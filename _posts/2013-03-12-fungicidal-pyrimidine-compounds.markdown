defined herein.","According to a further embodiment, the present invention relates to compounds of the formula I wherein:\n\n","The compounds I and the compositions according to the invention, respectively, are suitable as fungicides. They are distinguished by an outstanding effectiveness against a broad spectrum of phytopathogenic fungi, including soil-borne fungi, which derive especially from the classes of the Plasmodiophoromycetes, Peronosporomycetes (syn. Oomycetes), Chytridiomycetes, Zygomycetes, Ascomycetes, Basidiomycetes and Deuteromycetes (syn. Fungi imperfecti). Some are systemically effective and they can be used in crop protection as foliar fungicides, fungicides for seed dressing and soil fungicides. Moreover, they are suitable for controlling harmful fungi, which inter alia occur in wood or roots of plants.","The compounds I and the compositions according to the invention are particularly important in the control of a multitude of phytopathogenic fungi on various cultivated plants, such as cereals, e.g. wheat, rye, barley, triticale, oats or rice; beet, e.g. sugar beet or fodder beet; fruits, such as pomes, stone fruits or soft fruits, e.g. apples, pears, plums, peaches, almonds, cherries, strawberries, raspberries, blackberries or gooseberries; leguminous plants, such as lentils, peas, alfalfa or soybeans; oil plants, such as rape, mustard, olives, sunflowers, coconut, cocoa beans, castor oil plants, oil palms, ground nuts or soybeans; cucurbits, such as squashes, cucumber or melons; fiber plants, such as cotton, flax, hemp or jute; citrus fruit, such as oranges, lemons, grapefruits or mandarins; vegetables, such as spinach, lettuce, asparagus, cabbages, carrots, onions, tomatoes, potatoes, cucurbits or paprika; lauraceous plants, such as avocados, cinnamon or camphor; energy and raw material plants, such as corn, soybean, rape, sugar cane or oil palm; corn; tobacco; nuts; coffee; tea; bananas; vines (table grapes and grape juice grape vines); hop; turf; sweet leaf (also called Stevia); natural rubber plants or ornamental and forestry plants, such as flowers, shrubs, broad-leaved trees or evergreens, e.g. conifers; and on the plant propagation material, such as seeds, and the crop material of these plants. Preferably, compounds I and compositions thereof, respectively are used for controlling a multitude of fungi on field crops, such as potatoes sugar beets, tobacco, wheat, rye, barley, oats, rice, corn, cotton, soybeans, rape, legumes, sunflowers, coffee or sugar cane; fruits; vines; ornamentals; or vegetables, such as cucumbers, tomatoes, beans or squashes.","The term \u201cplant propagation material\u201d is to be understood to denote all the generative parts of the plant such as seeds and vegetative plant material such as cuttings and tubers (e.g. potatoes), which can be used for the multiplication of the plant. This includes seeds, roots, fruits, tubers, bulbs, rhizomes, shoots, sprouts and other parts of plants, including seedlings and young plants, which are to be transplanted after germination or after emergence from soil. These young plants may also be protected before transplantation by a total or partial treatment by immersion or pouring.","Preferably, treatment of plant propagation materials with compounds I and compositions thereof, respectively, is used for controlling a multitude of fungi on cereals, such as wheat, rye, barley and oats; rice, corn, cotton and soybeans.","The term \u201ccultivated plants\u201d is to be understood as including plants which have been modified by breeding, mutagenesis or genetic engineering including but not limiting to agricultural biotech products on the market or in development (cf. http:\/\/cera-gmc.org\/, see GM crop database therein). Genetically modified plants are plants, which genetic material has been so modified by the use of recombinant DNA techniques that under natural circumstances cannot readily be obtained by cross breeding, mutations or natural recombination. Typically, one or more genes have been integrated into the genetic material of a genetically modified plant in order to improve certain properties of the plant. Such genetic modifications also include but are not limited to targeted post-translational modification of protein(s), oligo- or polypeptides e.g. by glycosylation or polymer additions such as prenylated, acetylated or farnesylated moieties or PEG moieties. Plants that have been modified by breeding, mutagenesis or genetic engineering, e.g. have been rendered tolerant to applications of specific classes of herbicides, such as auxin herbicides such as dicamba or 2,4-D; bleacher herbicides such as hydroxylphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD) inhibitors or phytoene desaturase (PDS) inhibitors; acetolactate synthase (ALS) inhibitors such as sulfonyl ureas or imidazolinones; enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS) inhibitors, such as glyphosate; glutamine synthetase (GS) inhibitors such as glufosinate; protoporphyrinogen-IX oxidase inhibitors; lipid biosynthesis inhibitors such as acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACCase) inhibitors; or oxynil (i. e. bromoxynil or ioxynil) herbicides as a result of conventional methods of breeding or genetic engineering. Furthermore, plants have been made resistant to multiple classes of herbicides through multiple genetic modifications, such as resistance to both glyphosate and glufosinate or to both glyphosate and a herbicide from another class such as ALS inhibitors, HPPD inhibitors, auxin herbicides, or ACCase inhibitors. These herbicide resistance technologies are e.g. described in Pest Managem. Sci. 61, 2005, 246; 61, 2005, 258; 61, 2005, 277; 61, 2005, 269; 61, 2005, 286; 64, 2008, 326; 64, 2008, 332; Weed Sci. 57, 2009, 108; Austral. J. Agricult. Res. 58, 2007, 708; Science 316, 2007, 1185; and references quoted therein. Several cultivated plants have been rendered tolerant to herbicides by conventional methods of breeding (mutagenesis), e.g. Clearfield\u00ae summer rape (Canola, BASF SE, Germany) being tolerant to imidazolinones, e.g. imazamox, or ExpressSun\u00ae sunflowers (DuPont, USA) being tolerant to sulfonyl ureas, e.g. tribenuron. Genetic engineering methods have been used to render cultivated plants such as soybean, cotton, corn, beets and rape, tolerant to herbicides such as glyphosate and glufosinate, some of which are commercially available under the trade names RoundupReady\u00ae (glyphosate-tolerant, Monsanto, U.S.A.), Cultivance\u00ae (imidazolinone tolerant, BASF SE, Germany) and LibertyLink\u00ae (glufosinate-tolerant, Bayer CropScience, Germany).","Furthermore, plants are also covered that are by the use of recombinant DNA techniques capable to synthesize one or more insecticidal proteins, especially those known from the bacterial genus , particularly from , such as \u03b4-endotoxins, e.g. CryIA(b), CryIA(c), CryIF, CryIF(a2), CryIIA(b), CryIIIA, CryIIIB(b1) or Cry9c; vegetative insecticidal proteins (VIP), e.g. VIP1, VIP2, VIP3 or VIP3A; insecticidal proteins of bacteria colonizing nematodes, e.g. spp. or spp.; toxins produced by animals, such as scorpion toxins, arachnid toxins, wasp toxins, or other insect-specific neurotoxins; toxins produced by fungi, such Streptomycetes toxins, plant lectins, such as pea or barley lectins; agglutinins; proteinase inhibitors, such as trypsin inhibitors, serine protease inhibitors, patatin, cystatin or papain inhibitors; ribosome-inactivating proteins (RIP), such as ricin, maize-RIP, abrin, luffin, saporin or bryodin; steroid metabolism enzymes, such as 3-hydroxysteroid oxidase, ecdysteroid-IDP-glycosyl-transferase, cholesterol oxidases, ecdysone inhibitors or HMG-CoA-reductase; ion channel blockers, such as blockers of sodium or calcium channels; juvenile hormone esterase; diuretic hormone receptors (helicokinin receptors); stilben synthase, bibenzyl synthase, chitinases or glucanases. In the context of the present invention these insecticidal proteins or toxins are to be understood expressly also as pre-toxins, hybrid proteins, truncated or otherwise modified proteins. Hybrid proteins are characterized by a new combination of protein domains, (see, e.g. WO 02\/015701). Further examples of such toxins or genetically modified plants capable of synthesizing such toxins are disclosed, e.g., in EP-A 374 753, WO 93\/007278, WO 95\/34656, EP-A 427 529, EP-A 451 878, WO 03\/18810 und WO 03\/52073. The methods for producing such genetically modified plants are generally known to the person skilled in the art and are described, e.g. in the publications mentioned above. These insecticidal proteins contained in the genetically modified plants impart to the plants producing these proteins tolerance to harmful pests from all taxonomic groups of athropods, especially to beetles (Coeloptera), two-winged insects (Diptera), and moths (Lepidoptera) and to nematodes (Nematoda). Genetically modified plants capable to synthesize one or more insecticidal proteins are, e.g., described in the publications mentioned above, and some of which are commercially available such as YieldGard\u00ae (corn cultivars producing the Cry1Ab toxin), YieldGard\u00ae Plus (corn cultivars producing Cry1Ab and Cry3Bb1 toxins), Starlink\u00ae (corn cultivars producing the Cry9c toxin), Herculex\u00ae RW (corn cultivars producing Cry34Ab1, Cry35Ab1 and the enzyme Phosphinothricin-N-Acetyltransferase [PAT]); NuCOTN\u00ae 33B (cotton cultivars producing the Cry1Ac toxin), Bollgard\u00ae I (cotton cultivars producing the Cry1Ac toxin), Bollgard\u00ae II (cotton cultivars producing Cry1Ac and Cry2Ab2 toxins); VIPCOT\u00ae (cotton cultivars producing a VIP-toxin); NewLeaf\u00ae (potato cultivars producing the Cry3A toxin); Bt-Xtra\u00ae, NatureGard\u00ae, KnockOut\u00ae, BiteGard\u00ae, Protecta\u00ae, Bt11 (e.g. Agrisure\u00ae CB) and Bt176 from Syngenta Seeds SAS, France, (corn cultivars producing the Cry1Ab toxin and PAT enzyme), MIR604 from Syngenta Seeds SAS, France (corn cultivars producing a modified version of the Cry3A toxin, c.f. WO 03\/018810), MON 863 from Monsanto Europe S.A., Belgium (corn cultivars producing the Cry3Bb1 toxin), IPC 531 from Monsanto Europe S.A., Belgium (cotton cultivars producing a modified version of the Cry1Ac toxin) and 1507 from Pioneer Overseas Corporation, Belgium (corn cultivars producing the Cry1F toxin and PAT enzyme). Furthermore, plants are also covered that are by the use of recombinant DNA techniques capable to synthesize one or more proteins to increase the resistance or tolerance of those plants to bacterial, viral or fungal pathogens.

The compounds produced in this manner are listed in Table I below including corresponding physical data. 4-Chloro-6-ethyl-5-pyrimidinecarboxylic acid ethyl ester was synthesized according to a procedure given in U.S. Pat. No. 5,439,911 A. 4-Chloro-6-methyl-5-pyrimidinecarboxylic acid methyl ester was prepared as described in EP 606011 A1.","To a solution of 4-iodophenol (200 g, 910 mmol) in N,N-dimethylformamide (1 L) was slowly added sodium hydride (47 g, 1.2 mol). The reaction was stirred for 30 min at room temperature, then 2-chloro-4-trifluoromethylpyridine (165 g, 910 mmol) was added and the solution was stirred at 110\u00b0 C. for 4 h and 12 h at room temperature. The reaction solution was poured into water and extracted with methyl tert-butylether (3\u00d7). The combined organic layers were washed successively with water, lithium chloride solution and 10% sodium hydroxide solution. The combined organic phases were then dried over sodium sulfate and the solvent was removed in vacuo to afford 91% (303 g, 830 mmol) yield of 2-(4-iodophenoxy)-4-(trifluoromethyl)pyridine.","To a solution of 2-(4-iodophenoxy)-4-(trifluoromethyl)pyridine (102 g, 279 mmol) in tetrahydrofuran (500 mL) was added triethylamine (84 g, 838 mmol), copper(I) iodide (0.53 g, 3 mmol) and Pd(PPh)Cl(2 g, 3 mmol), followed by pent-4-yn-2-ol (28 g, 335 mmol). The reaction was stirred at room temperature for 1 h and was then filtered over celite, followed by rinsing with methyl tert-butylether. Water and methyl tert-butylether were then added to the filtrate. The organic layer was separated and concentrated in vacuo to provide 93 g of crude 5-[4-[[4-(trifluoromethyl)-2-pyridyl]oxy]phenyl]pent-4-yn-2-ol. This material was redissolved in dichloromethane (1 L) and triethylamine (58 g, 576 mmol). The reaction solution was cooled to 5\u00b0 C. and methyanesulfonyl chloride (42 g, 288 mmol) was added. The solution was allowed to warm to room temperature overnight. The reaction solution was poured into water and extracted with dichloromethane. The combined organic layers were dried over sodium sulfate and the solvent was then removed in vacuo to afford 121 g of the crude mesylate. The crude product was redissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide (600 mL) to which sodium azide was added (94 g, 1.4 mol). The reaction solution was heated to 80\u00b0 C. for 2 h then cooled to room temperature. Water and methyl tert-butylether were added, the organic layers were combined and concentrated in vacuo to provide 91 g of the crude azide product. The azide was dissolved in methanol (700 mL) to which was added tin(II) chloride-HO (118 g, 523 mmol). The reaction was stirred at room temperature overnight and was then concentrated. To the residue was added 10% sodium hydroxide solution and the crude product was extracted with dichloromethane before it was dried over sodium sulfate and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was filtered over a silica gel plug to provide 96% of the desired product.","To a solution of 5-[4-[[4-(trifluoromethyl)-2-pyridyl]oxy]phenyl]pent-4-yn-2-amine (268 mg, 0.84 mmol) in N,N-dimethylformamide (5 mL) was added diisopropylethylamine (216 mg, 1.7 mmol). The solution was stirred for 5 min at room temperature at which time 4,6-dichloro-5-methoxypyrimidine (150 mg, 0.84 mmol) was added. The reaction mixture was stirred at 80\u00b0 C. overnight, then allowed to cool to room temperature. It was concentrated in vacuo and filtered over a plug of silica gel to provide 215 mg (0.47 mmol, 55%) of the brown oily product.","The compounds listed in Table I have been prepared in an analogous
