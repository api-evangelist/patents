No. 61\/031,771 filed Feb. 27, 2008, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by this reference.","Subject matter described herein was made with government support under Grant Number CTS-0122504 awarded by National Science Foundation. The government has certain rights in the described subject matter.","The presently-disclosed subject matter relates to particle feeders and systems including particle feeders. In particular, the presently-disclosed subject matter relates to particle feeders for feeding small particles at uniform feed rates.","For manufacturing, research, and other application, it can be desirable to feed particles at uniform feed rates over a period of time. However, available particle feeders are unable to maintain desired uniform feed rates, particularly for small particles, at low feed rates, for longer periods of time. Accordingly, there remains a need in the art for an improved particle feeder.","The presently-disclosed subject matter meets some or all of the above-identified needs, as will become evident to those of ordinary skill in the art after a study of information provided in this document.","This Summary describes several embodiments of the presently-disclosed subject matter, and in many cases lists variations and permutations of these embodiments. This Summary is merely exemplary of the numerous and varied embodiments. Mention of one or more representative features of a given embodiment is likewise exemplary. Such an embodiment can typically exist with or without the feature(s) mentioned; likewise, those features can be applied to other embodiments of the presently-disclosed subject matter, whether listed in this Summary or not. To avoid excessive repetition, this Summary does not list or suggest all possible combinations of such features.","The presently-disclosed subject matter includes a particle feeder for feeding particles at a desired uniform feed rate. The particles can be for example, coal particles or biomass particles. The particle feeder includes a primary reservoir and a valve. The primary reservoir encloses an internal volume for holding particles and defining a hole through a bottom surface thereof. The valve includes a rod enclosed within and extending through the volume defined by the primary reservoir. The rod is movable between an open position, wherein particles can flow through the hole, and a closed position, wherein the rod blocks the hole. The actuator controls movement of the rod between the open position and the closed position.","In some embodiments, the feeder also includes a timer for controlling the actuator. In some embodiments, the actuator is a solenoid actuator. In some embodiments, a second solenoid actuator is provided for moving the rod into the closed position.","In some embodiments, the primary reservoir includes a removable cap for providing access to the internal volume of the primary reservoir. The cap can be positioned at different heights above the hole to adjust a traveling distance of the rod when the rod is moved between the open position and the closed position. In some embodiments, the cap is constructed from a nonmagnetic material. In some embodiments, the primary reservoir includes a substantially conical floor, with an internal lateral surface directed downward towards an apex, said hole being defined at the apex.","In some embodiments, the rod includes a substantially conical tip for nesting within the apex of the floor, thereby sealing the hole in the closed position. In some embodiments, the rod can be adjusted to different lengths to change a traveling distance of the rod when said rod is moved between the open position and the closed position. In some embodiments, the rod comprises a magnetic material.","In some embodiments, the particle feeder also includes a secondary reservoir having an internal volume, and a conduit for connecting the internal volume of the secondary reservoir with the internal volume of primary reservoir, such that particles can flow from the secondary reservoir into the primary reservoir.","The presently-disclosed subject matter includes a system having a particle feeder for feeding particles at a desired uniform feed rate into a reactor. The system includes the particle feeder and the reactor. The particle feeder can be an embodiment of the particle feeder as described above. The reactor has an internal area placed in fluid communication with the internal volume of the primary reservoir, such that particles flowing through the hole can enter the internal area of the reactor.","In some embodiments, the system also includes a series of lines and valves for exposing the system to a gas or a vacuum. The series of lines can include a first line in fluid communication with the internal volume of the primary reservoir, for exposing the internal volume of the primary reservoir to a gas or a vacuum; a second line in fluid communication with the internal area of the reactor for exposing the internal area of the reactor to the gas or the vacuum; and an equilibrium line placed in fluid communication with the first and second lines. The series of valves are provided for controlling exposure of the internal volume of the primary reservoir and the internal area of the reactor to the gas or the vacuum.","In some embodiments, the system also includes an analytical instrument operably connected to the reactor.","The presently-disclosed subject matter includes a particle feeder for feeding particles at a desired uniform feed rate. The particle feeder includes a reservoir and a valve. The reservoir encloses an internal volume for holding particles, and defines a hole through a bottom surface thereof. The valve includes a rod and an actuator, which controls movement of the rod. The rod is enclosed within and extends through the volume defined by the reservoir. When the valve is moved into an open position, particles can flow through the hole defined by the reservoir. When the valve is moved into a closed position, the hole is blocked, keeping particles from escaping the reservoir.","With reference to , A, and B, in some embodiments, the reservoir  of the particle feeder  includes a wall , a cap , and a floor , defining the internal volume  for holding particles for feeding. The floor  of the reservoir  defines a hole  though which particles can exit the reservoir . As will be understood by those skilled in the art, the hole  should be sized to allow a particle or particles to flow therethrough, as desired, which size will vary depending on the application in which the particle feeder  is being used, the size and nature of the particles, etc.","As will be understood by those skilled in the art, the reservoir  can be any shape that allows particles to flow freely, under force of gravity, through the internal volume . In some embodiments, the reservoir  is substantially cylindrical, with a circumferential wall . It can be desirable for the reservoir  to be designed to facilitate the flow of particles toward the hole . In this regard, in some embodiments, the floor  is shaped like an inverted cone, where the hole  is defined in an apex of the cone such that particles can flow down an internal lateral surface of the cone, towards the apex, and through the hole . As will be understood by those skilled in the art upon studying this application, the desirable particle volume and\/or mass capacity of the reservoir  will vary depending on the application in which the particle feeder  is being used, the size and nature of the particles, etc. The reservoir  can be constructed from any material of sufficient strength and durability for operation of the particle feeder. In embodiments that include a solenoid actuator, as mentioned below, it can be desirable to use a nonmagnetic material (e.g., a material that does not contain iron), such a stainless steel, brass, or acrylic. In some embodiments, the reservoir  has an integral construction. In some embodiments, the reservoir  has discrete structural elements that are secured to one another. For example, the wall , cap , and floor  could be provided as discrete structural elements that are secured to one another to form the reservoir  and enclose the internal volume . In such embodiments, the wall , cap , and floor  could be constructed from different materials, for example, the wall  could be stainless steel, while the cap  and the floor  could be brass.","With continued reference to , A, and B, in some embodiments, the valve  of the particle feeder  includes a rod , and an actuator  for controlling movement of the rod . The rod  is moveable within the space  of the reservoir  between a closed position and an open position. With reference to , when the rod  is in the closed position, it blocks the hole  to keep particles from escaping the reservoir . With reference to , when the rod  is in the open position, it is lifted away from the hole  and particles are allowed to flow through the hole .","As will be understood by those skilled in the art, the rod  can be any shape, so long as it does not interfere with the flow of particles from the reservoir , and it is capable of movement within the internal volume , i.e., it should not abut the wall  of the reservoir  in a manner that unduly restricts its movement or unduly limits the internal volume  of the reservoir . As will also be understood by those skilled in the art, the length of the rod , relative to its diameter, can be important for maintaining a desired structural stability of the rod . As is noted below, in some embodiments, the length of the rod  can affect feed rate, in so far as it can alter the traveling distance of the rod  from the hole , and therefore can alter the time period that hole  is accessible to particle flow.","The actuator  can be of any type that is capable of controlling movement of the rod , and communicating with the timer , for example, an electric actuator, a pneumatic actuator, or a hydraulic actuator can be used. In some embodiments, a solenoid actuator is used; for example, Model SS251 12 V starter solenoid available from Standard Motor Products, Inc. (Long Island City, N.Y.) can be used. In some embodiments, an actuator  is employed to lift the rod  into the open position, before releasing the rod  and allowing it to fall by force of gravity into the closed position. In some embodiments, an actuator  is also used to pull the rod  down into the closed position. For example, in some embodiments, two solenoid actuators can be used, a first to lift the rod into the open position, and a second to pull the rod into the closed position.","The rod  can be constructed from any material that is of sufficient strength and durability for operation of the particle feeder. In embodiments of the particle feeder , which makes use of a solenoid actuator , the rod  includes material capable of interacting with and being lifted by the magnetic field generated by the solenoid actuator , such as a magnetic material, e.g., magnetic metal. In some embodiments, the rod  is constructed from a metal containing iron, nickel, and\/or cobalt. In some embodiments, the rod  is constructed from steel. In some embodiments, the rod  includes a segment constructed from a metal containing iron, nickel, and\/or cobalt. In some embodiments, the rod  includes a segment constructed from steel.","It is noted that, when magnetic metals are exposed to a magnetic field for periods of time, they can become permanently magnetized. In this regard, as will be understood by those skilled in the art upon studying this application, when a solenoid actuator is used, consideration should be given to the materials selected for certain components of the particle feeder, to avoid undesired results of components of the particle feeder becoming permanently magnetized. For example, in some embodiments, the cap  of the reservoir  is situated between the rod  and the solenoid actuator  of the valve . If the cap  of the reservoir  becomes permanently magnetized, the rod  can stick in the open position, hindering operation of the particle feeder . This undesirable result can be avoided by constructing the cap  from a non-magnetic material, such as brass or stainless steel. For another example, this undesirable result can be avoided by including a buffering structure at the top of the rod, constructed from a non-magnetic metal, to keep the rod from sticking in the open position. For example, the top of the rod can be threaded to accept a stainless steel nut, serving as the buffering structure.","In some embodiments, it can be desirable to apply a coating, such as a plastic coating, on the base of the rod before running the particle feeder to facilitate sealing of the hole when the rod is in the closed position. When such a coating is used, it should be applied uniformly, and should be reapplied as needed. A spray-on plastic coating can be used, such as, Liquid Plastic, which is widely available commercially, for example, from Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Use of the Liquid Plastic brand plastic coating is most convenient when it is desired to run the particle feeder for time periods approximately less than 1 or 2 hours, because the plastic coating may need to be reapplied periodically.","The rod  can further comprises a tip , shaped to provide a seal with the floor  of the reservoir  defining the hole , to keep particles from escaping from the reservoir  when the rod  is in the closed position. For example, in embodiments where the floor  is conical, the tip  can likewise be conical, such that it can nest within the apex of the conical floor , snuggly sealing the hole . The tip  can be integral with the rod , or can be a distinct structure that is connected to the base of the rod .","The tip  of the rod  can be constructed from any material, which is of sufficient strength and durability for operation of the particle feeder, and which has properties for achieving a surface capable of nesting within the apex of the conical floor  to seal the hole, e.g., a smooth surface can be desirable. In some embodiments, the tip  can be constructed from brass, aluminum, or stainless steel. In some embodiments, it can be desirable for the tip  to be constructed from a material capable of interacting with a magnetic field generated by a solenoid actuator, such as a magnetic metal. In this regard, in some embodiments, the tip  can be constructed from a metal containing iron, nickel, and\/or cobalt. However, in embodiments, such as embodiments that make use of a second solenoid actuator for pulling the rod into the closed position, if the tip  becomes permanently magnetized, the rod  can stick in the closed position, hindering operation of the particle feeder . In this regard, in some embodiments, it can be desirable for the tip  to be constructed from a non-magnetic material.","In some embodiments, when the particle feeder  is being run for longer periods of time, it can be desirable to include a wire  wrapped around the base of the rod , or similar structural projection extending from the base of the rod . Such a structure can serve to disturb the particles contained in the reservoir  when the rod  moves, reducing caking of the particles in the reservoir .","As noted above, the rod  is moveable between the open position and the closed position. The rod  movement is substantially longitudinal within the volume  of the reservoir . The rod  can be held in a substantially vertical position for such longitudinal movement in a number of manners. In some embodiments, the internal volume of the reservoir and the diameter of the rod are such that the rod is held substantially vertically by the reservoir itself. In some embodiments, the rod can have a first diameter, and can include a segment having a second, larger diameter. When positioned within the reservoir, the segment of the rod separates the rod from the internal wall of the reservoir, holding it substantially vertically within the internal volume of the reservoir. The segment can be integral with the rod, or it can be a discrete structure that is attached to the rod. In some embodiments, the rod can be threaded, and the segment can be screwed onto the rod, e.g., a nut can be used. In some embodiments, a guide is employed to hold the rod in a substantially vertical position for longitudinal movement. The guide can have a substantially planar structure, affixed to the internal walls of the reservoir, or to the cap of the reservoir, and defining an aperture in which the rod can move longitudinally.","With reference to , an exemplary application the feeder  will now be described. The particle feeder  can be used to deliver particles to an internal area of a reactor . When the feeder  is used as part of a system  including a reactor , the internal volume  of the reservoir  is placed in fluid communication with the internal area of the reactor . That is to say that particles can flow from the reservoir  into the reactor  when the rod  is in the open position. In some embodiments, it can be desirable to have a sealed system, wherein there is fluid communication between the internal area of the reactor  and the internal volume  of the reservoir , but not with the environment outside of the system .","In some embodiments, it can also be desirable to control the content and pressure of the atmosphere of the system . In this regard, the system  can further include a series of lines and valves for delivering and removing gas to the system . With reference to , in some embodiments a first line  is placed in fluid communication with the internal volume  of the reservoir , a second line  is placed in fluid communication with the internal area of the reactor , and an equilibrium line  is placed in fluid communication with the first line  and the second line . A gas inlet  and a vacuum  are placed along the series of lines , ,  for purging and evacuating the system . As will be understood by those skilled in the art, valves are placed along the series of line , ,  so that gas and vacuum flow to the internal volume  of the reservoir , the internal area of the reactor , or both can be controlled. In this manner, inert or reactive gas can be delivered to the system , as desired. Similarly, pressure within the internal volume  of the reservoir  and the internal area of the reactor  can be controlled as desired.","For many applications, it can be desirable to maintain substantially the same pressure within the internal volume  of the reservoir  and the internal area of the reactor , which can be accomplished by opening the equilibrium line  to fluid communication with the first line  and second line , as will be understood by those skilled in the art. For other applications, it can be desirable to maintain a pressure differential at the hole  through which particles exit the reservoir , which can be accomplished by closing the equilibrium line  to fluid communication with the first line  and second line , and adjusting the relative pressures as desired, as will be understood by those skilled in the art. It can be desirable to maintain a pressure differential, for example, to control feed rate, or to facilitate feeding of particular types of particles. When the pressure within the internal area of the reactor  is greater, it can slow the feed rate. Conversely, when the pressure within the internal volume  of the reservoir  is greater, it can urge particles through the hole  towards the reactor . The ability to urge particles through the hole  using a pressure differential can be particularly useful when the particles are provided in a liquid slurry.","With reference to , it can be desirable to strategically place the second line  a distance below the hole  to minimize disruption of particle flow by movement of gas. As will be understood by those skilled in the art, the ideal distance will depend on the application, internal pressure(s), particle type, particle size, etc. In some embodiments, where fine coal particles of about 70-100 \u03bcm are being fed, it can be desirable to place the second line at least about 2-3 inches below the hole. To further protect the particle flow from disruption by movement of gas, a transport tube  can be employed. The transport tube  is placed in fluid communication with the internal volume  of the reservoir , such that particles can fall through the hole , through the transport tube , past the second line , and into the reactor . In this manner, as the particles flow past the second line the second line , they are protected from the movement of gas by the transport tube .","The transport tube can serve other purposes as well. For example, it was unexpectedly found that a transport tube of sufficient length, between and connecting the internal volume  of the reservoir  and the internal area of the reactor , results in more homogeneously sized particles being delivered to the reactor . The ideal length will depend on the application, internal pressure(s), particle type, particle size, etc. In some embodiments, where fine coal particles of about 70-100 \u03bcm are being fed, it can be desirable for the transport tube to be at least about 1-2 feet in length.","For another example, the transport tube can be used to provide a custom fit between the feeder and a reactor, or other piece equipment or device with which the feeder is being used. For example, suppose that the feeder is being used to feed particles into a reactor having a particularly-sized opening, e.g., 1\/16 inch diameter, that differs from the size of the hole defined by the reservoir, e.g., \u215b inch diameter. In such an example, the transport tube can be provided in segments of different sizes, e.g., a first segment of \u215b inch diameter, a second segment of \u00bc inch diameter, and a third segment of 1\/16 inch diameter, such that a first segment is capable of mating with the hole defined by the reservoir, and another segment is capable of mating with the opening of the reactor.","With reference to , it is noted that a system  including a feeder  can further include an analytical instrument . Examples of analytical instruments that can be included are: a gas chromatographer\/mass spectrometer (GC\/MS), and a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR).","Referring again to , A, and, B, the particle feeder  can be operated in the following exemplary manner. Particles of interest, of a desired type and size are selected. Particle types will depend on the application, but examples include, coal, biomass, powders, pharmaceutical compositions, and the like. Generally, dried particles can be fed with greater ease; however, liquids containing particles, including suspensions, and slurries can also be used. When liquids containing particles are being used, it is believed that providing the liquids in low concentrations with small particle sizes will achieve the best results. As noted herein, when slurries are being used, it can be beneficial to create a pressure differential to urge the slurry particles through the hole  defined by the reservoir . It is often desirable to feed particles that are substantially homogeneous in size, or within a particular size range. In this regard, before placing particles in the reservoir  for feeding, they can be fed through a sieve, or otherwise size selected. Particles can be as small as about 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, or 100 \u03bcm. Particles can be of a size capable of passing through a commercially-available sieve of 35, 74, 88, 104, 124, 147, 175, 208, 246, 295, 351, 417, 495, 589, 701, 833, or 991 \u03bcm. Particles can be up to about 1 mm, or larger, as desired.","The cap  is removed to expose the internal volume  of the reservoir , the rod  is positioned substantially vertically in the reservoir , such that the tip  blocks the hole  and the rod  can freely move substantially longitudinally. A weighted sample of the particles of interest is poured into the reservoir . As noted herein, the capacity of the reservoir  and the weight and\/or volume of particles housed in the reservoir  for deliver can vary depending on the application, particle size, type of particle, etc.; however, in some embodiments, when coal particles of about 70-100 \u03bcm are being used, the reservoir  can have a volume of about 200 cmand about 150 gm of particles can be poured into the reservoir  for feeding.","As noted below, the traveling distance of the rod  can affect flow rate, i.e., the shorter the traveling distance, the lower the feed rate. In embodiments where a nut is provided at the top of the rod for adjusting the traveling distance of the rod, the nut can be rotated to adjust the traveling distance, as desired. In embodiments where the reservoir cap  is threaded to be secured at different heights relative to the hole , for adjusting the traveling distance of the rod , the cap  can be secured at a desired height. In any event, the cap  is replaced, enclosing the rod  and the particles of interest within the interior volume  of the reservoir .","The rod  is placed in communication with the actuator , so that the actuator  can control the movement of the rod . The actuator  is placed in communication with a timer , for controlling the actuator , thereby controlling the frequency that the rod  is placed in the open position. A power supply  is provided for the actuator  and the timer . In embodiments of the feeder  making use of a solenoid actuator , the solenoid actuator  is placed above the reservoir cap .","The internal volume  of the reservoir  is placed in fluid communication with a desired device or piece of equipment (e.g., reactor, analytical equipment, capsule for housing a pharmaceutical composition, etc.). In some embodiments, an external surface of the reservoir  is threaded to facilitate ease of attachment of a mating portion of the desired device or piece of equipment, thereby sealing the internal volume and area of the system. In some embodiments, a transport tube  is placed in fluid communication with the internal volume  of the reservoir  before the system is sealed.","The particle feeder  is designed such that all components that move while the feeder  is running, i.e., the rod  of the valve , are enclosed within the internal volume  of the reservoir . The lack of external moving components of the particle feeder  limits undesirable air leakage, from the system, which air leakage can result in disruption in uniformity of the feed rate. Additionally, this design allows feeding of particles into a gas of any desired composition, without air interference. Such air interference can induce undesired oxidation of the particles and impair data integrity when the particle feeder is being used as part of a system including, for example, a reactor and analysis equipment.","It can sometimes be desirable to run the particle feeder for relatively long periods of time, e.g., 10 hours. With reference to , in some embodiments, the particle feeder  can include a secondary reservoir , and a conduit  for delivering particles from the secondary reservoir  to the primary reservoir . The secondary reservoir  provides additional volume for housing particles, and can also be conveniently refilled while the feeder  is operating.","In addition to allowing for a long-term supply of particles, the secondary reservoir  can confer other benefits, including facilitating stability of particle size and uniformity of feed rate. For example, for some applications, it can be desirable to limit particle residence time in the primary reservoir . A volume of particles in the primary reservoir  can settle for form a bed. Variation in the density of this particle bed can result in disruption in uniformity of the feed rate. As noted above, a wire wrapped around the base of the rod can provide disturbance of particles adjacent the rod to achieve an acceptable density of the particle bed for some applications; however, in embodiments making use of a secondary reservoir , variation in the density of the particle bed can be controlled by limiting the particle residence time in the primary reservoir . Use of the secondary reservoir  also allows variation in the uniformity of the particle bed in the radial direction to be avoided.","Limiting the particle residence time in the primary reservoir  can also serve to limit particle attrition, or the unintended breakage of particles. Particle attrition results in not only smaller particle size and non-uniform size distribution, but can also result in a particle bed with an increased density, creating an obstacle for precise movement of the rod of the valve. While a uniform size of smaller volumes of particles can be more readily maintained, when larger volumes are used, particles tend to agglomerate, disturbing the uniformity of the feed rate.","The secondary reservoir  can be constructed from any material that is capable of being pressurized, for example, a metal, such as brass, or a polymeric material, such as PVC. In some embodiments, the secondary reservoir  is constructed from PVC. The conduit  can be constructed from any material such as metals or polymeric materials, e.g., stainless steel, brass, PVC, acrylic. In some embodiments, the conduit  is constructed from acrylic.","As will be understood by those skilled in the art upon studying this application, the desirable particle volume and\/or mass capacity of the reservoirs will vary depending on the application of the particle feeder, the size and nature of the particles, etc.","As will be understood by those skilled in the art, the secondary reservoir  and the conduit  can be any shape that allows particles to flow freely, under force of gravity, from the secondary reservoir , through the conduit , and into the internal volume  of the reservoir . In some embodiments, it can be desirable have specific control over the flow of particles from the secondary reservoir  into the primary reservoir . For example, it may be useful to limit particle residence time in the primary reservoir  by controlling the flow of particles from the secondary reservoir  into the primary reservoir . For another example, it may be desirable to feed a single particle, or a small number of particles using the feeder , which could be facilitated by delivering only a single or a small number of particles from the secondary reservoir  into the primary reservoir  during a particular cycle of the feeder valve. This can be accomplished, for example, by providing a valve for controlling flow of particles from the secondary reservoir , which is the same or similar to the valve  described above with reference to the primary reservoir .","When the particle feeder of the present application is operated, it can be described as running through a plurality of cycles, wherein each cycle includes the rod being lifted into the open position, a particle or particles falling through the hole, and the rod returning to the closed position. The flow rate achieved by the feeder can be defined in terms of the weight of particles fed per period of time (e.g., grams\/minute), the number of particles fed per period of time (e.g., particles per minute), or the volume of particles fed per period of time (e.g., mL per minute). The flow of particles can also be described in terms of particles, weight, or volume fed per cycle.","Flow rate of the feeder can be calibrated in a number of manners, including the following. The timer can be used to control the frequency with which the actuator lifts the rod into the open position, allowing particles to flow through the hole. In some embodiments, the rod is returned to the closed position under force of gravity. As such, the traveling distance of the rod from the hole correlates to the time taken for the rod to return to the closed position after being released by the actuator, and therefore correlates to the time that particles are allowed to flow through the hole. The traveling distance of the rod can be controlled in a number of ways. For example, traveling distance of the rod can be physically restricted by the reservoir. As such, the rod itself can be provided in a particular length, relative to length of the reservoir to provide for a particular traveling distance. The traveling distance of the rod can be physically restricted by other more readily adjustable means. For example, the cap of the reservoir can be designed to be secured to enclose the internal volume at different heights relative to the hole, e.g., the cap can be threaded to be secured at different heights relative to the hole, for adjusting the traveling distance of the rod. For another example, the rod can be threaded for securing a nut at the top of the rod. The nut can be moved upward or downward to adjust the overall length of the rod, and therefore the traveling distance of the rod.","In some embodiments, an actuator, under the control of a timer, can also be provided to pull the rod down into the closed position. In such embodiments, the flow rate can be calibrated by timed and coordinated actuation of the rod upward into an open position, and downward into a closed position. It is further contemplated that the flow rate could be controlled by generated a desired pressure differential at the hole defined by the reservoir, or by adjusting the size of the hole itself.","The particle feeder of the present application can be used to deliver particles at a desired uniform flow rate. Such desired uniform flow rate can include a low uniform flow rate. The particle feeder can further be used to deliver fine particles at a low uniform flow rate. As used herein, the term \u201cuniform flow rate\u201d refers to a flow rate that is within \u00b13% in some embodiments, within \u00b15% in some embodiments, within \u00b18% in some embodiments, and within \u00b110% in some embodiments. As used herein, the term \u201clow flow rate\u201d refers to a flow rate that is about 45-100 \u03bcm to about 4-5 mg per minute. Such a flow rate can be equivalent to feeding about 10 or fewer particles per cycle, depending on the size of the particle, e.g., it is contemplated that a single particle of about 1 mm could be fed in a single cycle. In this regard, it is contemplated that the particle feeder could be used for single particle injection applications. As used herein the term \u201clow uniform flow rate\u201d refers to a low flow rate that [use same language used to define \u201cuniform flow rate\u201d]. As used herein, the term \u201cfine particles\u201d refers to particles at least about as small as 100, 95, 90, 85, 80, 75, 70, 65, 60, 55, 50, 45, 40, or 35 \u03bcm In some embodiments, the term \u201cfine particles\u201d refers to particles of a size capable of passing through a commercially-available sieve of 35, 74, 88, 104, 124, 147, 175, 208, 246, 295, 351, 417, 495, 589, 701, 833, or 991 \u03bcm.","As will be apparent to those skilled in the art upon studying the present application, the particle feeder described herein can have utility in a variety of manufacturing and research applications. For example, it can be used for to deliver particles to a reactor and\/or to analytical equipment for research applications, it can be provided in a scale for use in coal gasification processes, or it can be used to deliver metered amounts of pharmaceutical compositions to capsules.","The details of one or more embodiments of the presently-disclosed subject matter are set forth in this document.

With reference to , the particle feeder  was placed in communication with a reactor . The reactor was a straight alumina tube, 99.8% of AlO, 1.91 cm I.D., 2.54 cm O.D., 864 mm in length, from McDanel Advanced Ceramic Technologies. The reactor  was vertically placed in a furnace . A Lindberg\/Blue M Model 54494-V furnace equipped with ten heating elements of 30.48 cm in length was used. The furnace temperature can be brought up to 1700\u00b0 C. by a programmable controller, Lindberg\/Blue M Model 59256-P-COM. The reactor  was placed in communication with a analytical instrument . A gas chromatograph\/mass spectrometer was selected as the analytical instrument for the study. Pyrolysis products were analyzed by an online Agilent Technologies 6890 gas chromatograph and 5973N mass spectrometer (GC\/MS). Data were recorded on an online computer. The transport time between the reactor and the GC\/MS is typically 20 s.","Before the pyrolysis or oxidation, 2 g of dried, pulverized Illinois No. 6 coal or lignite of 120-140 mesh was placed in the reservoir. It was purged by ultra high pure helium (He) three times. Particles were fed using two different modes: a batch mode (low frequency or manual control) and a continuous mode (high frequency). Pyrolysis was performed with the batch mode with 1 s opening time using Illinois No. 6 coal. Each feed was controlled manually. Particles were fed into the preheated reactor at 850\u00b0 C. with flowing He at 800 cc\/min. Oxidation was performed with two continuous injection modes: 9 s intervals with 0.1 s opening times and 0.4 s intervals with 0.02 s opening times. Particles were fed into the preheated reactor at 900\u00b0 C. with flowing gas mixture containing 1 or 2% Oin He at 800 cc\/min. The feeder was kept on at the continuous mode for 1 h (400 feeds\/injections) or 20 min (3000 feeds\/injections) for the tests with 9 and 0.4 s injection intervals, respectively.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0076","num":"0075"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},"When the feeder was initially placed in communication with the reactor for pyrolysis, gas was fed horizontally on one side of the tube adjacent to the needle hole.  shows CO and COyields during pyrolysis of batch feeding of coal particles at 850\u00b0 C. These five peaks show poor reproducibility. Indeed, the fluctuations are more than 25% and not acceptable. The swirl flow created by the gas stream effected the stability of the particles near the needle. In accordance with Bird et al.the entrance length can be estimated based on the following formula:\n\n=0.035\n\nwhere Lis the entrance length, D is the diameter, and Re is the Reynolds number of the fluid. Thus, the gas feed position was moved about 3 in. below the hole defined by the reservoir.\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0078","num":"0077"},"figref":"FIG. 7","sub":"2 "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0079","num":"0078"},"figref":"FIG. 8","sub":["2 ","2 ","2 "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0080","num":"0079"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 9"],"sub":["2 ","2 "]},"It is contemplated that the frequency of injection and stability of the feed rate can be further increased from that shown with the exemplary embodiment used for tests described in Example 1 using, for example, a more powerful solenoid to pull the rod to its opening position, and\/or a mechanism for pulling the rod down into the closed position, e.g., a second solenoid, or a spring around the rod (metal or plastic, as long as it has a magnet and seals the nozzle tightly) to urge the rod to the closed position.","Features capable of controlling the feed rate include, the timer, the vertical traveling distance of the rod in the reservoir, and the size of the hole defined by the reservoir. When the opening time period or the hole of valve decreases, the feed rate decreases. Particle size can also influence feed rate. It is observed that feeding rate increases when particles of more uniform size, i.e., between 120 and 140 meshes, are fed.","The diameter of the hole defined by the reservoir is useful in keeping the feeding rate steady, particularly when particles are smaller than 100 \u03bcm. Holes having a diameter of about 1\/16 inch have been tested favorably with particles smaller than about 100 \u03bcm. When the hole has a diameter of about \u215b in, a high feed rate results with particles that are smaller than 100 \u03bcm, and a feed rate below 1 gram\/hour is not achieved. If the diameter of the hole is too small, particles tend to block the hole. Feeding of small particles at a uniform rate can be facilitated by providing a smooth internal wall of the reservoir and\/or floor of the reservoir.","The range of feed rate can be extended as the diameter of the hole defined by the reservoir is increased or decreased within its operating range. When the size of the hole is selected, adjusting the vertical traveling distance of the rod inside the reservoir can achieve a wide range of feed rates. The longer the traveling distances, the higher the feed rate that can be achieved. When the achieved rate approaches the desired rate, the rate can be further tuned by adjusting the timer parameters, i.e., the on and off periods of the actuator. Shortening the off-periods of the timer, which increases the time that the rod of the valve is in the open position, increases the feed rate. For example, when the on\/off periods are sets at 0.08 s\/0.4 s, the feed rate is about 4 mg\/min. When the on\/off periods are sets at 0.12 s\/0.14 s, the feed rate increase to 800 mg\/min.","The embodiment of the particle feeder and system used in the presently-described test has been tested with fine particles of 45-75 \u03bcm with feeding rate varying from 0.2 gm\/hour to 1 gm\/min. This range of feed rate is achieved by adjusting the on\/off periods of the timer.","It was observed that dried particles can be most readily fed using the particle feeder. A vibrator was not used because it was evidence was determined that vibration actually enhanced the density of the particle bed, and clogging at the hole defined by the reservoir.","The pressure differential across the hole of the valve can affect the feed rate and the uniformity of the feed rate. When the pressure differential is greater than 7 psig, uniformity is sacrificed. Testing indicated that the best reproducibility for dried small particles can be achieved when the pressures on both sides of the hole are kept identical.","The exemplary gravity-driven, solenoid\/timer-regulated particle feeders described herein are capable of feeding pulverized particles at low and uniform rates. They require no aspirating gas, do not have external moving parts, are protected from flow disturbance as particle flow through the hole defined by the reservoir, and are protected from leakage at the hole defined by the reservoir when the rod is in the closed position. Embodiments of the particle feeder have been found to be effective in systems for conducting combustion experiments, where dried pulverized coal particles of about 100 \u03bcm are fed over a wide range of feed rates. The particle feeder can be scaled up or down for other kinds of particles at other desirable ranges of size and feed rate. Feed rates can be readily controlled and calibrated. The particle feeder is capable of feeding particles of at either batch or near continuous mode. The particle feeder can also be adapted for feeding liquids or particles that have been suspended in liquids. Single-particle injection at a desired time is also feasible. Addition information relevant to the exemplary particle feeder used for tests described in this Example is described in W. Y. Chen, G. Gowan, G. Shi, and S. Wan, 79, 083904 (2008), which is incorporated herein by this reference.","An embodiment of the particle feeder was selected for testing long-term operation, which requires larger quantities of particles. A reservoir having a length of about 8 cm, having a capacity for more than 12 grams of coal particles was provided. The length of the rod of the valve was provided in a length for operation within the provided reservoir. A powerful solenoid actuator was used, Model SS251 12 V starter solenoid available from Standard Motor Products. The power source needed to drive the actuator was 100 W, much higher than the maximum output from the 15 W timer being used. Therefore, the timer was unable to control the solenoid directly, and a relay  was added, as illustrated in . The relay, Omega SSRDC 100 VDC20, had a low voltage output connected to the timer and a high voltage output to the solenoid side. A single power supply , Antec Basiq 350 Watt (BP350), was installed and modified to provide power to the timer , relay , and actuator , as illustrated in .","To maintain uniform bed density, particles were stirred by placing piecewise metal wires around the rod with short, regular intervals, and the ends of each piece of wire were extended into the particle bed to prevent caking during feeding. A ferrous valve rod was selected for its beneficial durability, and to enhance interaction with the solenoid actuator.","This embodiment was tested for long-term operation capacity with coal particles, which were placed into the reservoir, forming a particle bed. Although the features described in the foregoing paragraph were able to keep the valve rod from jamming in the voluminous particle bed, and feed rate was initially found to be stable (i.e., under short-term operation); under long-term operation, the uniformity in feed rate was less than desirable. Therefore, another exemplary embodiment of the particle feeder was designed for applications requiring long-term operation (e.g., more than about 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 hours).","With reference to , an exemplary embodiment of the particle feeder  including a secondary reservoir  was designed for applications requiring long-term operation. Embodiments making use of the secondary reservoir can also be used for other applications, where shorter-term operation is desired.","The secondary reservoir was contemplated to serve multiple purposes, including: (1) capacity for large quantities of particles, which are needed for long-term operation; (2) minimizing the particle bed height and density variations in the primary reservoir during operation; (3) reducing particle residence time in the primary reservoir, thereby minimizing particle attrition due to rod motion, and (4) ability to replenish particle supply during operation of the feeder.","With reference to , , and , a conduit  was used to place the secondary reservoir  in fluid communication with the primary reservoir . In the exemplary embodiment, a conduit of 0.635 cm o.d. was selected. A first end of a conduit  was attached at the lower end of the primary reservoir  at a 30-degree angle. A second end of the conduit  was attached to the secondary reservoir  by a flexible hose. The particles in the secondary reservoir were allowed to continuously fall into the primary reservoir during the operation. To maintain uniform density of the particle bed and minimize the particle attrition in the primary reservoir, the conduit was placed to allow flow into the primary reservoir at a location relatively close to the hole defined by the primary reservoir, e.g., about 1.2 cm. In the exemplary embodiment, a primary reservoir of 4.85 cm length and 0.635 cm o.d. was orivuded.","With reference to , in the exemplary embodiment, the valve rod  was constructed from ferrous material, and was provided in a diameter designed to reduce load and a length of about 14.5 cm, which was shorter that the rod length of the exemplary embodiment described earlier in this Example. Due to the reduction in particle bed height and particle residence time in the primary reservoir, the metal wires around the rod, as used in the exemplary embodiment described earlier in this Example, were deemed unnecessary.","Since the rod motion is induced by a magnetic field in the exemplary embodiment, the shortened rod suffers lesser effects resulted from any imprecision in aligning the rod with the magnetic field. Studies indicate that improved results are obtained when the solenoid actuator is placed horizontally, and the rod is placed vertically, in the center of the solenoid. Imprecise alignment can result in wobbling of the rod during feeding, which, in turn, results in unstable feed rate.","To minimize the pressure difference between the primary reservoir and downstream internal areas in a system incorporating the exemplary feeder, gas can be fed into the top of the secondary reservoir, as well as into the downstream internal area of the system, below the hole defined by the primary reservoir. In this embodiment, there is no need to feed gas into the primary reservoir because it is designed to be operated under a steady state condition. In other embodiments, it can be useful to feed gas into the primary reservoir. In the exemplary embodiment, particles exit from the primary reservoir and enter a transport tube, e.g., a 0.317 cm o.d. stainless steel tube. A carrier gas enters the downstream internal area of the system from the side into a system tube, e.g., a 0.635 cm i.d. stainless steel tube, which encloses the transport tube. Particles fall through the transport tube, past the gas inlet. In this manner, the movement of gas at the gas inlet does not disturb flow of the particles.","Particles can be transported by gas further through the system, downward and upward in a flexible hose, which can include segments that are sequentially smaller in size. When the particles are transporting upward into a smaller hose, to prevent particle accumulations just before a reducer, it is recommended that gas always flow upward through the 0.1587 to 0.3175 cm reducer in the down stream of the feeding device. In the event carrier gas is not desirable, particles can fall freely from the transport tube. In such embodiments, a cap of the secondary reservoir can be left open to minimize the pressure difference, and secondary gas will not be needed.","The exemplary embodiment of the particle feeder, including the secondary reservoir, was tested for long-term operation. Tests were performed for 3, 4, and 11 h, all with dried bituminous coal particles of 100 to 150 \u03bcm. The timer's on\/off times were set at 0.01\/0.3 s. Particles exiting the primary reservoir were urged upward with He gas flowing at 200 ml\/min through a tube with 0.159 cm o.d. Samples were collected for 30 s and then weighted. Three consecutive samples were collected, each within 2 min, for about every 30 min.  present results from a 3-h test, and a 7-h test, respectively. For the data in , the standard deviations associated with the short- and long-term stabilities are 0.031 and 0.095 mg\/min, respectively. The mean feed rate is 1.49 mg\/min. For the data in , the standard deviations associated with the short- and long-term stabilities are 0.033 and 0.12 mg\/min, respectively. The mean feed rate is 1.84 mg\/min. It is noted that the chosen feed rate is low for this set of experiments, and the percentage fluctuations (relative to their mean) improve when the device is operated at higher feed rates. Assuming the feed rate is the random variable, the mean and variances of each data set i, {x}, are estimated by the following formulas, respectively,",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0100","num":"0099"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["\u03bc","i"]},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mfrac":{"mn":"1","mi":"n"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":"j","mo":"=","mn":"1"},"mi":"n"},"mo":"\u2062","msub":{"mi":["x","ij"]}}}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"1"}}]}}}},"br":{}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0101","num":"0100"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002","num":"00002"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":{"mi":"var","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"msub":{"mi":["x","i"]}}},"mo":"=","mfrac":{"mrow":[{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":"j","mo":"=","mn":"1"},"mi":"n"},"mo":"\u2062","msup":{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":["x","ij"]},{"mi":["\u03bc","i"]}],"mo":"-"}},"mn":"2"}},{"mi":"n","mo":"-","mn":"1"}]}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"2"}}]}}}},"br":{},"sub":"ij","i":"Mathematical Statistics, ","sup":"nd "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0102","num":"0101"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00003","num":"00003"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mi":"x","mo":"=","mrow":{"mfrac":{"mn":"1","mi":"m"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":"x","mn":"1"},{"mi":"x","mn":"2"},{"mi":["x","m"]}],"mo":["+","+","+"],"mi":"\u2026"}}}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"3"}}]}}}}},"then the mean and variance associated with the random variable x are, respectively,",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0104","num":"0103"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00004","num":"00004"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mi":"\u03bc","mo":"=","mrow":{"mfrac":{"mn":"1","mi":"m"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":"i","mo":"=","mn":"1"},"mi":"m"},"mo":"\u2062","msub":{"mi":["\u03bc","i"]}}}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"4"}}]}}}}},"and",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0106","num":"0105"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00005","num":"00005"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"var","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"x"}},{"msup":{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mfrac":{"mn":"1","mi":"m"}},"mn":"2"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":"i","mo":"=","mn":"1"},"mi":"m"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mi":"var","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"msub":{"mi":["x","i"]}}}}}],"mo":"="}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"5"}}]}}}}},"The square root of the var(x) in the above expression, or the standard deviation, is an index of short-term stability.
