For example, the SP  may package first terrestrial broadcasts, second terrestrial broadcasts, cable MSOs, satellite broadcasts, various internet broadcasters, and applications, and then, may provide them to a user.","Additionally, the SP  may provide service to the client  through a unicast or multicast method.","The unicast method is a method of transmitting data between one transmitter and one receiver via one to one communication. For example, in the case of the unicast method, when a receiver requests data to a server, the server may transmit data to the receiver in response to the request,","The multicast method is a method of transmitting data to a plurality of receivers in a specific group. For example, a server may transmit data to a plurality of pre-registered receivers at the same time. In order for such multicast registration, the Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) may be used.","The NP  may provide a network to the client  in order to provide the above service, and the client  may establish a Home Network End User (HNED) in order to receive the service.","As a means for protecting contents transmitted from the system, conditional access or content protection may be used.

A video display device transmits an SP attachment request signal in operation S. After the SP attachment is completed, the video display device receives provisioning information in operation S. Furthermore, the video display device receives the a master SI table from the SP in operation S, receives a Virtual channel map table in operation S, receives a virtual channel description table in operation S, and receives a source table in operation S.","For example, the SP discovery may mean a process that SPs providing IPTV related services search for a server providing information on their services.","A method of finding an address list for receiving information on a Service Discovery (SD) server may be the following three, for example. First, an address preset in a video display device or an address set by a user's manual operation may be used. Second, a DHCP based SP discovery method may be used. Third, a DNS SRV-based SP discovery method may be used.","Additionally, the video display device accesses the server of the address obtained through one of the above three methods, receives a service provider discovery record containing information necessary for service discovery for each SP, and performs a service discovery operation by using it.

That is, the network interface unit  may receive services and contents from a SP via a network.","The TCP\/IP manager  may be involved in delivering packets received by the video display device  and packets that the video display device  transmits, from a source to a destination. Also, the TCP\/IP manager  classifies the received packets in order to correspond to a proper protocol and outputs packets classified into the service delivery manager , the service discovery manager , the service control manager , and the metadata manager .","Moreover, the service delivery manager  is responsible for controlling the received service data. For example, when controlling real-time streaming data, the service delivery manager  may use the RTP\/RTCP.","When transmitting the real-time streaming through the RTP, the service delivery manager  may parse the received data packet according to the RTP and may transmit them to the demux , or may store them in the SI&Metadata DB  according to a control of the service manager . Additionally, the service delivery manager  may feed back the network received information to a server through the RTCP.","The demux  may demultiplex the received packet into audio, video, and Program Specific Information (PSI) data and may transmit them into the audio\/video decoders  and  and the PSI&(PSIP and\/or SI) Decoder , respectively.","The PSI&(PSIP and\/or SI) Decoder  may decode service information such as the PSI and, for example, may receive the PSI section, the Program and Service Information Protocol (PSIP) section, or the Service Information (SI) section, which are demultiplexed in the demux , and then may decode them.","Additionally, the PSI&(PSIP and\/or SI) Decoder  may decode the received sections in order to create a database for service information, and then may store the database for service information in the SI&Metadata DB .","The audio\/video decoders  and  may decode the received video data and audio data from the demux , and may provide the decoded audio and video data to a user through the display unit .","Moreover, the UI manager  and the service manager  may manage the overall state of the video display device  and may provide a user interface, and also may manage other managers.","For example, the UI manager  may provide a Graphic User Interface (GUI) for user through an On Screen Display (OSD), and may receive a key input from a user to perform a receiver operation according to the input. Additionally, when receiving a key input for channel selection from a user, the UI manager  may transmit the key input signal to the service manager .","The service manager  may control managers relating to services such as the service delivery manager , the service discovery manager , the service control manager , and the metadata manager .","Additionally, the service manager  creates a channel map and selects a channel by using the channel map according to the received key input from the user interface manager .","Also, the service manager  may receive service information of a channel from the PSI&(PSIP and\/or SI) Decoder  and may set the audio\/video Packet Identifier (PID) of the selected channel in the demux .","The service discovery manager  may provide information necessary for selecting an SP that provides services. For example, when receiving a signal relating to channel selection from the service manager , the service discovery manager  may find a service by using the received signal.","Additionally, the service control manager  is responsible for selection and control of service. For example, when a user selects Live Broadcasting service such as an existing broadcasting system, the service control manager  uses the IGMP or the RTSP and when a user selects a service such as Video On Demand (VOD), the service control manager  uses the RTSP in order to select and control the service.","The RTSP may provide a trick mode for real-time streaming and the service control manager  may initialize and manage the sessions passing through the IMC gateway by using the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) and the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).","The metadata manager  may manage metadata relating to service and may store the metadata in the SI&Metadata DB .","Additionally, Also, the SI&Metadata DB  may store the service information decoded by the PSI&(PSIP and\/or SI) Decoder , the metadata that the metadata manager  manages, and the information necessary for selecting SPs that the service discovery manager  provides.","Moreover, the SI&Metadata DB  may store setup data for system and, for example, may be realized with NonVolatile RAM (NVRAM) or flash memory.","Furthermore, the IG  may be a gateway having functions necessary for accessing IMS based IPTV service.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0092","num":"0091"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},"Referring to , the video display device  may include a broadcast receiving unit , an external device interface unit , a storage unit , a user input interface unit , a control unit , a display unit , an audio output unit , and a power supply unit .
