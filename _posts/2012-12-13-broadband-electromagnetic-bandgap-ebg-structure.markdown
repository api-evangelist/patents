{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD OF INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This application claims benefit of U.S. provisional patent application Ser. No. 61\/601,584, filed Feb. 22, 2012, which is herein incorporated by reference.","The invention described herein may be manufactured, used and licensed by or for the U.S. Government.\u201d","Embodiments of the present invention generally relate to electromagnetic band-gap (EBG) structures, and more particularly to EBG structures having a progressive cascade of patterns of EBG cells, which progressive cascade of patterns result in a continuous wideband operational phase response for the EBG structures, as well as antennas using such wideband EBG structures.","Electromagnetic band gap (EBG) structures are periodic structures that have special properties, such as high surface impedance. Accordingly, a ground plane having EBG structures formed thereon can act as a close-to-perfect magnetic conducting structure, and therefore suppress the formation of surface waves. The reflection phase is important when EBG structures are used for designing an antenna because of the known consequence that the efficiency of the antenna is affected by destructive interference of the wave reflected from the ground plane with the wave directly radiated from the antenna. A conventional solution to this problem is to provide the antenna at a specified distance from the electric ground plane (that is, at one quarter wavelength of the center frequency) so that the reflected wave and the radiated wave constructively combine along the boresight of the antenna. Using a magnetic ground plane having EBG structures formed thereon in combination with an antenna is known so as to take advantage of the EBG characteristic of high impedance, and thereby allowing the construction of low-profile antennas. The reflection phase of such EBG structures when used in an antenna embodiment is such that it results in the constructive addition of the incident and reflected waves, thereby reducing backward radiation and enhancing forward radiation. Although EBG structures have been known in microwave design for more than two decades and are known to provide advantages due to their compact size and low loss when integrated into an antenna design, EBG structures typically work over a narrow frequency band, which makes them not practical for use with broadband antennas. The word \u201csize\u201d as used herein is not limited to a measure of physical characteristics, but also includes a measure of electrical characteristics.","It would be desirable to provide an electromagnetic band gap structure having a phase response suitable for use with a broadband antenna, that is, having an ultra-wideband (UWB) operational phase response which is greater than, for example, 500 MHz.","Methods and apparatus for providing a broadband electromagnetic band gap (EBG) structure are provided herein. In some embodiments an apparatus for providing a broadband EBG structure includes a progressive cascade of patterns, of EBG cells, each pattern having a resonance at a different, but closely-spaced frequency compared with an adjacently positioned pattern. In some embodiments this is accomplished by using one of either a concentric arrangement or a symmetric parallel arrangement of patterns of EBG cells, each pattern having a basic cell size, which size progressively changes the further the pattern is positioned from a central point of the EBG structure, so as to cause a progressive change in resonance for adjacently positioned patterns. The combined effect of this progressive cascade arrangement is a continuous ultra wide operational bandwidth for the EBG structure. In some embodiments the progressive cascade of patterns are provided as a single level structure, and in other embodiments, each pattern is provided on a different level. These and further embodiments of the present invention are described below.","To facilitate understanding, identical reference numerals have been used, where possible, to designate identical elements that are common to the figures. The figures are not drawn to scale and may be simplified for clarity. It is contemplated that elements and features of one embodiment may be beneficially incorporated in other embodiments without further recitation.","The present invention describes embodiments for a broadband electromagnetic bandgap (EBG) structure and use of that structure in an antenna application. The invention derives from a progressive cascade of patterns of EBG structures, each pattern having a progressively increasing resonant frequency, so that the combined effect of the cascade structure provides a continuous ultra-wide broadband phase response. The new structure is validated by using it in combination with a broadband antenna and comparing the performance of the antenna with a uniform EBG ground plan structure and then with a broadband EBG ground plane structure having a progressive cascade of patterns as described herein.","Mushroom-like EBG structures have parallel LC resonators, such as shown in  which illustrate top and side views, respectively of a 2\u00d72 patch mushroom EBG structure  of a type useful for forming some embodiments of the invention. The structure includes a periodic conductive pattern of patches  centered over metallized vias  having a diameter (2r) formed in a dielectric board  having a thickness (t). Each patch and via comprise one EBG cell. The patches  are illustrated in this embodiment as squares having a uniform side dimension (w) which are separated by a gap distance (g). The inductance (L) of the resonator is represented by the metallized vias  and the capacitance (C) is represented by the gap (g) between the patches . At, the resonant frequency of the EBG structure, the surface impedance goes to infinity and thus acts like a perfect magnetic conductor (PMC). When the surface is used as the ground plane for an antenna, this effect causes the wave reflected from the ground plan surface to be \u201cin-phase\u201d, and therefore constructively add with the direct wave radiated from the antenna. The result is an up to 3 DB improvement in antenna performance, as compared with the antenna in a free-space environment, and an even more significant improvement relative to an antenna over a ground plane surface that acts like a perfect electric conductor (PEC). A PEG ground plane surface provides an out-of-phase reflection (that is \u2212180\u00b0) from its surface that destructively interferes with the direct wave radiated from the antenna. Although the reflection off of a PEG becomes coherent with the antenna radiation if the antenna is placed a quarter-wavelength above the PEC, placing the antenna a quarter-wavelength above the PEC results in an undesirable increase in height for the antenna arrangement.","The surface impedance of the mushroom EBG structure is calculated as shown in equation 1, while the inductance and capacitance of the EBG structure are calculated as shown in equations 3 and 4. The band gap of an EBG structure is defined as the frequency band where they reflection phase is within the +90 to \u221290\u00b0 range.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["Z","s"]},"mo":"=","mfrac":{"mrow":[{"mi":["j","\u03c9","L"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}]},{"mn":"1","mo":"-","msup":{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":"\u03c9","mo":"\/","msub":{"mi":["\u03c9","o"]}}},"mn":"2"}}]}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"1"}}]},{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["\u03c9","o"]},"mo":"=","mfrac":{"mn":"1","msqrt":{"mi":"LC"}}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"2"}}]},{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mi":"C","mo":"=","mrow":{"mfrac":{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["\u025b","o"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mn":"1","mo":"+","msub":{"mi":["\u025b","r"]}}}},"mi":"\u03c0"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"msup":{"mi":"cosh","mrow":{"mn":"1","mo":"-"}},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mfrac":{"mrow":{"mi":["\u03c9","g"],"mo":"+"},"mi":"g"}}}}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"3"}}]},{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mi":"L","mo":"=","mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["\u03bc","o"]},"mo":"\u2062","mi":"t"}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"4"}}]}]}}}},"It has been found that three or four different patterns of individual cell size are needed in the EBG structure to achieve the wide bandwidth phase performance desired in an antenna arrangement.
