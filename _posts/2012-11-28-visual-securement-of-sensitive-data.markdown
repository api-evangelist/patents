{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["With the advent of the internet and portable computing devices, information can be accessed easily and quickly from anywhere. Users can access reports such as business intelligence reports from anywhere and at any time over wireless communication networks. Some reports may include sensitive data. Accessing such reports from public places may not be secure and users may be asked not to open such records in public. Asking users not to open the reports is not an effective or a reliable approach for protecting sensitive data. Some security measures involve restricting the access of reports in public places. Restricting the access of report can be unproductive in situations where users need to immediately work on the report from some public place. Other security measures involve password protection where users are required to enter a password before opening the reports with sensitive data. However, password protection is also not effective because once the report is opened, the sensitive data is exposed.","Embodiments of techniques for visual securement of sensitive data are described herein. In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth to provide a thorough understanding of the embodiments. One skilled in the relevant art will recognize, however, that the embodiments can be practiced without one or more of the specific details, or with other methods, components, materials, etc. In other instances, well-known structures, materials, or operations are not shown or described in detail.","Reference throughout this specification to \u201cone embodiment\u201d, \u201cthis embodiment\u201d and similar phrases, means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one of the one or more embodiments. Thus, the appearances of these phrases in various places throughout this specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment. Furthermore, the particular features, structures, or characteristics may be combined in any suitable manner in one or more embodiments.","Report may be a document which presents information to a specific audience. For example, a business intelligence (BI) report presents salient content to business users such as business analysts. The report can include tables, charts, graphical elements, etc. In one embodiment, the report is a graphical report including one or more graphs. In one embodiment, the report is a tabular report comprising one or more data fields. For example, the tabular report \u2018employee profile\u2019 may include data fields such as employee name, address, salary, etc. Each data field of the report includes one or more data or values. For example, the data field employee name includes data, e.g., Alex, Tom, Rim, etc.","Critical or sensitive data fields are those data fields of the report which can be of more interest to a user or otherwise emphasized. What is sensitive may vary depending on the context. In one context, the data fields which are more frequently analyzed in the report may be sensitive. In one embodiment, the data fields including personal information may be sensitive. In some embodiments, the sensitive data fields are predefined at design-time, i.e., during a design or development phase of the report. Usually, a report designer specifies the sensitive data fields. For example, the report designer may specify the data field \u2018employee name\u2019 as \u2018sensitive\u2019 data field. In one embodiment, the data fields are specified \u2018sensitive\u2019 at runtime by a user. In one embodiment, the data fields are automatically specified \u2018sensitive,\u2019 based upon user's behavior. In one embodiment, the data fields are specified sensitive by recording those data fields which are more frequently accessed by the user. In one embodiment, an access count of the data field is recorded and if the access count exceeds a predefined number, the data field is automatically specified as the sensitive data field.","Sensitive data are parts of the report which are important and subject to privacy. In one embodiment, the sensitive data are data associated with the sensitive data fields. For example, the data such as Alex, Tom, Rim, etc., of the sensitive data field \u2018employee name\u2019 are automatically marked as \u2018sensitive\u2019 data. In some embodiments, each data is individually specified as \u2018sensitive\u2019 or \u2018non-sensitive\u2019 at design-time of the report. For example, the data related to personal information of a particular user may be specified as \u2018sensitive\u2019 data at design-time of the report.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","110","120","120","130","140","130","120","110","120","110","120","120","110","130","130","140","120"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","200"]},"The data corresponding to the sensitive data fields automatically becomes sensitive data.

The end user can send the request from anywhere using the portable computing device . For example, the end user may send the request from his mobile phone from any public place such as airport, railway station, market place, bus stand, etc. The portable computing device  may be any computing device which can be carried by the end user, e.g., a laptop, a mobile phone, a smartphone, a tablet computer, etc. The end user sends the request for displaying the report, e.g., the report , from the portable computing device . The request is received by a report rendering module . The report rendering module  is communicatively coupled to the portable computing device . In one embodiment, the report rendering module  may be a part of the portable computing device .","Once the request is received by the report rendering module , the report rendering module  looks for the requested report, e.g., the report , on a server , shown in . The report rendering module  is communicatively coupled to the server  that stores the reports. In one embodiment, the server  may be a business intelligence (BI) server. In one embodiment, the report rendering module  may be a part of the server . The report rendering module  communicates with the server  to check the availability of requested report, e.g., the report .","In one embodiment, when the requested report is not available on the server , the report rendering module  displays an error message on the portable computing device . Few exemplary error messages may be \u201cnot available,\u201d \u201cerror.\u201d \u201cunidentified report,\u201d etc. In case the requested report, e.g., the report , is available on the server , the report rendering module  generates an instance of the requested report . In one embodiment, the report rendering module  includes the securement module . The securement module  determines if the requested report  includes any sensitive data. In one embodiment, the securement module  determines if the requested report  includes any sensitive data by determining if the requested report  includes any sensitive data fields. In one embodiment, the securement module  refers to report definition to determine whether the report includes any sensitive data field. Typically, the securement module  determines whether the property named \u2018IS_SENSITIVE\u2019 for any data field is \u2018TRUE.\u2019 If the property \u2018IS_SENSITIVE\u2019 for any data field is \u2018TRUE,\u2019 it is determined that the report includes sensitive data field. By default, the property \u2018IS_SENSITIVE\u2019 for all the data fields is set \u2018FALSE.\u2019 At design-time of the report , the property \u2018IS_SENSITIVE\u2019 may be set \u2018TRUE\u2019 for the sensitive data fields S1-S4.","Once it is determined that the report  includes sensitive data fields S1-S4, the securement module  identifies the display rule associated with the sensitive data fields S1-S4. In one embodiment, the display rule is predefined for each of the sensitive data fields S1-S4. The display rule is related to visual securement of the sensitive data E1-E5, U1-U5, V1-V5, and W1-W5 of the sensitive data fields S1-S4. In one embodiment, a separate display rule may be defined for each sensitive data field S1-S4. The display rule may be predefined at design-time of the report . In one embodiment, the display rule may be revised or updated. The display rule associated with the sensitive data fields S1-S4 is for obscuring their respective data E1-E5, U1-U5, V1-V5, and W1-W5. In one embodiment, the display rule executes a procedure for obscuring the sensitive data E1-E5, U1-U5, V1-V5, and W1-W5.","In one embodiment, the sensitive data E1-E5, U1-U5, V1-V5, and W1-W5 is obscured in the instance of the report  generated by the report rendering module . The securement module  applies the display rule on the instance of the report  and not on the actual report  which is stored on the server .","In one embodiment, the procedure for obscuring the sensitive data E1-E5, U1-U5, V1-V5, and W1-W5 includes blurring or smudging the sensitive data E1-E5, U1-U5, V1-V5, and W1-W5, as shown in . The sensitive data E1-E5, U1-U5, V1-V5, and W1-W5 may be blurred using any suitable blurring or smudging algorithm known in the art to generate a visually secured report . For example, a Gaussian image blur algorithm may be used to blur the sensitive data E1-E5, U1-U5, V1-V5, and W1-W5. As shown in , the visually secured report  includes unobscured non-sensitive data fields NS1-NSN and the obscured sensitive data fields S1-S4.","In one embodiment, the procedure for obscuring sensitive data includes adjusting contrast of the sensitive data.  illustrates a visually secured report  including the sensitive data E1-E5, U1-U5, V1-V5, and W1-W5 with adjusted contrast. The contrast is a difference in luminance and\/or color of a displayed data and a background. In one embodiment, the contrast is adjusted by adjusting a color of the sensitive data relative to the background color. In one embodiment, the contrast is adjusted by adjusting the background color relative to the color of the sensitive data. In one embodiment, both the color of the sensitive data and the background color are adjusted relative to each other. The background color may be represented as \u2018bgc\u2019 and the color of the sensitive data may be represented as \u2018tc.\u2019 In some embodiments, the below exemplary algorithm may be executed to adjust the contrast of the sensitive data:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"left"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"ADJUST_CONTRAST(SENSITIVE DATA)"},{"entry":"{"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"140pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"if (tc= 000000)","\/\/ 000000 is a hexadecimal code for BLACK"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"140pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"color\/\/"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"140pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"tc= bgc+\u03b5;","\/\/ \u03b5 is \u2018epsilon\u2019 which indicates small value"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"203pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"else"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"189pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"bgc= tc\u2212 \u03b5;"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"left"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"}"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"According to the above algorithm, it is determined if the color of the sensitive data (tc) has a default value, e.g., BLACK or 000000 (in hexadecimal format). If the color of the sensitive data (tc) is equal to 000000, it implies that the sensitive data has a default color (e.g., BLACK). The color of the sensitive data then can be changed relative to the color of the background to obscure the sensitive data. In one embodiment, the color of the sensitive data (tc) is changed to the background color+some small value, e.g., {tc=bgc+\u03b5}. In one embodiment, the color of the sensitive data (tc) is changed to the background color\u2212some small value, e.g., {tc=bgc\u2212\u03b5}. In one embodiment, the \u2018\u03b5\u2019 may be any suitable hexadecimal value which ensures small difference between the color of the sensitive data and the background color such as 111111, 112233, 221133, 113333, 222222, etc. For example, the text E1-E5. U1-U5, V1-V5, and W1-W5 is changed to background color (i.e., white)+small value, and therefore, the sensitive data E1-E5, U1-U5, V1-V5, and W1-W5 appears slightest grayish and obscured in . In case the color of the sensitive data (tc) is not default color or BLACK then the color of the sensitive data might be context specific, e.g., RED color to identify that the data requires attention. The color of the context specific data should not be changed. In case the color of the sensitive data (tc)\u2260BLACK, the background color (bgc) is changed relative to the color of the sensitive data to obscure the sensitive data. For example, the background color (bgc) is changed to the color of the sensitive data\u00b1some small value, e.g., {bgc=tc\u2212\u03b5}). Therefore, actual values of color of the sensitive data and the background color are adjusted appropriately to render the sensitive data E1-E5, U1-U5, V1-V5, and W1-W5 difficult to read, thereby protecting the data from prying eyes and cameras, etc. The above stated algorithm is for illustration and any suitable algorithm for adjusting contrast may be used.","In one embodiment, the contrast may be adjusted by adjusting an alpha (\u03b1) value of the color of the sensitive data or the background color. The alpha value represents opacity and the alpha value varies from 0 to 1, i.e., 0\u2266\u03b1\u22661. The alpha value 0 represents 100% transparency, i.e., text becomes transparent and invisible. The alpha value 1 represents 0% transparency, i.e., text becomes opaque and clearly visible. By default the alpha value of the color of the sensitive data is 1 and therefore, the text is clearly visible. For obscuring text, the alpha value of the color of the sensitive data may be adjusted so that the text becomes more transparent and obscured. The alpha value of the color of the sensitive data may be adjusted by calling a function \u201ctc=tc.alpha(\u03b1).\u201d For example, the alpha value of the color of the sensitive data may be adjusted by calling a function \u201ctc=tc.alpha(0.03).\u201d In some embodiments, the contrast is adjusted by just adjusting the alpha value of the color of the sensitive data. In some embodiments, the contrast is adjusted by adjusting the color of the sensitive data (e.g., tc=bgc+\u03b5), followed by adjusting the alpha value of the color of the sensitive data.","In one embodiment, the procedure for obscuring the sensitive data includes striking out the sensitive data. In one embodiment, the font effect \u2018strikethrough\u2019 or \u2018double strikethrough\u2019 is automatically enabled for the sensitive data.  illustrates a visually secured report  including the sensitive data E1-E5, U1-U5, V1-V5, and W1-W5 being obscured using strikethrough.","In one embodiment, the procedure for obscuring sensitive data includes reducing font size of the sensitive data. In one embodiment, the font size for the sensitive data is automatically set to certain predefined value.  illustrates a visually secured report  with the sensitive data E1-E5, U1-U5, V1-V5, and W1-W5 being obscured by reducing font size.","In one embodiment, the procedure for obscuring sensitive data includes masking the sensitive data. In one embodiment, masking includes applying a dark layer (e.g., BLACK patch) upon the sensitive data.  illustrates a visually secured report  including sensitive data E1-E5, U1-U5, V1-V5, and W1-W5 masked with the dark layer. In one embodiment, the dark layer may be applied by calculating a display area covering the sensitive data. For example, the respective display area covering the sensitive data E1-E5, U1-U5, V1-V5, and W1-W5 may be calculated. Once the display area of the respective sensitive data E1-E5, U1-U5, V1-V5, and W1-W5 is calculated, the respective display area may be filled by dark color like BLACK. In one embodiment, the color of the display area may be set as {displayarea.color=000000}. In one embodiment, a single display area covering all the sensitive data E1-E5, U1-U5, V1-V5, and W1-W5 may be calculated and masked with the BLACK patch.","Although some procedures for obscuring sensitive data are described above, it should be understood that other obscuring procedures can be easily adopted. Any new procedure for obscuring data may be easily configured within the securement module .","In one embodiment, the display rule calls the procedure for obscuring the sensitive data E1-E5, U1-U5, V1-V5, and W1-W5 based upon various conditional parameters. In one embodiment, the conditional parameter includes at least one of the location information of the portable computing device  from which the request for displaying the report  is received, a name or an address of a network through which the request is received, a connectivity status of the network including an online and offline status of the network, an authentication information of the end user sending the request, an email address of the end user to whom the report  or an screen shot of the report  is to be sent, etc.","Examples of display rules for obscuring the sensitive data based on the location information includes (a) \u201cblur sensitive data when location of portable device accessing the report is greater than 2 miles radius from place named XYZ\u201d (b) \u201cblur sensitive data when location of portable device accessing the report is greater than 2 miles radius from place address ABC\u201d (c) \u201cblur sensitive data when location of portable device accessing the report does not has the latitude\/longitude value of L1\/L2.\u201d L1 and L2 can have any suitable numerical value. In one embodiment, various known techniques such as global positioning system (GPS), radio frequency identifier (RFID), geo coding, cell tower location, etc., may be used for determining the location information.","In one embodiment, the display rule including conditional parameter related to the location information may be \u201cstrikethrough the sensitive data when employee is not in office.\u201d In one embodiment, it may be determined whether the employee is within the office campus or outside based upon the employee entry\/exit information. Typically, a database table (IN\/OUT register) shown below as Table 1 may be maintained for tracking employee entry\/exit details:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":[{},"TABLE 1"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"Employee I No.","Gate #","Time","IN\/OUT"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"I089","2","12:00 pm\u2002","OUT"]},{"entry":[{},"I764","1","6:00 am","IN"]},{"entry":[{},"I123","4","8:00 am","IN"]},{"entry":[{},"I067","3","6:00 pm","OUT"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}}},"In one embodiment, the report rendering module  can query a server (not shown) storing Table 1 whether the employee is IN or OUT. For example, the report rendering module  queries the server \u201cis I089 IN?\u201d The server checks Table 1 (IN\/OUT register) and replies back. If the reply is \u2018YES,\u2019 then the employee is within the office campus and therefore, according to the display rule the report is displayed without striking the sensitive data.","Examples of display rules for obscuring the sensitive data based on the network information such as the address and the status of the network includes (a) \u201cblur sensitive data when network through which request is received is a wireless network unless the name of the wireless network is \u2018abc\u2019\u201d (b) \u201cblur sensitive data when the network address through which request is received is not \u2018yz\u2019\u201d (c) \u201cstrikethrough sensitive data when connectivity status of the network is \u2018offline\u2019\u201d (d) \u201cblur sensitive data until SSID is \u2018pqr\u2019.\u201d SSID or service set identifier is a name of a wireless local area network (WLAN). The display rule \u201cstrikethrough sensitive data when connectivity status of the network is \u2018offline\u2019\u201d is applicable for the already downloaded reports.","In one embodiment, the display rule can be based on the authentication information of the end user or the device. Non-authenticated users or devices may not be allowed to view the reports from the server . An exemplary display rule including conditional parameter based on the user authentication information may be as \u201cblur sensitive data when the user is not authenticated.\u201d","In one embodiment, the display rule can be based on an email address or email_id of a receiver. For example, the display rule may be \u201cblur sensitive data if the report is sent to an unknown email_id.\u201d In one embodiment, a screen shot of the report may be sent via email. The securement module  determines if the email_id is known or registered. In case the email_id is not registered, the font size of the sensitive data is automatically reduced in the screenshot to be sent to the unregistered email_id.

For example, if the user accessing the report is granted special permission or privileges then the display rule may be overruled and the sensitive data is not obscured for the user. The special privileges may be associated with a profile or device of the user. The securement module  determines if the special privilege is associated with the user. In one embodiment, the securement module  determines if the device from which the report is requested is given special privileges. In case the special privilege is associated with the user or device, the display rule is overruled and the sensitive data is not obscured.","In one embodiment, as illustrated in , a user interface element  is provided on a screen or a user interface  of the portable computing device  to enable users view the obscured data. In one embodiment, the UI element  may be a magnifier glass kind of element. The UI element  is navigable and the user can position the UI element  anywhere on the screen. The area under the UI element  becomes clearly visible. Therefore, when the user positions the UI element  upon, e.g., a part of the obscured data, that part of the obscured data becomes clearly visible. For example, the data E5 positioned under the UI element  become clearly visible. Therefore, the end user can view the obscured data without straining themselves. In one embodiment, the UI element can be of any other shape or size.","In one embodiment, information or reasons for obscuring the sensitive data may also be displayed. The information for obscuring the sensitive data may be displayed in response to the user action such as on placing a cursor upon the obscured data.

Typically, a function, e.g., applicationwillgotobackground( ) is automatically called while closing or minimizing the report. Once the function is called, the OS knows that the report is to be closed or minimized (going to background). After the execution of the function applicationwillgotobackground( ), the OS takes screenshot of the report and saves it in a backend. The screenshots from the backend can be easily retrieved by hackers. Generally, even if the mobile device is locked, a hacker can easily retrieve the stored screenshots, e.g., using a pen drive. Therefore, it is required to obscure the sensitive data in the screenshot. In one embodiment, a code for obscuring sensitive data of the displayed report is included within the function applicationwillgotobackground( ). Therefore, whenever the function applicationwillgotobackground( ) is called and executed, the sensitive data of report is obscured and the visually secured report is displayed on the screen.

Sensitive data within reports are visually secured (e.g., obscured) without hampering the accessibility of the reports. Therefore, users can access and work on the report without bothering about the security of the sensitive data. The sensitive data is automatically obscured using various techniques such as blurring, smudging, adjusting contrast, striking out, reducing font size, masking the sensitive data with a dark layer, etc. Embodiments are also flexible to incorporate new techniques of obscuring data. In some embodiment, sensitive data is visually secured depending upon various conditional parameters.

Some example embodiments may include remote procedure calls being used to implement one or more of these components across a distributed programming environment. For example, a logic level may reside on a first computer system that is remotely located from a second computer system containing an interface level (e.g., a graphical user interface). These first and second computer systems can be configured in a server-client, peer-to-peer, or some other configuration. The clients can vary in complexity from mobile and handheld devices, to thin clients and on to thick clients or even other servers.","The above-illustrated software components are tangibly stored on a computer readable storage medium as instructions. The term \u201ccomputer readable storage medium\u201d should be taken to include a single medium or multiple media that stores one or more sets of instructions. The term \u201ccomputer readable storage medium\u201d should be taken to include any physical article that is capable of undergoing a set of physical changes to physically store, encode, or otherwise carry a set of instructions for execution by a computer system which causes the computer system to perform any of the methods or process steps described, represented, or illustrated herein. A computer readable storage medium may be a non-transitory computer readable storage medium. Examples of a non-transitory computer readable storage media include, but are not limited to: magnetic media, such as hard disks, floppy disks, and magnetic tape; optical media such as CD-ROMs, DVDs and holographic indicator devices; magneto-optical media; and hardware devices that are specially configured to store and execute, such as application-specific integrated circuits (\u201cASICs\u201d), programmable logic devices (\u201cPLDs\u201d) and ROM and RAM devices. Examples of computer readable instructions include machine code, such as produced by a compiler, and files containing higher-level code that are executed by a computer using an interpreter. For example, an embodiment may be implemented using Java, C++, or other object-oriented programming language and development tools. Another embodiment may be implemented in hard-wired circuitry in place of, or in combination with machine readable software instructions.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0062"},"figref":"FIG. 17","b":["1700","1700","1705","1755","1705","1700","1740","1755","1710","1715","1710","1715","1715","1710","1715","1715","1705","1715","1700","1725","1730","1700","1725","1730","1700","1735","1700","1750","1750","1700","1745","1700","1720","1760","1760","1760","1750","1760"]},"A data source is an information resource.
