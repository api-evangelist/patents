title: Hybrid switching architecture having dynamically assigned switching models for converged services platform
abstract: A converged services platform based on a hybrid switching architecture in which either a traditional switching model or a soft-switching model may be selected on a call-by-call basis. In addition, the assigned switching model may be dynamically changed while a call is in progress in order to gain access to desired media services while avoiding network latencies and undesirable service delays.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF AN ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENT"],"p":["1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates generally to the field of telecommunications and, more specifically, to a converged services platform based on a hybrid switching architecture.","2. Background Information","Traditional circuit-switched telecommunications networks, including the public switched telephone network (PSTN), typically include switches in which call control signaling is fully integrated with media switching. Call processing functionality must be tightly coupled, and usually co-located, with media switching hardware in order to implement the traditional switching model. Thus, a switch which operates in accordance with the traditional model consists of a single \u201cbox\u201d containing a call processing element (e.g., a CPU running appropriate software), a switching element (e.g., a timeslot inter-changer), one or more line cards capable of supporting desired protocols (e.g., DS3, T1, E1, J1, analog, etc.) or other interfaces (e.g., SS7, IP, etc.) and, in most instances, a capability for performing tone generation\/detection, voice recorded announcements, conferencing or similar \u201cmedia services\u201d as may be required by a given application.","A major disadvantage of the traditional switching model is that, due to the tight coupling between call processing and media switching hardware, it is not particularly flexible and is not well suited to rapid development and deployment of new telecommunications services. In addition, use of the traditional switching model often requires higher capital investment to provide a given service due to the duplication of hardware at multiple locations in a large system.","In the past several years, a growing emphasis on the use of packet-switched networks to provide telecommunications services has given rise to an alternative switching model known as \u201csoft-switching.\u201d Broadly speaking, the soft-switching model is based on a decoupling of call processing from media switching. Such decoupling provides greater flexibility for development and deployment of new services and enables construction of systems in which call processing functionality may be geographically remote from media switching hardware. Such geographical distribution is naturally compatible with packet-switched networks and provides numerous advantages, including elimination of duplicate hardware which would normally be required by use of the traditional switching model.","However, the soft-switching model exhibits disadvantageous characteristics in certain applications. For example, latencies in controlling media switching entities over packet-switched networks may be sufficiently large as to cause noticeable delays in playing tones or announcements to a subscriber, which may in turn cause the subscriber to discontinue use of service. Such an outcome is commercially unacceptable and cannot be tolerated by carriers or other service providers.","In brief summary, the present invention provides a converged services platform, based on a hybrid switching architecture, in which switching functions may be performed in accordance with either a traditional switching model or a soft-switching model. In a preferred embodiment, the choice of switching model is programmable through application software which controls the overall operation of the converged services platform. The application software may dynamically assign a switching model on a call-by-call basis. In addition, the choice of model may be dynamically changed during the duration of a call.","By allowing the application software, and thus the application developer, the flexibility to dynamically assign and change switching models on a per call basis, a highly diverse collection of applications may be optimized to very high performance in conjunction with a single converged services platform. That is, the present invention allows application developers to avoid making exclusive choices between switching models and the performance tradeoffs associated with each such model. Instead, an application developer may simply select the switching model which best suits the requirements of a given call within the application and may do so without affecting any other call.","Another advantage provided by the present invention relates to the use of media resources. Media resources, such as those needed to generate\/detect tones, provide conferencing, playback voice recorded announcements and the like, are often relatively expensive components of a given system. Thus, there is usually an economic reason for minimizing such resources. With the present invention, media resources may be arranged as a media server located in a single, essentially central, location, but which may be efficiently utilized by switching hardware which is either co-located with or geographically remote from the media server.","The present invention may advantageously be used with existing switching platforms that were originally designed to operate exclusively using a traditional switching model. By making appropriate modifications and additions to the operating software of such a platform, the capabilities of the present invention may be realized in a way that both extends the useful life and increases the revenue-generating capability of existing platforms.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["2","4","2","6","8"]},"As shown, platform  includes redundant switching buses and . Redundant CPU cards , are connected to buses , an HDLC bus , and to host  by way of input\/output (I\/O) cards , . Depending upon the requirements of a particular application, various combinations of the following \u201cline\u201d cards, each of which supports a particular digital telecommunications protocol, may be included within platform : T1 card ; E1 card , DS3 cards , . For redundancy, a stanby card , which is a duplicate of one of the other line cards, may also be included. All such line cards have an associated I\/O card, denoted collectively by reference number , which serves as an interface to PSTN .","If a particular application requires ISDN signaling, ISDN PRI cards , may be included within platform . Similarly, if a particular application requires SS7 signaling, SS7 cards , may be included. If a particular application requires IP media transport, platform  may include IPN cards , or an IPS card . Also, if a particular application requires media services, a media resource card  may be included. Cards ,  and  each have an associated I\/O card, denoted collectively by reference number . Power cards , and cooling fans , are also present within platform .","In a preferred embodiment, CSP  is an open, programmable, multi-service platform which, in conjunction with appropriate application software, may be used to implement a wide variety of applications including prepaid calling, interactive voice response (IVR) systems, enhanced services and many others. In applications involving IP networks, a single CSP  which includes at least one media resource card  may be used as a media server that is accessible by a number of geographically remote media gateways or other platforms. As a result, media resources need not be duplicated in multiple locations and significant savings may be realized.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 2A","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["2","2","4","38","38","12","16","18","20","24","28","30","32","38","38","38","6"],"i":["a ","b","a ","b "]},"In contrast, using the soft-switching model of , bearer switching is no longer handled by CSP , which retains responsibility only for call control and signaling control. That is, no physical switching is carried out by CSP  with respect to a call that is assigned the soft-switching model and the only hardware of CSP  that is required is one of CPU cards  and optionally one IPN card  if a call, during its duration, were to be transitioned from the soft-switching model to the traditional switching model. The use of the soft-switching model is appropriate where phone sets and , for example, represent IP end points of IP network , which by definition supports self-routing, connectionless communications.","In a preferred embodiment, the assignment of either the traditional switching model or the soft-switching model may be made by the application (host ) issuing an appropriate message to CSP  at the initiation of a given call. This arrangement advantageously allows an application developer to specify the switching model deemed best for a particular application. Those skilled in the art will recognize that CSP  may be programmed to default to a particular switching model in the absence of a message from host .","With reference now to , we shall discuss an example of a call processed in accordance with the soft-switching model of . In this example, reference number represents a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) End Point (EP) A and reference number represents SIP EP B. The process begins with SIP EP A issuing an INVITE message , via IP network , which is received by the CPU card or within CSP . CSP  responds by issuing a 100 TRYING message  to SIP EP A. CSP  next issues a Request for Service (RFS) with data message  (the data being SIP EP A's Session Description Protocol (SDP)) to host , which notifies the application program that a call is beginning. The messages exchanged between the CSP  and host  belong to an application programming interface (API) provided by CSP  to host  implementers (e.g., application developers). Host  responds with a ROUTE_CONTROL message , which causes CSP to signal a call to SIP EP B using an available voice over IP (VoIP) channel.","CSP  responds to message  by issuing an INVITE message , which includes SIP EP A's SDP as data, to SIP EP B, which returns a 180 RINGING message . CSP  then acknowledges receipt of message  by returning a ROUTE_CONTROL_ACK message  to host , which responds with a PARK CHANNEL A message . CSP  then issues a 180 RINGING message  to SIP EP A and subsequently receives, from SIP EP B, a 200 OK message  which indicates that SIP EP B is available to accept the call initiated by SIP EP A. CSP  acknowledges receipt of message  by ACK message .","CSP  then issues a message  to host  which contains SIP EP B's SDP as data, thus providing the application with comparable information with respect to both SIP EP A and B. This is followed by CSP  issuing a CPE (answer) message  to host , which responds with a CONNECT with data message  instructing CSP  to process the call in accordance with the soft-switching model of . CSP  acknowledges receipt of message  with a message .","CSP  then issues a 200 OK message , which contains SIP EP B's SDP, to SIP EP A. At that point, a two-way RTP voice path  is established between SIP EP A and B. Subsequently, SIP EP A terminates the call resulting in a BYE message  passing to CSP . CSP  issues a BYE message  to SIP EP B, which responds with a 200 OK message . CSP  then issues a CPE message  to inform the application that the channel previously used for SIP EP B is released, followed by a 200 OK message  to SIP EP A and a CPE message  to release the other channel.","Turning now to , we shall discuss an example of a call processed in accordance with the soft-switching model of , but which includes an early media path setup. In the interest of brevity, messages shown in  and subsequent figures which also appear in  are not discussed again, but such messages should be understood to perform comparable, if not identical, functions in all instances. Here, SIP EP B issues a 183 SESSION PROGRESS message , containing SIP EP B's SDP, to CSP . In response, CSP  issues a message  to host  informing the application of SIP EP B's SDP. Subsequently, host  issues a message  instructing CSP  to create an early media path between SIP EP A and B. CSP  responds by issuing a 183 SESSION PROGRESS message  to SIP EP A. At this point in the call flow, even though there has not yet been an \u201canswer\u201d to the call initiated by SIP EP A, there is in fact a two-way RTP early voice path  established between SIP EP A and B. Thus, if SIP EP B now plays a recorded announcement, it will be heard by SIP EP A.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["102","2","2","104","4","2","106","108","110"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["116","2","114","2","112","2","116","112","114","116","112","118"]}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The invention description below refers to the accompanying drawings, of which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIGS. 2A and 2B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2B"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 6"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
