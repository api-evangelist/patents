No. 61\/668,680, filed Jul. 6, 2012.","The Renal Outer Medullary Potassium (ROMK) channel (Kir1.1) (see e.g., Ho, K., et al., -, Nature, 1993, 362(6415): p. 31-8.1, 2; and Shuck, M. E., et al., -, J Biol Chem, 1994, 269(39): p. 24261-70) is a member of the inward rectifier family of potassium channels expressed in two regions of the kidney: thick ascending loop of Henle (TALH) and cortical collecting duct (CCD) (see Hebert, S. C., et al., , Physiol Rev, 2005, 85(1): p. 319-713). At the TALH, ROMK participates in potassium recycling across the luminal membrane which is critical for the function of the Na\/K\/2Cl co-transporter, the rate-determining step for salt reuptake in this part of the nephron. At the CCD, ROMK provides a pathway for potassium secretion that is tightly coupled to sodium uptake through the amiloride-sensitive sodium channel (see Reinalter, S. C., et al., -, Acta Physiol Scand, 2004, 181(4): p. 513-21; and Wang, W., , Curr Opin Nephrol Hypertens, 2004, 13(5): p. 549-55). Selective inhibitors of the ROMK channel (also referred to herein as inhibitors of ROMK or ROMK inhibitors) are expected to represent novel diuretics for the treatment of hypertension and other conditions where treatment with a diuretic would be beneficial with potentially reduced liabilities (i.e., hypo- or hyperkalemia, new onset of diabetes, dyslipidemia) over the currently used clinical agents (see Lifton, R. P., A. G. Gharavi, and D. S. Geller, , Cell, 2001, 104(4): p. 545-56). Human genetics (Ji, W., et al., , Nat Genet, 2008, 40(5): p. 592-9; and Tobin, M. D., et al., , Hypertension, 2008, 51(6): p. 1658-64) and genetic ablation of ROMK in rodents (see Lorenz, J. N., et al., , J Biol Chem, 2002, 277(40): p. 37871-80 and Lu, M., et al., () () , J Biol Chem, 2002, 277(40): p. 37881-7) support these expectations. To our knowledge, the first small molecule selective inhibitors of ROMK, including VU590, were reported from work done at Vanderbilt University as described in Lewis, L. M., et al., --7.1, Mol Pharmacol, 2009, 76(5): p. 1094-1103. The compound VU591 was later reported in Bhave, G. et al., -1.1, Mol Pharmacol, 2011, 79(1), p. 42-50, the text of which states that \u201cROMK (Kir1.1), is a putative drug target for a novel class of loop diuretics that would lower blood pressure without causing hypokalemia.\u201d",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0005","num":"0003"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"69.68mm","wi":"71.97mm","file":"US09062070-20150623-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"However, continuing discovery of selective small molecule inhibitors of ROMK is still needed for the development of new treatments for hypertension and related disorders.

When bonds to the chiral carbon are depicted as straight lines in the structural Formulas of the invention, or when a compound name is recited without a chiral designation for a chiral carbon, it is understood that both the (R) and (S) configurations of the chiral carbon and hence both enantiomers and mixtures thereof, are embraced within the Formula or by the name. The production of specific stereoisomers or mixtures thereof may be identified in the Examples where such stereoisomers or mixtures were obtained, but this in no way limits the inclusion of all stereoisomers and mixtures thereof from being within the scope of this invention.","The invention includes all possible enantiomers and diastereomers and mixtures of two or more stereoisomers, for example mixtures of enantiomers and\/or diastereomers, in all ratios.

In the case of a cis\/trans isomerism the invention includes both the cis form and the trans form as well as mixtures of these forms in all ratios. The preparation of individual stereoisomers can be carried out, if desired, by separation of a mixture by customary methods, for example by chromatography or crystallization, by the use of stereochemically uniform starting materials for the synthesis or by stereoselective synthesis. Optionally a derivatization can be carried out before a separation of stereoisomers. The separation of a mixture of stereoisomers can be carried out at an intermediate step during the synthesis of a compound of Formula Ia or it can be done on a final racemic product.

The present invention is meant to include all suitable isotopic variations of the compounds of Formula Ia. For example, different isotopic forms of hydrogen (H) include protium (H) and deuterium (H). Protium is the predominant hydrogen isotope found in nature. Enriching for deuterium may afford certain therapeutic advantages, such as increasing in vivo half-life or reducing dosage requirements, or may provide a compound useful as a standard for characterization of biological samples. Isotopically-enriched compounds within Formula Ia can be prepared without undue experimentation by conventional techniques well known to those skilled in the art or by processes analogous to those described in the Schemes and Examples herein using appropriate isotopically-enriched reagents and\/or intermediates.","When the compounds of Formula Ia contain one or more acidic or basic groups the invention also includes the corresponding pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Thus, the compounds of Formula Ia which contain acidic groups can be used according to the invention, for example, as alkali metal salts, alkaline earth metal salts or as ammonium salts. Examples of such salts include but are not limited to sodium salts, potassium salts, calcium salts, magnesium salts or salts with ammonia or organic amines such as, for example, ethylamine, ethanolamine, triethanolamine or amino acids. Compounds of Formula Ia which contain one or more basic groups, i.e. groups which can be protonated, can be used according to the invention in the form of their acid addition salts with inorganic or organic acids as, for example but not limited to, salts with hydrogen chloride, hydrogen bromide, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, benzenesulfonic acid, methanesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, naphthalenedisulfonic acids, oxalic acid, acetic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, tartaric acid, lactic acid, salicylic acid, benzoic acid, formic acid, propionic acid, pivalic acid, diethylacetic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, pimelic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, malic acid, sulfaminic acid, phenylpropionic acid, gluconic acid, ascorbic acid, isonicotinic acid, citric acid, adipic acid, etc. If the compounds of Formula Ia simultaneously contain acidic and basic groups in the molecule the invention also includes, in addition to the salt forms mentioned, inner salts or betaines (zwitterions). Salts can be obtained from the compounds of Formula Ia by customary methods which are known to the person skilled in the art, for example by combination with an organic or inorganic acid or base in a solvent or dispersant, or by anion exchange or cation exchange from other salts. The present invention also includes all salts of the compounds of Formula Ia which, owing to low physiological compatibility, are not directly suitable for use in pharmaceuticals but which can be used, for example, as intermediates for chemical reactions or for the preparation of pharmaceutically acceptable salts.","Furthermore, compounds of the present invention may exist in amorphous form and\/or one or more crystalline forms, and as such all amorphous and crystalline forms and mixtures thereof of the compounds of Formula Ia are intended to be included within the scope of the present invention. In addition, some of the compounds of the instant invention may form solvates with water (i.e., a hydrate) or common organic solvents. Such solvates and hydrates, particularly the pharmaceutically acceptable solvates and hydrates, of the instant compounds are likewise encompassed within the scope of this invention, along with un-solvated and anhydrous forms.","Any pharmaceutically acceptable pro-drug modification of a compound of this invention which results in conversion in vivo to a compound within the scope of this invention is also within the scope of this invention. For example, esters can optionally be made by esterification of an available carboxylic acid group or by formation of an ester on an available hydroxy group in a compound. Similarly, labile amides can be made. Pharmaceutically acceptable esters or amides of the compounds of this invention may be prepared to act as pro-drugs which can be hydrolyzed back to an acid (or \u2014COO\u2014 depending on the pH of the fluid or tissue where conversion takes place) or hydroxy form particularly in vivo and as such are encompassed within the scope of this invention. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable pro-drug modifications include, but are not limited to, \u2014Calkyl esters and \u2014Calkyl substituted with phenyl esters.","Accordingly, the compounds within the generic structural formulas, embodiments and specific compounds described and claimed herein encompass salts, all possible stereoisomers and tautomers, physical forms (e.g., amorphous and crystalline forms), solvate and hydrate forms thereof and any combination of these forms, as well as the salts thereof, pro-drug forms thereof, and salts of pro-drug forms thereof, where such forms are possible unless specified otherwise.","The compounds of Formula Ia according to the invention are inhibitors of ROMK, and therefore could be used as diuretic and\/or natriuretic agents. ROMK inhibitors may be used to help to increase urination and increase urine volume and also to prevent or reduce reabsorption of sodium in the kidneys leading to increased excretion of sodium and water. Therefore, the compounds could be used for treatment or prophylaxis or both of disorders that benefit from increased excretion of water and sodium from the body. Accordingly, the compounds of this invention could be used in a method for inhibiting ROMK comprising administering a compound of Formula Ia in a ROMK-inhibitory effective amount to a patient in need thereof. The inhibition of ROMK by the compounds of Formula Ia can be examined, for example, in the Thallium Flux Assay and\/or Electrophysiology Assay described below. Moreover, this invention also relates to the use of the compounds of Formula Ia or salts thereof to validate in vitro assays, for example but not limited to the Thallium Flux and Electrophysiology Assays described herein.","The compounds of this invention could be used in a method for causing diuresis, natriuresis or both, comprising administering a compound of Formula Ia in a therapeutically effective amount to a patient in need thereof. Therefore, the compounds of Formula Ia of this invention could be used in methods for treatment of, prevention of or reduction of risk for developing medical conditions that benefit from increased excretion of water and sodium, such as but not limited to one or more of hypertension, heart failure (both acute and chronic, the latter also known as congestive heart failure) and\/or other conditions associated with excessive salt and water retention. Furthermore, the compounds of Formula Ia could be used in methods for treatment of, prevention of or reduction of risk for developing one or more disorders such as pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), cardiovascular disease, diabetes, endothelial dysfunction, diastolic dysfunction, stable and unstable angina pectoris, thromboses, restenosis, myocardial infarction, stroke, cardiac insufficiency, pulmonary hypertonia, atherosclerosis, hepatic cirrhosis, ascitis, pre-eclampsia, cerebral edema, nephropathy, nephrotic syndrome, acute and chronic kidney insufficiency (also referred to as chronic kidney disease, or more generally as renal impairment), hypercalcemia, Dent's disease, Meniere's disease, edematous states, and other conditions for which a diuretic or natriuretic or both would have therapeutic or prophylactic benefit. The compounds of the invention may be administered to a patient having, or at risk of having, one or more conditions for which a diuretic or natriuretic or both would have therapeutic or prophylactic benefit such as those described herein.","The compounds of Formula Ia may potentially have reduced liabilities (for example, hypo- or hyperkalemia, new onset of diabetes, dyslipidemia, etc.) over currently used clinical agents. Also the compounds may have reduced risk for diuretic tolerance, which can be a problem with long-term use of loop diuretics.","In general, compounds that are ROMK inhibitors can be identified as those compounds which, when tested, have an ICof 5 \u03bcM or less, preferably 1 \u03bcM or less, and more preferably 0.25 \u03bcM or less, in at least one of the following assays: 1) Thallium Flux Assay, 2) Electrophysiology Assay. These assays are described in more detail further below.","The dosage amount of the compound to be administered depends on the individual case and is, as is customary, to be adapted to the individual circumstances to achieve an optimum effect. Thus, it depends on the nature and the severity of the disorder to be treated, and also on the sex, age, weight and individual responsiveness of the human or animal to be treated, on the efficacy and duration of action of the compounds used, on whether the therapy is acute or chronic or prophylactic, or on whether other active compounds are administered in addition to compounds of Formula Ia. A consideration of these factors is well within the purview of the ordinarily skilled clinician for the purpose of determining the therapeutically effective or prophylactically effective dosage amount needed to prevent, counter, or arrest the progress of the condition. It is expected that the compound will be administered chronically on a daily basis for a length of time appropriate to treat or prevent the medical condition relevant to the patient, including a course of therapy lasting days, months, years or the life of the patient.","In general, a daily dose of approximately 0.001 to 100 mg\/kg, preferably 0.001 to 30 mg\/kg, in particular 0.001 to 10 mg\/kg (in each case mg per kg of bodyweight) is appropriate for administration to an adult weighing approximately 75 kg in order to obtain the desired results. The daily dose is preferably administered in a single dose or can be divided into several, for example two, three or four individual doses, and may be, for example but not limited to, 0.1 mg, 0.25 mg, 0.5 mg, 0.75 mg, 1 mg, 1.25 mg, 2 mg, 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg, 50 mg, 75 mg, 100 mg, 125 mg, 150 mg, 175 mg, 200 mg, etc., on a daily basis. In some cases, depending on the potency of the compound or the individual response, it may be necessary to deviate upwards or downwards from the given daily dose. Furthermore, the compound may be formulated for immediate or modified release such as extended or controlled release.","The term \u201cpatient\u201d includes animals, preferably mammals and especially humans, who use the instant active agents for the prohylaxis or treatment of a medical condition. Administering of the drug to the patient includes both self-administration and administration to the patient by another person. The patient may be in need of treatment for an existing disease or medical condition, or may desire prophylactic treatment to prevent or reduce the risk for developing said disease or medical condition or developing long-term complications from a disease or medical condition.","The term therapeutically effective amount is intended to mean that amount of a drug or pharmaceutical agent that will elicit the biological or medical response of a tissue, a system, animal or human that is being sought by a researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor or other clinician. A prophylactically effective amount is intended to mean that amount of a pharmaceutical drug that will prevent or reduce the risk of occurrence of the biological or medical event that is sought to be prevented in a tissue, a system, animal or human by a researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor or other clinician. The terms \u201cpreventing,\u201d \u201cprevention,\u201d \u201cprophylactic\u201d and derivatives of these terms as used herein refer to administering a compound to a patient before the onset of clinical symptoms of a condition not yet present in the patient. It is understood that a specific daily dosage amount can simultaneously be both a therapeutically effective amount, e.g., for treatment of hypertension, and a prophylactically effective amount, e.g., for prevention or reduction of risk of myocardial infarction or prevention or reduction of risk for complications related to hypertension.","In the methods of treatment of this invention, the ROMK inhibitors may be administered via any suitable route of administration such as, for example, orally, parenterally, or rectally in dosage unit formulations containing conventional non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, adjuvants and vehicles. The term parenteral as used herein includes subcutaneous injections, intravenous (IV), intramuscular, intrasternal injection or infusion techniques. Oral formulations are preferred for treatment of chronic indications such as hypertension or chronic heart failure, particularly solid oral dosage units such as pills, tablets or capsules, and more particularly tablets. IV dosing is preferred for acute treatment, for example for the treatment of acute heart failure.","This invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions comprised of a compound of Formula Ia and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier which is comprised of one or more excipients or additives. An excipient or additive is an inert substance used to formulate the active drug ingredient. For oral use, the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention containing the active ingredient may be in forms such as pills, tablets, troches, lozenges, aqueous or oily suspensions, dispersible powders or granules, emulsions, hard or soft capsules, or syrups or elixirs. Compositions intended for oral use may be prepared according to any method known to the art for the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions. Tablets contain the active ingredient in admixture with non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable excipients which are suitable for the manufacture of tablets. The excipients may be for example, inert diluents, such as calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate, lactose, mannitol, calcium phosphate or sodium phosphate; granulating and disintegrating agents, for example, corn starch, or alginic acid; binding agents, for example starch, gelatin or acacia, and lubricating agents, for example, magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc.","Pharmaceutical compositions may also contain other customary additives, for example but not limited to, wetting agents, stabilizers, emulsifiers, dispersants, preservatives, sweeteners, colorants, flavorings, aromatizers, thickeners, buffer substances, solvents, solubilizers, agents for achieving a depot effect, salts for altering the osmotic pressure, coating agents or antioxidants.","Oral immediate-release and time-controlled release dosage forms may be employed, as well as enterically coated oral dosage forms. Tablets may be uncoated or they may be coated by known techniques for aesthetic purposes, to mask taste or for other reasons. Coatings can also be used to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example, a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate may be employed.","Formulations for oral use may also be presented as hard gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent, for example, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate or kaolin, or as soft gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredients is mixed with water or miscible solvents such as propylene glycol, PEGs and ethanol, or an oil medium, for example peanut oil, liquid paraffin, or olive oil.","Aqueous suspensions contain the active material in admixture with excipients suitable for the manufacture of aqueous suspensions. Oily suspensions may be formulated by suspending the active ingredient in a vegetable oil, for example arachis oil, olive oil, sesame oil or coconut oil, or in mineral oil such as liquid paraffin. The oily suspensions may contain a thickening agent, for example beeswax, hard paraffin or cetyl alcohol. Sweetening agents and flavoring agents may be added to provide a palatable oral preparation. These compositions may be preserved by the addition of an anti-oxidant such as ascorbic acid. Syrups and elixirs may be formulated with sweetening agents, for example glycerol, propylene glycol, sorbitol or sucrose.","The instant invention also encompasses a process for preparing a pharmaceutical composition comprising combining a compound of Formula Ia with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Also encompassed is the pharmaceutical composition which is made by combining a compound of Formula Ia with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Furthermore, a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of this invention can be used for the preparation of a medicament useful for inhibiting ROMK, for causing diuresis and\/or natriuresis, and\/or for treating, preventing or reducing the risk for any of the medical conditions described herein, in dosage amounts described herein.","The amount of active compound of Formula Ia and\/or its pharmaceutically acceptable salts in the pharmaceutical composition may be, for example but not limited to, from 0.1 to 200 mg, particularly from 0.1 to 100 mg, and more particularly from 0.1 to 50 mg, per dose on a free acid\/free base weight basis, but depending on the type of the pharmaceutical composition, potency of the active ingredient and\/or the medical condition being treated, it could also be lower or higher. Pharmaceutical compositions usually comprise 0.5 to 90 percent by weight of the active compound on a free acid\/free base weight basis.","The compounds of Formula Ia inhibit ROMK. On account of this property, apart from use as pharmaceutically active compounds in human medicine and veterinary medicine, they can also be employed as a scientific tool or as aid for biochemical investigations in which such an effect on ROMK is intended, and also for diagnostic purposes, for example in the in vitro diagnosis of cell samples or tissue samples. The compounds of Formula Ia can also be employed as intermediates for the preparation of other pharmaceutically active compounds.","One or more additional pharmacologically active agents may be administered in combination with a compound of Formula Ia. The additional active agent (or agents) is intended to mean a compound that is different from the compound of Formula Ia, and which is a pharmaceutically active agent (or agents) that is active in the body, including pro-drugs that convert to pharmaceutically active form after administration, and also includes free-acid, free-base and pharmaceutically acceptable salts of said additional active agents when such forms are sold commercially or are otherwise chemically possible. Generally, any suitable additional active agent or agents, including but not limited to anti-hypertensive agents, additional diuretics, anti-atherosclerotic agents such as a lipid modifying compound, anti-diabetic agents and\/or anti-obesity agents may be used in any combination with the compound of Formula Ia in a single dosage formulation (a fixed dose drug combination), or may be administered to the patient in one or more separate dosage formulations which allows for concurrent or sequential administration of the active agents (co-administration of the separate active agents). Examples of additional active agents which may be employed include but are not limited to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (e.g, alacepril, benazepril, captopril, ceronapril, cilazapril, delapril, enalapril, enalaprilat, fosinopril, imidapril, lisinopril, moveltipril, perindopril, quinapril, ramipril, spirapril, temocapril, or trandolapril); angiotensin II receptor antagonists also known as angiotensin receptor blockers or ARBs (e.g., losartan i.e., COZAAR\u00ae, valsartan, candesartan, olmesartan, telmesartan, eprosartan, irbesartan and any of these drugs used in combination with hydrochlorothiazide such as HYZAAR\u00ae); diuretics, e.g. hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ); potassium sparing diuretics such as amiloride HCl, spironolactone, epleranone, triamterene, each with or without HCTZ; neutral endopeptidase inhibitors (e.g., thiorphan and phosphoramidon); aldosterone antagonists; aldosterone synthase inhibitors; renin inhibitors (e.g. urea derivatives of di- and tri-peptides (See U.S. Pat.

Some frequently applied routes to the compounds of Formula Ia are also described by the Schemes as follows. In some cases the order of carrying out the steps of reaction schemes may be varied to facilitate the reaction or to avoid unwanted reaction products.","Compounds of this invention may be prepared as shown in Scheme 1 by coupling of appropriately substituted piperazines 1 with carboxylic acids of the structure 2 to form amides.

For example, when the protective group is Boc as shown in Scheme 2, removal can be achieved by treatment with an acid such as TFA or HCl to afford piperazines 1A. Alternatively, compounds 6 can be separated by means of silica chromatography or preparative high pressure liquid chromatography employing a chiral column to afford the separated cis 6 (cis) and trans 6 (trans) isomers. The protective group of the pure cis and trans isomers can be removed by treatment with an acid such as TFA or HCl, in the case of a Boc group, to afford piperazines 1A as pure cis and trans isomers 1A (cis) and 1A (trans).

The resulting hemiketals 8 can be converted directly to piperazines 1A by reduction using, for example, triethylsilane in the presence of an acid catalyst such as trifluoroacetic acid. If separation of the cis and trans isomers is desired, a protective group such as Boc may be installed using, for example, BocO, to give intermediates 6 which can be separated into cis and trans isomers as described in Scheme 2.

After centrifugation, the cell pellet was resuspended in approximately 4.0 mL of bath solution and placed in the IonWorks instrument. The intracellular solution consisted of (in mM): 80 K gluconate, 40 KCl, 20 KF, 3.2 MgCl, 3 EGTA, 5 Hepes, pH 7.4. Electrical access to the cytoplasm was achieved by perforation in 0.13 mg\/mL amphotericin B for 4 min. Amphotericin B (Sigma A-4888) was prepared as a 40 mg\/mL solution in DMSO. Voltage protocols and current recordings were performed using the IonWorks HT software\/hardware system. Currents were sampled at 1 kHz. No correction for liquid junction potentials was used. The test pulse, consisting of a 100 ms step to 0 mV from a holding potential of \u221270 mV, followed by a 100 ms voltage ramp from \u221270 mV to +70 mV, was applied before and after a 6 min compound incubation period. Test compounds were prepared by diluting DMSO stock solutions into the bath solution at 3\u00d7 the final concentration and placed in the instrument in 96-well polypropylene plates. Current amplitudes were measured using the IonWorks software.

spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) exhibits age-dependent hypertension that does not require administration of exogenous agents to elevate blood pressure nor does it require the use of a high salt diet to elevate blood pressure. Thus it resembles human essential hypertension and provides an opportunity to assess the dose-dependence of novel agents for their ability to lower blood pressure.","Experimental protocols for evaluating blood pressure lowering efficacy of compounds of the present invention in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR):","Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR, male, 6 months, Charles River) were implanted with DSI TA11PA-C40 telemetry device (Data Sciences, Inc., St. Paul, Minn.) under isoflurane or ketamine\/metomidine anesthesia. The telemetry unit catheter was inserted into the descending aorta via the femoral artery and the telemetry device was implanted subcutaneously in the left flank area. Animals were allowed to recover from surgery for 14 days before the start of any studies. Blood pressure, heart rate, and activity signals from conscious, freely moving rats were recorded continuously for 30 seconds every 10 minutes. HCTZ (25 mg\/kg\/day, PO) was included as a reference diuretic at a dose giving approximately maximal efficacy in SHR. The blood pressure lowering efficacy of compounds of the present invention compared to vehicle control was evaluated following a single oral gavage each day for a typical duration of three to fourteen days. Data were collected as hourly averages, and changes in blood pressure were calculated by subtracting vehicle control baseline data on an hourly basis. Example numbers, 1A, 1G, 2A, 2H, 17A, 21, 34, 35, 40, 96A, 97 were evaluated at PO, QD doses of either 3 mg\/kg or 10 mg\/kg and resulted in typical reductions in daily (24 h) mean systolic blood pressure ranging from 7 mmHg to 21 mmHg by the last day of the studies.","The Spontaneously Hypertensive Rat Assay described is well known and often used in the art as an experimental model simulating human hypertension (see, e.g., Lerman, L. O., et al., 2005; 146:160-173).","While the invention has been described with reference to certain particular embodiments thereof, numerous alternative embodiments will be apparent to those skilled in the art from the teachings described herein.
