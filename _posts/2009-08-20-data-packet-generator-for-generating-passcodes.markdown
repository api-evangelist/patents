No. 61\/138,295 filed on Dec. 17, 2008, entitled PASSCODE GENERATOR AND AUTHENTICATION PROCESS; and to U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61\/105,202 filed on Oct. 14, 2008, entitled PASSCODE GENERATOR AND AUTHENTICATION PROCESS; and to U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61\/090,461 filed on Aug. 20, 2008, entitled PASSCODE GENERATOR AND AUTHENTICATION PROCESS, the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entireties.","This application relates to an electronic device that generates a data packet, and more particularly to a data packet generator that generates unique codes periodically and associated systems and methods.","The two greatest expenses for most companies are human resources and real estate. Human resources involves the employment of a skilled workforce and includes related expenses such as salaries, retirement contributions, health care contributions, and the like. Real estate involves the buildings and other facilities in which those employees work, and includes expenses such as rent, utilities, and property taxes. In addition to these aspects of a company, information technology is a third aspect that is becoming more critical to most companies. Information technology includes the management of technology resources such as computers, telephones, and other electronic devices. In today's world, information technology is crucial to most businesses.","Traditionally, each of these aspects of a company has been able to work somewhat autonomously. Human resources and real estate needs did not change rapidly, and as needs changed, there was adequate time to consider the options and make decisions. Information technology was traditionally not a crucial part of most business.","Today's business environment is changing. Rapid changes are becoming the norm. Employees are increasingly mobile, with current technology allowing them to perform their work anywhere. The office is becoming a thing of the past as employees are increasingly working from temporary work stations, their homes, their cars, or out in the field. Enormous effort is required for the real estate department or other decision makers to understand the company's needs at any given time. Similarly, as employees move, the information technology department is challenged to allocate and distribute technology resources where they are needed. If the technology is not available when needed, employee productivity and efficiency suffers. Needs change from one day to another; but companies lack adequate tools to help them track, understand, and respond to these ever changing needs.","In general terms, this disclosure is directed to a data packet generator. In one possible configuration and by non-limiting example, the data packet generator is a semi-transient electronic device that generates a data packet. In some embodiments the data packet includes at least one passcode that changes periodically.","One aspect is a data packet generator comprising: a processing device; memory storing data instructions, which when executed by the processor cause the processor to periodically generate a passcode, the passcode including a plurality of characters; an output device that outputs a data packet including a passcode; and an attachment device configured for semi-permanent attachment to an object.","Another aspect is a method of determining a location, the method comprising: receiving at a computing device a data packet from a data packet generator, the data packet including at least one passcode; determining with the computing device a location associated with the passcode; and identifying with the computing device the location in a computer-aided design drawing.","Yet another aspect is a method of communicating a passcode, the method comprising: generating with a data packet generator a passcode, the data packet generator including a processor device, memory, and a wireless communication device; and communicating using the wireless communication device a service set identifier, the service set identifier including the passcode.","A further aspect is a method of authenticating, the method comprising: receiving with a computing device a passcode generated at a first time by a data packet generator of a plurality of data packet generators; determining with the computing device whether the passcode is a valid passcode; determining with the computing device whether the passcode should have been generated by any of the plurality of data packet generators at the first time; and authenticating with the computing device the passcode if the passcode is a valid passcode and if the passcode should have been generated by any of the plurality of data packet generators at the first time.","Various embodiments will be described in detail with reference to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals represent like parts and assemblies throughout the several views. Reference to various embodiments does not limit the scope of the claims attached hereto. Additionally, any examples set forth in this specification are not intended to be limiting and merely set forth some of the many possible embodiments for the appended claims.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0067","num":"0066"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","100","102","104","106","108","120","122","130","132","122","132","124","134"]},"Workstations  and  are physical locations that are known by server . Often workstations  and  are physical locations where people work, such as an office, a cubicle, a conference room, a reception desk, or a security booth. Other embodiments include other physical locations, such as a particular location of a room or building, or a particular physical location in the outdoors, such as the physical location near a tree, park bench, or lake, or a particular location as identified by a global positioning system coordinate, or a latitude and longitude coordinate. In some embodiments, a workstation is any physical location where a data packet generator is located. As just one example, workstations  and  are sometimes referred to herein as being a physical location within a building, such as an office, desk, room, or cubicle.","Within workstations  and  are computing devices  and , respectively. An example of a computing device  or  is a personal computer. Other examples of computing devices include a handheld computer, a server, a mobile device, a cell phone, a smart phone, a personal digital assistant, or any device having a processing device, memory, and a communication system suitable for data communication across network . An example computing device  is described in more detail with reference to .","In some embodiments, Data packet generators  and  are devices that generate a data packet, such as passcodes  and . Data packet generators  and  are alternatively referred to as code generators in some embodiments, such as when a data packet includes a passcode. Such codes generated by data packet generators  and  are typically formed of a quantity of characters. The quantity of characters is typically in a range from 1 to 25, and preferably in a range from 5 to 10 characters. For example, in some embodiments the passcode includes 7 characters. In general, a larger quantity of characters results in a larger quantity of unique passcode combinations that are available. On the other hand, long passcodes are sometimes less desirable, such as when a passcode is to be entered manually. In some embodiments a single character of a passcode is provided at a time, with subsequent digits being provided one-by-one (or two-by-two, etc.) until a single data packet generator has been uniquely identified.","The characters from which the passcodes  and  are composed are typically selected from alphanumeric characters so that they are easily recognizable to a user, although other characters are used in other embodiments. For example, in the English language the alphabet includes 26 letters (A through Z) and 10 numbers (0 through 9). Thus, some embodiments include 36 possible characters made up of the combination of 26 letters and 10 numbers, sometimes referred to as base 36. In some embodiments the letters I, O, and Q and the numbers 0 and 1 are not used because of the similarities in the letters and numbers. This reduces the chance that a user will misidentify a character of the passcode. Thus, some embodiments include 31 possible characters composed of 23 letters and 8 numbers, sometimes referred to as base 31. In yet other embodiments, only numbers are used. Thus, some embodiments include 10 characters, sometimes referred to as base 10. Other embodiments include other alphanumeric characters, such as those of other languages, or other character systems (e.g., Braille).","In some embodiments, data packet generator  and  output more than one passcode at a given time. For example, some data packet generators display a previous passcode, a current passcode, and a next passcode. Other embodiments generate two or more passcodes at any given time. In some embodiments all passcodes are valid while being output by a data packet generator. This is useful, for example, if multiple passcodes are needed, such as for method  (described below with reference to ).","In some embodiments, data packet generators  and  generate one or more passcodes that are used to communicate a unique identifier for subsequent authentication. The identifier itself takes up no space (because numbers and time require no space in and of themselves). The only space that is consumed is that of the data packet generator, which acts to generate and output the identifier. When the data packet generator is implemented by software (as some embodiments are) the space utilization of the system approaches zero, absent the space consumed by the devices that are implementing the data packet generator and performing processing and communication steps involving the data packet generator and\/or passcode.","Communication network  is a data communication network that facilitates data communication between computing device  or  and server , and\/or between data packet generators  or  and server . An example of network  is the Internet. Other examples of network  include an intranet, extranet, local-area network (LAN), wireless network (such as conforming to the 802.11 protocols), cellular network, telephone network, and other known data communication networks. In some embodiments two or more communication networks are used.","Server  is a computing device that stores data associated with data packet generators  and , and in some embodiments operates to validate passcodes generated by data packet generators  and . Server  is also configured to communicate with computing devices  and  across network . Although server  is illustrated as a single device, in some embodiments server  includes multiple servers , such as a computer cluster.","Server  typically includes a database. In some embodiments, the database contains data relating to data packet generators  and , such as the location of the data packet generators  and , as well as passcode information that permits sever  to determine what passcode will be generated by the respective data packet generator  or  at a particular time. As discussed herein, the passcode information includes in some embodiments a table of all passcodes for each data packet generator, while in other embodiments the passcode information includes a mathematical formula and seed information necessary to compute the passcodes.","Some embodiments include more than one server . For example, one alternative embodiment includes two servers. The first server is a local server operated by a single company or location, and the other server is a remote server that may be overseeing multiple companies or locations. The remote server is configured to recognize passcodes for some or all data packet generators in a particular company or location. In some embodiments, the remote server provides seed information allowing the local server to perform at least some of the functions of the remote server for a period of time. In some of these embodiments, the remote server communicates relevant passcode information to the local server, which then operates to validate passcodes from data packet generators over a period of time. In some embodiments, the remote server provides only a limited number of passcodes to allow the local server to operate for a limited period of time (e.g., 90 days) without renewing with the remote server. After the period of time has elapsed (or shortly before), the local server receives another set of passcodes from the remote server to continue operation. Other embodiments include more than two servers. In further embodiments, multiple servers are used to distribute workload or for redundancy.","One possible example of a local server is a jumpnode server, such as distributed by Jumpnode Systems LLC located in Minneapolis, Minn., US, that allows data to be shared outside of the local area network, such as with a remote server. In this example, the jumpnode server permits communication to the remote server, but can be configured to prohibit communication into the local area network. In some embodiments, the jumpnode server sends communications including data packets or data from data packet generators to a remote server or other computing device.","In some embodiments system  operates as a location authentication system to authenticate the location of a user, computing device, or other device. An example authentication process will now be described with reference to . In this example, system  operates to determine whether a user is working at workstation , or if the user is at workstation , or whether the user may not be at either workstation  or workstation . As an example, assume a user is working at workstation  and is using computing device .","An example authentication process begins with data packet generator  displaying passcode  and data packet generator  displaying passcode . The user at workstation  is prompted by computing device  to enter a passcode. Since the user is located in workstation , passcode  is visible to the user on the display of the data packet generator . As a result, the user reads passcode  and enters passcode  into computing device .","Computing device  receives the passcode, and transmits the passcode across network  to server . Server  receives the passcode. Server  then determines whether passcode  should have been displayed by any data packet generator  or , and if so, which data packet generator it was displayed by. In this case, server  identifies the passcode as being associated with workstation . In this way, the location of the user is authenticated as being at workstation .","In another possible embodiment, computing device  and\/or server  operate to monitor a transition of a passcode from a first passcode to a next passcode. Validation occurs only if the transition occurs between two valid passcodes at an expected time. For example, computing device  is programmed to monitor the transition to confirm that a valid transition occurs at the expected time. Alternatively, computing device  is programmed to monitor a transition and to report the passcode to server  within a predetermined period of time, such as within one to five seconds. Other embodiments allow more or less time (e.g., milliseconds or tens of seconds). Such validation can be used to reduce or prevent the chance that a person or device would transferring a code from a data packet generator to a remote location and then falsely report that code as an identification of the present location. Such validation processes that monitor a passcode transition can be referred to as changing-of-the-guards validation processes. Further, some embodiments monitor and validate only if multiple passcode transitions occur at the expected times.","In some embodiments, authentication system  operates as a location authentication system. The location authentication system  operates to authenticate a location of a user or device. For example, in large companies employees are frequently moved between various office spaces. It is sometimes desirable to identify the location of a particular employee, such as to know what workstation that the employee is currently working at. To do so, a login screen is presented to the employee on computing device  each time that the employee logs into the computer system and\/or periodically while the employee continues to access the network. In some embodiments, the login screen requests the username and password (e.g., see user interface , shown in ). The login screen also requests that the employee enter the passcode shown on the data packet generator associated with the workstation (e.g., workstation ). The username and password are typically used to authenticate who the employee is, and the passcode is used to identify where the employee is. Once the location of the employee is known, the location data may be stored for subsequent use. For example, an employee directory is updated to accurately reflect the location of the employee. Some embodiments request one or more of the username, password, and passcode. In some embodiments the username is not required; such as if it was previously saved or is otherwise already known by the computer system or server.","As another exemplary embodiment, authentication system  is used in some embodiments to control access to protected resources based upon the location of the user. For example, a problem with wireless networks is that the signal from a wireless router often extends beyond the physical borders of a building. Authentication system  is used in some embodiments to require that only those present within the building are granted access to the wireless network or to particular protected resources. This is accomplished, for example, by requiring a user to enter a passcode from a data packet generator as part of a network login process or to retain network access that has previously been granted. The passcode is then evaluated either to identify the data packet generator that generated the passcode or deny the access request. Once the data packet generator becomes known, the location of the corresponding user is identified. If the location of the user is determined to be within the boundaries of the building (or satisfies other criteria, such as on a particular floor, in a particular group\u2014e.g., the accounting department, etc.), the user is permitted to access the wireless network or protected resource. In some embodiments, authentication system  requires a user to be at a particular workstation (rather than merely within a group of workstations) in order to access the network or particular protected resources on the network. Some embodiments are used to control access to a wireless network within a home or residence. These examples are provided as just some of the many possible embodiments. Many other embodiments are discussed below.","An example of a wireless access point of a wireless network is shown in , herein.","Examples of protected resources include data stored on a computing device and functions performed by a computing device. In some embodiments, protected resources are local to a data packet generator, local to a computing device, or remote, such as operating on a server. In some embodiments protected resources are provided by an application service provider. Protected resources are sometimes part of a Software as a Service (SaaS) application, or an application commonly referred to as a cloud computing. Other examples of protected resources include room or building control systems, such as room electricity, lighting, a room scheduling system, and voice\/data access.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0087","num":"0086"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["102","120","122","102","202","204","102","102","206","102"]},"Some embodiments of workstation  include walls  that define the outer boundary of the workstation. Workstation  also typically includes a desktop  that provides a solid work surface. In some embodiments desktop  is connected to and supported by walls . In other embodiments, desktop  is a desk that is not connected to walls  but is within the outer boundary defined by walls . At least part of computing device  (e.g., a display) is typically supported by desktop .","In this example, data packet generator  is attached or associated with workstation . The attachment is permanent in some embodiments, while it is somewhat permanent in other embodiments. For example, data packet generator  is attached to desktop  in some embodiments in a manner that would require disassembly of the desk or that would require specialized tools in order to disassociate the data packet generator from desktop . In other embodiments, data packet generator  is attached to walls . In other embodiments, data packet generator  is attached to another part of workstation  other than desktop  or walls  (e.g., another structure within workstation ). In other embodiments, data packet generator  is attached to something near workstation  (e.g., a floor, a ceiling, an architectural wall). Some specific examples are shown herein, such as in . In yet other embodiments, data packet generator  is contained by or integrated with a component of workstation  (e.g., a tile or the worksurface).","As shown in , data packet generator  is preferably located near to computing device , so that a user in workstation  that is using computing device  can easily identify a passcode generated by data packet generator .","In some embodiments, two or more data packet generators are associated with each location. This provides redundancy, for example, if a data packet generator were to malfunction. Alternatively, a second or additional data packet generator may be used if a code generated by a first data packet generator is not unique at that time (such as for use in method  described with reference to ). In such an event, the second data packet generator is used to provide a second passcode to uniquely identify the location or data packet generators.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0092","num":"0091"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["122","122","302","304","306","308","310","312","314","304","320","322"]},"Housing  is a protective enclosure of data packet generator . In some embodiments housing  is a metal enclosure, but in other embodiments housing  is made of other materials such as plastic. Housing  is sealed in some embodiments, such as to be water resistant or water proof. Further, some embodiments of housing  are designed with seals that are tamper resistant. In some embodiments temper-evident seals are provided across housing joints. An example of a tamper-evident seal is a label adhered with an adhesive across a housing joint. If the joint is opened, the label will tear. A warning against opening housing  is printed on the tamper-evident seal in some embodiments. In this way the label acts to reveal if someone has attempted to open housing .","Microprocessor  is a processing device that is typically enclosed within housing . Examples of a suitable microprocessor include a central processing unit (\u201cCPU\u201d), microcontroller, programmable logic device, field programmable gate array, digital signal processing (\u201cDSP\u201d) device, and other types of microprocessors. Microprocessor  may be of any general variety such as reduced instruction set computing (RISC) device, complex instruction set computing device (\u201cCISC\u201d), or specially designed processing device such as an application-specific integrated circuit (\u201cASIC\u201d) device.","In some embodiments microprocessor  includes timer  and memory . In other embodiments, timer  and memory  may be separate from, or in addition to microprocessor . Timer  is used by microprocessor  to measure the passage of time. For example, in some embodiments a new passcode is generated by data packet generator  periodically. Timer  is used to measure the period of time. After the period of time has elapsed, a new passcode is generated and output using output device . The period of time is typically in a range from about 1 second to about 5 minutes, and preferably from about 30 seconds to about 2 minutes when manual passcode entry is involved. In some embodiments the period of time is short to provide rapid passcode changes, such as eight passcode changes per second. Rapid passcode changes are more typically used when the output is not dependent on manual entry of the passcode. In other embodiments, the period of time is long to provide infrequent passcode changes, such as in a range from about 24 hours to about three months.","Memory  is used by microprocessor to store data. For example, a passcode is stored in memory  in some embodiments. In other embodiments, memory  stores a formula that is used to generate a passcode. Memory  also stores an identifier (such as a serial number) of data packet generator  in some embodiments. Software or other program code may also be stored in memory  in some embodiments that define logical operations of data packet generator .","Data packet generator  typically includes power source  within housing . Power source  supplies power to the electronic devices of data packet generator , such as microprocessor , output device , input device , and in some embodiments tamper sensor . An example of power source  is a battery. In other embodiments, power source  is a power supply circuit that receives power from a source external to housing , such as a wall outlet. In other embodiments, power source  is a power jack or terminal that is connected to housing  and is configured to receive power from an external source, such as from a power adapter. When power source  is a battery, it is sometimes helpful to have a secondary power source in place (another battery) so that changing the primary battery does not cause a loss of electric energy to the data packet generator . In some embodiments power is received from an Ethernet cable, such as from a Power over Ethernet (PoE) system.","Output device  generates one or more outputs. One of the outputs is typically passcode  (shown in ). Examples of output device  include a visual display device, and audible output device, a vibratory or sensory output device, a wireless signal output device (e.g., wireless communication device , shown in ), a wired signal output device (e.g., a network interface , shown in ), and other output devices. Examples of visual display devices include a light-emitting diode (LED) display, a liquid crystal display (LCD), a cathode ray tube (CRT), a vacuum fluorescent display (VFD), a sheet of electronic paper, and other display devices. In some embodiments, visual display devices include a backlight to assist a user in viewing the visual display device in poorly lit environments. Examples of audible output devices include a speaker, headset, buzzer, alarm, and other output devices. In some embodiments, an audible output device provides an alert to a user. In other embodiments, an audible output device provides information (such as a passcode) sufficient for use by a user that is vision impaired. Examples of vibratory or sensory output devices include a vibrator and a Braille terminal. In some embodiments, output device  is or includes a data communication device. The data communication device is used by data packet generator  to communicate with another device, such as computing device , server , another device connected to network , or another device. Examples of data communication devices include a network communication device, a wireless communication device (e.g., wireless communication device , shown in ), a modem, a cellular communication device, a radio-frequency transmitter, or other communication devices. In some embodiments a radio frequency identification (RFID) tag acts as a communication device (e.g., to communicate the serial number of the data packet generator). In some embodiments, data packet generator  includes two or more output devices .","In some embodiments, output device  is a visual display device, such as an LCD. Data packet generator  operates, in some embodiments, to generate a passcode  using microprocessor . The passcode  is then displayed by output device . After a period of time, the passcode  is typically changed to a new passcode . The new passcode  is then displayed by output device  instead of the previous passcode.","Other output devices  are used for other purposes in some embodiments, such as to provide audible feedback when an input device  is activated (e.g., generate a sound when a button is pressed), or to provide an alarm if tampering is detected by tamper sensor .","Input devices  operate to receive one or more inputs. Some embodiments of data packet generator  do not include an input device  because no input is required. Other embodiments of data packet generator  do include one or more input devices . Examples of input devices include a button, a switch, a microphone, a mouse, a keyboard, a keypad, a magnetic sensor, a radio-frequency receiver, and other input devices. Some output devices  also operate as an input device . Examples of devices that act as both input and output devices include a touch screen display and at least some data communication devices such as a USB port.","An example of a use for input device  is as a power saving feature. For example, in some embodiments input device  is a depressable button arranged on a face of data packet generator . When input device  is pressed, the current passcode (e.g., , shown in ) is displayed for a period of time by output device . The rest of the time, output device  is powered off, or in a lower power state. As a result, considerable energy savings is realized.","Another example of a use for input device  is for syncing data packet generator  with another device, such as server  (shown in ). In some embodiments it is desirable to have timer  synced with a timer of server . To do so, input device  may include a data communication device, such as to communicate with server  across network . One or more messages may be sent between data packet generator  and server  to ensure that data packet generator  and server  are in sync. Some embodiments do not require synchronizing between data packet generator  and server . Other embodiments require only a single syncing operation during manufacturing or initial setup, and do not require further syncing thereafter.","In an alternative embodiment, input device  is a data communication port through which it is connected with computing device . The data communication port allows computing device  to communicate directly with data packet generator . If desired, server  is also configured to communicate with data packet generator  through computing device  in some embodiments.","In some embodiments, data packet generators  and  communicate directly with server  across communication network  or another communication network. For example, as discussed in more detail herein, some embodiments of data packet generators  and  are directly connected to the network , such as through an Ethernet cable. Other embodiments include a wireless communication system, and are configured to utilize a wireless access point to communicate across network .","Some embodiments of data packet generator  include a tamper sensor . An example of tamper sensor  is a motion sensor, such as an accelerometer. If the motion sensor detects motion, data packet generator  may be programmed to take appropriate action. For example, data packet generator  may sound an alarm. The alarm may be an audible or visible warning that movement has been detected. The alarm may alternatively be a message sent across a communication network (e.g. network ). For example, a message may be sent to server  or elsewhere, such as to a security booth. In other embodiments, data packet generator acts to generate a code or series of codes that indicate to the server  that tampering has occurred.","In some embodiments tamper sensor  includes a Global Positioning System or other location identifier. In such cases, the tamper sensor  can be used as part of a larger system capable of monitoring the location of the data packet generator , and to identify movement of the data packet generator.","Data packet generator  typically includes attachment device  that is configured for connecting housing  with another structure. One example of an attachment device  is a fastener. Fasteners include screws, nails, adhesive, rivets, bolts and nuts, and a wide variety of other known fasteners. In some embodiments, fasteners are used that are not easily removable. For example, in some embodiments screws include one-way heads that are designed to be easily inserted but resist removal. In other embodiments, screws include less common head configurations (as opposed to the most common slotted and Phillips configurations) or non-standard shapes or sizes. Examples of less common head configurations include Torx and Robertson head configurations. In addition to (or in place of) fasteners, some embodiments of attachment device  include brackets, pins, keyed slots or protrusions, or other features to aid in attaching housing  with another structure. In some embodiments the housing  is itself detachable from the attachment device  and interchangeable with other attachment devices . For example, it may be desirable for data packet generator  to be compatible with various worksurface thicknesses. An appropriately sized attachment device may then be selected from various differently sized attachment devices to find an attachment device that most closely matches the thickness of the worksurface. Similarly, different shaped attachment devices are used in some embodiments.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0109","num":"0108"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["122","122","302","308","314","302","402","314","410","412","414","416"]},"In this embodiment, output device  is a digital display, such as an LCD display.

Attachment device  is provided for this purpose, which includes angle bracket . Angle bracket  includes a rear portion  that extends downward from housing . Rear portion  typically extends slightly further than the thickness of desktop . Bottom portion  is connected to rear portion  at a joint or bend. Bottom portion  is configured to be placed against a bottom surface of a desktop, and includes fastener holes  in some embodiments.","To connect data packet generator  to a desktop , angle bracket  is arranged so that bottom portion  is against and generally parallel with a bottom surface of the desktop . In addition, rear portion  is arranged so that it is behind a rear side of the desktop . When in this position, data packet generator  is arranged above a top surface of the desktop , such as shown in .

In this embodiment data packet generator  does not include an angle bracket (e.g., angle bracket  shown in ). Rather, data packet generator  is configured for insertion into recessed region  of desktop . Recessed region  has an outer periphery that is slightly larger than the outer periphery of housing  and typically has a depth about equal to the thickness of data packet generator .","An adhesive patch  is applied, in some embodiments, to a bottom surface of data packet generator .

Output device  operates to display a passcode periodically on the display so that it is visible to a user. In some embodiments, output device  is removable from housing . For example, output device  is connected via a wire so that output device  may be moved to a more convenient location away from housing .

In some embodiments, a set of passcodes is received, such as from a server. The set of passcodes may include any number of passcodes. The number of passcodes is typically in a range from about 30 passcodes to about 6 million passcodes or more. If, for example, the passcode were to change once per minute, about 5.25 million passcodes would allow a data packet generator to continue operating for a period of about ten years. The set of passcodes is typically stored into memory. By receiving passcodes from the server, the data packet generator and the server are now in possession of the same set of passcodes. In some embodiments, operation  is performed during manufacturing of the data packet generator. In other embodiments, communication occurs across a communication network after manufacturing.","Operation  is next performed to synchronize the data packet generator with the server. In some embodiments, synchronization involves setting a clock of the data packet generator to match the server's clock. In other embodiments, synchronization involves identifying a start time in which to begin displaying passcodes. Further, in some embodiments, synchronization also includes identifying one of the passcodes of the set of passcodes as a current passcode. For example, the server may operate in some embodiments to maintain all data packet generators in sync. Thus, when a new data packet generator is synced, the server informs the new data packet generator of which code of the set of codes the other data packet generators are currently on (e.g., the fifth passcode), so that the new data packet generator is also synchronized with the other data packet generators (e.g., to display the fifth passcode). An advantage of such synchronization is that the server may be used, in some embodiments, to ensure that no two data packet generators will output the same passcode at the same time. However, some embodiments do allow data packet generators to display the same passcode at the same time, as described in more detail below.","In some embodiments operation  is performed before operation  to synchronize the data packet generator with the server before sending a first set of passcodes. In other embodiments operations  and  are performed simultaneously. In other embodiments the server begins to observe data packet(s) that identify a single data packet generator as being the source of the data packet(s) (such as when the serial number of the data packet generator is included within the data packet). In this scenario, one or more data packet retrievals can inform the server about the current status of the data packet passcode sequence (if such passcodes are in the data packet). Through preprogramming and memory, the server can then synchronize itself to that data packet generator so that all future passcodes from that data packet generator are predictable by the server. This is helpful, for example, in the case of data packet generators that are programmed (e.g., at the factory) to not start generating passcodes until a tab is removed from the battery.","Operation  is next performed to output the current passcode. In some embodiments, operation  involves displaying the current passcode on a display. In other embodiments, operation  involves generating an audible signal identifying the current passcode. In other embodiments, operation  involves communicating the passcode via a digital communication signal or by using another output device.","After the passcode has been output, method  pauses to wait for a time period to elapse with operation . The time period defines how frequently the passcode is changed to a new passcode. A benefit of changing the passcode periodically is that it prevents someone from viewing a passcode on a data packet generator and then later using it in an unauthorized manner from a different location. In general, the more frequently the passcode is changed, the more difficult it would be for someone to use the passcode at a different location. The period of time used in operation  is typically in a range from about 10 seconds to about 1 hour, and preferably from about 30 seconds to about 2 minutes. In some embodiments, the time period is about one minute, such that the passcode is updated about once per minute. One minute is typically a sufficient amount of time for a user to manually enter a passcode.","Once the time period has elapsed, operation  is performed to determine whether the current passcode is the last of the first set of passcodes. If so, operation  is performed to bring method  to an end. Alternatively, method  returns to the first passcode and displays the same passcodes again beginning with operation . In yet another embodiment, a user alert is provided to inform the user that all passcodes have been exhausted. In a further embodiment, the data packet generator initiates communication with a server to obtain a second set of passcodes and restarts method  to obtain the second set of passcodes.","If further passcodes remain, operation  is performed to increment the current passcode to the next passcode of the first set of passcodes.

In some embodiments, the passcodes are generated by a known algorithm so that they can also be accurately determined or predicted by the server. In some embodiments, the code generation algorithm is cryptographically secure or substantially cryptographically secure. In some embodiments, the code generation algorithm is an algorithm for generating pseudo-random numbers. One example of a code generation algorithm utilizes a linear congruential generator (LCG) algorithm. The LCG algorithm is defined by the recurrence relation:\n\n=()mod \n","where Xis the sequence of random values, m=modulus, a=multiplier, c=increment, and X=the seed or start value. m, a, c, and Xare integer values.

It then generates an output by computing a pseudo-random function based on these two input variables.","Another possible embodiment includes a hardware random number generator, such as those based on microscopic phenomena including thermal noise, the photoelectric effect, or other quantum phenomena. Examples of quantum phenomena include shot noise, nuclear decay, and the passage of photons through a semi-transparent mirror (such as used in the line of cryptography products developed by id Quantique of Geneva, Switzerland.)","Some embodiments generate a passcode using base 31, rather than base 10. A base 31 code may be generated by first generating a number of appropriate length using base 10 (or binary, if desired). The number is then converted into base 31 using an appropriate conversion algorithm. Alternatively, an algorithm is used to generate a passcode in base 31 directly.","In some embodiments the actual code generation algorithm is predefined, but operation  involves storing the start value and any other necessary value in memory.

In some embodiments the passcode output in operation  is only valid during this time period.","After the time period has elapsed, operation  is performed to determine whether the data packet generator has reached an end of life. In some embodiments data packet generators are configured to operate only for a predetermined life span. For example, the life span is typically in a range from about one hour (such as for a data packet generator given to guests on a temporary basis) to about ten years. Other embodiments have other life spans outside of this range. Added security is achieved in some embodiments by limiting the life of data packet generators to a predetermined duration. If the end of life has been reached, operation  is performed to terminate operation of the data packet generator. In some embodiments a warning or alert is given to the user.

The authentication module , in some embodiments, prevents a user from accessing protected resources on the computing device (or on the network) until proper authentication has been provided, such as a valid passcode. For example, once a passcode is entered, the authorization module  operates to request validation of the passcode, by sending the passcode to the server using server communication module . If validated, the server returns a validation message that is delivered to the authorization module . Upon receiving the validation message, the authorization module  allows the user to access the protected resource.

For example, data may be gathered and stored in memory relating to general space utilization. When a passcode is entered, data is stored identifying the location of the user. The location data may be used to identify spaces that are highly used, or spaces that are infrequently used, for example. In this example, the passcode is not being used for security purposes, and therefore need not prohibit access to resources upon entry of an invalid passcode. Rather, the data associated with an invalid code is discarded or stored as an erroneous entry. Alternatively, an algorithm is used in some embodiments to identify the data packet generator based on the invalid code, such as by identifying a data packet generator that had a code that was very similar to the code entered by the user. If a subsequent report (e.g., a space usage report) is generated based on the data, the data associated with an invalid code may be ignored for generating space usage reports.","In some embodiments authentication module  is not required, such as if the protected resource is located on a server (e.g., ) rather than on computing device .

This alternative embodiment allows the user to enter a second or subsequent passcode from another location, provided that the next location is within a particular range from the first location. For example, after a user enters a first passcode, the system then prompts the user to enter a second passcode (e.g., via a handheld computing device). The user then locates a nearby data packet generator and enters the associated passcode. The server determines the amount of time between the first passcode entry and the second passcode entry and, using an estimated maximum walking speed, determines whether or not the second passcode entry is within a range that the user could have walked to. If so, the second passcode entry is accepted. Since it is unlikely that two or more data packet generators would both (i) display the same passcode at the same time, and (ii) have a nearby data packet generator that displays the same second passcode at the same time, the server will typically be able to uniquely identify the data packet generators that are being used. However, if the server is unable to uniquely identify the data packet generators, the process is repeated with additional passcodes until the data packet generators are uniquely identified.","In another possible embodiment, a passcode received in operation  is compared with known information. For example, if the user also provides a user ID, known information about the user can be compared with the list of data packet generators that are generating the passcode (operation ). For example, if multiple data packet generators are generating the same passcode provided by the user, but one of the data packet generators is located within the user's private workspace, some embodiments will not require additional passcodes. Rather, the system will assume that the user is working from the private workspace. Similarly, if one data packet generator is located in the user's home facility in Minneapolis and another passcode is located in Phoenix, some embodiments will assume that the user is in the home facility and will not require additional passcodes.","In some embodiments, a data packet generator is first identified by receiving the serial number from the data packet generator. The serial number provides a preliminary indication of the identity of the data packet generator. The passcode is then evaluated and a determination is made as to whether the passcode matches a passcode that is expected from the data packet generator having the provided serial number. If so, the data packet generator is uniquely identified and no further evaluation may be needed. Alternatively, the evaluation of the serial number can be performed after the initial evaluation of the passcode, such as after operation  has identified that more than one data packet generator is expected to be generating the passcode at a given time.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0198","num":"0197"},"figref":"FIG. 14","b":["1400","1400","120","1400","1402","1404","1406","1412","1414","1416","1400","1420","1422","1400","1430"]},"User interface  is typically displayed by an output device, such as a computer monitor, although other output devices are used in some embodiments. User interface  is a Web page displayed by a Web browser application in some embodiments. In other embodiments user interface  is a screen of a software application other than a Web browser. In yet other embodiments, user interface  is a screen generated by an operating system.","In some embodiments, user interface  is displayed to a user to request the user's username and password. The username is entered into username field  and the password is entered into password field . User interface  further requests that the user enter the passcode from a nearby data packet generator. The passcode is entered into passcode field .","After entering data into the appropriate fields, the user clicks on submit button  to submit the information. In some embodiments, clicking on the submit button causes the computing device (e.g., computing device , shown in ) to transfer the data to a server (e.g., server , shown in ).","Alternatively, cancel button  is selected to cancel submission of data. In some embodiments, a user is then returned to a prior user interface window, or the user interface  is closed.","In some embodiments, message display window  is included in user interface . Message display window  operates to display a message to the user. An example of such a message is a request to reenter a passcode, such as upon entry of an invalid passcode. Any other desired message may be displayed in message display window .","In some embodiments, user interface  is a virtual wall. The virtual wall is activated when a user attempts to access a protected resource on the computer system or on the network. For example, if the user attempts to access a protected file, software application, computer, device, or other protected resource, a virtual wall such as user interface  is displayed. In some embodiments the virtual wall is a pop-up window that fills the entire screen. The virtual wall requires the user to enter information sufficient to validate that the user is authorized to access the protected resource, or to cancel the attempt to access the protected resource. Data is logged in some embodiments to record a potential attempt to access the unauthorized protected resource.","In some embodiments the passcode (or other data) is provided automatically by the data packet generator, such that the user does not need to enter the passcode into field . Some embodiments do not prompt the user for one or more of the username, password, or passcode. Other embodiments include other or additional fields or prompts as desired.","In some embodiments the username of the user is acquired for subsequent use. The username can be acquired in a number of possible ways. One way is to receive the username with user interface  either at login and\/or at another time after login. In another possible embodiment, the username is acquired by acquiring other data and looking up that data in a lookup table to find the associated username. For example, in some embodiments an identifier of a smartphone (or other mobile device) is obtained. The identifier of the smartphone is then compared to a lookup table that maps identifiers with usernames. The username is therefore identified. Other identifiers are used in other embodiments, such as a computer identifier, a data packet generator identifier, or other identifier. The identifier is then compared to a lookup table or other database that maps the identifier to a user identifier. In this way a common identifier can be used for a single user, rather than separately using a user identifier when the user is using a computing device and another identifier when the user is using another device, such as a smartphone.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0207","num":"0206"},"figref":"FIG. 15","b":["1500","1500","1502","1504","1510","1512","1520"]},"In some embodiments, user interface  is a screen displayed by a Computer-Aided Design (CAD) software application configured for use in facilities management.","In some embodiments, user interface  is dynamically updated to show current data. For example, a user identifier  or  is updated to show the name of the user that is currently using the respective workstation. In this example, John Smith (user identifier ) is currently using workstation  and Mark Daigle is currently using workstation . If either user switches to a different workstation, the user identifiers are updated to reflect the change. In addition, if no user is associated with a particular workstation, the workstation is so identified. This allows a user to be instantly located within a building and for associated records to be dynamically updated. For example, internal mail routes are updated to deliver mail to the user at their current workstation. Therefore, in some embodiments, data displayed on user interface  represents real-time data. In some embodiments, real-time data includes data that was acquired within the past 24 hours. In other embodiments, real-time data includes data that was acquired within the past 12 hours, 6 hours, 4 hours, 2 hours, 1 hour, 30 minutes, 15 minutes, 10 minutes, 5 minutes, 1 minute, 30 seconds, 15 seconds, or 1 second. In other embodiments, user interface  displays information based on compiled or historical data over a period of time. In yet another embodiment, user interface  displays projected data, such as determined by extrapolating or projecting from real-time data and\/or compiled or historical data.","In some embodiments, an occupancy field is updated with a code representing whether the workstation is unoccupied (e.g., \u201c0\u201d for a vacant workstation) or occupied (e.g., \u201c1\u201d for an occupied workstation). Further, in some embodiments real estate utilization records are updated according to the occupancy information. In some cases the capacity of a station is also considered. In this case the facilities manager typically defines the capacity. For example, a certain cubicle can house two contractors, that cubicle is assigned a capacity of two (2). Location authentication data can then be used to reveal when this cubicle is occupied but not at full capacity.","Some embodiments include a data packet generator layer in a CAD system. The data packet generator layer identifies all of the data packet generators present in a floor plan, and includes information about the data packet generators, such as an identifier of the data packet generator (e.g., a serial number), an identification of the location of the data packet generator, a graphical representation of the data packet generator (e.g.,  shown in ), and any other desired information. An example of a CAD program is a Computer Aided Facility Management (CAFM) application. Examples of commercially available CAFM systems include Tririaga, Manhattan CenterStone, FM: Systems, Archibus, and others. Some embodiments utilize or interface with Integrated Workplace Management Software (IWMS). Some embodiments are Web based CAFM applications, other embodiments are local software applications. In some embodiments, one or more CAFM drawings are geospatially aligned in a GIS program. When the data packet generators are recorded as a layer in a geospatially aligned CAFM program, the latitude, longitude (and sometimes altitude) of those data packet generators can then also be known. This is useful, for example, to permit the data from data packet generators to be used by other location based applications, or vice versa. This CAFM method of retrieving real-time latitude, longitude (and sometimes altitude) allows an internal continuation of exterior GIS applications. The geospatially aligned CAFM method is used in some embodiments to acquire real-time latitude and longitude (and in some cases altitude) of a user or device or object without requiring GPS data (or in concert with GPS data), which is especially useful inside of buildings.","In some embodiments, historical trends are recorded according to user location information. Historical trend information is very valuable to a business, as it allows a business to most effectively utilize their space. Since real estate is the second largest expense for many companies, improved space utilization will sometimes save a company a large amount of money. For example, historical trend information is used to determine that a particular workstation was only occupied 10% of the time. As a result, the space may be reassigned to another user or group of users that will better utilize the space. In another example, a large space may be identified as being a candidate for subleasing opportunities if the space is only rarely used. As another example, it may be determined that a particular group needs a larger space, while another group could make due with a smaller space. A software program is used in some embodiments to automatically evaluate historical trend information to suggest improvements in space utilization efficiency.","Employee\/user privacy is an important consideration. In some embodiments occupancy is tracked without identifying the particular employee. For example, in some embodiments a passcode (or data packet) is requested or received without a username or password. As a result, the occupancy, vacancy, and remaining capacity information for the station is obtainable without requiring that the employee identify themselves.","In another embodiment, user location information is tracked without storing time information. For example, some embodiments operate to avoid storing data that would identify a login and a logout time of an employee. For example, data is stored to identify occupancy information without storing the beginning and ending times that the space was occupied. Other privacy concerns should be carefully weighed to prevent employee or user privacy from being invaded.","In some embodiments, an authentication system includes a moves\/adds\/changes (MAC) management system. The MAC management system processes data relating to planned moves and work orders within a facility. Location information is used, for example, to identify vacant spaces as spaces to which an employee can move. It is also useful to identify potential move collisions before they occur, such as when an employee is scheduled to move into a space that is currently occupied and not itself scheduled to be vacated.","In some embodiments, an authentication system is used to identify a location for a work request. For example, when the work request is made a data packet or passcode is also obtained automatically. Alternatively, when the work request is made, the requester provides the passcode with the request. The passcode is used to identify the location where the work is required. For example, the work request is a request for technical support made to an IT specialist. As another example, the work request is a request for medical attention. As yet another example, a work request is a request for office supplies or furniture. The person or software program receiving the request uses the passcode to identify the location for the work.","In some embodiments, location information is not used to update information dynamically, but rather to provide general space utilization data. For example, data may be gathered over a period of time (e.g., 24 hours) and then compiled into space utilization summaries over the period of time. In this example, incorrect passcode entries could be ignored as it would likely not have a significant impact on the overall utilization statistics, at least not in a large organization.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0218","num":"0217"},"figref":"FIG. 16","b":["1600","1600","1602","1604","1606","1600"]},"When an emergency is detected, such as a fire, user interface  is displayed on the screen of the user. In some embodiments, user interface  is a popup window. In other embodiments user interface  is a full screen display that obscures all other information displayed on the computer screen.","The user interface  may include emergency message . The emergency message warns the user of the emergency and provides instructions to the user explaining what the user should do. For example, the emergency message  says \u201cEMERGENCY ALERT\u2014A fire has been detected! Please proceed to Exit 2B.\u201d Some embodiments provide detailed evacuation directions (e.g., exit your office to the left, proceed to the end of the hall and exit through door 2B\u201d). Any other information may be displayed. In this embodiment, user interface  also includes custom evacuation directions , which in this example provides the directions graphically, indicating that the user should exit through Exit 2B and showing the best path to take to get to the exit. The directions are customized for each user, in some embodiments. Customization may take into consideration various factors, such as the location of the fire, the number of people in a given area, and the path that others will be taking to evacuate the building. In this way, for example, a user is guided to go to Exit 2B rather than Exit 2A, because the fire is near Exit 2B (as illustrated by a \u201cFIRE\u201d graphic ). As another example, the customized directions for neighboring workspaces may also direct the users to Exit 2B so that all of the people are moving in the same direction, rather than going against the flow of evacuation. In some embodiments the evacuation plan is customized to evacuate a maximum number of people as quickly and safely as possible.","User interface  may also include other information , such as an identification of the location of the fire, or any other emergency information that may be helpful in safely evacuating people from the building.","In addition to guiding tenants and users, user interface  is also or alternatively used in some embodiments to provide wayfinding for third parties. For example, first responders or other emergency personnel uses user interface  to determine what instructions have already been given, and\/or to guide them to a place where their assistance is needed. In some cases the first responders may be granted independent access to the remote server (such as when an IT system at the emergency site is not operational.)","Other embodiments are used for other purposes. For example, security guards are required to enter passcodes as they perform their security checks within a building. By doing so, the security guard confirms that the security guard was at a particular location at a particular time. Alternatively, the passcodes are obtained automatically by a computing device, such as a smart phone, that is carried by the security guard. This provides a method of verifying, for example, that routine security checks are performed. Similarly, other embodiments are used to confirm that a person made it to a particular location (e.g., a user made it to a location for a treasure hunt, or made it to the top of Mt. Everest, etc.).","In some embodiments a computing device is identified by a unique identifier. When a user logs into the network, for example, the server determines what device is logging in by checking the unique identifier. For example, a computer may have an identifier \u201c473.AXZ.127.839JK8.\u201d The computer automatically communicates the identifier without requiring a user to manually enter the identifier. Once both the identity of a device is known and a passcode of an associated data packet generator are known, the location of a particular device is also known. As noted above, computing devices are not only computers, but also include mobile devices such as cell phones. Further, if a computing device has a way of determining what other devices or objects are around it (such as with an RFID system, barcode scanner, etc.), this information may also be communicated to a server to identify the location of the other devices or objects as well.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0225","num":"0224"},"figref":"FIG. 17","b":["1700","1700"]},"Authentication system  includes data packet generator , computing device , object  and server .

In some embodiments a computing device is initially authenticated as being at a particular location, such as by entering a passcode into the computing device. Once the location of the computing device is known, then the objects (e.g., object ) may also be authenticated as being at that location. For example, a user operates computing device  to input object identifier  into computing device . Alternatively, if the location of the computing device is not initially authenticated, the user may also enter a passcode along with the object identifier to provide location information. In some embodiments, barcode reader  is used to scan identifier  to input the object identifier  into computing device .","In another embodiment, a passcode is automatically provided by data packet generator  into computing device . In another embodiment, data packet generator  is a software module operating on computing device  that generates the passcode. The passcode is authenticated by server .","Upon validation of the passcode from data packet generator  and receipt of a valid object identifier  (which in some embodiments is itself validated by server ), the location of object  is validated as being within workstation . In some embodiments, a check-in process is used when an item arrives at the workstation. In other embodiments, a check-out process is also or alternatively used to identify when an item leaves the workstation.","In another possible embodiment, the data packet generator  is configured to receive a message from server  (such as across the network, via computing device , or from another data packet generator) to check for asset tags  in the vicinity of the data packet generator . Upon receipt of the message, data packet generator  checks for asset tags . Alternatively, data packet generator  is configured to automatically check for asset tags periodically or at a predetermined time.","To check for asset tags , in some embodiments the data packet generator  transmits a message wirelessly and monitors for a response. Alternatively, rather than transmitting a message, data packet generator  monitors for a wireless transmission from asset tags , which operate to broadcast information periodically or at a predetermined time. The received information is then stored by the data packet generator , and in some embodiments is transmitted back to server .","If object  is moved to another location, any of the processes described above are used to update the location of the object as being at the new location.","Authentication of the location of an object is useful in many applications. For example, it is used in some embodiments to track the location of a file, a piece of mail, furniture, or any other object. The location may be tracked within a building, or anywhere in the world, so long as components of the location authentication system  are available at the location of the object. It is recognized that the process may be automated in some embodiments, such that a user does not need to manually enter data.","Some embodiments include other features. For example, in some embodiments the system  receives an input identifying where an object should be delivered to, this information is stored on the server for subsequent use. In some embodiments server  retrieves the delivery information when an object is checked in and indicates at the point of delivery whether or not the object has been delivered to the correct location. Further, a summary of move information is provided to a move coordinator at the end of the move that acknowledges that every object was picked up and that every object was delivered to the appropriate location. Additional details may be stored for further reports, such as the details of when an object was picked up, who picked it up, when it was picked up, where it was delivered to (and any intermediate stops along the way), who delivered it, and what time it was delivered. If any object has not been properly moved, the information is available immediately in some embodiments, so that the object may be located.","Some embodiments of authentication system  (or other embodiments described herein) are implemented in a virtual reality environment. Various virtual reality environments are currently in existence. One example is the SECOND LIFE\u00ae world. In a virtual reality environment, devices are implemented as objects in the virtual reality environment by data instructions executed by a tangible computing device, such as the computing device shown in  herein. The objects perform the functions described herein, but do so in some cases in the virtual reality environment, rather in the tangible world. In some embodiments portions of authentication system  (or other embodiments described herein) are at times tangible while other portions are at times objects in the virtual reality environment. Any of the objects described herein (and other objects) can similarly be represented in some embodiments as virtual objects in a virtual reality system, and utilize the systems and methods described herein.","In some embodiments the virtual reality environment is configured to display a passcode directly with a three-dimensional object. Due to the fact that computers operate to generate the three-dimensional environment, the functions of a data packet generator may be performed without the need for a virtual three-dimensional representation of a physical data packet generator. Rather, the code may be output directly, such as so that it is visible on a surface of the object. For example, a passcode is associated with a pet in some embodiments so that the passcode is visible upon close inspection of the pet. The passcode is then used in one of the various manners discussed herein, such as to determine the owner of the pet and return the lost pet to the owner.","Another possible alternative to the system illustrated in  is a system in which data packet generator  is itself attached to or integrated with object . For example, equipment in a hospital may be equipped with a data packet generator. The passcode generated by data packet generator  is entered into computing device  at various possible times (such as when the object is brought to a new location or when the object leaves a location). In this way the location of the object may be tracked throughout the hospital. Alternatively, the code may be provided directly to a server whenever the equipment is turned on. In some embodiments, the passcode or other data is transferred automatically from the data packet generator , as discussed herein.","As employees become increasingly mobile, some employees are no longer assigned to a particular office space. Such employees may, however, wish to store a small amount of their belongings at the facility, rather than transporting everything with them each time they leave. To accommodate this, some embodiments include hoteling packages. Hoteling packages are enclosures that are each assigned to a particular person. The person can store items (including writing instruments, books, calculators, rulers, documents, or any other personal belongings or business items) in the hoteling package. In some embodiments the hoteling package includes an asset tag that identifies the hoteling package. In some embodiments the asset tag is an active device (such as a device that wirelessly transmits asset tag information), or a passive device (such as one that displays asset tag information in the form of a code or barcode). Server  monitors the locations of the hoteling packages using the asset tags, according to the methods described herein. In this way, the employee can leave the hoteling package at the facility when the employee leaves, and can quickly locate the hoteling package again the next time he or she returns (or remotely via a computing device). In some embodiments the hoteling package includes a slot for receiving mail, such that the hoteling package can provide the additional function of receiving mail, such as when stored in a mail room.","As mentioned above, systems and methods disclosed herein are used in some embodiments to identify the location of a telephone, such as a voice over Internet protocol (VoIP) telephone. For example, a data packet generator is integrated with a VoIP telephone or in data communication (either wirelessly or via one or more wires) with a data packet generator. Accordingly, using the systems and methods disclosed herein, the location of the VoIP telephone can be identified. This location is used to inform an emergency responder, telephone company, 911 emergency system, caller ID system, (or other person or system) of where the call originated from.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0248","num":"0247"},"figref":"FIG. 18","b":"1800"},"An example location authentication system will first be described. The location authentication system includes in some embodiments a data packet generator located at a retail establishment, such as a coffee shop. The data packet generator is, for example, hung on the wall so that it is easily visible by customers in the coffee shop. The system also includes a computing device, such as a public computer terminal supplied by the coffee shop, or a device carried by the user, such as a laptop, PDA, cell phone, or other computing device. The user uses the computing device to log into a social networking Web site, for example. In some embodiments the login process requests a username and password (although login is not needed in all embodiments, such as if the computing device has previously recognized the user) but other login processes are used in some embodiments. The login process is used to identify a user (e.g., Mark), or typically at least to associate the user with a username or other identifier. Once logged in, the site includes a module that allows the user to enter a passcode to identify the user's current location. The user initiates the module and enters the passcode displayed by the data packet generator. The Web site then validates the passcode and determines the location of the user as being at the coffee shop.","User interface  is an exemplary user interface displayed by a social networking Web site. The user interface is displayed to a user of the social networking Web site, such as a friend (e.g., Sally) after the friend has logged into the Web site and initiated a module to locate Mark. The Web site includes, for example, a map displaying the location of Mark at the coffee shop located at 123 Main Street. Sally may now use this information to meet up with Mark at the coffee shop. The location authentication system may also be useful for a child to confirm their location to a parent. It is also possible for the coffee shop to have three or four of our devices next to three or four common social phrases. For example. One data packet generator is next to a phrase that says \u201cCome meet me at this location\u201d. Another data packet generator says, \u201cI'm leaving this location now\u201d. Then, when the user enters that passcode it not only authenticates that the user was at the location but it also communicates a message simultaneously. Alternatively, in some embodiments a software application identifies the available phrases automatically, such as by receiving a data packet from the data packet generator wirelessly (or via one or more communication wires). The data packet includes the respective code and the associated phrase. The software then displays the available phrases to the user, who selects the message to be communicated. In this example, the user does not have to manually enter the passcode.","Due to privacy considerations, it is strongly preferred that embodiments for locating people do so only when a person specifically wants to be located, such as when the person himself enters a code indicating a desire to be located. In addition, it is strongly preferred that such location information be provided only to a select group of people, such as a trusted group of friends. In some embodiments the information is communicated only to a single person or group of people that have been identified by the user as intended recipients of the information.","Although user interface  is described above as a user interface of a Web site, other embodiments communicate information in other manners, such as through an e-mail message, a text message, and the like. Similarly, the information is used in some embodiments to communicate a message across an existing system, such as Twitter, Facebook, other social networking sites, or other communication systems.","In some embodiments described above, authentication systems are used to authenticate a location of something. Other possible embodiments involve an object identification system that may be used to authenticate the identity of an object. In such an embodiment, for example, a data packet generator is attached or otherwise connected or associated with an object. The code generated by the data packet generator may be entered into a computing device and sent to a server for validation. The server validates the code as a valid code and then retrieves an identity of the object associated with the data packet generator that generated the passcode from a database. Other information may also be associated with the object in the database, if desired. Such an object identification system is useful in a wide variety of applications. For example, a data packet generator may be connected to or integrated into a piece of artwork. The object identification system operates to authenticate the object as being a particular object, such as an original painting or sculpture by a particular artist, or a pallet used in shipping applications. In some embodiments the retrieval of data packets from data packet generators associated with the object is performed automatically. Nearly any object can be associated with a data packet generator.","Another example of an object authentication system involves a sheet of electronic paper or other display system. The electronic paper displays a document, for example and\/or also operates as a data packet generator to display a code that is updated periodically. The code may be used to authenticate the identity of the document displayed by the electronic paper. In some embodiments, the electronic paper may be used to bridge the gap between digital data on a computer and physical documents or objects. In other embodiments, a document may be printed having a static passcode printed thereon. The passcode may be used to authenticate the source of the document or other information about the document known by the server (such as the time it was printed, who printed it, etc).","As just one example, electronic currency could be displayed on electronic paper in the form of tangible currency. The currency displays a passcode that is updated periodically that may be used to authenticate the currency. In some embodiments the tangible currency displayed on electronic paper is converted into electronic currency, such as by transferring an equation or other digital data relating to the currency to another electronic device and removing the equation or other digital data from the electronic paper. The electronic currency is transferable, such as by transmitting the equation or other digital data across a network, such as the Internet or a telephone network. Similarly, the electronic currency is then converted back to tangible currency by transferring the equation or other digital data back to the electronic paper.","In other possible embodiments, a Web address (e.g., uniform resource locator) is printed on the document. The Web address points to a Web site that displays a dynamic passcode associated with the document. The dynamic passcode may be used for authentication as described herein. In another possible embodiment, a Web address and a code or value is printed on the document. Upon accessing the Web site identified by the Web address, the code or value is entered to enable the passcode to be displayed or generated.","Another exemplary application for an object authentication system is an Internet based lost and found. When an item is found that contains a data packet generator, the code is used to return the lost item to its rightful owner. For example, the person that finds the item (sometimes referred to herein as the finder) may read a label printed on the item that directs the finder to log onto a particular Web site. The finder does so and is then prompted to enter the code currently displayed by the data packet generator. Upon entering the code, the item is identified by a server. The server may also request information about the finder, such as a telephone number, e-mail address, or mailing address where the finder can be contacted. The server then identifies contact information associated with the original owner in the database. This information was, for example, previously provided by the original owner. The server then sends the finders contact information to the original owner to allow the original owner to contact the finder to arrange for pickup or delivery of the object. Examples of tangible objects include electronics (computers, MP3 or MP4 players, stereos, DVD players, telephones, smart phones, etc.), valuables jewelry, money\/currency, gold, antiques), pet collars, boxes, furniture, pens, wine bottles, artwork, pavement, credit cards, currency, vehicles, phones, shoes, medical equipment, car keys, documents, chairs, pallets, cubicle parts, bricks, plates, toys, or a wide variety of other objects. Some embodiments of the Internet based lost and found operate to maintain the privacy of the original owner by not disclosing information about the owner to the finder.","Other possible embodiments involve a person or company authentication system. In this embodiment, a person or group of people can be authenticated to another person or group of people. For example, in some embodiments a person uses the authentication system to authenticate communications as being from a vendor that the person has contracted with. The vendor agrees to provide either a dynamic or static passcode in all communications with the person as a way for the person to ensure that the communication is coming from the vendor. For example, an e-mail may include a dynamic passcode (e.g., one that changes periodically) while a document may include a static passcode. When a vendor e sends an e-mail message, for example, a passcode is supplied to the computing device, which is inserted or embedded into the e-mail message. When the e-mail message is received, the passcode is continually shown in the e-mail message whenever that message is read by the person. The passcode is then validated as a valid passcode by comparing the passcode shown in the e-mail to a passcode shown on the person's device. No data entry is required in some embodiments (such as if only a visual comparison is made to reassure the person). If the comparison is successful, the e-mail message is determined to have come from the vendor. Other communications may also be used. For example, a vendor employee reads the passcode into a telephone to initiate a telephone conference with the person or the vendor sends a document that shows a timestamp and a passcode that was valid at that time. Whenever the person wants to change vendors, all vendors need to be notified and the person's data packet generator needs to be updated via an input device or replaced with new data packet generators. In this way the person remains in control of which vendors know their current passcodes.","Yet other embodiments include a time verification system. The time verification system utilizes a data packet generator to authenticate a time at which an event occurs. The time verification system includes a data packet generator in which a passcode generated by the data packet generator changes periodically, such as once per minute. In some embodiments the data packet generator is integrated into another device. One example of a device is a digital camera. When the digital camera is used to take a photograph, the digital image is stored along with a passcode provided by the data packet generator. The passcode may subsequently be used to verify the time of an event shown in the photograph. Examples of such events include a car accident to prove the time the accident occurred to an insurance company, and a wide variety of other possible events.","Many of the embodiments described herein may also be used for time verification in addition to or as an alternative to the particular uses described herein.","Yet further embodiments involve authentication of a right to access information. For example, a digital data sharing system is provided by some embodiments. In this example, a user desires to purchase a digital copy of a song from a distributor, such as through the distributors Web site. The Web site includes an option to purchase a right to share the music with friends, such as to purchase three sharing credits to allow the user to share the song with three friends (or one friend three times, etc.) The user then downloads a digital copy of the song. The song display on the MP3 player then shows changing code next to the title. That code is unique not only to the song purchased but also to the original buyer (in other words somebody else purchasing sharing rights to the same song would not have the same code for the same song). Whenever the owner of the song feels so inclined, they can share the current code shown next to the title of the song with a friend. The friend enters the current code into their own device. Once the code has been authenticated by the server, the friend's device is given access to stream (not download or own) the song (such as one time during the next three days. In some embodiments, the friend cannot subsequently share the song with anyone else because the code is only valid for a short period of time. The transfer of passcode information can happen in person via text message, over the phone, etc.","In some embodiments, sharing is initiated by the user selecting a share icon in the music library (e.g., their iTunes music library) to initiate legal sharing. Upon selecting the share icon, a message is sent to a server (e.g., the iTunes server) that indicates an intent to share a song (or collection of songs) as well as the current rolling passcode associated with the song. In some embodiments the user also enters an identifier (such as an e-mail address) of a person that the song should be shared with. The server then authenticates the rolling passcode including the original purchasers name and whether their account is active for a charge. Once authenticated, the server then returns a message to the user's computing device, including a sharing passcode, which the user can give to a friend or other person. Alternatively, the server sends the passcode directly to the person that the song is to be shared with. In some embodiments the passcode is embedded in a link. In some embodiments the passcode is valid for a limited period of time, such as a predetermined number of minutes, hours, or days. If the passcode is used by the recipient to access the song, the sharer's account is charged and limited rights to access the music are granted to the recipient.","Some embodiments described above utilize a data packet generator that generates codes using a random number generation algorithm. In some embodiments the algorithm uses one or more input variables as inputs to the equation to calculate a passcode. The input variables are stored in memory, for example. Another possible embodiment, however, receives the input variables from another object, material, or device.","For example, if a data packet generator is attached to a desktop (such as illustrated in ), some embodiments of the data packet generator operate to receive an input variable from another object, such as the desktop itself. In this way the data packet generator is able to read input variables specific to the location of the data packet generator. The input variables are integrated, printed, embedded, or formed into the object, such as a desktop.","In one example, at least part of the desktop surface includes an at least partially conductive material. The conductivity of the desktop surface is made to match a predetermined conductivity (or range of conductivities). Probes from the data packet generator contact the desktop to measure a resistance between the probes, such as by applying a voltage between the probes. The resistance is measured and converted into an input variable that is then used by the random number generator. In some embodiments the data packet generator also uses the current time as an input to the random number generator, such that the result is a pseudorandom number that identifies the desktop to which the data packet generator is attached.","Another possible embodiment involves a series of dots on the surface of the object, such as a desktop. The dots are made of conductive polymers (such as polythiophenes, polypyrroles, etc.) or nonconductive polymers. The conductivity (or lack thereof) between any two of the dots is used to encode a value onto the surface which is read by the data packet generator as an input to the random number generation algorithm. Pins from the data packet generator contact each of the dots to determine whether the dot is conductive or non-conductive (or whether a resistance is above or below a predetermined threshold). If a dot has a low resistance, for example, the dot encodes a \u201c1\u201d value and if the dot has a high resistance, the dot encodes a \u201c0\u201d value. Any number of dots may be used to encode any number of binary digits. The binary digits may be converted into base 10 or another base if desired to provide an input value to the random number generator. In some embodiments the value is known by a server and is associated with a desktop that is known to be in a particular location. When the passcode is received at the server, the server is able to calculate the value that was used to generate the passcode, because the server knows the random number algorithm and the time at which the passcode was generated. Once the value is known, the location of the data packet generator is also known by matching the value with the stored location associated with the value. In some embodiments, then, simply placing the data packet generator onto a surface having the encoded value allows the server to identify the location when the passcode is received. Alternatively, the data packet generator itself is programmed to identify its own location upon detection of the value from the surface. The value may also be encoded in other locations, such as on a label affixed to an object or surface, or in a material printed onto a surface. In some embodiments different ranges of resistances are used to represent a particular value. For example, three values are encoded into a particular dot by using a material having a low resistance to represent a first value, a moderate resistance to represent a second value, and a high resistance to represent a third value. Any number of values may be encoded in a single dot by defining different ranges of resistances for each value.","In another possible embodiment, a value is encoded into a surface by dots that reflect different wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation. An ultraviolet (UV) camera is included in the data packet generator in some embodiments. The UV camera detects a color of light reflected from one or more of the dots when exposed to UV light. In this way the data packet generator need not be in physical contact with the surface or object. In some embodiments a material, such as a polymer, is used that degrades over a predetermined period of time to limit the usable lifetime of the material or perhaps to limit the readable period to within a particular window of time.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0268","num":"0267"},"figref":"FIG. 19","b":["1900","1900","204","204","1902","1904","1906"]},"In this example, data packet generator  includes a housing having a first housing member  and a second housing member .

Tapered sidewalls  provide gradually sloping edges, rather than sharp corners, to prevent or reduce damage to a person, person's clothing, or another object that may come into contact with data packet generator .","In some embodiments second housing member  is an attachment device that allows data packet generator  to be fastened to another object, such as bottom surface  of desktop . Any suitable fastener can be used, such as a screw, nail, bolt, or adhesive. For example, screws are inserted into fastener holes  to secure data packet generator  to desktop .

However, in another possible embodiment, conductive elements  and  are vertically spaced from each other. In yet another possible embodiment, conductive elements  and  are both horizontally and vertically spaced from one another.","When an electrically conductive fastener is inserted into fastener hole , first conductive element  and second conductive element  become electrically connected through the adjacent portion of screw . Sensor  is also electrically connected to conductive elements  and  and operates to detect whether the conductive elements  and  are electrically connected to each other or not. After installation of a data packet generator, such as to desktop  (or another object), sensor  is able to detect if one or more screws  are removed, such as by applying a small current through conductive elements  and . When screw  is removed, the current flowing through conductive elements  and  stops flowing. The sensor  communicates this information to the microprocessor (e.g., , shown in ), which determines whether action is necessary in response to potential tampering.","In some embodiments, such action includes recording the status of the one or more screws in memory. For example, when a change in status is identified, the status is stored in memory (e.g., screw  not installed) along with a time stamp of when the change occurred. In some embodiments, this status information is subsequently transmitted to a server or other computing device, such as in a data packet.","Although fastener  is described as a screw that mounts the body of data packet generator to another object, such as desktop , other fasteners can also be used. For example, in some embodiments the housing of the data packet generator is formed of two shells. Sensor  can be used to detect tampering with fasteners used to connect the shells together. Fasteners can also be used to secure a battery compartment. Any such fastener may be monitored with sensor  to detect tampering.","Other embodiments include other mechanisms for detecting tampering with fasteners. In some embodiments sensor  operates to detect a change in resistance between conductive elements  and . When screw  is removed, the resistance increases. Other embodiments of sensor  use an alternating current (AC) signal rather than a direct current (DC) signal. A high frequency signal is applied to first conductive element  and the resulting signal is detected at conductive element . A change in one or more of various electrical characteristics can be detected to alert sensor  to potential tampering. In other embodiments sensor  monitors for any changes in static electricity. Magnetic or electric fields are generated and monitored by sensor  in other embodiments.","In some embodiments, the data packet generator (e.g., data packet generator , shown in ) operates to take one or more actions upon the detection of a potential tampering event. Some possible actions include: entering a hibernation mode to cease generating subsequent passcodes; erasing data stored in memory, such as the algorithm used for generating passcodes, algorithm seed data, identifying information, or any other data stored in memory; sending a communication to another data packet generator or computing device; a combination of these actions; or other actions. In some embodiments the event is recorded in memory, and subsequently communicated via a data packet.","Examples of potential tampering events include: movement of the device (such as measured by an accelerometer or other motion sensor) that exceeds a certain threshold of time, distance, or intensity; absence of one or more fasteners from the data packet generator; retraction of a fastener beyond a threshold (such as if the fastener is retracted beyond one or both of first and second conductive elements  and ); a lack of communication between the data packet generator and another device (such as another data packet generator, an RFID reader, or a computing device) for more than a predetermined period of time; or other measurable or detectable events.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0284","num":"0283"},"figref":"FIG. 23","b":["2300","2300"]},"In some embodiments, intensity map  includes floor plan display  and legend . Floor plan display  illustrates the location of a plurality of workstations  (including workstation , workstation , and workstation , and workstation ) at a particular location, such as on a first floor of a building.","A color is associated with each workstation . Each color represents a different space utilization intensity level, as shown in legend . Legend includes white background , green background , yellow background , and red background . White background  is associated with a vacant workstation. Green background  is associated with a low usage intensity. Yellow background  is associated with a moderate usage intensity. Red background  is associated with a high usage intensity. Any number of colors may be used in various embodiments, and any color can be associated with any usage intensity or range of usage intensities. Further, some embodiments use colors, text, patterns, textures, images, graphics, sounds, multimedia, or various other identifiers to indicate usage intensity or ranges of usage intensities.","Using data stored in the location authentication system database, intensity map  is generated to visually depict the space utilization intensity of each workstation. In some embodiments, background colors are determined based on the percentage of normal business hours that a space is occupied. For example, a vacant space is a space that is used less than 5% of normal business hours. A low usage space is a space that is used from 5% up to 50% of normal business hours. A moderate usage space is a space that is used from 50% to 95% of normal business hours. A high usage space is a space that is used more than 95% of normal business hours. Other embodiments define space utilization intensities based on other percentages or on other periods of time.","In yet another embodiment, space utilization is defined by the number of people that utilize a space in a particular period of time, or at a particular time (e.g., whether a space is typically or currently occupied by one person, two people, three people, etc.). Further, some embodiments display usage statistics for larger spaces or groups of workspaces, such as entire floors, entire departments, entire buildings, or define other spaces other than single workspaces. Some embodiments display usage statistics for common spaces, such as conference rooms, hallways, reception areas, restrooms, or other common spaces. Further embodiments display usage statistics based on the percentage of the available space that is utilized, such as the percentage of space that is utilized for storage in a storage room, file room, closet, or computer room.","In this example, the background color of each workstation  is displayed in a color representing the space utilization intensity. For example, workstation  is displayed having a green background , showing that workstation  has a low usage intensity. Workstation  is displayed having a white background , showing that workstation  has not been used during the observation period. Workstation  is displayed having a yellow background , showing that workstation  has a moderate usage intensity. Workstation  is displayed having a red background , showing that workstation  has a high usage intensity.","Usage data is gathered in some embodiments whenever a user logs into a computing device. For example, when a user logs into a computing device, the device prompts the user for a passcode. The user enters the passcode displayed on the data packet generator located in the workspace. The passcode is communicated to a server, which identifies the workspace and identifies the workspace as being in use.","In other embodiments, space usage data is compiled in other ways. For example, space utilization is tied to light usage in some embodiments. If the lights are on, the space is considered to be in use. Motion detectors are used in other embodiments. Yet other embodiments utilize other sensors. For example, a motion or weight sensor can be associated with a chair to detect when a user is sitting in the chair. The usage data is then communicated to a server using one or more communication devices. The usage data is then stored for subsequent use, such as to generate space utilization intensity map .","As noted above, user privacy is an important consideration. It may be desirable to impose restrictions or limitations to data collection to protect user privacy. For example, in some embodiments, detecting when a user is sitting in a chair is limited to only short durations of time at infrequent intervals. Alternatively, though data collection may not be limited, the generation of reports can be limited to protect user privacy. However, it is noted that although some embodiments do collect space utilization data, some embodiments do not identify the user that is occupying the space. In these embodiments the data that is collected may only show that the space was used without providing any information to identify the particular user or users that were utilizing the space.","Space utilization intensity map  is an example of a possible user interface display of a handheld inspection and maintenance device. Such an inspection and maintenance system is typically a portable device including a display, a data packet generator communication device, a network communication device, an input device (such as a touch screen or keypad), a processor and memory (e.g., a computing device). In some embodiments the handheld inspection and maintenance device displays a floor plan of a facility where the inspector is currently located. Location information is determined, for example, by receiving communications from nearby data packet generators that (e.g., through communication with the server) identify the location, or by receiving GPS signals with a GPS receiver, or both. In some embodiments the floor plan display automatically pans as the inspector moves throughout the building to continually display a current floor plan for the location that the inspect is in. For example, if the inspector moves one way, the floor plan scrolls to the left. If the inspector moves another way, the floor plan scrolls down. In some embodiments the inspection device also detects elevation or determines what floor the inspector is on, and automatically adjusts the display accordingly.","Other embodiments of the handheld inspection and maintenance device include other user interface displays. For example, a real-time CAFM display is provided in some embodiments. Other user interfaces or dashboard displays are included in other embodiments, such as those described herein. In some embodiments the handheld inspection and maintenance device is a smart phone, such as an iPhone.

As a result, when a computing device (or other device) is able to communicate with the communication device  while it is operating in the short range communication mode, the location of the computing device is known to be within the short range of the associated data packet generator. If the location of the data packet generator is also known, then the location of the computing device is also known.","In some embodiments, the data packet generator  communicates a passcode (or other data) using the short range communication mode. The short range of the short range communication mode prevents the passcode from being received by a computing device that is outside of the short range of the communication device , but allows the passcode to be received by a computing device that is within the short range of the communication device .","In some embodiments computing device  is programmed to automatically detect a communication from data packet generator  across communication path . Once detected, the passcode (or other data) is received from the communication and may be used for an automated login with the server. For example, when a user starts a computer, the user can enter a username and password (if desired by the administrator). Before proceeding with the login, however, the computing device waits to receive a passcode from a nearby computing device. If the passcode is received, the computing device proceeds to use the username, password, and passcode to gain access the system (or just the passcode in some embodiments). If a passcode is not received within a predetermined period of time, the user is prompted to manually enter a passcode.","An alternate embodiment does not require a user name or password. Rather, software runs in the background on the computing device. The software periodically receives a passcode (or other data) from a data packet generator and provides that passcode to a server without requiring user intervention. Further, in some embodiments the software does not act to control access to protected resources.","Some computing devices use identifiers other than usernames and passwords to confirm the identity of a user. For example, a biometric identification system is used to identify a user according to one or more biometric identifiers. Examples of biometric identifiers include fingerprint scanners, eye scanners (e.g., iris scanners), face identifiers, voice identifiers, etc. Ultimately each organization will typically determine the identification method or methods that are best for that organization.","In some embodiments the username is obtained automatically for use as disclosed herein, such as by utilizing a software application running on the computing device to read the user name from the operating system (such as from the operating system registry file).","When the communication device  is operating in the longer range communication mode, communication is possible across a longer distance than is possible in the short range communication mode. In some embodiments the longer distance is in a range from about 10 feet to about 30 feet, and preferably from about 15 feet to about 25 feet. In other embodiments, the longer range is greater than about 100 feet. Other embodiments include other ranges.","In some embodiments, a data packet generator utilizes the longer range communication mode of the communication device  to communicate with neighboring data packet generators, such as across communication path . A neighboring data packet generator is a data packet generator that is within the longer range of another data packet generator, when the data packet generator is communicating in the longer range communication mode. For example, when data packet generator  is operating the communication device  in the long range communication mode, data packet generator  is able to communicate with neighboring data packet generators, such as data packet generator , if the data packet generator  is a distance away that is less than the longer range of communication device . This can include, for example, any data packet generators located within one or more neighboring workspaces, such as workstation .","In some embodiments, communication device  is used to communicate a passcode (or other data in a data packet) to a computing device or to another data packet generator without requiring a user to manually read the passcode (or other data) from the display of the data packet generator and manually enter the passcode into a keypad. As a result, such communication of the passcode (or other data) is sometimes referred to herein as automated communication. Further, in some embodiments additional information is also communicated along with the passcode. In some embodiments, such information is transmitted as, or as part of, a data packet.","One example use of the longer distance communication mode is to communicate passcodes among neighboring data packet generators. For example, in some embodiments each data packet generator is programmed to broadcast a data packet to neighboring data packet generators periodically, such as once per day. The data packet includes various information, such as a serial number of the data packet generator or a passcode generated by the data packet generator (or other data described herein). The neighboring data packet generators receive the data packet that is broadcast and store some or all of the data in memory. For example, in some embodiments the serial numbers and\/or passcodes of each of the neighboring data packet generators are stored in memory. Later, when the data packet generator transmits a data packet to a computing device (or the server), the data packet generator also retrieves from memory the data from the neighboring data packet generators and transmits such data as well. If sent to the computing device, the computing device then transmits the data to the server (e.g., server ). The server then stores the data packet information in memory for subsequent or immediate use.","For example, in some embodiments the server utilizes neighboring passcode information to confirm the location of the data packet generator, by verifying that the neighboring passcodes were in fact generated by the known neighbors of the data packet generator. If a data packet generator is unable to supply the serial numbers or passcodes from neighboring devices, the server determines that either the data packet generator has moved (or malfunctioned) or that one or more of the neighboring data packet generators have moved (or malfunctioned). By similarly receiving such data from all other data packet generators, the locations of all (or at least some) of the data packet generators in a facility are verified or are flagged as requiring review, investigation, or other action. The interconnected network of data packet generators is sometimes referred to herein as a mesh network. The mesh network permits data packet generators to be moved (e.g., semi-transient), while the server maintains an accurate identification of the location (or approximate location) of the moved data packet generator. For example, if a reconfiguration of office space occurs, the movement of the data packet generators is reported to the server to inform space planners of the reconfiguration and present locations of the data packet generators. In some embodiments information is communicated to the space planners in an automated communication, such as via an e-mail or text message. In other embodiments a message is displayed on a user interface of a computing device.","In some embodiments communication  is used by a data packet generator  to determine the distance that the data packet generator  is away from a neighboring data packet generator . One exemplary method of determining the distance between data packet generators is to measure a signal intensity of communication  received from data packet generator . The attenuation of the signal from a known original intensity can be used to approximate the distance. In another embodiment, data packet generator  determines a change in signal intensity among multiple communications . A drop in signal intensity of a communication  from the intensity of a previously received communication indicates that the data packet generator  may have been moved away from data packet generator . Another method of determining the distance between data packet generators is to measure the time the signal takes to propagate to a nearby data packet generator and to receive the response from the data packet generator. Another embodiment uses triangulation between multiple data packet generators to determine distances and\/or specific locations of neighboring data packet generators.","In some embodiments a periodic location check is performed. The periodic location check occurs periodically, such as once per minute, hour, day, or month. The location check is initiated, in some embodiments, by a single data packet generator that emits a first location check message. The location check message is received by neighboring data packet generators that in turn emit a subsequent location check message. This is an example of viral communication. The message continues to propagate through the entire area until all data packet generators that are within range of another data packet generator have issued a location check message. The location check messages are also received by neighboring data packet generators. The neighboring data packet generators use the location check messages to estimate the distances between themselves and the neighboring data packet generators. The distance information is then stored in memory, such as for subsequent communication back to the server (such as using a passcode alert message described below). In another possible embodiment, instead of a location check, a presence check is performed that verifies the presence of a data packet generator, rather than the location of the data packet generator.","Viral communication is used in some embodiments to communicate additional information or data among data packet generators. For example, firmware updates are transmitted through the data packet generators using viral communication in some embodiments, where the firmware update is distributed to one or more selected data packet generators, which in turn send the firmware update to the neighboring data packet generators until all interconnected data packet generators have received the update. Security measures are put into place in the preferred embodiments to ensure that an actual virus or other malicious firmware or software cannot propagate in this manner.","In another possible embodiment, the presence check is performed at a predetermined time, where all data packet generators are configured to wake up during that time to perform the presence check. In some embodiments the data packet generators remain active for a period of time, such as about ten minutes, to allow all of the presence checks to be performed, before returning to a normal mode of operation. In some embodiments the operation of the data packet generator during this period is referred to as a presence check mode of operation.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0322","num":"0321"},"figref":"FIG. 25","b":["2500","2500","2502","2504","2506"]},"Method  begins in normal mode . In normal mode, the data packet generator generates and outputs a current passcode or data packet periodically, such as once per minute. In some embodiments the current passcode is displayed by a display of the data packet generator. In other embodiments the current passcode (or other data) is transmitted in a data packet using a communication device. Other embodiments do both. Normal mode  continues until a qualifying event is detected.","An example of a qualifying event is the detection of potential tampering, such as by a tamper sensor. Another example of a qualifying event is the receipt of an alert message from a neighboring data packet generator. Other examples of qualifying events are described herein. Other qualifying events can include any event that is measurable, detectable, or determinable by a data packet generator. Examples of data that can be included in the data packet are described herein, such as in table 2 below.","Upon the detection of a qualifying event, method  begins to operate the data packet generator in alert mode . While operating in alert mode, the data packet generator continues to generate a current data packet periodically. However, the data packet generator now adds additional information to the data packet in an effort to communicate information regarding the qualifying event that has been detected. An example of the alert mode  is described in more detail herein with reference to .","In some embodiments, the alert mode  adds to the data packet information about the event that has occurred. Other embodiments take additional action.","After operating in the alert mode , method  either returns to normal mode  upon termination of the qualifying event, or operates to disable the data packet generator  if one or more criteria for disable are met.","In some embodiments, some qualifying events terminate after a passage of time. Other qualifying events terminate once the qualifying event has been rectified, such as if a missing screw is replaced. Other qualifying events terminate upon receipt of a wireless or wired communication from an administrator, security personnel, or server informing the data packet generator that the event should be terminated. In some embodiments some qualifying events terminate when the data packet generator is placed into a known \u201csafe zone,\u201d such as by returning the data packet generator to a docking station or particular storage room. In some embodiments the location of the data packet generator can be determined by the data packet generator by receiving a known passcode (or other data, such as a serial number or other data packet generator identifier) from another data packet generator that is known to be in a particular location, such as the storage room. In some embodiments, after an alert is sent, neighboring data packet generators respond to the alert to inform the alerting data packet generator that the alert has been received. The receipt of this message from one or more neighboring data packet generators terminates the qualifying event in some embodiments. Other embodiments terminate qualifying events in other manners.","Alternatively, in some embodiments, method  proceeds to disable the data packet generator after operating in the alert mode  if one or more criteria for disable are met. An example of a criterion for disable is the passage of a period of time following a qualifying event. Another example of a criterion for disable is the inability to communicate with previously neighboring data packet generators for a period of time. Another example of a criterion for disable is tampering that exceeds a predetermined threshold (e.g., a screw is removed, two or more screws are removed, if screws are removed in a certain order, if screws are not removed in a certain order, if screws are removed within a certain time period, if screws are not removed in a certain time frame, if a detected impact exceeds a predetermined impact threshold, if a temperature advances out of a safe operating range, etc.).","In some embodiments, disable  operates to put the data packet generator into a hibernation mode, such that the data packet generator ceases generating and outputting passcodes. In another embodiment, disable  operates to cause the data packet generator to clear data stored in memory, such as a passcode generation algorithm, passcode seed information, software, data regarding neighboring passcodes, or any other data stored in memory. In another possible embodiment, disable  causes the data packet generator to begin generating a different set of passcodes that appear to be valid passcodes but are valid or invalid passcodes that the server knows to be related to a disable event.","In some embodiments, an administrator or other authorized user can reset a data packet generator to return the data packet generator to normal mode  following alert mode  or disable . In some embodiments resetting the data packet generator involves restoring data previously erased from memory, such as by transmitting the data to the data packet generator.

The alert code digit is typically a number indicating the digit in the manual alert passcode where the alert code should be inserted. The alert code digit is typically a number between 1 and the sum of the number of digits in the current passcode and the number of digits in the alert code.

The reason for this is that in the manual alert mode the manual alert passcode must be viewed by a user and manually typed into a computer. A relatively short passcode makes it easier for a user to enter the passcode and reduces the chance of the passcode being entered incorrectly. It is preferred that the passcode be in a range from about 5 characters to about 15 characters, and preferably from about 7 characters to about 8 characters. It is also preferable that the manual alert passcode also be kept to about these ranges. Although a longer passcode can be used in some embodiments, a long passcode such as having 30 digits will typically be more difficult and cumbersome for a user to enter manually. Alternatively, a longer passcode may be formed of two or more sequential passcodes having a relatively short length.","Since it is desirable to limit the length of the manual alert passcode, the amount of information that may be conveyed by the alert code is also limited. An example of the information that can be conveyed by the alert code is provided in table 1 herein.","There are multiple reasons for including a manual mode of operation in a data packet generator. First, some computers may not be configured to receive automatic alerts (such as if they do not include a wireless communication device). Second, in the event that a communication device on either the data packet generator or the computing device malfunctions, the manual mode is available as a backup method. This, for example, ensures that no user is prevented from accessing system resources due to a malfunctioning communication device. Third, the manual mode can be used as a higher security mode, such as by disabling wireless communication of passcodes, to prevent unauthorized or inappropriate receipt of passcodes.

First, the user enters the room and dials a telephone number to access an automated conference room confirmation system. The system asks the user to enter the passcode provided by data packet generator . The user then types the code into the telephone keypad. The passcode is communicated to server  which validates that the passcode is a valid code. The validation is then communicated through computing device  to conference room scheduler , which confirms that the conference room is being used. In some embodiments the conference room scheduler  operates on a server, such that information about conference room availability is available to other users.","If such confirmation is not received, room scheduler  releases the conference room reservation to make the conference room generally available for any other user that needs a conference room.","In the event that a conference was not previously scheduled and the conference room is not currently being used, some embodiments also allow a user to reserve a conference room using a similar process. The user enters the room and turns on the lights, dials a telephone number, and enters the passcode from data packet generator . The system may also prompt the user for other information, such as a user ID number, the duration of the conference, or any other information. The system then updates the room scheduler  to show that the conference room is in use.","If the user does not reserve the room in this way, the conference room control system will automatically shut off the lights after a period of time, in some embodiments, assuming that the conference room is not currently being used. Some embodiments include motion detectors, sound detectors or decibel meters, or other sensors to determine if a conference room is in use.","In some embodiments, after validating the passcode entered into telephone  as being valid, the server  orally issues a sister passcode to the user. The user enters the sister passcode into computing device  or uses an input device of data packet generator  to enter the sister passcode into data packet generator . If entered into the data packet generator , the data packet generator then validates the sister passcode and sends an alert message (such as via a wireless communication device) to the conference room control system . In either case, the conference room control system  operates to grant access to room resources, such as the lights (e.g., turn on the lights) or any other desired resources.","Some embodiments conserve energy by shutting down lights or other resources when not in use (e.g., temperature control systems) or by opening or closing curtains or blinds appropriately.","Some embodiments work to create a high performance building where resources are automatically made available if they are not being used. For example, if a conference room has been reserved but is not occupied within a period of time, the conference room is released from the reservation so that the space is made available to others.","In some embodiments an authentication system is used to determine the location of a device (such as a computing device), even if the device is currently turned off. To do so, the device is equipped with a remotely controllable power switch. The server issues a request to turn on the device. The request is received by the remotely controllable power switch (such as via a wireless or wired communication signal), which causes the device to turn on. The device is then programmed to automatically search for a data packet generator communication including a passcode. Once received, the device sends a data packet to the server across a network, such as including a passcode. The server receives the data packet and uses data within the packet, such as the passcode, to identify the location of the device. Subsequent action may then be taken, such as to physically collect the missing device or to record the current location of the device in memory of the server. In some embodiments if a device is not located within a period of time, a long distance signal is broadcast (such as a worldwide data signal) that instructs the device to erase its memory.","Some embodiments require that multiple passcodes be received from multiple data packet generators. For example, if a vehicle is driving down the road and is equipped with a computing device, the computing device receives passcodes or data packets from multiple data packet generators arranged along the road. The passcodes or data from data packets are stored in memory and in some embodiments are communicated to another device, such as a server. The passcode information identifies not only particular locations, but shows a path that was taken by the vehicle. This information may then be compiled for subsequent use, such as to determine payments that need to be made (e.g., a toll way), to pay taxes, or for a variety of other uses. Similarly, this information is used in some embodiments to control a fleet of moving vehicles, such as to control the speeds, orientations, directions, or routes of the vehicles. Data packets from the data packet generators are collected by each vehicle as it moves.","Similarly, if a person walks down a hallway, multiple passcodes from multiple data packet generators arranged along that hallway can be collected. In some embodiments access to a protected resource is not granted unless a particular set of passcodes has been received within a period of time, such as to prove that a person walked down the hallway. If another path is taken (such as by walking around the outside of the building), access to the protected resource is not granted.","In some embodiments the identity of a device and the location of a device are merged to create another type of passcode. For example, a tank could integrate an authentication code as a way to prove that the tank is in fact a particular tank. Further, a motion sensitive GPS unit is stationed nearby the tank (e.g., five feet away). A communication device receives passcodes from both the tank and the GPS unit and generates a merged passcode from the combination of the two passcodes. If the communication device is unable to generate the merged passcode, an alert is issued (e.g., to Homeland Security).","In some embodiments look up charts are provided by the server to a security department periodically, such as once per hour, minute, hour, day, year, etc. The look up charts provide passcode information for a particular set of data packet generators over that period of time. In some embodiments, each data packet generator is associated with a set of passcodes that the data packet generator will generate during that period. One method of identifying if this information is mishandled is to insert known misinformation into the lists occasionally. If the misinformation is detected by a server, the server is alerted that a potential security breach had occurred. For example, each data packet generator is, in some embodiments, programmed to generate two passcodes at a time. Only one of the passcodes is used for communication. The other passcode is used, for example, to identify the particular data packet generator that is being targeted, and acts to alert the server that a potential security breach had occurred.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0379","num":"0378"},"figref":"FIG. 32","b":["3200","3200","3202","3204","3206"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0380","num":"0379"},"figref":"FIG. 33","b":["3202","3302","3302","1","2","1","2","3302"]},"A data packet generator operates in some embodiments to generate a code that is analogous to a DNA strand and can be used in the identification of anything associated with the code, whether living, non-living, physical (e.g., an object or location), or non-physical (e.g., information stored in digital form). Accordingly, some embodiments are a biomimic of DNA. In some embodiments, a process for authenticating using numerical codes is referred to as dynamic numeric authentication, and can also be abbreviated with the acronym DNA. In contrast to identification through natural DNA, dynamic numeric authentication uses numbers in place of chemicals and time in place of length in some embodiments. Accordingly, an advantage of dynamic numeric authentication is that authentication can be achieved without the identifier having to take up space (e.g., the size of time, numbers, and the sequence of numbers themselves is nothing). The only space consumed is that needed by hardware. Furthermore, when a code generator algorithm is used, an advantage of some embodiments is that the current codes disappear (or are deleted) once their time has expired, leaving no room for duplicating later on or elsewhere (and even if duplicated, the code is no longer valid after expiration). Further, such past codes do not have to continue to consume space in memory, in some embodiments.","In some embodiments, each code (e.g., A) generated is only a portion of an overall numerical code  (e.g., each code is a segment of numerical code ). If a particular code (e.g., A) is not sufficient to provide a unique identification, an additional code (e.g., A) or set of codes can be used until the combined codes (e.g., A and A) provide a unique identifier.","As previously illustrated in , natural DNA typically includes two uniting strands. In a similar manner, some embodiments of dynamic numeric authentication unite two or more identifiers to generate a combined identifier. As one example, a first data packet generator is in data communication with a nearby data packet generator (such as via wireless communication). The second data packet generator communicates a code to the first data packet generator. The first data packet generator then combines the received code with its own code and uses the combined code for identification.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0384","num":"0383"},"figref":["FIG. 34","FIG. 34"],"b":["3400","3400","3402","3404","3404","3404","3400"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0385","num":"0384"},"figref":"FIG. 35","b":["3500","3500","3502","3504","3506","3508","3500","3510","3512","3502","3520"]},"In this example, server  is configured to communicate across network , such as the Internet or other data communication network.

For example, computing device  can send messages to network  or server  by sending the messages to wireless access point . Similarly, server  or network  can send messages to computing device  by sending the messages through wireless access point .","When computing device  has formed data communication path , most existing operating systems will not allow computing device  to also join an additional wireless communication network (although such dual communication is expected to be included as a feature in Microsoft\u00ae Windows\u00ae 7). As a result, if computing device  (or the associated user) wanted to connect temporarily to another communication path, data communication path  would have to be terminated, and the alternate communication path be established. After communication, the alternate communication path would need to be terminated, and communication path  reestablished. This process, particularly if being done automatically by a computer, could be disruptive to a user who is trying to send or receive data with computing device  across communication path .","As a result, another option is illustrated in . In this example, even when data communication path  is established, computing device  is configured to wirelessly receive additional SSIDs from devices other than (or in addition to) wireless access point .

For example, data packet generator \u2032 broadcasts an SSID of SSID # and data packet generator \u2033 broadcasts an SSID of SSID#. Computing device  is configured to receive the SSIDs, even when data communication path  is active.","The SSIDs of data packet generators \u2032 and \u2033 are used to convey information to computing device  in some embodiments. For example, some embodiments insert a data packet into the SSID so as to convey an entire data packet to computing device  through SSID # or SSID #. In this way, data generators \u2032 and \u2033 can send data to computing device , without interrupting communication path .","One example of a data packet that is inserted into an SSID is a serial number of the data packet generator \u2032 or \u2033. Another example of a data packet is a passcode, such as including seven characters (or other passcodes described herein). Another possible example includes multiple passcodes, such as a previous passcode, a current passcode, and a next passcode. Yet another possible embodiment includes a serial number and one or more (two, three, four, or more) passcodes. One specific example of an SSID includes a serial number (e.g., seven digits), and three passcodes (e.g., each being seven digits).

In some embodiments the SSIDs are then stored in memory of computing device , such as in a table . In addition, in some embodiments the strength of the signal is measured by computing device , and the relative strength associated with each SSID is also stored in memory, such as in table . In this example, SSID # has a strength of four bars (e.g., high strength), SSID # has a strength of three bar (e.g., good strength), and SSID # has a strength of three bars (e.g., moderate strength). Other embodiments identify strengths in other units, such as in mW or dBm.","The relative signal strength is one indication of the proximity of data packet generators \u2032 and \u2033 to computing device . In the example shown in , for example, it is likely that data packet generator \u2032 is closer to computing device  than data packet generator \u2032, due to the higher signal strength of the signal including the SSID # as compared to the signal strength of SSID #. Although the signal strength can be attenuated by objects, such as a wall, between the data packet generators  and computing device , the signal strength is typically a good indication of relative distances. This information can be combined with additional information to obtain more accurate distance or location information in some embodiments.","After receiving the SSIDs, computing device  evaluates the SSIDs to determine whether the SSID is a data packet from a data packet generator . In some embodiments this is performed by evaluating the content of the SSID, to determine if it conforms to an expected format, such as including a certain number of characters or digits, or including a particular code or identifier. In other embodiments, the SSIDs are all communicated to a server , which evaluates the SSIDs to determine which, if any, of the SSIDs are associated with a data packet generator . For example, the server  first determines whether the serial number in the SSID is a valid serial number of a data packet generator. If so, the server  next determines whether one or more of the passcodes in the data packet is a valid passcode for the identified data packet generator.","After each SSID has been evaluated, whether by the computing device or server , a list of the nearby data packet generators  is determined. In this example, SSID # and SSID # are both determined to contain a data packet. For each SSID that included a valid data packet, the signal strengths in table  are then evaluated to identify the signal having the strongest signal strength. In this example, the signal associated with SSID # is determined to have the strongest signal strength. As a result, data packet generator \u2032 is determined to be the nearest data packet generator, in some embodiments.","In some embodiments, after a particular data packet generator \u2032 has been identified as being the nearest neighbor to another data packet generator \u2033, that data packet generator \u2032 will continue to be reported (or identified) as the nearest neighbor (even if the signal strength of data packet generator \u2032 falls below another data packet generator \u2032\u2033) until that data packet generator \u2032 is no longer available. This embodiment prevents false reports of movement based on small changes in signal strength, for example.","In another possible embodiment, data packet generators  operate to receive signals from other data packet generators , and\/or from computing device . The information is communicated from the data packet generator  to server , such as by sending the information to wireless access point , or via a wired network connection.","In some embodiments a computing device operates to collect all of the data packets from a plurality of data packet generators, such as by wirelessly receiving and recording in memory each SSID that is transmitted by the data packet generators that are within a wireless communication range. The computing device then reports the collected data back to a server where is stored in memory and processed.","Further, in some embodiments full data packets are also received by the computing device (either via a wired network or wireless network) containing additional data. The computing device receives the full data packet as well as the SSID data packet and merges the data. In some embodiments the merged data is then communicated to the server.","Some computing devices described herein include a wireless communication card that is configured to receive SSIDs, but are not configured to join a wireless network identified by the SSID.

Other embodiments have differently shaped signal regions, such that the distance of signal range R can be different in different directions.","In some embodiments, data packet generators  have different wireless power levels, providing variable signal ranges. For example, some embodiments include a low and a high signal level. Another embodiment includes a high, medium, and low power level. A further embodiment includes four signal levels ranging from low to high. Yet other embodiments have more signal levels, such as five or more or ten or more signal levels.","One example embodiment of mesh network  operates as follows. At a predetermined time (such as periodically each minute, hour, day, week, month, or year), all data packet generators  wake up, form an ad hoc network and exchange a data packet. In some embodiments, each data packet generator  begins with the lowest wireless power level, such as a low power level. The data packet generators then wait to receive a data packet from a neighboring data packet generator. If received, the data packet (or data from the data packet) is stored in memory. In some embodiments, the data packet generator associated with the received data packet is identified by the receiving data packet generator as being the nearest neighbor. If more than one data packet is received, then, in some embodiments, each of the data packet generators are identified as being the nearest neighbors. Alternatively, the relative strength of the received signals are used to further identify relative distances of data packet generators.","If a data packet is received, in some embodiments, the data packet generator  then stops broadcasting. Alternatively, if only a single wireless power level is to be used, data packet generator  stops broadcasting.","In other embodiments, the data packet generator  continues broadcasting to search for additional neighbors. The wireless power level is adjusted to the next higher setting, and a second data packet is broadcast. The data packet generator  then waits to receive a data packet from one or more neighboring data packet generators. If received, the data packet (or data from the data packet) is stored in memory. The process of increasing the wireless power level, broadcasting a data packet, and receiving a data packet (if any) continues, in some embodiments, until the data packet generator  has broadcast a data packet at the highest power level, or highest selected power level.","This process allows data packet generators  to identify their neighbors and to provide at least some information about the respective locations of each data packet generator.","In the example shown in , mesh network  includes four data packet generators \u2032, \u2033, \u2032\u2033, and \u2033\u2033. At the predetermined time, all data packet generators form an ad hoc network and exchange data packets within the respective signal ranges R, R, R, and R.","The data packet generators then receive data packets from neighboring data packet generators. For example, data packet generator \u2032 receives a data packet from data packet generator \u2033 because it is within signal range R. Data packet generator \u2033 receives a data packet from data packet generators \u2032 and \u2032\u2033 because it is within the signal ranges R and R. Data packet generator \u2032\u2033 receives data packets from data packet generators \u2033 and \u2033\u2033 because it is within the signal ranges R and R. Data packet generator \u2033\u2033 receives a data packet from data packet generator \u2032\u2033 because it is within the signal range R.","After storing the data in memory, in some embodiments data packet generators are configured to insert some or all of the data into a data packet to be subsequently transmitted to another device, such as server , another data packet generator , or a computing device.","When received by server , for example, the server acts in some embodiments to process the data and to determine whether any position or location changes have occurred. In some embodiments, server  identifies a location, or approximate location, of a data packet generator  based on the locations of its nearest neighbors. In some embodiments the location data is used to generate a user interface display or is associated with a CAFM system. In other embodiments, tampering or relocating is detected by identifying the absence of a data packet generator that was previously within a mesh network  or previously identified as a nearest neighbor to a particular data packet generator. Sometimes an accelerometer is used to identify which device experienced motion, since the data packets for all nearby data packet generators may change with just one simple reconfigure.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0469","num":"0468"},"figref":["FIGS. 52-53","FIG. 52","FIG. 53"],"b":["5200","5200","5200"]},"One example of a data packet  includes data .

In this example, data packet  includes a set of standard data, but also includes an expansion data field where a number of expansion data sets are identified. For example, a standard set of data includes a serial number, a passcode, and an expansion data field. If a data packet generator needs to communicate additional data, the quantity of additional expansion data sets necessary is indicated in the expansion data field. For example, the quantity 2 is inserted into the expansion data field to indicate that two additional expansion data sets are included. The data packet is then expanded to include two additional data sets to include the additional data, for example, temperature data and asset tag data, or any other desired data. This provides a data packet having variable length. This improves efficiency by not requiring that empty data fields be transmitted in each data packet, and improves flexibility by allowing any desired data to be transmitted. In some embodiments a header is included in each expansion data set to identify the type of data being transmitted in the each expansion data set.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0478","num":"0477"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE
