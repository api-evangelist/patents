{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS AND PRESENTLY PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["A channel of distribution, also referred to as a distribution channel, a marketing channel, a marketing channel network or a channel marketing network, may be defined as the collection of organizational units, institutions, or agencies within, external to, or inclusive of a manufacturer of products and\/or services, which perform the functions that support product and\/or service distribution and\/or marketing, such as conducting product and\/or service advertising campaigns. The marketing functions are pervasive and may include buying, selling, transporting, storing, grading, financing, bearing market risk, and providing marketing information. Any organizational unit, institution, or agency that performs or assists in the performance of one or more of the marketing functions may be a member of a channel marketing network.","Participants of a particular channel marketing network may include a sponsor, one or more intermediaries and one or more resellers. Sponsors are typically a manufacturer or other originator of products and\/or services for sale to consumers and may promulgate one or more particular exclusive brands. Resellers are organizations or entities, such as retail outlets or direct sales organizations, which typically purchase, directly or indirectly, products and\/or services from a sponsor with the intent to resell those products and\/or services to consumers. Intermediaries may include organizations or entities, such as a distributor or reseller association, which facilitate the sale of products and\/or services of one or more sponsors by one or more resellers.","In any given channel marketing network, each participant may have an interest in marketing, e.g. conducting advertising campaigns for, the particular products and\/or services of a particular sponsor, to facilitate sales to consumers and generation of revenue. Further, sponsor participants may be interested in coordinating with, or otherwise helping, other participants, e.g. intermediary and\/or reseller participants, to conduct advertising campaigns as well as to manage those campaigns to ensure, for example, consistent brand presentation, avoidance of activities detrimental to the brand, ensure fair opportunities among participants and generally minimize inefficiencies in the marketing and sales process.","The disclosed embodiments relate to a marketing system, also referred to as a platform, which facilitates centralized management of marketing activities among multiple participants of multiple channel marketing networks, where the marketing activities may include determination of one or more consumers to which marketing content is to be presented and a provision of marketing content thereto. In particular, the disclosed embodiments relate to a technology platform that allows members of a channel marketing network, including, for example, sponsors\/OEMs, distributors, buying groups, and resellers, to link to each other to create connections that allow a secure and managed exchange of marketing content, funding and contact data, for the purpose of executing shared business processes, such as co-marketing related processes, and having access to the results thereof. The disclosed embodiments provide an advertising platform which facilitates participant discovery and channel network formation, segregates marketing activities between channel marketing networks and among the participants of a particular channel marketing network, generates and conducts marketing campaigns on behalf of participants based on internally generated and\/or participant provided marketing content and directed to participant identified contacts, facilitates the funding of those marketing campaigns by one or more participants, and facilitates gathering and evaluation of the results thereof.","As opposed to single-sponsor systems, the disclosed embodiments centralize marketing related processes and activities across multiple channel marketing networks comprising sponsor, intermediary and reseller participants, standardizing workflow and eliminating inconsistent and inefficient or duplicative application. Further, the disclosed embodiment enable intra- and inter-channel marketing network functionality such as support for multiple sponsors as well as overlapping or discrete channel marketing networks, real-time approvals, real-time provision of funding, co-funding of transactions, enforcement of business process constraints and rules, and marketing activity management.","To clarify the use in the pending claims and to hereby provide notice to the public, the phrases \u201cat least one of <A>, <B>, . . . and <N>\u201d or \u201cat least one of <A>, <B>, . . . <N>, or combinations thereof\u201d are defined by the Applicant in the broadest sense, superceding any other implied definitions herebefore or hereinafter unless expressly asserted by the Applicant to the contrary, to mean one or more elements selected from the group comprising A, B, . . . and N, that is to say, any combination of one or more of the elements A, B, . . . or N including any one element alone or in combination with one or more of the other elements which may also include, in combination, additional elements not listed.","In one embodiment, the platform may be a shared instance enabling multiple channel marketing networks and syndication of marketing content, allocation and\/or distribution of funds and centralized execution of marketing activities within and\/or between each channel marketing network, i.e., one sponsor may connect with multiple intermediaries, such as distribution partners, and multiple resellers, one intermediary may connect with multiple sponsors and multiple resellers, and one reseller may connect with multiple sponsors and multiple distribution companies. As will be described, each connection in a particular channel marketing network may follow participant-defined rules defining the type and amount of content, data, communication, and funds that may be exchanged. The system may support thousands of inter-connected and overlapping networks\u2014much like a social network, but rather than just connecting and communicating, the participants of the various marketing channel networks will be able to execute, e.g. in real time, business transactions and shared business processes, such as the creation, funding, coordination, execution and evaluation of marketing and advertising campaigns.","As used herein, a consumer may be an individual or organization, corporate or otherwise, which purchases or otherwise acquires products and\/or services with the intent to use or consume those products and\/or services, i.e. for its own use or consumption. Typically, the products and\/or services are acquired from a reseller or sponsor, described in more detail below, in response to an advertising campaign advertising those products and\/or services and conducted by the sponsor, intermediary and\/or reseller via the disclosed embodiments as will be described.","A sponsor may be an individual or organization, corporate or otherwise, such as a company, which is a manufacturer, original equipment manufacturer (\u201cOEM\u201d), service provider, supplier, and\/or brand that sells or otherwise originates one or more products and\/or services, such as branded products or services, for sale to one or more consumers, such as through a direct or an indirect sales channel. A sponsor may rely on other independent businesses to be resellers of the sponsor's products and\/or services. The resellers may receive those products and\/or services directly from the sponsor, or the products and\/or services may come through intermediaries such as distributors or buying groups. As will be discussed in more detail below, in one embodiment, a sponsor is interested in assisting others to market the products and\/or services of the sponsor and may provide marketing content, funds, and\/or contact data to its resellers, but may not receive marketing content, funds, and\/or contact data from other sponsors. In particular, the disclosed embodiments enable a sponsor to syndicate marketing content, i.e. publish, supply or otherwise make marketing content available to multiple participants substantially simultaneously. Along with marketing content, funds and contact data, the sponsor can specify rules, explained in more detail below, which enable the sponsor to guide, control or otherwise coordinate the marketing activities of its channel marketing network participants. As will be further discussed, the disclosed embodiments enable a sponsor to see which of its resellers ran its sponsored advertising campaigns, and to see aggregate results of campaigns, such as how many opens, clicks, respondents, leads occurred, or overall survey results. To protect the interests of the other participants, such as resellers, the disclosed embodiments may prevent a sponsor from accessing the identities of individual leads as those may be considered proprietary to the reseller.","A reseller may be an individual, organization or business which sells products and\/or services originated by another company, e.g. a sponsor, to one or more consumers, i.e. a reseller may be an entity that purchases for the intent of selling rather than consuming. A reseller may be associated with, i.e. may sell the products and\/or services of, one or more sponsors and may obtain those products and\/or services directly from the source sponsor or indirectly, such as via an intermediary. In one embodiment, as will be described in more detail below, a reseller may receive marketing content, funds, and\/or contact data from one or more sponsors and\/or intermediaries but may not provide marketing content, funds, and\/or contact data to other resellers.","An intermediary may be an individual or organization, corporate or otherwise, such as a company, which may facilitate the sale or marketing of one or more products and\/or services by one or more sponsors and\/or resellers to one or more consumers. An intermediary may serve as an aggregator of sponsor products and\/or services, i.e. a distributor, to distribute to resellers. Examples include distributors, buying associations or groups, marketing organizations, etc. In one embodiment, as will be described below, an intermediary may receive marketing content, funds, and\/or contact data from one or more sponsors and may provide sponsor-provided or its own marketing content, funds, and\/or contact data to one or more resellers. Intermediaries may conduct their own marketing activities and\/or assist, alone or in conjunction with sponsor provided resources, others, e.g. resellers, in conducting marketing activities. For example, the disclosed embodiments may facilitate the co-funding by a sponsor and intermediary, at least partially, of the expense of a marketing campaign conducted by a reseller via the disclosed marketing system.","It will be appreciated that the characterization of an individual or organization or other entity as a consumer, sponsor, intermediary or reseller may depend upon the particular transaction undertaken by the entity and that a given entity may be characterized as being in a first category for one transaction, e.g. as a consumer, and in another category for a different transaction, e.g. as a sponsor. As such, the disclosed embodiments may be applicable to Business to Consumer (\u201cB2C\u201d) transactions as well as Business to Business (\u201cB2B\u201d) transactions.","In the disclosed embodiments, as will be described below, participants, e.g. individuals and\/or organizations, corporate or otherwise, register with the marketing system as either being a sponsor, intermediary or reseller. As will be used herein, the terms sponsor or sponsor company, intermediary or intermediary company, and reseller or reseller company, may refer to both a category of participation in the disclosed system and to a participant registered in that category. In an alternate embodiment, a participant may be permitted to register in more than one category for the purpose of being able to participate in different transactions in different roles.","In one embodiment, a channel marketing network is a set of one or more participants who have agreed, explicitly or implicitly, to be associated for the purpose of at least conducting one or more marketing activities as will be described. A channel marketing network may include one or more sponsors alone or further include one or more intermediaries and\/or one or more resellers. While a channel marketing network may include any combination of sponsors, intermediaries and resellers, in one embodiment a channel marketing network will always have at least one sponsor or intermediary, which may be considered to own or otherwise control, direct or manage the network, and at least one reseller. The channel marketing network may further include one or more intermediaries. In one embodiment, a sponsor or intermediary may invite and\/or approve other participants, registered or non-registered, to enable them to register with the marketing system and\/or join the sponsor's or intermediary's network. Alternatively, or in addition thereto, participants may be permitted to discover and join networks at their discretion, such as by viewing a list of available sponsors, intermediaries and or channel marketing networks. In one embodiment, sponsors and\/or intermediaries may limit the visibility or otherwise constrain the availability of their channel marketing networks to only those participants meeting specified criteria, such as specific identity, type or location. In this way, sponsors and\/or intermediaries may make their channel marketing networks available to specific participants without having to first identify and invite those participants to join, or otherwise deny access to participants they wish to avoid without having to specifically disapprove of their joining a particular channel marketing network.","As will be described in more detail below, channel marketing networks may be defined within the marketing system as groups to which participants belong. A participant wishing to implement a channel marketing network defines the group and either invites other participants to join and\/or makes the group available to other participants, or specified subsets thereof, to join, with or without approval of the initiating participant. In one implementation, the group is characterized by one or more permissions which define the criteria for participation. The marketing system mediates invitations, requests and\/or approvals according to the specified criteria, if any, to associate participants with a given channel marketing network in accordance therewith. In one embodiment, the marketing system may maintain a database storing records for each participant wherein each record identifies the channel marketing networks to which the particular participant belongs. Alternatively, or in addition thereto, channel marketing groups may be defined by inter-participant associations, e.g. participant-to-participant links, wherein each connection between two or more participants may be further defined by one or more rules defining the parameters of the connection, such as constraints on data sharing, communication or specifying a common characteristic, and wherein the marketing system mediates inter-participant interaction according to the criteria. In one implementation, each participant record in the database may identify each other participant to which the particular participant is associated and\/or linked and the criteria defining the parameters of the interconnection, wherein a collection of interconnected participants having particular interconnection parameters represents a channel marketing network.","Sponsors, intermediaries and resellers may belong to more than one channel marketing network and a channel marketing network of one sponsor, i.e. the set of participants, may or may not overlap the channel marketing network of another sponsor. For example, a sponsor may have more than one channel marketing network so as to segregate groups of participants, such as particular types of resellers. As will be described, marketing content, funding and contact data may be provided by a participant subject to rules specified by the participant as to how the marketing content, funding and\/or contact data may be distributed to or used by members of the participant's channel marketing network. The disclosed system enforces the specified rules enabling segregation of marketing activities between, and control of marketing activities within, channel marketing networks. In one embodiment, a channel marketing network may consist of a single sponsor which wishes to use the marketing system to market its own products and\/or services as described herein. In one implementation, this sponsor may be registered as a reseller in the marketing system wherein the marketing system itself is registered as a sponsor thereto, in particular wherein the marketing system is producing marketing content therefore.","Marketing content includes advertisements and other collateral, such as images, animation, video and\/or descriptive text, relating to one or more products and\/or services offered by a sponsor and may describe the products and\/or services, as well as discounts, promotions and\/or offers related thereto. Marketing content may be in a form applicable to distribution via one or more media formats, such as postal mail, electronic mail, Internet\/web based advertising, telemarketing, or combinations thereof. Further, marketing content may be at least partially customizable, such as to allow the inclusion of the name of an intermediary or reseller from which the products and\/or services may be obtained by a consumer, and\/or to direct the advertisement's message to the specific consumer to which it is presented. In one embodiment, marketing content may merely specify the parameters of a desired promotion, such as the subject product and a specification of a discount offer, where the marketing system is engaged to produce the advertisement, e.g. descriptive text, images, etc., for subsequent distribution. As will be described, marketing content is typically provided by a sponsor or intermediary to the marketing system and made available to their associated channel marketing network, e.g. associated resellers, to be used to execute advertising campaigns via the marketing system.","Marketing content, funding and contact data may all be provided subject to rules which govern the use of the content, funding or contact data. The rules, which are enforced by the marketing system, enable the provider of the marketing content, funding data or contact data, to control the use thereof to ensure that their business goals are achieved. As will be described, rules may be specified to generally limit which participants may have access to the marketing content, funding and contact data, as well as the extent of such access.","In one embodiment, marketing content may be provided, i.e. made available or syndicated, such as to a particular channel marketing network, subject to content rules which specify, for example, a fee for use of the marketing content, the extent to which the content may be modified by a participant who wishes to use the marketing content, the duration for which the marketing content may be used, etc. For example, the content rules may restrict modifications of the marketing content to allow a reseller only to insert their name but otherwise restrict any other changes such as the addition of co-related products or services offered by an intermediary or reseller. Content rules enable the provider of the marketing content, e.g. a sponsor or intermediary, to control the use of that content and ensure use which is consistent with their marketing goals, for example, to ensure consistent brand presentation.","As discussed above, and described in more detail below, participants, such as sponsors or intermediaries, may provide marketing content or contact data to the system to be made available to other participants of the channel marketing network for the purpose running advertising campaigns via the marketing system. Such marketing content and\/or contact data may be provided for free or for a fee. Further, the marketing system may charge a fee to execute a particular advertising campaign. To facilitate payment, the marketing system enables participants to provide funding data and funding rules wherein the funding data comprises funds, such as monies conveyed to an account maintained by the marketing system on behalf of the participant, or funding mechanisms such as a credit or debit card, to be used to cover the costs of acquiring marketing content and\/or contact data from another participant or from the marketing system, and cover the costs of executing advertising campaigns. Further, the marketing system may permit, subject to the funding rules, a participant to provide or otherwise allocate funds to another participant to be used to acquire marketing content or contact data or otherwise execute advertising campaigns. The marketing system may maintain accounts for each participant. In one embodiment, a participant may initiate a request for funds from another participant to which the requestee may respond. Alternatively, or in addition thereto, a participant may allocate funds to other participants. In either case, funds may be provisioned subject to rules specifying how those funds may be used, such as to cover all or only a portion of the execution of an advertising campaign. For example, a sponsor may allocate funds to each of their resellers subject to the rule that the funds may only be used to cover up to half of the cost of an advertising campaign. Participants may obtain funds from multiple sources and may be permitted to combine funds from those multiple sources as specified by the funding rules associated therewith. For example, a sponsor may provide funds to cover half of the cost of an advertising campaign executed by a reseller while an intermediary provides funds to cover the remaining half. Further, funds may be allocated by one participant, such as a sponsor, to another participant, such as intermediary, for the purpose of reallocation, such as to resellers. Funding may further be specific to marketing content thereby allowing, for example, a sponsor to fund a particular advertising campaign and not others. In this way, the marketing system acts as data exchange, a financial intermediary, a market place and a service provider.","Contact data is data which identifies one or more consumers, such as by email address, telephone number, postal address, etc., to which, for example, marketing content, such as an advertisement, may be directed, such as by electronic mail, postal mail, telephone, Internet ad, or combinations thereof. Contact data may further include demographic and personal information about the consumers which may be used, for example, to further tailor or direct an advertising campaign. As used herein, a contact refers to a consumer that is a potential recipient, i.e. has yet to receive particular marketing content. A target refers to a consumer to which particular marketing content has been sent, presented or otherwise provided but not necessarily viewed or otherwise perceived. A lead refers to a consumer to which particular marketing content has been provided and which has demonstrated some form of interest or has otherwise responded to the marketing content, such as by opening a link, requesting more information or otherwise seeking to purchase the product or service advertised by the marketing content.","Contact data may be provided subject to contact rules which specify, for example, a duration for which at least a portion of the contact data identifying a subset of the one or more consumers may be exclusively accessed by any one registered participant to execute an advertising campaign, a duration for which at least a portion of the contact data identifying a subset of one or more target consumers may be exclusively accessed by any one registered participant subsequent to executing a marketing campaign to see if any of the target consumers become leads, and a duration for which at least a portion of the contact data identifying a subset of the one or more consumers may be exclusively accessed by any one registered participant subsequent to the execution of an advertising campaign to see if any leads actually purchase the product. In this way, a sponsor, for example, can segregate marketing activities among their marketing channel to segregate markets, as well as prevent duplicative marketing activities and inefficient competition among resellers. Effectively, participants can \u201ccheck out\u201d or otherwise reserve particular contacts for exclusive periods while the provider of those contact can ensure that the contacts are used, i.e. marketed to, in a timely manner.","As will be described herein, generally, registered participants may access the marketing system to form and\/or join one or more channel marketing networks, identify available marketing content and cause the marketing system to execute one or more advertising campaigns on their behalf to one or more consumers. As part of the service of executing advertising campaigns, the marketing system may further obtain results of campaign, such as which targets became leads, such as by determining click-throughs, or other consumer responses. These results may then be made available, in the aggregate or in detail, to the participant who ran the advertising campaign, and may be further made available, in the aggregate or in detail, to other participants of the associated channel marketing network. Further participants, such as sponsors, may be able to monitor the activities of other participants in their channel marketing network, such as resellers, to determine, for example, how many advertising campaigns they have run and the results thereof.","Advantageously, the disclosed marketing system simplifies the formation of channel marketing networks, i.e. makes it easier for sponsors to engage their channel network partners and allows for secure exchange of information among participants of a channel marketing network, i.e. simplifies communication among the layers of the distribution channel. This enables a sponsor, for example, to more readily guide and control marketing activities and gain visibility to results and enable their channel partners to market the sponsor's brand. Other channel network participants are provided with a unified portal through to communicate with multiple sponsors, obtain marketing content and contact data, execute advertising campaigns and view the results thereof. The funding mechanisms of the disclosed system enable the channel partners to leverage sponsor resources and facilitate sponsor-funded activities by ensuring funding resources are provided or otherwise allocated in real time rather than subjecting participants to a reimbursement cycle.","In one example of the operation of the disclosed embodiments, a sponsor may have new product launch that it wants its resellers to promote. The sponsor may fund an integrated marketing campaign including three separate emails, two direct mail post cards, content for all available social media outlets, an online advertisement for local targets, and lead classification via telemarketing. 50% of resellers work through a distributor, the other 50% are house accounts. The sponsor uploads campaign elements to marketing system which then allows the sponsor's marketing team to define sequencing of each marketing element in the integrated campaign and conduct litmus testing on each element. The sponsor decides what parts of each element can be customized by the resellers. The sponsor then uploads a centralized contact database to the marketing system to distribute to resellers. The sponsor may expect resellers to market the campaign to their own target lists, but may also want to make available additional leads that had been collected centrally. The sponsor further sets campaign budgets and allocations and may elect to cap the budget per reseller, and\/or set a reimbursement percentage for specific resellers, or require that dealers request approval on a campaign-by-campaign basis. The sponsor may allocate funds to resellers directly, or allocate pools of funds to distributors for them to allocate to individual resellers. If pooled funds given to an intermediary for reallocation, such as distributor, the intermediary is notified to access the marketing system to reallocate those funds to resellers. Intermediaries with pooled funds have the same options to allocate funds or require approvals for individual resellers as the sponsor is afforded. Resellers are notified of the campaign so that they can access the marketing system to make customizations and define the target consumers to which it will be addressed. The resellers customize the marketing content within approved guidelines, elects which social media outlets to post to, set the parameters for online ad placement, and target the email and direct mail elements towards the appropriate targets. The resellers are able to run to both geo-allocated prospects from the centralized sponsor contact database, and to their own target lists. Centralized prospects from the sponsor have locked, time-boxed assignment to individual resellers to avoid channel conflict. The resellers approve and purchases the campaign using a combination of funds made available by the sponsor, by intermediary, and\/or its own funds. Pre-approved print and telemarketing vendors are notified of the order, and log in to process the order, rates for which may have already been negotiated ahead of time and are established in the system. The marketing system tracks lead classification and other results to which the sponsor, intermediary and reseller may have appropriate access.","Referring to , there is shown a block diagram of a marketing system , according to one embodiment, for facilitating centralized management of a plurality of marketing activities among a plurality of participants  of a plurality of marketing networks, the plurality of marketing activities comprising at least a determination of one or more consumers  to which marketing content is to be presented and a provision of marketing content thereto. As will be described, the system  may implemented by a computer, such as the computer  described below with respect to , having a processor  and a memory  coupled therewith, and coupled with the participants  via a network , such as Internet or other wired and\/or wireless proprietary and\/or non-proprietary network .","The system  includes a registration processor , which may be implemented by first logic stored the memory  of the computer  and executable by the processor  or otherwise operative to register, such as via a user interface  coupled with the participants  via the network , each of the plurality of participants -with the marketing system as being in one of a first participation category or a second participation category, wherein a participant registered in the first participation category comprises an originator of one or more products or services for sale to the one or more consumers and a participant registered in the second participation category comprises a reseller of the one or more products or services to at least a subset of the one or more consumers -. For example, the first participation category may comprise sponsor participants such as manufacturers, OEM's, or promulgators of a particular brand. The second participation category may comprise reseller participants, i.e. one who purchases for the intent of selling rather than consuming. The one or more products or services sold by the reseller may have been obtained from a registered participant registered in the first participation category. The user interface  may be a web based or other type of network accessible interface generated by a web server executed by the processor  described below. It will be appreciated that the disclosed marketing system  may be accessed by the users thereof, i.e. the participants -, using any suitable device, mobile or otherwise, having suitable proprietary or non-proprietary software, such as a web browser program, and suitable network connectivity, e.g. a wired or wireless connection to the marketing system  via the network .","The system  also includes a database  stored in a memory , which may be the same or different from the memory , coupled with the registration processor  and operative to store a plurality of participant records, each of the plurality of participant records  being associated with one of the plurality of registered participants -and storing participant data characterizing the associated participant  as being registered in one of the first or second participation categories, each of the plurality of participant records  further storing network data indicative of the associated participant  belonging to at least one marketing network of the plurality of marketing networks. Herein, the phrase \u201ccoupled with\u201d is defined to mean directly connected to or indirectly connected through one or more intermediate components. Such intermediate components may include both hardware and software based components.","The system  further includes a marketing content processor , which may be implemented as second logic stored in the memory , coupled with the memory , and executable by the processor  or otherwise operative to receive, such as via the user interface \/network , first marketing content  and first content rules  associated therewith from a first registered participant  registered in the first participation category, store the first marketing content and first content rules in the database  and allow access to the stored first marketing content  to at least a first subset of other registered participants -of the plurality of registered participants -not registered in the first participation category and belonging to a first marketing network of the plurality of marketing networks to which the first registered participant  also belongs subject to the first content rules . For example, where a channel marketing network is permitted to have more than one participating sponsor, one sponsor may be prevented from accessing the marketing content  provided by another sponsor whereas other data, such as messages and other information may be freely shared among sponsors in the same channel marketing network. In an alternative embodiment, inter-sponsor sharing of marketing content  may be permitted such as to facilitate a co-sponsored product or joint product marketing, such as for complimentary or symbiotic products. The first content rules  may define at least an extent to which the first marketing content  may be modified by a registered participant  of the first subset of other registered participants -, a duration for which the first marketing content  may be exclusively accessed by a registered participant  of the first subset of other registered participants -, a cost to purchase the first marketing content  by a registered participant  of the first subset of other registered participants -, or a combination thereof.","The system  further including a funding processor , which may be implemented by third logic stored in the memory , coupled with the memory  and executable by the processor  or otherwise operative to receive first funding data  and first funding rules  associated therewith, such as via the user interface \/network , from the first registered participant  and store the first funding data  and first funding rules  in the database , the first funding data  specifying first funds available to at least indirectly fund at least a portion of at least one of the plurality of marketing activities by at least one registered participant  of the first subset of other registered participants -with respect to the first marketing content  subject to the first funding rules . The first funding rules  may define at least one condition upon which at least a portion of the first funds may be provided to a registered participant  of the first subset of other registered participants -to fund the at least one of the plurality of marketing activities with respect to the first marketing content . For example, the first funding rules  may specify that a percentage of the campaign may be paid for using the first funds, the remainder being covered by the registered participant .","In one embodiment, the registration processor  is further operative to register each of the plurality of participants -with the marketing system  as being in one of the first participation category, the second participation category or a third participation category, wherein a participant  registered in the third participation category, e.g. an intermediary participant, comprises a facilitator of the sale of the one or more products or services obtained from a registered participant  registered in the first participation category to at least a subset of the one or more consumers by one or more registered participants -registered in the second participation category. For example, each intermediary participant may be one of a distributor, organization, association, group, or combination thereof. In one embodiment, each of the plurality of marketing networks comprises only one participant registered in the first participation category and at least one participant registered in the second participation category.","The marketing content processor  may be further operative to receive second marketing content  and second content rules  associated therewith from a second registered participant  registered in the third participation category, store the second marketing content  and second content rules  in the database  and allow access to the stored second marketing content  to at least a second subset of other registered participants -of the plurality of registered participants -belonging to a second marketing network of the plurality of marketing networks to which the second registered participant  also belongs subject to the second content rules . The first marketing network may be the same as the second marketing network, may overlap with the second marketing network, i.e. have one or more participants in common, or be entirely discrete from the second marketing network.","The funding processor  may be further operative to receive second funding data  and second funding rules  associated therewith from the second registered participant  and store the second funding data  and second funding rules  in the database, the second funding data  specifying second funds available to at least indirectly fund at least a portion of at least one of the plurality of marketing activities by at least one registered participant  of the second subset of other registered participants -with respect to the second marketing content  subject to the second funding rules . In one embodiment, the first funding data  may further specify third funds available to at least indirectly fund at least a portion of at least one of the plurality of marketing activities by at least one registered participant  of the second subset of other registered participants -with respect to the second marketing content  subject to the first funding rules .

Further, in an exemplary, non-limited embodiment, implementations can include distributed processing, component\/object distributed processing, and parallel processing. Alternatively, virtual computer system processing can be constructed to implement one or more of the methods or functionality as described herein.","Although the present specification describes components and functions that may be implemented in particular embodiments with reference to particular standards and protocols, the invention is not limited to such standards and protocols. For example, standards for Internet and other packet switched network transmission (e.g., TCP\/IP, UDP\/IP, HTML, HTTP, HTTPS) represent examples of the state of the art. Such standards are periodically superseded by faster or more efficient equivalents having essentially the same functions. Accordingly, replacement standards and protocols having the same or similar functions as those disclosed herein are considered equivalents thereof.","The illustrations of the embodiments described herein are intended to provide a general understanding of the structure of the various embodiments. The illustrations are not intended to serve as a complete description of all of the elements and features of apparatus and systems that utilize the structures or methods described herein. Many other embodiments may be apparent to those of skill in the art upon reviewing the disclosure. Other embodiments may be utilized and derived from the disclosure, such that structural and logical substitutions and changes may be made without departing from the scope of the disclosure. Additionally, the illustrations are merely representational and may not be drawn to scale. Certain proportions within the illustrations may be exaggerated, while other proportions may be minimized. Accordingly, the disclosure and the figures are to be regarded as illustrative rather than restrictive.","One or more embodiments of the disclosure may be referred to herein, individually and\/or collectively, by the term \u201cinvention\u201d merely for convenience and without intending to voluntarily limit the scope of this application to any particular invention or inventive concept. Moreover, although specific embodiments have been illustrated and described herein, it should be appreciated that any subsequent arrangement designed to achieve the same or similar purpose may be substituted for the specific embodiments shown. This disclosure is intended to cover any and all subsequent adaptations or variations of various embodiments. Combinations of the above embodiments, and other embodiments not specifically described herein, will be apparent to those of skill in the art upon reviewing the description.","The Abstract of the Disclosure is provided to comply with 37 C.F.R. \u00a71.72(b) and is submitted with the understanding that it will not be used to interpret or limit the scope or meaning of the claims. In addition, in the foregoing Detailed Description, various features may be grouped together or described in a single embodiment for the purpose of streamlining the disclosure. This disclosure is not to be interpreted as reflecting an intention that the claimed embodiments require more features than are expressly recited in each claim. Rather, as the following claims reflect, inventive subject matter may be directed to less than all of the features of any of the disclosed embodiments. Thus, the following claims are incorporated into the Detailed Description, with each claim standing on its own as defining separately claimed subject matter.","It is therefore intended that the foregoing detailed description be regarded as illustrative rather than limiting, and that it be understood that it is the following claims, including all equivalents, that are intended to define the spirit and scope of this invention."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0005","num":"0004"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":"100"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0006","num":"0005"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
