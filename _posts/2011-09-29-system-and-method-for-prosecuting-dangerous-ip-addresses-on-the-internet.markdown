{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION","Example One","Example Two","Example Three"],"p":["The present application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61\/388,582, filed on Sep. 30, 2010, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.","Not Applicable","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention generally relates to identifying threat IP addresses (\u201cthreat IP's\u201d) on the internet and publishing information about threat IP's for consumption by network management products and network administrators to manage risk in network communications.","2. Description of the Related Art","The threat landscape is constantly changing, from the actors involved, as identified by IP addresses, URLs, and files, to the vectors of attack that they employ. As technology evolves, adding new paradigms such as cloud computing or social networking, new opportunities are created for exploitation by these bad actors. The key vector of attack is the web.","The motivation for \u2018hacking\u2019 or attacks upon vulnerable networks has also evolved, from simple notoriety and bragging rights to profit, which has significantly increased the investment in malicious software design and implementation, leading to more sophisticated and difficult to detect attacks.","Enterprises, and even the security solutions vendors themselves, have limited visibility into all of the malicious activity occurring on the internet, so there is a need to share data to increase visibility and gain better protection against a broader range of attacks.","Definitions for various terms are set forth below. Domain Name System (\u201cDNS\u201d) translates Internet domain names into numerical IP addresses.","HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is a method of mixing text and other content with layout and appearance commands in a text file, so that a browser can generate a displayed image from the file.","Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a set of conventions for controlling the transfer of information via the Internet from a Web server computer to a client computer, and also from a client computer to a Web server.","Internet is the worldwide, decentralized totality of server computers and data-transmission paths which can supply information to a connected and browser-equipped client computer, and can receive and forward information entered from the client computer.","Internet protocol (IP) is an address is the numerical reference for any device on a computer network using an Internet Protocol for communication between communication nodes.","Sub-domain is a label to the left of a top level domain of a domain name such as www. uspto.gov wherein uspto is a sub-domain.","Top level domain is the right most portion of a domain name such as www uspto.gov wherein .gov is the top level domain.","URL or Uniform Resource Locator is an address on the World Wide Web.","Web-Browser is a complex software program, resident in a client computer, that is capable of loading and displaying text and images and exhibiting behaviors as encoded in HTML (HyperText Markup Language) from the Internet, and also from the client computer's memory. Major browsers include MICROSOFT INTERNET EXPLORER, CHROME, APPLE SAFARI, MOZILLA FIREFOX, and OPERA.","Web-Server is a computer able to simultaneously manage many Internet information-exchange processes at the same time. Normally, server computers are more powerful than client computers, and are administratively and\/or geographically centralized. An interactive-form information-collection process generally is controlled from a server computer, to which the sponsor of the process has access. Servers usually contain one or more processors (CPUs), memories, storage devices and network interface cards. Servers typically store the HTML documents and\/or execute code that generates Web-pages that are sent to clients upon request. An interactive-form information-collection process generally is controlled from a server computer, to which the sponsor of the process has access.","Thus, there is a need to identify threatening events emanating from IP addresses in real-time, or as close as possible thereto, in order to warn network management products and network administrators of these threatening IP addresses.","The present invention is directed at a broad-based threat identification, not a niche solution for spam or other specific attack vector.","The present invention utilizes first-hand observations of network activity originating from remote IP addresses, and analyzes those observations to identify threat behavior. Specially designed sensors are deployed within a wide variety of networks worldwide in order to make those observations. In addition, third-party sources of network observations are combined with the first-hand observations in order to augment the overall visibility of the system.","One aspect of the present invention leverages web content information where possible, including characterization of remote IP web requests for content type and security profile, as well content and reputation information for domain(s) which may be associated with the remote IP itself.","Another aspect of the present invention is a cloud based system that utilizes sensors that push events as the events occur into the cloud, versus periodic \u201cpulling: of the data from a collector process\u2014resulting in \u201creal-time\u201d collection. Observations are preferably stored in one hour buckets for later prosecution.","This aspect of the present invention is scalable and utilizes \u201cHADOOP\u201d technology to process each hour's observations in a highly parallel way, grouping observations by originating IP address, and continually processing each hour of data at the conclusion of each hour. Raw observations are preferably stored in AMAZON's S3 storage service. Another incarnation stores the data in a CASSANDRA database. Key behavior metrics are defined and calculated for each IP address, and rules are written in terms of the metrics.","While one embodiment of the present invention utilizes standard SQL databases in a central datacenter to process the raw threatening events data, another embodiment implements security rules as Map\/Reduce jobs\u2014and preferably utilizes AMAZON's S3 storage, which processes data faster and is more scalable. Then operating on that data using \u201cHADOOP Technology\u201d, which is analyzing the raw threatening events data using a configurable set of servers\/processors clustered together, allowing fast processing even as the raw threatening event data increases to very high volumes.","The system preferably continuously runs MapReduce jobs operating hour by hour on data sent from sensors positioned throughout the world. A determination of threat behavior (aka conviction decisions) are preferably based on one-hour, two-hours, and twelve-hours aggregated data.","The threat IP verification process of the present invention involves comparison of an IP address to a whitelist (immunity list or list of known non-threatening IP addresses) which prevents publishing of the IP address. The threat IP verification process also analyzes an associated Host\/Domain reputation by performing a reverse DNS lookup to find host(s) associated with the IP, performing a lookup of the host(s) in a URL database to determine a reputation score and content, count sub-domains within host name (a.b.c.d.e.domain.com=7) then, determine if the reputation score is high and the sub-domain count=2, the IP address is not published.","The threat IP aging process of the present invention reviews the punishment to determine if the IP address should be removed from the threat list (paroled). The blacklist (prison time) is based on several factors: threat behavior (crime committed); overall level of activity originating from the threat IP; threat record (criminal record)\u2014incrementally extend time based on number of threat \u2018convictions\u2019 within specific timeframes; network reputation\u2014the number of threat IP's identified with the same network as the IP in question. The IP address is removed from the published list (prison) when the \u2018sentence\u2019 is complete.","Having briefly described the present invention, the above and further objects, features and advantages thereof will be recognized by those skilled in the pertinent art from the following detailed description of the invention when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["1000","100","1010","1020","1030","1040","1050","1060","1070","1100","1080"]},"The following terms are defined for use in this application.

One such sensor technique is semi-open proxy farms that detect key threats such as click fraud and botnets. Another sensor technique preferably employed by the present invention is the use of \u201choneypots\u201d that detect key threats such as WINDOWS exploits.

The REST philosophy is based on defining available resources via URI's (nouns), and the possible operations on those resources via HTTP methods (verbs). The general SSHARP URI format is: <service-root>\/<incident-type-specific-component>{.json, xml}. The supported threatening events types are: File; Web (URL's, generally outbound); Network (IP's, generally inbound); Email (inbound and outbound spam, and related URL's, senders); and Threat Package (correlated collection of the other types).","The GET method is used to request data from the service. Based on query parameters, the data requested can be filtered by various attributes and by timeframe. The PUT method is used to create new records in the threatening events database. The POST method is used to append information to a threat package. An existing threat package ID is used to identify the package to be appended to.","Each threatening event type defines type-specific attributes. These attributes represent a description of the threatening event, and are a set of facts related to the threatening event that can be used for analysis.

Bulk threatening events can be submitted using PUT and a JSON or XML-formatted request body.","The SSHARP protocol can also be utilized for security data queries, using the GET method and the appropriate attributes for each record type. For example, using the network threatening event type described below, security records can be obtained using GET:","GET\/threateningevents\/network{.json, xml}?source_ip=<ip>.","IP threatening events are the base threatening event type. All other IP threatening events preferably include the required attributes of the base IP threatening event type. These threatening events represent both in-bound exploit attempts as well as outbound compromised behaviors, along with normal outbound end-user traffic. A network URI is used to send\/receive network threatening events, referring to a variety of possible interactions with remote IP's, such as probes, port scans, and vulnerability exploits.","The intent is to identify the key attributes needed to identify and track threat IP's and to correlate threat IP activity with other types of threatening events. The attributes defined for network events represent a sort of \u2018base class\u2019, where all other incident types inherit these attributes, some of which are required, along with additional type-specific attributes.","HTTP incidents are specific HTTP protocol requests, using any HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.). Threatening events are analyzed for frequency, content type requested, reputation, method, and a variety of other attributes. HTTP threatening events are supersets of network threatening events, and all network threatening event attributes are valid for Web threatening events as well.","DNS threatening events track name lookups to allow analysis for anomalies and failure patterns, as well as use of unconfigured nameservers. The threatening events are a superset of general IP threatening events, and preferably include the required IP threatening event attributes.","An threatening event package is a collection of different or multiple threatening events that are part of the same attack or threat.

The threat aging algorithm is preferably performed for each of the threatening IP addresses published on the list of threatening IP addresses. The threat aging algorithm determines if an IP address should be removed by determining the threat performed by the threatening IP address, the time period on the list of threatening IP addresses, the completion of a publication period on a threatening IP addresses list by the threatening IP address, reoccurring behavior by the threatening IP address and volume of threatening events performed by the threatening IP address. If the listed IP address is no longer a threat, or no longer behaving threateningly, then the IP address is removed from the list of threatening IP addresses.","From the foregoing it is believed that those skilled in the pertinent art will recognize the meritorious advancement of this invention and will readily understand that while the present invention has been described in association with a preferred embodiment thereof, and other embodiments illustrated in the accompanying drawings, numerous changes modification and substitutions of equivalents may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of this invention which is intended to be unlimited by the foregoing except as may appear in the following appended claim.
