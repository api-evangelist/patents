title: Interface board connector
abstract: An interface board connector includes a plurality of individual conductive partition element seats. Each partition element seat includes four spring fingers that extend into apertures in a dielectric base plate of the interface assembly. Two adjacent spring fingers form a tweezers-like connector in one of the apertures that couples to a trace on a balun board contact post to form an impedance-matched extension of the balanced transmission line that is an integral part of the adjacent partition element seats. Each spring finger includes three distinct sections. A ramp section allows the balun board, when inserted, to push apart the two spring fingers and slide into place. The contact sections of two adjacent spring fingers form the electrical junction between the balanced transmission line traces on the balun board contact post and the section of balanced transmission line formed by the parallel spring sections of the two adjacent spring fingers.

A balanced line or balanced signal pair refers to a transmission line consisting of two conductors of the same type, each of which have equal impedances along their lengths and equal impedances to ground and to other circuits. Circuits driving balanced lines must themselves be balanced to maintain the benefits of balance. This may be achieved by transformer coupling using a balun transformer.","For reliability, electrical connections between circuit boards or between circuit board components are generally soldered. Typically, a printed circuit board is mechanically supported by a dielectric base plate. The printed circuit board metallization provides electrical seats for the circuit elements.","The circuit board metallization is designed to enable an electrical connection to the metal traces that form a balanced transmission line on each balun board tongue, or contact post. The electrical connection is made by soldering the metal traces on the balun board contact post to the partition element electrical seats on the printed circuit board.","This method is satisfactory when the likelihood of a failure of one component or board is extremely small. In complex systems, wherein a large number of boards are interconnected, a failure of one of the boards will likely require nearly complete disassembly of the system in order to replace the failed board.","As an example, a variety of active circuits can be incorporated into individual balun boards that provide the electrical interface between partition elements and system electronics. Some balun boards can incorporate power amplifiers that will enable transmitters. Other boards can incorporate low noise receivers that will enable high dynamic range signals acquisition systems. Boards incorporating other active circuits can enable radio frequency generators and sensors for a variety of specialized applications.","The large numbers of active circuits can open the possibility to occasional component failure. When a failure does occur, it will particularly advantageous to be able to exchange one or more failed boards without disassembling the entire interface assembly. Additionally, the ability to exchange various components can provide greater design flexibility.","There is a need for a connector that allows for independent removal and replacement of each such interface board without disassembly of the entire interface. Further, the connector needs to provide a mechanically rigid connection and an electrically sound interface coupling.","The object of the present invention is, therefore, to provide a removable interface board connector. Further objects are to provide a mechanically rigid, electrically sound connector and a method for designing the connector.","With the above and other objects in view, an interface board connector includes a plurality of individual conductive partition element seats. Each partition element seat includes four spring fingers that extend into apertures in a dielectric base plate of the interface assembly. Two adjacent spring fingers form a tweezers-like connector in one of the apertures that couples to traces on a balun board contact post to form an impedance-matched extension of the balun balanced transmission line that is an integral part of the adjacent partition element seats.","Each spring finger includes three distinct sections. A ramp section allows the balun board, when inserted, to push apart the two spring fingers and slide into place. The contact sections of two adjacent spring fingers form the electrical junction between the balanced transmission line traces on the balun board contact post and the section of balanced transmission line formed by the parallel spring sections of the two adjacent spring fingers.","In one embodiment, an interface connector includes an interface element mounting plate and a plurality of spring sections, spaced apart at the periphery of the plate. The spring sections extend at an angle, t, generally orthogonal from the plate, wherein tan t\u2248t. The interface also includes a corresponding plurality of contact sections. Each contact section extends from one of the spring sections distal from the plate, with the contact section maintaining the angle, t. The contact sections have a stiffness greater than ten times the stiffness of the spring sections.","The interface can further include a dielectric support to which the plate is attached. The spring sections and contact sections extend through apertures in the dielectric support. The interface can include a plurality of the connectors attached to the support, wherein distal ends of the contact sections of one connector are in contact with distal ends of the contact sections of adjacent connectors.","Each spring finger can include a ramp section that extends from the contact section distant from the plate. The thickness of the ramp section can decrease linearly to a point distant from the contact section. Further, the width of the spring sections provides a 50-Ohm characteristic impedance.","In one embodiment, a method for designing an interface connector includes defining a set of variables based upon a known interface architecture. The set of variables can include a modulus of elasticity, E, an initial deflection, b, of the spring finger of the connector, a length, S, of the spring section of the spring finger, a width, u, of said spring section and a width, m, of said contact section. A value greater than 10 is selected for the ratio of the contact section stiffness to the spring section stiffness.","The method also includes setting either the spring section thickness or the contact pressure exerted by the contact section. When the spring section thickness is set, the value is used to obtain the contact pressure. If the obtained contact pressure is outside the range of about 6,000 Pascals to about 1 giga-Pascal, the spring section thickness is varied until the obtained contact pressure is within this range. When the contact pressure is set, the value is used to obtain the spring section thickness. If the obtained spring section thickness is less than about 0.010 inch, the contact pressure is varied until the obtained spring section thickness is greater than about 0.010 inch.","Based on the finalized spring section thickness, a deflection angle and a spring finger offset are determined. Additionally, the thickness of the contact section is determined.","The method can further include choosing an incline angle for a ramp section of the spring finger and determining a length of the ramp section based on the incline angle and the contact section thickness. An engagement force between the spring finger and a contact post can be determined based in part on the incline angle. The incline angle can further be used to calculate the length of the transition between the spring section thickness and the contact section thickness.","The above and other features of the invention, including various novel details of construction and combinations of parts, will now be more particularly described with reference to the accompanying drawings and pointed out in the claims.","It will be understood that the particular assembly embodying the invention is shown by way of illustration only and not as a limitation of the invention. The principles and features of this invention may be employed in various and numerous embodiments without departing from the scope of the invention.","Referring to , there is shown an exploded, partial side view of a generalized embodiment of a plurality of interface board connectors . Connectors  enable an electrical connection between prior art balun board  and partition elements . As is known to those of skill in the art, metal traces  on tongues, or contact posts  of balun board  form a balanced transmission line on balun board .","Element seat plates  of connectors  are supported by dielectric  and prior art partition elements  are electrically connected to plates . Spring fingers  of connectors  extend generally orthogonally from plates  through apertures formed in dielectric . For clarity and ease of visualization, solid portions of dielectric  are cross-hatched.","When balun board  is positioned adjacent to dielectric  (by movement in the direction of arrow  of ), contact posts  are inserted into corresponding apertures . Spring fingers  contact metal traces  to form the electrical connection between balun board  and partition elements .","Referring now to , there is shown a detailed side view of connector , corresponding to the orientation of . The number of spring fingers  and their spacing will depend on the architecture of the interface board. For illustration, but not limitation, connector  of  includes four spring fingers , spaced 90\u00b0 apart about central axis X-X of connector , one of which is hidden in .","Each spring finger  extends away from element surface of plate  and away from axis X-X at an angle, t, wherein the known small angle approximation tan t\u2248t is valid. Each spring finger  is formed of spring section , contact section and ramp section . Spring section is proximal to and is attached to plate . Ramp section is distal from plate , with contact section between spring section and ramp section ","Spring section is fabricated to have a much smaller moment of inertia than contact section , such that bending deflections of spring finger  in a direction towards axis X-X are generally confined to spring section . Ramp section tapers from contact section inward towards axis X-X.","Referring now to , there is shown a detailed plan view of connector , taken from the perspective of balun board  of . As noted previously with respect to , the configuration of plate  depends on the architecture of the interface board. For illustrative purposes and for conformance with , but not for limitation, plate  is shown having a generally octagonal shape, with spring fingers  at alternate apexes. In addition, plate  can include openings for alignment pins and mounting bolts, as is known in the art.","Referring now also to , there is shown a partial side view of contact post  engaging spring finger . As contact post  contacts face of ramp section and is moved further towards plate , force Wis exerted normal to face and spring section begins to deflect towards axis X-X (as shown by arrow A).","Due to its larger moment of inertia, essentially no deflection occurs in contact section . Accordingly, when contact post  is moved fully towards plate , spring section deflects through angle t (shown in ) such that contact section is in full contact with metal traces  on contact post .","Referring also to , there is shown a partial plan view of spring finger , corresponding to the side view of , with contact post  being shown removed from spring finger . As shown in , the lengths of spring section , contact section and ramp section are designated as S, H and R, respectively. The widths of spring section and contact section are designated as u and m, respectively. Referring back to , the thicknesses of spring section and contact section are designated as v and z, respectively.","Referring now to , there is shown a schematic representation of the geometry of a spring finger. In , the x and y coordinate axes are aligned with the initial un-deformed position of the spring finger in order to permit the application of standard beam deflection theory to the problem. As noted with respect to , slight variations in the vertical dimensions caused the initial deflection angle can be ignored since tan t\u2248t.","When a force W is applied, as would be the case when contact post  advances past ramp section in , the spring section (denoted by length S in ) of the spring finger deflects until the contact section (denoted by length H in ) becomes horizontal. To ensure that almost all bending occurs in the spring section and the contact section remains relatively unbent, the moment of inertia of the contact section can be set significantly larger than the moment of inertia of the spring section.","As is known to those of skill in the art, the beam deflection equation is:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":{"mi":"y","mo":"=","mrow":{"mfrac":{"mi":"W","mrow":{"mn":"6","mo":"\u2062","mi":"EI"}},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mrow":{"mn":"3","mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"msup":{"mi":"x","mn":"2"},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"msub":{"mi":["x","W"]}}}},"mo":"-","msup":{"mi":"x","mn":"3"}}}}},"mo":[",","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},"mi":"where"}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"1"}}]}}}}},"y is the ordinate,","x is the abscissa,","W is the force applied at x=x","E is the material modulus of elasticity, and","I is the moment of inertia of the beam, or spring finger.","For ease of calculation and derivation, the length of the contact section, H, is set equal to the length of the spring section, S.
