Technical Field","The present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition for inhibiting angiogenesis, the composition containing, as an effective ingredient, a novel synthetic low-molecular compound targeting ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase binding protein (UQCRB).","2. Description of the Related Art","Angiogenesis is a key process for progression of many solid tumors. Accordingly, the efficient inhibition of angiogenesis is considered to be a powerful way to suppress tumor growth and metastasis. Consequently, several specific target proteins of angiogenesis, including vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFs), matrix metalloproteinases, aminopeptidases, histone deacetylases, and calmodulin, have been identified and anti-angiogenic agents of various scaffolds have been developed based on their inhibitory activities toward the specific targets. We recently isolated terpestacin, a new angiogenesis inhibitor with a unique bicyclo sesterterpene structure, from fungal metabolites. To investigate the molecular mechanism of terpestacin regarding its anti-angiogenic activity, we identified a cellular binding protein of terpestacin using a reverse chemical proteomics approach. Terpestacin specifically bound to the 13.4-kDa subunit (UQCRB) of complex III in the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Recent reports have suggested that reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation at mitochondrial complex III triggers hypoxia-inducible factor-1a (HIF-1a) stabilization during hypoxia. Indeed, terpestacin binding to UQCRB inhibited hypoxia-induced ROS generation, leading to inhibition of HIF-1a and tumor angiogenesis in vivo, without disrupting mitochondrial respiration and complex III functional structure. In addition, the regulation of UQCRB expression demonstrated that the protein is a critical mediator of hypoxia-induced tumor angiogenesis via mitochondrial ROS-mediated signaling. This discovery suggested that small molecules targeting UQCRB in mitochondrial complex III can suppress tumor angiogenesis without acting as a respiratory poison. As such, we attempted to develop new small molecules that specifically regulate the function of UQCRB.","Throughout the specification, a number of publications and patent documents are referred to and cited. The disclosure of the cited publications and patent documents is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety to more clearly describe the state of the related art and the present disclosure.","The present inventors endeavored to develop an anti-angiogenesis agent for effectively inhibiting angiogenesis without cytotoxicity. As a result, the present inventors found a novel synthetic low-molecular compound targeting ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase binding protein (UQCRB) of mitochondrial complex III, as a new molecular target for angiogenesis, and confirmed that this compound binds to UQCRB to effectively inhibit angiogenesis, based on which the present inventors completed the present invention.","Accordingly, an aspect of the present invention is to provide a pharmaceutical composition for inhibiting angiogenesis.","Another aspect of the present invention is to provide a novel sulfonyl amide derivative compound.","Still another aspect of the present invention is to provide a method for prevention or treatment of uncontrolled angiogenesis-related diseases or disorders.","Other purposes and advantages of the present invention will become clarified by the following detailed description of invention, claims, and drawings.","In accordance with an aspect of the present invention, there is provided a pharmaceutical composition for inhibiting angiogenesis, the pharmaceutical composition including, as an effective ingredient, a compound represented by Chemical Formula 1 below:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"15.92mm","wi":"58.59mm","file":"US09371286-20160621-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"wherein, Ris",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"10.08mm","wi":"24.47mm","file":"US09371286-20160621-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sub":["1 ","1","6 ","1","6 ","1","6 ","2 "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00003","num":"00003"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00003","he":"21.84mm","wi":"24.38mm","file":"US09371286-20160621-C00003.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sub":["1 ","5 ","1","6 ","1","3 ","1","6 "]},"In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method for prevention or treatment of uncontrolled angiogenesis-related diseases or disorders, the method including administering the pharmaceutical composition to a subject in need thereof.","According to a preferable embodiment of the present invention, Aof Rin Chemical Formula 1 of the present invention is methyl, ethyl, phenyl, or tert-butyl.","According to a preferable embodiment of the present invention, Bof Rin Chemical Formula 1 of the present invention is hydrogen, chloride, fluoro, hydroxy, nitro, or methyl.","According to a preferable embodiment of the present invention, hydroxy naphthalyl of Rin Chemical Formula 1 of the present invention is 7-hydroxy naphthalyl.","According to a preferable embodiment of the present invention, quinoline of Rin Chemical Formula 1 of the present invention is 8-hydroxy quinoline.","According to a preferable embodiment of the present invention, the compound of the present invention is selected from the group consisting of compounds represented by Chemical Formulas 2 to 29 below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"chemistry":[{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00004","num":"00004"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00004","he":"214.80mm","wi":"72.81mm","file":"US09371286-20160621-C00004.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00005","num":"00005"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00005","he":"204.89mm","wi":"66.55mm","file":"US09371286-20160621-C00005.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00006","num":"00006"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00006","he":"214.80mm","wi":"66.55mm","file":"US09371286-20160621-C00006.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00007","num":"00007"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00007","he":"216.07mm","wi":"66.55mm","file":"US09371286-20160621-C00007.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00008","num":"00008"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00008","he":"148.51mm","wi":"71.46mm","file":"US09371286-20160621-C00008.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}]},"More preferably, the compound of the present invention is selected from the group consisting of compounds represented by Chemical Formulas 5, 6, 12, 17, 21, 23, and 24 above.","Disease or disorders that can be prevented or treated by the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention include various diseases related to angiogenesis.

Control biotin and biotinylated terpestacin were sequentially immobilized onto the surface of a streptavidin-coated sensor chip. Competitive binding molecules (A1893 and A1938, 25 \u03bcM) were incubated with the purified UQCRB protein (25 \u03bcM) in the buffer (10 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA (pH 7.4)), and then UQCRB-competitive binding molecule complexes were injected onto the sensor chip at a flow rate of 30 \u03bcl\/min. The surface of the sensor chip was regenerated by the injection of 5 \u03bcl of the regeneration buffer (50 mM NaOH). Molecular interaction analysis was performed using the BIAcore 2000 system (BIAcore AB), and the apparent binding affinities were calculated by the subtraction of resonance values of UQCRB binding to control biotin from those of UQCRB binding to biotinylated terpestacin. For competitive binding analysis, terpestacin and the compounds of the present invention were each incubated with the UQCRB protein, and then the complexes were injected into flow cells of the sensor chip. Consequently, when terpestacin and the compounds of the present invention were each incubated with the UQCRB protein, the binding efficiency of UQCRB to BT was significantly decreased, which confirmed that A1893 and A1938 directly bind to UQCRB ().","Angiogenesis-Inhibitory Activity Analysis","1. Invasiveness Analysis","Serum-starved human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were treated with VEGF with or without A1893 or A1938, and then the in vitro angiogenesis analysis was performed. The invasiveness of HUVECs was investigated using the Transwell chamber system with 8.0-\u03bcm pore-sized polycarbonate filter (Corning Costar). First, a lower portion of the filter was coated with 10 \u03bcl gelatin (10 mg\/ml) for 1 hour, and an upper portion of the filter was coated with 10 \u03bcl Matrigel (3 mg\/ml) for 2 hours. Then, 600 \u03bcl of the EBM-2 medium was put into the Transwell, and then, VEGF (30 ng\/ml) and the compound of the present invention DPCN (2.5 \u03bcM and 5 \u03bcM) were added thereto. The coated filter was placed on the Transwell, and HUVECs (1\u00d710cells\/well) were inoculated on the upper portion of the filter, following by incubation for 18 hours. After that, the cells were fixed with 70% methanol, and then stained with hematoxylin\/eosin. Then, the total number of invaded cells was measured using an optical microscope at 100\u00d7 magnification. As a result of the measurement, it was confirmed that A1893 and A1938 inhibited VEGF-induced invasion without affecting viability of endothelial cells ().","2. Tube Formation Analysis","Tube formation analysis was performed using HUVECs growing on Matrigel (Collaborative Biomedical Products). The 48-well plate was coated with 150 \u03bcl Matrigel, followed by polymerization at 37 for 2 hours. Then, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs, 1\u00d710cells\/well) were inoculated on Matrigel, and then VEGF (30 ng\/ml) and the compound of the present invention DPCN (2.5 \u03bcM and 5 \u03bcM) were added thereto. The morphological change of cells was observed while the cells were incubated at room temperature for 8 hours. Tube formation was quantified by measuring the number of connected cells in randomly selected fields and dividing the measured number by the total number of cells in the same field. As a result of the measurement, it was confirmed that A1893 and A1938 inhibited the tube formation of HUVECs without affecting viability of endothelial cells ().","Mitochondrial ROS Generation Analysis","The increase in ROS generation due to complex III during hypoxia triggers HIF-1\u03b1 stabilization, and consequently mediates the expression of its target genes such as VEGF. UQCRB, which is an important component in mitochondrial complex III, acts as an Osensor and mediates hypoxia-induced tumor angiogenesis. In order to determine whether anti-angiogenic activity of A1893 and A1938 is associated with the modulation of the Osensing function of UQCRB, the present inventors investigated the mitochondrial ROS-mediated hypoxic signal transmission procedure of A1893 and A1938. HepG2 liver cancer cells were pretreated with A1893 and A1938 for 30 minutes, and then exposed to 1% Ofor 10 minutes. Intracellular ROS levels were determined by the DCF fluorescence. A1893 and A1938 suppressed the hypoxia-induced mitochondrial ROS generation in HepG2 cells in a dose-dependent manner (). This result showed that anti-angiogenic activity of A1893 and A1938 is associated with the modulation of the Osensing function of UQCRB.","Although the present invention has been described in detail with reference to the specific features, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that this description is only for a preferred embodiment and does not limit the scope of the present invention.
