The mobile device  may include a portable electronic device providing at least some of the functionalities of the client machines  and . The mobile device  may include a third party application  (or a web client) configured communicate with application server .","Turning specifically to the network-based publisher , an application program interface (API) server  and a web server  are coupled to, and provide programmatic and web interfaces respectively to, one or more application servers . The application servers  host one or more publication application (s) . The application servers  are, in turn, shown to be coupled to one or more database server(s)  that facilitate access to one or more database(s) .","In one embodiment, the web server  and the API server  communicate and receive data pertaining to listings, transactions, and feedback, among other things, via various user input tools. For example, the web server  may send and receive data to and from a toolbar or webpage on a browser application (e.g., web client ) operating on a client machine (e.g., client machine ). The API server  may send and receive data to and from an application (e.g., client application  or third party application ) running on another client machine (e.g., client machine  or third party server ).","A publication application(s)  may provide a number of publisher functions and services (e.g., listing, payment, etc.) to users that access the network-based publisher . For example, the publication application(s)  may provide a number of services and functions to users for listing goods and\/or services for sale, facilitating transactions, and reviewing and providing feedback about transactions and associated users.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["116","114","102","118","116","102","102"]},"The network-based publisher  may provide a multitude of feedback, reputation, aggregation, and listing and price-setting mechanisms whereby a user may be a seller or buyer who lists or buys goods and\/or services (e.g., for sale) published on the network-based publisher .","The application server  also includes a location-based incentive application . The location-based incentive application  communicates incentives to the mobile device  based on the mobile device  location and the intent of the user of the mobile device  as further described below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["130","102","130","202","204","206","202","132","204","132","206","132"]},"In one embodiment, the location-based incentive application  receives a communication from the mobile device . For example, the communication may include a specification of an item and a location of the mobile device . Based on the specified item and the location of the mobile device , the incentive module  consults with the database server  and database  to determine and communicate incentives from local merchants to the mobile device .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["202","132","132","132","302","202","132","132","302","202","132","132","132"]},"The location identification module  may also include a location input module  configured to determine a geographic location of the mobile device  by requesting the user to input an address, city, zip code or other location information on his\/her mobile device . In one embodiment, the user can select a location from a list of locations or a map on the mobile device . For example, a user on the mobile device  inputs the location of the mobile device  via an application or a web browser on the mobile device . In another embodiment, the location input module  derives the geographic location of the user by communicating with third party application using respective APIs (Application Programming Interface).","The location identification module  may also include a location-dependent search term module . The location of the mobile device  can be inferred when the user of the mobile device  requests a search on the mobile device  using location-dependent search terms. For example, a user inputs a search query on his\/her mobile device for \u201cBest Japanese Restaurant San Jose.\u201d The location-dependent search term module  consults a database (not shown) that can determine the geographic location of the best Japanese restaurant in San Jose. The location-dependent search term module  then infers that the user of the mobile device  is at that geographic location. In one embodiment, the location-dependent search term module detects the search query term \u201cSan Jose\u201d as a location and infers that the location of the user is in San Jose irrespective of actually running the search.","The location identification module  may also include a tag module  configured to determine the geographic location of the mobile device  based on a tag associated with a unique geographic location. The tag may include, for example, a barcode tag (e.g. linear barcode or two dimensional bar code) or a Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tag that is associated with a unique geographic location. For example, the user of the mobile device  may use his\/her mobile device  to scan the tag placed at a landmark or store. The tag is uniquely associated with the geographic location of the landmark or store. Such relationship can be stored in a database. The tag module  can then determine the geographic location of the mobile device  based on the tag after consulting the database.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["204","132","402","404","406","408","410"]},"The text identification module  identifies an item or a category of an item specified by the user at the mobile device  using a text input from the user at the mobile device . For example, the user may enter the brand and model number of an item the user wishes to search for at the location of the mobile device . The text identification module  can then identify the item by comparing the brand and model number of the item with a database containing a catalog of products. In another embodiment, the user can input a category of the item. For example, the user may be interested in not a specific digital camera but any brand of digital camera. As such the user may specify \u201cdigital camera\u201d as a category for searching. The text identification module  can then identify items that correspond to the text input by the user. In this case, the text identification module  identifies items that match the category of the item input by the user (e.g. all digital cameras).","In another embodiment, the user can enter the barcode or any other types of codes associated with an item. The text identification module  can then identify the item by comparing the barcode with a database containing a catalog of products and their corresponding barcodes.","The audio identification module  identifies an item or a category of the item as specified by the user at the mobile device using an audio input from the user at the mobile device. For example, the user may speak the brand name and model of an item the user wishes to search for at the location of the mobile device. The audio identification module  includes a speech recognition system (not shown) that enables the spoken words of the user to be transcribed into text. In another embodiment, the audio identification module  includes a song recognition system (not shown) that recognizes the title and author of the song.","The audio identification module  then can be used to identify the specified item by comparing the brand and model number of the item transcribed from the audio with a database containing a catalog of products. In another embodiment, the user can speak a category of the item. For example, the user may be interested in not a specific digital camera but any brand of digital camera. As such the user may say \u201cdigital camera\u201d to the mobile device as a category for searching. The audio identification module  can then identify items that correspond to the audio input by the user. In this case, the text identification module  identifies items that match the category of the item as spoken by the user (e.g. \u201cdigital camera\u201d).","The machine-readable symbol module  identifies an item by having the user scan the bar code or any other machine-readable symbol with his\/her mobile device  as a machine-readable symbol reader. For example, the mobile device  may include an optical device (e.g. a lens) configured to capture an image of a bar code on an item or product. The mobile device  may then upload the captured image to the machine-readable symbol module . The machine-readable symbol module  processes the machine-readable symbol by consulting a database of machine-readable symbols to match the machine-readable symbol with a corresponding item or product. The machine-readable symbol module  can then identify the item specified by the user at the mobile device. Based on the identified item, the machine-readable symbol module  can further determine attributes associated with the item. For example, the machine-readable symbol module  can determine the category, brand, and other product related or similar to the identified item. Other identifying and descriptive information related to the identified item may be returned by the machine-readable symbol module  as well.","The image identification module  identifies an item by having the user take a picture of the item with his\/her mobile device . Mobile devices commonly have an optical lens for capturing pictures. The mobile device  may then upload the picture to the image identification module . The image identification module  analyzes the picture using an image recognition algorithm (not shown) to match the uploaded picture with a corresponding image of an item. The image recognition algorithm consults a database of images and corresponding items to identify the uploaded picture. For example, a user may take a picture of a shoe with his\/her mobile device . The image identification module  recognizes the shoe and identifies its brand and model, among other identifying and descriptive information about the item. In another example, the user may take a picture of a barcode or other item identifier. The image identification module  may recognize and decode the barcode contained in the image and identify the brand and model. In certain instances, the image identification module  may operate in conjunction with one or more other modules, such as the machine-readable symbol module  to perform image recognition and identification. In another embodiment, the image identification module  can also determine other products related or similar to the identified item.","The video identification module  is configured to identify an item by having the user take a video of the item with his\/her mobile device. Mobile devices commonly have an optical lens to capture video. The mobile device  may then upload the video (or a portion of the video) to the video identification module . The video identification module  analyzes the frames of the video using an image recognition algorithm (not shown) to match a frame of the video with a corresponding image of an item. The image recognition algorithm consults a database of images and corresponding items to identify the uploaded video. For example, a user may take a video with his\/her mobile device of a shoe worn by someone walking. The video identification module  recognizes the shoe and identifies its brand and model, among other identifying and descriptive information about the item. In another embodiment, the video identification module  can also determine other products related or similar to the identified item.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["206","206","502","504","506","508","510","512","514"]},"The local merchant module  identifies at least one local merchant having at least one incentive based on the geographic location of the mobile device  as determined by the location identification module . A local merchant may be a merchant or retailer that is located within a predefined distance from the geographic location of the mobile device . In one embodiment, the local merchant module  identifies at least one local merchant with at least one incentive based on an updated search distance preference as specified in the user preference module .","It should be noted that the incentive of the local merchant may or may not correspond to the item identified by the user. For example, a local merchant may feature a special sale on shoes while identified item corresponds to a digital camera. Once all local merchants having incentives are identified based on the geographic location of the mobile device  (using a database of incentives), the incentive match module  filters all local merchants based on the identified item. In the previous example, the local merchant featuring a sale on shoes may be filtered out from the search result.","The item category module  determines a category of the item specified by the user and identified by item identification module . For example, the user may specify a particular digital camera. The item category module  determines that the item specified by the user falls into the category of electronics and the subcategory of cameras.","The incentive match module  determines whether the identified item specified by the user corresponds to an item identified in at least one incentive of at least one local merchant as determined by the local merchant module . For example, a user specifies an item with his\/her mobile device. The item is identified as a specific digital camera. The item identification module  generates the brand, model number, color, and other attributes of the specified digital camera. The local merchant module  identifies merchants with incentives local to the geographic location of the mobile device . The incentive match module  matches local merchants with incentives (sale or discount) on the specific digital camera.","In another embodiment, the incentive match module  determines whether the category of the item identified by the user corresponds to a category of items as determined by item category module  and identified in at least one incentive of at least one local merchant. For example, a user specifies an item with his\/her mobile device . The item is identified as a specific digital camera. The item identification module  generates the brand, model number, color, and other attributes of the specified digital camera. The item category module  determines the category of the identified item: electronics. The local merchant module  identifies merchants with incentives local to the geographic location of the mobile device . The incentive match module  matches local merchants with incentives (sale or discount) on electronics or categories related to the digital camera.","The user preference module  provides user-defined preferences used in the process of determining local merchants or brands or category of the items. In one embodiment, the user preference module  allows a user to update a search distance preference for local merchants. For example, the user may wish to decrease the radius of the distance preference in a downtown area of a city. Conversely, the user may wish to increase the radius of the distance preference in a suburban or rural area of a city. In another embodiment, user preference module  may also allow the user to specify favorite brands of items or favorite merchants or retailers.","The incentive code module  generates a code associated with at least one incentive selected by the user at the mobile device . The code may be valid for a predetermined period of time at the corresponding local merchant. For example, a user selects a coupon from a local merchant on his\/her mobile device . The incentive code module  generates a code associated with the coupon. The code is communicated to the mobile device  of the user. The user takes the code to the corresponding local merchant to redeem the discount. The code can be redeemed at the local merchant by showing or telling the code to a cashier at the checkout register of the local merchant. The cashier may then enter the code at the checkout register to determine the validity of the code and appropriately apply the discount or promotion. The code can also be redeemed by displaying a machine-readable code such as a bar code on a screen of the mobile device . The user then displays the bar code to the cashier at the checkout register who can scan the bar code to determine the validity of the code and appropriately apply the discount or promotion.","In one embodiment, the code may be valid for a predetermined period of time (e.g. one day, one week, etc. . . . ). In another embodiment, the generated code may be uniquely associated with the user of the mobile device  and may expire immediately upon redeeming the coupon.","The communication module  communicates one or more incentives of the identified item from at least one local merchant to the mobile device . For example, a list of local merchants within a preset distance radius (e.g. one mile) of the mobile device  is displayed. The list of local merchants may include a sale or discount on the item identified by the user of the mobile device . The list may also include a list of recommended merchants (having an incentive on the identified item) that are located beyond the preset distance radius.","In another embodiment, the communication module  communicates one or more incentives of the identified category of the items from at least one local merchant to the mobile device . For example, a list of local merchants within a preset distance radius (e.g. a block) of the mobile device  is displayed. The list of local merchants may include a sale or discount on similar or related items to the identified item specified by the user of the mobile device . The list may also include a list of recommended merchants (having an incentive on similar items to the identified item) that are located beyond the preset distance radius.","The incentive receiver module  collects attributes of incentives from merchants and stores the attributes of the incentives in an incentive database. An example of a data structure of the incentive database is further described in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["602","604","606","608","610","612","614","616"]},"The merchant name attribute  includes the name of the local merchant (e.g. Joe's Electronic Shop).
