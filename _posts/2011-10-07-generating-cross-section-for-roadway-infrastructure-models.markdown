{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates generally to modeling applications, and in particular, to a method, apparatus, and article of manufacture for creating and displaying detailed cross-sectional views in a roadway infrastructure model along arbitrary directions and across multi-segment paths simultaneously.","2. Description of the Related Art","Roadway infrastructure is typically modeled in software applications by building cross sections along a pathway. Cross sections may be designed at regular intervals along an alignment and the road model encapsulates this information to present a three-dimensional (3D) model to the user. In some situations such as roundabouts, cross sections along multiple paths may be part of the same roadway model.","As a part of the design process, civil engineers routinely create cross sectional views of the road model at various locations for model investigation and documentation purposes. It is easy to create a sectional view along one of the designed sections since it involves reproducing the designed section. Ordinarily, these cross sectional views are created by using an object that represents a cutting tool. The cutting tool represents where the cross sectional view will be created and in prior art implementations must be aligned parallel to cross sections as they exist in the drawing.","Frequently users would like to create a sectional view that does not coincide with the designed cross section. Examples include roadway intersections, models of cul-de-sacs, roundabouts, off ramps etc. In some of these examples, the cutting plane will not align with a cross section in the roadway model which means that a cross section cannot be created.","Another deficiency in the prior art relates to the creation of a cross section view where the ends of the cutting tool used to create the cross sectional view fall within or between two cross sections. In other words, the newly designed cross section does not extend through the roadway cross section, but falls within the roadway. The prior art solves such problems by adding a design cross section if it aligns with the cutting plane.","Accordingly, it may be noted that prior art design applications do not support cutting sections in cases where the cutting plane does not align with a designed cross section. Instead, a layered based approach is utilized. In this regard, typically, roadway infrastructure models consist of various layers (e.g., pavement layer, gravel layer, subbase layer, etc.). Prior art procedures involve creating a DTM (digital terrain model) surface for the top of each layer. Thereafter, to represent each layer, users create a delta surface between the two layers that enclose it. However, such a procedure requires significant user effort and is therefore not desirable.","In other words, when users design roadways, it is not possible to design every aspect of the road (e.g., that is several miles long). Accordingly, cross sections are designed at large intervals (e.g., every one hundred [100] feet) and the designer specifies how the cross section looks at each cross section. However, no information is defined at intermediate locations between the cross sections. Nonetheless, it is desirable for users to cut sections along arbitrary planes\u2014in planes that do not align with the designed cross sections. Further, some cross sections may be organized to form complicated shapes (e.g., roundabouts, highway off-ramps, etc.). Prior art systems were only able to display the information at the specifically designed cross sections. Further, users had to create derivatives of a model in order to display cross sections accurately (e.g., a surface was created from a model, and the newly created surface was displayed in the cross section).","In view of the above, it is desirable to provide a means to generate section views of roadway infrastructure models along arbitrary directions (cutting planes) and also across multiple-segment paths (alignments) simultaneously. In addition, it is desirable to provide a methodology to generate fully capable 3D solids for infrastructure models.","Embodiments of the invention overcome the problems of the prior art by generating and displaying a cross section of a roadway infrastructure at an arbitrary location\/direction that may cross multiple-segment paths simultaneously. To provide such capabilities, a user specifies a location for a cutting plane (e.g., by drawing a cutting plane line). Such a location may be at an arbitrary location that does not align with predefined\/regularly occurring cross sections. Further, the location may cross multiple-segment paths (e.g., a cul-de-sac, a round-about, etc.).","Thereafter, further user interaction is not necessary as the system automatically and without additional user input, creates, accurately labels, and displays points, lines\/edges, faces, and solids at the desired cross section location. The first step in this process, determines (i.e., based on various methods) where the location of the cutting plane line intersects with the roadway model. Based on the determination, solid models are created at the points of intersection. For example, the solid models may be interpolated based on regularly occurring cross sections. The newly created cross sections are then sliced based on the cutting plane line with the result displayed. Further, parts\/components of the cross section (e.g., points, lines\/edges, faces, and solids) inherit the labels based on parent relations (e.g., from the solids\/cross sections on which the newly created solids are based).","In the following description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof, and which is shown, by way of illustration, several embodiments of the present invention. It is understood that other embodiments may be utilized and structural changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention.","Overview","Embodiments of the invention provide a roadway model that models building cross sections and presents a 3D model to the user.

Line - illustrates a cross section at a location where the cutting plane coincides with an existing model cross section. Line - illustrates a cross section at a location where the cutting plane would not align with existing roundabout cross sections. As cross section - lines up with an existing cross section, the information\/details\/layers can be seen in the section view. However, since section - does not align with a cross section of the roundabout model, section - in  does not show any detail of the model. Such differences illustrate the problem of the prior art. Accordingly, embodiments of the invention need to create a 3D representation that displays the layers and details of non-aligned cross sections.","In view of the above, when a user elects to create a cross\/cut section, embodiments of the invention process the model and try to create a section where desired.  is a flow chart illustrating the logical flow for generating a cross section for roadway infrastructure models in accordance with one or more embodiments of the invention.","At step , a sample line or CSV (cross section viewer) section is obtained. In other words, the user marks a cutting plane (e.g., by typing\/entering a command to create a cross\/cut section).","At step , a determination is made regarding whether the station is in a regular corridor frequency. In other words, the system checks to determine if the location being cut (i.e., the location of the sample line or CSV section) is at a calculated\/already calculated station\/cross section.","If the new section is at a regular corridor (i.e., at an already created cross-section) (e.g., line - of ), the corridor section is drawn at step .","However, if the new section does not coincide with an already existing cross section, the process continues at step  where a determination is made regarding whether the sample line or CSV section is perpendicular to the baseline. In other words, the system examines the perpendicularity of the sample line with respect to remaining parts of the drawing (e.g., wherever the user is drawing the cutting plane). If the alignment of the roadway is perpendicular to the baseline, the assembly is applied at that station at step . To apply the assembly, a cross section is created and added to the design at this location. Thus, in addition to the cross sections that are regularly spaced, the model will now have this additional cross section.","If the sample line or CSV section is not perpendicular to the base line, solids are generated from the corridor at step , the solids are sliced at step , and the slice data is drawn with labels at step . Thus, the determination at step  (for perpendicularity) determines if a roadway has a different geometry from a straight standard road. An example of such a different geometry is if the new cross section covers more than one roadway model (e.g., a freeway with a divided highway with lanes on two sides separated by a graph median). In such a situation, embodiments of the invention actually generate solids (at step ), slice the solids at the points of intersection (at step ), and then draw the slice data accordingly (at step ).","The above steps may be examined with respect to . In this regard, a cutting plane is marked by a user (e.g., using a command to create a cross\/cut section such as line - or -). If the cutting plane is at a regular frequency (e.g., line -), the section is simply drawn at step . However, if not at a regular frequency (e.g., line -), the system runs through the model and when attempting to create a section across line -, a solid is created at those locations on the road that intersect with line -. First, the system finds where the cutting plane (i.e., line -) intersects with the road. Thereafter, at step , a solid is created for those portions to be displayed in a corresponding 3D view. Those solids are then sliced at step  and drawn at step .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":["FIGS. 7A and 7B","FIG. 7B","FIG. 5B"],"b":["2","2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["802","1","1","2","2"]},"At step , portions of the roadway model that intersect the cutting plane line are determined. Spatial partitioning along the roadway alignment may be used to perform this determination. As part of the above process in both the flow charts of , one determination that must be made is that of determining where the cutting plane intersects with existing cross sections of the roadway model. A variety of methods\/functions may be used to determine the intersection locations. One exemplary method\/function that may be used is described in \u201cStrip Trees: A Hierarchical Representation for Curves\u201d, by Dana H. Ballard, Commun. ACM 24, 5 (May 1981), pages 310-321, which article is fully incorporated by reference herein. In the prior art, no cross sections were displayed at the points of intersection. However, once the regions of intersection have been identified, embodiments of the present invention create a solid model at those regions (e.g., step  of  and step  of ), slice the model (e.g., step  of ), and display the slices accordingly (e.g., step  of ).","At step , for the identified intersection regions, solids (e.g., created using a solid modeling kernel such as Autodesk\u2122 Shape Manager\u2122) that are fully capable of answering solid model queries are created. The creation process many involve using a special loft application programming interface (API) to loft a solid between design cross sections (that occur at regular intervals). Accordingly, a composite solid is assembled out of the pieces\/regions that are determined to intersect the cutting plane line. For example, in a roadway model, there may be points, links and shapes that are assembled into a solid using a modeling utility. In this regard, the cutting plane line lies between already defined cross sections. To define a new cross section at the cutting plane line, as no points, lines, and shapes exist at the cutting plane location, they must be interpolated. Points from the existing regular defined cross sections may be interconnected in a variety of manners to form the previously mentioned composite solid. One technique that may be used to create\/interpolate the solid is using linear interpolation. However, embodiments of the invention are not limited to linear interpolation and other techniques may be used.","At step , the cutting plane is formed and used to perform a Boolean operation, the result of which is the desired cross section. In other words, based on the cutting plane line, a cutting plane is formed and used to slice\/cut the solids that were created.","At step , the newly created section is translated back for display in a format useful to the user. For example, the display in  (in section ) illustrates the display of the translated section.","Lofted Solid Labeling","In addition to the above, step  may further include the identification\/labeling of points, links, and shapes that are displayed. Such labeling is done in a manner that allows the user to see this small slice of the model in the context of the entire model. In this regard, it is typical for users to label various elements of input sections (e.g., the edge of a roadway point, the top surface of the road, etc.). Embodiments of the invention may use a progenitor mechanism in a shape manager loft API to identify these features in the generated sectional view. For example, a particular point in a cross section may be labeled (e.g., adjusted pavement, specific centerline of road, etc.). When the cross section is cut along an arbitrary plane (i.e., the cutting plane line), users may expect the points in the new cross section to be labeled as well (e.g. in the 3D view).","In the prior art, if an existing cross section had marked points, and the cutting plane lined up, the labeling was carried over. However, if the cutting plane did not align with existing cross sections, labeling was lost. Embodiments of the present invention overcome the inability to label such points. In other words, when a cross section is cut along an arbitrary plane, even if points in the cross section are interpolated, such parts may be accurately labeled.","Lofted Solid Processing","To provide the labeling functionality, a lofted solid may be processed to add attributes based on the input cross section. In this regard, if two adjacent cross sections both have points\/labels \u201cA\u201d when the solid is created\/processed at step , the two points are connected. The line connecting these two points is labeled \u201cA.\u201d When the cutting plane cuts the line connecting the two points, the result is a single point that is labeled \u201cA\u201d (based on the line \u201cA\u201d).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0064"},"figref":["FIG. 9A","FIG. 9B"],"b":["1","2","1","2","3","4","902","902","2","902","2","1","2","3","4","902","902","902","1","2"]},"For links\/edges, if the parent of the two vertices of a link have the same attribute, the link is marked with the same attribute. Thus, the link between point  on Input Section  and Input section  are all marked with the label \u201c\u201d as illustrated.","Attribute Assignment","The links and points on the resulting cut section are given attributes by looking at the parent edges and faces on the lofted solid from which they originated.","Thus, any time there is a link in the solid model that connects two identical points, the link also acquires\/is assigned with the same label (i.e., from the parent edges and faces on the lofted solid from which they originated) (as illustrated in ).  illustrates a cut of a cross section that acquires labels based on a parent relationship in accordance with one or more embodiments of the invention. In , the user has defined a cut line\u2014the sample line cutting plane. The cutting plane does not line up with existing cross sections but it is still desirable to label the faces\/edges\/vertices of the sample line cutting plane.","To mark edges in the resulting section, the parent face on the lofted solid is examined and the edge is marked if the parent has an attribute. In , the parent face (i.e., of the Lofted Solid ) is labeled \u201cTop\u201d. Accordingly, the top of the cutting plane may be similarly labeled \u201cTop\u201d. To mark vertices, if the parent is an edge and has an attribute, the vertex is marked with that attribute\/label. Thus, since the parent (i.e., edge \u201c\u201d) of the Lofted Solid  is an edge, the intersection of the cutting plane with that vertex (i.e., at point ) is also labeled with the \u201c\u201d.","In view of the above, any time there is a link in the model that connects two identical points, the length gets the same label (e.g., the link \u201c\u201d in ). Similarly, once a cross section is cut, if the point happens to be on a line, the point is also assigned the same name (e.g., \u201c\u201d in ). Thus, referring to , the solids (e.g., Lofted Solid ) created at step  may be based on two predefined cross sections of the roadway infrastructure model (e.g., input section  and ). Such cross sections may have various points, edges, and faces with the same labels (e.g., input section  and input section  may both have edges labeled \u201cTop\u201d and vertices labeled \u201c,\u201d \u201c,\u201d \u201c,\u201d and \u201c\u201d) (see ). When the Lofted Solid  is created, the links that connect points having the same label are proscribed with the same label as the points (e.g., label \u201c\u201d). Faces created\/having edges with the same labels are similarly labeled with the same label as the edges (e.g., label \u201cTop\u201d). Further, solids that have parent faces (from the two cross sections) are labeled with the same label as those faces (not shown in  or B).","Conclusion","This concludes the description of the preferred embodiment of the invention.
