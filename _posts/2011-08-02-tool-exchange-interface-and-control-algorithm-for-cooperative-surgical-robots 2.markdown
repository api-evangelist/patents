EB007969 awarded by the National Institutes of Health and EEC9731478 awarded by National Science Foundation. The U.S. government has certain rights in the invention.","The present invention pertains to a tool exchange interface for surgical robots. More particularly, the present invention pertains to a tool exchange interface and control algorithm for cooperative surgical robots.","In the \u201chands-on\u201d cooperative robot control paradigm, both the operator and the robot hold the tool while the forces exerted by the operator on the tool are sensed with a force\/torque sensor and the robot moves to minimize these forces, effectively rendering the operator's desired motion. For surgical applications, quick tool changes are desirable and often required for timing and safety reasons. Specifically, unintended patient movement requires an immediate compensatory repositioning of the instrument to avoid tissue injury.","A quick tool exchange mechanism is desirable for a surgical system based on cooperatively controlled robot where frequent insertion and removal of surgical instruments is required, e.g., Vitreoretinal surgery. For safety reasons, this tool interface should also provide a very quick and robust instrument removal from the surgical site that is not dependent on a functioning robot. While engaged, this mechanism should not impede the function of the robot or the ability of the surgeon to perform desired tasks.","One approach to this problem is to use a simple d-tenting mechanism in which a small spring-loaded ball or pin in the tool holder engages a socket or groove on the tool shaft to hold the tool in place unless a sufficiently large force is exerted to disengage the tool. Another approach is to use a magnet. One challenge with these approaches is holding the tool firmly enough to permit the operator to guide the tool without unintended break-away while also ensuring that the required release force is not so large that the tool cannot be removed very quickly and safely if the need arises. This challenge is especially crucial in applications such as retinal microsurgery, where the forces are extremely delicate and the need for very quick, non-disruptive tool withdrawal is great.","Accordingly, there is a need in the art for a system and method for assisting with tool exchange during surgery.","According to a first aspect of the present invention, a system for tool exchange during surgery for cooperatively controlled robots comprises a tool holder for receiving a surgical tool adapted to be held by a robot and a surgeon, a tool holding element for constraining downward motion of the tool while allowing low force removal of the surgical tool from the holder, a first sensor for detecting if the surgical tool is docked within the tool holder, and a selector for automatically selecting different movements or actions of the tool holder to be performed based upon information detected by the first sensor.","According to a second aspect of the present invention, a method for tool exchange for cooperatively controlled robots comprises providing a tool holder for receiving a surgical tool adapted to be held by a robot and a surgeon, constraining downward motion of the surgical tool while allowing low force removal of the tool from the holder, detecting if the surgical tool is docked within the tool holder, and automatically selecting different movements or actions of the tool holder to be performed based upon information detected.","The presently disclosed subject matter now will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying Drawings, in which some, but not all embodiments of the inventions are shown. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout. The presently disclosed subject matter may be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein; rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will satisfy applicable legal requirements. Indeed, many modifications and other embodiments of the presently disclosed subject matter set forth herein will come to mind to one skilled in the art to which the presently disclosed subject matter pertains having the benefit of the teachings presented in the foregoing descriptions and the associated Drawings. Therefore, it is to be understood that the presently disclosed subject matter is not to be limited to the specific embodiments disclosed and that modifications and other embodiments are intended to be included within the scope of the appended claims.","The present invention pertains to a system and method for tool exchange of a surgical tool during cooperatively controlled robots. An exemplary embodiment of the invention provides for use of the system and method in cooperatively controlled hand-over-hand systems is described in \u201cDevelopment and Application of a New Steady-Hand Manipulator for Retinal Surgery\u201d, Mitchell et al., IEEE ICRA, pp. 623-629 (2007) and in \u201cNew Steady-Hand Eye Robot with Microforce Sensing for Vitreoretinal Surgery Research\u201d, A. Uneri, M. Balicki, James Handa, Peter Gehlbach, R. Taylor, and I. Iordachita, International Conference on Biomedical Robotics and Biomechatronics (BIOROB), Tokyo, Sep. 26-29, 2010. pp. 814-819, the entire contents of which are incorporated by reference herein. In steady-hand control, the surgeon and robot both hold the surgical tool. The robot senses forces exerted by the surgeon on the tool handle, and moves to comply, filtering out any tremor. While a specific cooperative control system is described in connection with the above publication, it should be understood that the system and method of the present invention may also be applicable to other cooperatively controlled systems.","With reference to  and , an exemplary embodiment of a cooperatively controlled surgical system to be used in connection with the present invention is shown. The system  may be used in micro-surgery of organs, for example, hollow organs, such as the human eye. However, other applications are possible and within the scope of the invention. As shown in , a robot  includes tool holder  for receiving a surgical tool  to be held by both the robot  and a surgeon  (). Preferably, the surgeon  holds the surgical tool  at a tool handle , and cooperatively directs the surgical tool  with the robot  to perform surgery of a region of interest with a tool tip .","With reference to , a tool holding element  is provided for constraining downward motion of the surgical tool  while allowing low force removal of the surgical tool  from the tool holder . In the exemplary embodiment in , the tool holding element  is a d-tenting mechanism in which a small spring-loaded ball or pin in the tool holder  engages a socket or groove on the tool shaft to hold the surgical tool in place unless a sufficiently large force is exerted to disengage the surgical tool . A flange  on the surgical tool  may also be used to restrict downward motion of the tool.","With reference to , an alternative embodiment of the system  includes a different type of tool holding element . In particular, the tool holding element  may be one or more tapered surfaces along either the tool shaft itself, or the internal channel of the tool holder. For example, the tool holder channel may be a circular cross section or some other cross section constraining the axial rotation of the tool relative to the tool holder. Other examples of tool holding elements include magnets, vacuum chucks, or any other mechanical or electromechanical devices to keep the surgical tool in place, while allowing low breakaway forces. The tool holding element should be sufficiently strong so that the tool is held firmly enough to allow the operator to guide the tool without unintended breakaway while also ensuring that the required release force not be so large that the tool cannot be removed safely and quickly.","According to the features of the present invention, a first aspect of the invention is to provide feedback information regarding whether a tool is engaged within the tool holder. That is, a first sensor may be provided for detecting if the surgical tool is docked within the tool holder . For example, with reference to , a sensor  may be positioned in the tool holder  to detect the position of the surgical tool  within the tool holder . Sensor  may include, but is not limited to, a proximity sensor (IR, Hall Effect) imbedded in the tool holder. As shown in , the sensor  is preferably disposed at a distal end of the tool. Because of the location of the sensor  at the distal end of the tool holder , the sensor  is operated when the tool is engaged in the holder.","In addition, other sensors may be used to detect if the surgical tool  is docked or engaged in the tool holder , including but not limited to, a contact sensor, a toggle switch or pressure sensor, a beam-break type of optical sensor, direct contact force sensor, and a displacement potentiometer. Further, a multiplicity of sensors may be used in a redundant manner to detect whether the tool is fully engaged with the tool holder.","According to the features of the present invention, a selector is provided that automatically selects different movements or actions of the tool holder to be performed based upon information detected by the sensor, e.g., whether the tool is engaged in the tool holder, which will be described in more detail below. For example, when a sensor detects that the tool is not fully engaged within the tool holder, the robot may actively move along the tool axis to restore that connection based on one or more contact sensing methods. If the tool is fully engaged in the tool holder, the robot moves to respond to motions commanded by the surgeon user, for example by exerting forces on the handle of the tool.","According to another aspect of the present invention, the forces between a surgeon and tool may also be detected. For example, a number of sensors known in the art may be used to detect whether the tool  is held by the surgeon. For example, and with reference to , a sensor  may be disposed on the tool handle. Sensor  may include but is not limited to micro-switches, capacitive sensors, optical sensors, force sensors, or pressure sensors on the tool handle . The robot can be programmed so that if the operator releases the tool handle, the robot will automatically retract the tool by a predetermined amount or a predetermined distance or to perform some other \u201cdisengaged\u201d behavior. Similarly, when the tool is held firmly in the tool holder, the breakaway force is high. A rise in the axial force in the direction of tool retraction up to some known break-away force, followed by a sudden drop to zero force is characteristic of tool break-away. When handle forces fall below a desired threshold or there is no handle contact or until the system otherwise detects that the tool is no longer engaged in the tool holder, the robot may move along the tool axis in the designated direction, e.g., back away from the risky area (or performs any other predefined disengaged behavior). This backing away motion may continue for some pre-determined threshold distance or until re-engagement of the tool with the tool holder is detected. The robot may be prevented from moving in a particular direction, such as along the tool axis direction toward the patient, until the tool is fully re-engaged in the tool holder. In the case where a handle force sensor is used to detect re-engagement of the tool with the tool holder, there may be a characteristic time sequence of force values used to detect re-engagement. For example, if a D-tenting mechanism is used to hold the tool in the tool-holder, the axial force along the tool will typically rise to a characteristic value and then decrease. Subsequently, the surgeon can be instructed to pull the tool gently along the tool axis in the retraction direction, though not hard enough to disengage the tool. If the tool is properly engaged, these forces will be detected by the force sensor.","With reference to , the system may also include a force sensor  which provides forces for the force control laws. The force sensor  may also detect forces exerted by the surgeon on the surgical tool when a surgical tool  is engaged within the tool holder . As shown in , force sensor  may be located between the tool holder  and the robot . Forces exerted by the surgeon on the tool handle are transmitted through the tool holder  to the force sensor . If the tool is not fully engaged in tool holder , then no forces in the downward z-direction along the tool shaft will be measured, but it may be possible to measure lateral forces in the other directions. In other embodiments, the force sensor  may be mounted in the handle  of the surgical tool or elsewhere.","The force sensor  may also be used to detect if the surgical tool  is within the tool holder , or if the surgical tool  is held by the surgeon. That is, a single sensor  can sense (1) whether the surgical tool is within the tool holder; and (2) whether the surgical tool is held by the surgeon. However, two separate sensors may also be used. Alternatively, an existing force\/torque sensor  may be used to sense when the tool is engaged in the tool holder  in the downward z-direction. If no downward force is detected by the sensor , the surgical tool  can be considered disengaged from the tool holder. If the only force detected by the sensor  is a downward force equal to the weight of the tool, then the tool may be considered engaged with the tool holder , but disengaged from the surgeon.","It should be understood that any number of sensors (including just a single sensor) may be used to detect whether the tool is engaged in the tool holder. The information detected can then be used to determine the appropriate movement of the robot. The choice of sensors and location of sensors depends upon application and design preference.","With reference , the detected values from the applied sensor(s) is\/are sent to a data processor  for necessary processing according to features of the present invention. The data processor  includes a memory device  having a program with machine readable instructions for performing the necessary algorithms for assisting with tool exchange according to features of the present invention. The data processor  may be a stand-alone computer system, or could be incorporated into existing software. For example, in the context of robotic surgery, the data processor  could be incorporated into existing software for the cooperative surgical systems.","The data processor  includes a program that automatically selects different movements or actions of the tool holder to be performed based upon information detected by the sensors. For example, with reference to , if a sensor senses that the surgical tool  is docked in the tool holder  and senses a force that is consistent with removal of the surgical tool, the tool holder  is moved in a direction of the force applied along a tool axis to reengage the surgical tool . Preferably, the tool holder is moved with an asymmetric gain in velocity. Likewise, with reference to , if the switch  is disengaged indicating non-use by the surgeon, the tool may be released from the tool holder  when the condition of non-use is sensed for a predetermined period of time.","With reference to , the surgical tool  may also include a proximity sensor  disposed at its tip for sensing tool to tissue distance. However, it should be understood that the proximity sensor  may be at other different locations, and need not be at the tool tip. Preferably, the tool to tissue distance is fed back to the data processor , and an appropriate action or movement may be performed in response to the detected value. For example, if the tool to tissue distance is a predetermined level indicative of non-use, the tool holder  may be moved to a desired standoff distance. See, e.g.,] M. Balicki, J.-H. Han, I.

In light of the present disclosure and the general level of skill in the art, those of skill can appreciate that the following Example is intended to be exemplary only and that numerous changes, modifications, and alterations can be employed without departing from the scope of the presently disclosed subject matter. The following Example is offered by way of illustration and not by way of limitation.","A variety of algorithms can be used to automatically select different movements or actions of the tool holder to be performed based upon information detected from a particular sensor. For example, if a sensor detects that the tool is disengaged then\n\nbut with =\u0192()\n\nOtherwise\n\n\n\n","Some examples for \u0192(s,t) are provided below. For example, when the tool is disengaged, set constant velocity: \u0192(s,t)=\u03b2 for a short period t (after motion stops), so that the tool has moved up by a fixed amount bt. In addition, when using a proximity sensor sensing the distance s of the tool from the patient's anatomy, set \u0192(s,t)=g(s\u2212s) or \u0192(s,t)=g to achieve a standoff distance s. If there is a displacement or proximity sensor sensing a distance dof the tool from the engaged position in the tool holder, set \u0192(s,t)=gdto cause the tool holder to move up to fully seat the tool.","The tool may be considered disengaged if F=F, where Fis some threshold force (negative for pushing down), and any of the above methods may be used to implement the desired \u201cdisengaged\u201d behavior. Alternatively, the robot may be programmed to move to maintain a minimum desired tool-to-holder contact force. For example, x=a(F\u2212F) would cause the tool holder to creep slowly up if the tool handle is released.","Although the present invention has been described in connection with preferred embodiments thereof, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that additions, deletions, modifications, and substitutions not specifically described may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The accompanying drawings provide visual representations which will be used to more fully describe the representative embodiments disclosed herein and can be used by those skilled in the art to better understand them and their inherent advantages.
