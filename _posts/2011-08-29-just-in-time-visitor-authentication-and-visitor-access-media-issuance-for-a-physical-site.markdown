It will be apparent, however, to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the present invention.","In addition, in the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous systems are described. It is important to note, and it will be apparent to one skilled in the art, that the present invention may execute in a variety of systems, including a variety of computer systems and electronic devices operating any number of different types of operating systems.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"In the example, a host organization represents one or more entities or users. In the example, a host organization is electronically represented by a host organization system . In addition, the host organization manages one or more physical sites, such as a host physical site . Host organization system  may represent one or more systems distributed geographically in multiple locations and may be shared by one or more host entities. In addition, host physical site  may represent one or more physical areas managed by one or more host entities.","The host organization may provide one or more visitors, such as visitor , with access to one or more areas within host physical site . Visitors to host physical site  may be associated with one or more entities, referred to as visitor organizations. In the example, each visitor organization is electronically represented by a visitor organization system, including, but not limited to, visitor organization system , visitor organization system , and visitor organization system . A visitor organization may represent a business partners, customer, service provider, or other type of partner of the host of host physical site .","In the example, the host organization of host physical site  may require that all visitors use a visitor access medium to access areas of host physical site , such as visitor access medium , readable within host physical site  by one or more physical access control systems (PACS) defining PACS controlled areas . In particular, host physical site  includes PACS controlled areas , which represent one or more areas within host physical site  to which ingress or egress by any visitor, such as visitor , requires presentation of a visitor access medium  and requires the visitor have the required credentials for the controlled area. A host organization system  may include one or more PACS systems to manage PACS controlled areas . In one example, visitor access media include PACS provisioned visitor cards and other temporary access badges. In another example, visitor access media as described herein may include one or more types of physical, portable media specified and provisioned at visitor check-in point  and readable by door controllers within PACS controlled areas  to control access to PACS controlled areas  including, but not limited to, paper cards, bar code cards, magnetic cards, physical access tokens, media embedded with an electronic microchip, and media embedded with radio frequency identifier (RFID) chips. Visitor access media include portable media of multiple sizes and shapes that, for example, may be carried by the user or affixed to the user, such as by being clipped to a lanyard or worn as a pendant. In one example, visitor access media are specified and provisioned by the host organization for use by visitors using a physical, portable storage medium provided by the host organization. The host organization system may issue visitor access media that are distinguishable from employee cards issued to regular employees of the host organization. In another example, a visitor may also present a physical, portable storage medium at visitor check-in point  and the visitor's physical, portable storage medium may be specified and temporarily provisioned for use as a visitor access medium.","Prior to a host organization issuing visitor access medium  to visitor , when visitor  arrives on site, the host organization verifies the identity of visitor  at one of one or more visitor check-in points, such as visitor check-in point . Visitor check-in point  provides automated visitor identity authentication when visitor  arrives at host physical site . Once visitor check-in point  authenticates the identity of visitor , visitor check-in point  provides automated just in time issuance of visitor access medium . In one example, visitor check-in point  provides automated just in time issuance of visitor access medium  by provisioning visitor access medium  through a PACS visitor access provisioning system by sending a PACS request based on the authenticated visitor identity.","In the example, when a visitor requests to enter host physical site  at visitor check-in point , the visitor does not have an electronic identity managed by the host organization, however, host organization system  is able to automate the authentication of a visitor identity if the visitor is from a visitor organization with an existing electronic trust relationship with host organization system . In the example, an electronic trust (ET) relationship  is established between host organization system  and visitor organization system , an ET relationship  is established between host organization system  and visitor organization system , and an ET relationship  is established between host organization system  and visitor organization system . While host organization system  may have an existing electronic trust relationship established with each of visitor organization systems , , and , each of visitor organization systems , , and  may or may not have an existing electronic trust relationship established between one another.","In particular, in one example, visitor  to host physical site  does not have an electronic identity managed by host organization system , however, visitor  does have an electronic identity managed in identifiers  by visitor organization system . In the example, visitor organization system  maintains identifiers , visitor organizations system  maintains identifiers , and visitor organization system  maintains identifiers , where each of identifiers , , and  include one or more electronic identity accounts for one or more users. Each electronic identity account stores authentication information sufficient to authenticate a purported identity of a user, when the user providers the required credentials or other identifying information for authenticating the user's identification.","In the example, host organization system  automates the authentication of a visitor identity by requesting that a visitor organization system associated with the visitor at visitor check-in point  authenticate the identity of the visitor. The visitor organization system receives a user's credentials entered at visitor check-in point  and if the visitor organization authenticates the user's credentials against the user's electronic identity account, sends an authentication response, in the form of a secure token, to host organization system . Host organization system  validates the authentication response based on the electronic trust relationship between host organization system  and the visitor organization authentication service. The electronic trust relationships, such as ET relationships , , and , between host organization system  and a visitor organization are implemented so that host organization , which does not maintain authentication information for visitors, may rely on visitor organizations, which do maintain electronic identity accounts containing authentication information for users, to authenticate the identity of the visiting user, to host organization system .","In one example, ET relationships , , and  are implemented through electronic trust relationships in accordance with the WS-Federation standard established between host organization system  and each visitor organization system. In particular, host organization system  implements the authentication process established by existing electronic trust relationships in accordance with the WS-Federation standard for authenticating visitors for access to host electronic services, to also authenticate visitors for authenticating visitor identifies and issuing just in time visitor access media to visitors for access to host physical site . Each of host organization  and visitor organization systems , , and  runs and manages a Secure Token Issuing Service (STS) in accordance with the WS-Federation standard, such as STS , , , and . The WS-Federation standard implements additional standards including, but not limited to, WS-Trust and WS-Security standards.","As illustrated in , by combining the system architecture for an existing electronic trust relationship with an existing PACS to provide automated just in time issuance of PACS based visitor access media for visitors from visitor organizations with an existing relationship with the host organization at visitor check-in point , a host organization can use existing PACS and existing visitor access medium generation systems to automate issuance of just in time visitor access media using visitor organization authentication. In addition, by automating visitor identity authentication and providing automated just in time issuance of visitor access media for visitors from visitor organizations with an existing electronic trust relationship with the host organization at visitor check-in point , the host organization uses existing electronic trust relationships established for authenticating visitors for electronic access to host organization system  to reduce the time, cost, and potential human error associated with authenticating visitor identities and issuing just in time visitor access media for physical site access. Using the existing electronic trust relationship between a host organization and visitor organization for automating visitor identity authentication for physical site access also increases the efficiency of authenticating visitors using the relationship already established. Moreover, using the existing electronic trust relationship between a host organization and visitor organization for automating visitor identity authentication for physical site access also allows for both organizations to efficiently track visitor requests and movement.","In another example, when a visitor arrives at host physical site  from a visitor organization that does not have an existing electronic trust relationship with the host organization, visitor identity authentication and issuance of visitor access medium  may require one or more manual steps performed by security personnel for the host organization and the visitor in addition to or separate from visitor check-in point . For example, a visitor from a visitor organization that does not have an existing electronic trust relationship with the host organization may be required to fill out paperwork or an online form providing information about the visitor and reason for the visitor and to present a form of identification such as a passport. Security personnel from host organization, when the identity of the visitor is confirmed, may initiate the issuance of a visitor access medium to the visitor. In addition, the host organization may also require that visitors from visitor organizations that do not have an existing electronic trust relationship with the host organization register with the host organization prior to arriving onsite through manual or automated approval interfaces approved by the host organization.","With reference now to , a block diagram illustrates one example of implementing visitor authentication and just in time issuance of visitor access media for access to PACS controlled areas of a host physical site.","In the example, a just in time system  for a particular host organization includes a site visitor system , which includes at least one visitor check-in point, such as visitor check-in point . Visitor check-in point  includes a visitor access service  providing a graphical user interface (GUI) for allowing a visitor to log on through visitor interface  at visitor check-in point . In one example, a visitor interacts with visitor interface  to start or invoke the GUI of visitor access service . In one example visitor interface  is a web browser. The GUI of visitor access service  allows a visitor to logon to visitor access service , including selecting the visitor's employer from among a list of visitor organizations, and to request a PACS visitor access medium issuance.","Visitor access service  manages the automated trusted authentication and identity verification of the visitor for a host organization, where the visitor is from a visitor organization with an existing electronic trust relationship with the host organization enabling authentication under the WS-Federation standard. In addition, visitor check-in point  includes a visitor access provision system  for specifying and provisioning visitor access media on one or more types of portable, physical media, immediately following a successful authentication of a visitor identity using the visitor's organization's authentication credentials, based on the existing electronic trust relationship between the host organization and the visitor organization.","In the example, an existing electronic trust relationship is established between the host organization and a particular visitor organization according to the WS-Federation standard, including resource secure token service (STS)  run and managed by host organization system  and identity provider secure token service (STS)  run and managed by the visitor organization system for the visitor organization selected by the current visitor. In particular, in the example, the electronic trust relationship established between the host organization and a particular visitor organization is further extended by trust relationships established according to the WS-Federation standard between identity provider STS  and resource STS  as illustrated at reference numeral  and between visitor access service  and resource STS  as illustrated at reference numeral . Identity provider STS  manages an electronic identity account for a visitor and manages the authentication of the identity of the visitor for the host organization. Resource STS  authenticates that an authenticated identity token issued by identity provider STS  is issued by the visitor organization.","In addition, in the example, just in time system  includes a translator service . Translator  is accessed by visitor access service , either as a component of visitor access service  or as a separate service accessible via a network. Visitor access service  receives a WS-Federation secure token authenticating the visitor identity directed from visitor interface  and translator  translates the WS-Federation secure token and additional data from visitor interface  into a PACS visitor access provisioning request for sending to PACS visitor provision service .","In the example, PACS visitor provision service  provides an interface to visitor access service  for submitting PACS visitor access provisioning requests. For example, PACS visitor provision service  provides a service layer interface above PACS provider application programming interfaces (APIs) and other interfaces, illustrated as PACS provider  and PACS provider . Each of PACS provider  and PACS provider  direct one or more door controllers, such as door control  and door control , which control access to PACS controller areas . In one example, PACS provider  and PACS provider  are existing PACS provider systems for controlling PACS controlled areas  within host physical site  and PACS visitor provision service  is added to extend the existing PACS system","In the example, door control  and door control  may include readers for detecting one or more types of visitor access media. Door control  and door control  may detect visitor access media placed in contact with a reader or may detect visitor access media physically present within a local area.","With reference now to , a block diagram illustrates one example of a flow of communications between components in a system implementing just in time visitor authentication and issuance of visitor access media for access to PACS controlled areas of a host physical site.","In the example, a visitor starts or invokes the GUI of visitor access service  through visitor interface , such as through a browser window. The GUI at visitor interface  allows the visitor to select the visitor's organization. For example, as illustrated in , visitor interface  may include a window  that includes a selectable visitor organization list  from which a visitor selects a visitor organization associated with the visitor. In the example, visitor organization list  may include a list of the visitor organizations with which the host organization has an existing electronic trust relationship.","As illustrated, the visitor requests () access under the selected visitor organization. Visitor access service  sends a redirect message (A) to visitor interface  to send the request to resource secure token service (STS) , provided by the host organization. Visitor interface  sends a redirect message (B) to resource STS . Resource STS  receives the redirected message (B) with the access request and the selected visitor's organization, identifies the identity provider STS registered with the host for the visitor organization, and returns a message (C) designating the identified identity provider STS. In the example, the registered, trusted identity provider STS for the requested visitor organization is identity provider STS . Visitor interface  sends a redirect message (D) with the access request to identity provider STS .","Identity provider STS  presents the user with the visitor organization's login form () within visitor interface . For example, as illustrated in , visitor interface  may include a window  that includes the visitor organization log-in interface. The credentials or other identifying information () entered by the visitor in the visitor organization's login interface within visitor interface  are received by identity provider STS . Identity provider STS  authenticates the visitor using the visitor's employer authentication credentials entered by the visitor and creates a Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) ID-token containing the authenticated identity of the visitor and attribute assertions, where the token is signed and encrypted in accordance with the WS-Federation standard. In one example, the attribute assertions in the SAML ID-token may include, but are not limited to, basic name and contact details, contract identifiers and validity dates, professional and technical qualifications, and photograph. While in the example, the token verifying a visitor identity is referred to as a SAML ID-token, in other examples, the visitor verification token may include additional or alternate types of tokens or authentication elements.","Identity provider STS  sends the ID-token () generated by the identity provider for the visitor organization back to visitor interface . Visitor interface  redirects the ID-token () to resource STS  for the host organization. Resource STS  validates the token from identity provider STS  and issues a new SAML R-token () for use by visitor access service . The assertions contained in the ID-token received by resource STS  are copied into the new R-token issued by resource STS . While in the example, the token validating that the visitor verification token is issued by the visitor organization system is referred to as an SAML R-token or resource token, in other examples, the validation token may include additional or alternate types of tokens or authentication elements.","Visitor interface  receives the R-token issued by resource STS  and redirects the R-token () to visitor access service . Visitor access service  verifies the R-token is issued by resource STS  and enables the visitor access medium interface GUI () at visitor interface  through which the visitor is permitted to request a PACS visitor access medium. For example, as illustrated in , visitor interface  may include a window  that includes the visitor access medium request interface. Within the visitor access medium request interface window , the visitor may be prompted to provide information not included in the attribute assertions including, but not limited to, a contract period or other information related to a visitation period. Visitor interface  sends the PACS visitor access medium request () with any additional information entered by the visitor to visitor access service .","A message () with the R-token issued by resource STS  and any additional data collected by visitor access service  are sent to translator service . Translator service  reads the R-token and additional data, translates the token and additional data into a PACS visitor service request, and returns a formatted PACS visitor service request () to visitor access service . Visitor access service  sends a message () with the PACS visitor service request to a PACS visitor provision service . PACS visitor provision service  provides an interface for distributing the PACS visitor service request to PACS providers  and . PACS providers  and  send messages () to update door controls  and  with information about the new visitor access medium to be issued. PACS visitor provision service  also sends instructions () to issue the new visitor access medium to visitor access provision system  to be generated at visitor check-in point  for the visitor to use. For example, as illustrated in , visitor access provision system  may generate a visitor access medium  specified for the particular visitor, at visitor check-in point .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","502"]},"Computer system  includes a bus  or other communication device for communicating information within computer system , and at least one hardware processing device, such as processor , coupled to bus  for processing information.
