{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SOME EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS","DESCRIPTION OF SOME EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["Service providers (e.g., wireless, cellular, etc.) and device manufacturers are continually challenged to deliver value and convenience to consumers by, for example, providing compelling network services. These services are leading to vast amounts of data (structured and binary) which need to be managed, stored, searched, analyzed, etc. Over the last decade, the internet services have accumulated data in the range of exabytes (10bytes). Although most of this data is not structured in nature, however, it must be stored, searched and analyzed appropriately before any real time information can be drawn from it for providing services to the users.","Social networking services provide various interactions among communities of users (e.g., family, friends, colleagues, classmates, etc.) Social based services drive a lot of data into the network system. For example, the network system providing social networking services needs to capture every comment and post by a friend or by any other user connected to the user via the social network. This leads to petabytes (10bytes) of data even for a social network with only a few million users. Most of the search engines, such as for example Lucene\u00ae are geared to search on certain small amounts of data. However, when encountered with massive amounts of data, search engines such as Lucene do not scale.","In order to provide a scalable search indexing based infrastructure, data partitioning strategies are used. Examples of common partitioning strategies used by industries include key based partitioning, location based partitioning, etc. The location based partitioning is based on the fact that user location can be easily determined and can be used to find related content that has been pre-partitioned based on location. However, location based partitioning is not an efficient strategy in social networking systems. In order to scale in such systems, social graph based partitioning is a highly efficient mechanism. In social graph based partitioning, all use cases involving search of family and friends can be associated with data spaces which are closely aligned with the social graph of an individual. Furthermore, a predictive social graph provides data clustering methods to cluster data associated with the users of a social network according to their existing and possible future affiliations, interests, etc.","Therefore, there is a need for an approach for providing information clustering based on predictive social graphs.","According to one embodiment, a method comprises processing and\/or facilitating a processing of one or more social graphs associated with one or more users to cause, at least in part, a prediction of one or more future states of the one or more social graphs. The method also comprises causing, at least in part, a clustering of one or more data items associated with at least one information space based, at least in part, on the one or more social graphs, the one or more future states, or a combination thereof.","According to another embodiment, an apparatus comprises at least one processor, and at least one memory including computer program code for one or more computer programs, the at least one memory and the computer program code configured to, with the at least one processor, cause, at least in part, the apparatus to process and\/or facilitate a processing of one or more social graphs associated with one or more users to cause, at least in part, a prediction of one or more future states of the one or more social graphs. The apparatus is also caused to cause, at least in part, a clustering of one or more data items associated with at least one information space based, at least in part, on the one or more social graphs, the one or more future states, or a combination thereof.","According to another embodiment, a computer-readable storage medium carries one or more sequences of one or more instructions which, when executed by one or more processors, cause, at least in part, an apparatus to process and\/or facilitate a processing of one or more social graphs associated with one or more users to cause, at least in part, a prediction of one or more future states of the one or more social graphs. The apparatus is also caused to cause, at least in part, a clustering of one or more data items associated with at least one information space based, at least in part, on the one or more social graphs, the one or more future states, or a combination thereof.","According to another embodiment, an apparatus comprises means for processing and\/or facilitating a processing of one or more social graphs associated with one or more users to cause, at least in part, a prediction of one or more future states of the one or more social graphs. The apparatus also comprises means for causing, at least in part, a clustering of one or more data items associated with at least one information space based, at least in part, on the one or more social graphs, the one or more future states, or a combination thereof.","In addition, for various example embodiments of the invention, the following is applicable: a method comprising facilitating a processing of and\/or processing (1) data and\/or (2) information and\/or (3) at least one signal, the (1) data and\/or (2) information and\/or (3) at least one signal based, at least in part, on (or derived at least in part from) any one or any combination of methods (or processes) disclosed in this application as relevant to any embodiment of the invention.","For various example embodiments of the invention, the following is also applicable: a method comprising facilitating access to at least one interface configured to allow access to at least one service, the at least one service configured to perform any one or any combination of network or service provider methods (or processes) disclosed in this application.","For various example embodiments of the invention, the following is also applicable: a method comprising facilitating creating and\/or facilitating modifying (1) at least one device user interface element and\/or (2) at least one device user interface functionality, the (1) at least one device user interface element and\/or (2) at least one device user interface functionality based, at least in part, on data and\/or information resulting from one or any combination of methods or processes disclosed in this application as relevant to any embodiment of the invention, and\/or at least one signal resulting from one or any combination of methods (or processes) disclosed in this application as relevant to any embodiment of the invention.","For various example embodiments of the invention, the following is also applicable: a method comprising creating and\/or modifying (1) at least one device user interface element and\/or (2) at least one device user interface functionality, the (1) at least one device user interface element and\/or (2) at least one device user interface functionality based at least in part on data and\/or information resulting from one or any combination of methods (or processes) disclosed in this application as relevant to any embodiment of the invention, and\/or at least one signal resulting from one or any combination of methods (or processes) disclosed in this application as relevant to any embodiment of the invention.","In various example embodiments, the methods (or processes) can be accomplished on the service provider side or on the mobile device side or in any shared way between service provider and mobile device with actions being performed on both sides.","For various example embodiments, the following is applicable: An apparatus comprising means for performing the method disclosed herein.","Still other aspects, features, and advantages of the invention are readily apparent from the following detailed description, simply by illustrating a number of particular embodiments and implementations, including the best mode contemplated for carrying out the invention. The invention is also capable of other and different embodiments, and its several details can be modified in various obvious respects, all without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly, the drawings and description are to be regarded as illustrative in nature, and not as restrictive.","Examples of a method, apparatus, and computer program for providing information clustering based on predictive social graphs are disclosed. In the following description, for the purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the embodiments of the invention. It is apparent, however, to one skilled in the art that the embodiments of the invention may be practiced without these specific details or with an equivalent arrangement. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the embodiments of the invention.","As used herein, the term \u201ccomputation closure\u201d identifies a particular computation procedure together with relations and communications among various processes including passing arguments, sharing process results, selecting results provided from computation of alternative inputs, flow of data and process results, etc. The computation closures (e.g., a granular reflective set of instructions, data, and\/or related execution context or state) provide the capability of slicing of computations for processes and transmitting the computation slices between devices, infrastructures and information sources.","As used herein, the term \u201ccloud\u201d refers to an aggregated set of information and computation closures from different sources. This multi-sourcing is very flexible since it accounts and relies on the observation that the same piece of information or computation can come from different sources. In one embodiment, information and computations within the cloud are represented using Semantic Web standards such as Resource Description Framework (RDF), RDF Schema (RDFS), OWL (Web Ontology Language), FOAF (Friend of a Friend ontology), rule sets in RuleML (Rule Markup Language), etc. Furthermore, as used herein, RDF refers to a family of World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) specifications originally designed as a metadata data model. It has come to be used as a general method for conceptual description or modeling of information and computations that is implemented in web resources; using a variety of syntax formats. Although various embodiments are described with respect to clouds, it is contemplated that the approach described herein may be used with other structures and conceptual description methods used to create distributed models of information and computations.","In one embodiment, according to a definition by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), cloud computing is a model for enabling convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction. This cloud model promotes availability and is composed of five essential characteristics, three service models, and four deployment models. The essential characteristics of the cloud model consist of on-demand self-service, broad network access, resource pooling, rapid elasticity, and measured Service.","The on-demand self-service characteristic of the cloud model enables a consumer to unilaterally provision computing capabilities, such as server time and network storage, as needed automatically without requiring human interaction with each service's provider.","The broad network access characteristic of the cloud model provides capabilities available over the network that can be accessed through standard mechanisms that promote use by heterogeneous thin or thick client platforms (e.g., mobile phones, laptops, and PDAs).","Based on the resource pooling characteristic of the cloud model, the provider's computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model, with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to consumer demand. There is a sense of location independence in that the customer generally has no control or knowledge over the exact location of the provided resources but may be able to specify location at a higher level of abstraction (e.g., country, state, or datacenter). Examples of resources include storage, processing, memory, network bandwidth, and virtual machines.","The rapid elasticity of the cloud model provides rapid and elastic, and in some cases automatic, provision of capabilities to quickly scale out and rapid release to quickly scale in. To the consumer, the capabilities available for provisioning often appear to be unlimited and can be purchased in any quantity at any time.","According to the measured service characteristic, cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging a metering capability at some level of abstraction appropriate to the type of service (e.g., storage, processing, bandwidth, and active user accounts). Resource usage can be monitored, controlled, and reported providing transparency for both the provider and consumer of the utilized service.","Furthermore, the service models associated with the cloud model include Cloud Software as a Service (SaaS), Cloud Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Cloud Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).","The Cloud Software as a Service (SaaS) provides, to the customer, the capability to use the provider's applications running on a cloud infrastructure. The applications are accessible from various client devices through a thin client interface such as a web browser (e.g., web-based email). According to this service model, the consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network, servers, operating systems, storage, or even individual application capabilities, with the possible exception of limited user-specific application configuration settings.","The Cloud Platform as a Service (PaaS) provides, to the customer, the capability to deploy onto the cloud infrastructure consumer-created or acquired applications created using programming languages and tools supported by the provider. According to this service model, the consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network, servers, operating systems, or storage, but has control over the deployed applications and possibly application hosting environment configurations.","The Cloud Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) provides, to the customer, the capability to provision processing, storage, networks, and other fundamental computing resources where the consumer is able to deploy and run arbitrary software, which can include operating systems and applications. According to this service model, the consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure but has control over operating systems, storage, deployed applications, and possibly limited control of select networking components (e.g., host firewalls).","Additionally, a cloud model can be deployed as a private cloud, a community cloud, a public cloud, or a hybrid cloud. In one embodiment, according to a private cloud model, the cloud infrastructure is operated solely for an organization. It may be managed by the organization or a third party and may exist on premise or off premise. Alternatively, a community cloud infrastructure is shared by several organizations and supports a specific community that has shared concerns (e.g., mission, security requirements, policy, and compliance considerations). It may be managed by the organizations or a third party and may exist on premise or off premise. A public cloud infrastructure is made available to the general public or a large industry group and is owned by an organization selling cloud services. Finally, a hybrid cloud infrastructure is a composition of two or more clouds (private, community, or public) that remain unique entities but are bound together by standardized or proprietary technology that enables data and application portability (e.g., cloud bursting for load-balancing between clouds).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["107","107","105"],"i":["a","i "]},"In one embodiment, when encountered with massive amounts of data associated with social networks, in order to provide a scalable search indexing based infrastructure, some data partitioning strategies need to be implemented to scale when trying to forecast social graphs, wherein a social graph is described as the global mapping of everybody and how they are related.","In one embodiment, the social graphs of users of UEs -may be maintained and processed by the computation clouds -. For example, the graph data may be stored in information spaces -while the program codes, scripts, or software that process and maintain the social graphs may be provided by the computation spaces -","The current data partitioning strategies explored by industries are based on using easy to find attributes of the data. However, in cases when a huge amount of data needs to be partitioned, these common strategies do not scale very efficiently in a social networking space.","In one embodiment, in order to scale in such social networking systems, social graph based data partitioning is a highly efficient mechanism. A data partitioning strategy based on social graph clustering is an efficient way of storage of large amounts of data where the use cases involve social interaction.","In one embodiment, the data associated with a user of UEs -of a social network is stored in information spaces -based on the social graph of the user. In this embodiment, because of the efficiency of the partitioning strategy based on social graph clustering for storage of large amounts of data, the search will be much more efficient. However, at the time when data associated with a user of UEs -of the social network is stored in the network, the social graph of that user may not be yet available (e.g. have not been created yet).","To address this problem, a system  of  introduces the capability to providing information clustering based on predictive social graphs. In one embodiment, the information clustering platform  treats the social network information management process as a regular periodic motion of a dynamic information flow of a certain number of information trajectories. For example, an information trajectory, similar to a motion trajectory, provides a mapping of information flow through information spaces -","In one embodiment, the information clustering platform  interprets the state of information prediction process corresponding with creation of information trajectories as a state of a dynamic process in terms of regular and stochastic motion. At any moment, the information clustering platform  may predict the state of whole information management process only by observing the model state space corresponding with the process.","In one embodiment, the information clustering platform  determines the predictive social graph of a user of UEs -based, at least in part, on some key user attributes (for example, user affiliations, interests, age, education, location, etc.). These attributes can be used by the information clustering platform  to forecast the social graph of each user.","In one embodiment, the information clustering platform  predicts the social graph of a user of UEs -and pools the user with possible users of other UEs -who are likely to be in the circle of work, colleagues, friends, etc. It is noted that the predicted social graph may not be completely accurate, but a likely social graph can be good enough to cluster the users of UEs -into groups of likely users who may need to interact with each other.","In one embodiment, a user of UE may need the information regarding \u201cthe most common activity my friends are currently doing\u201d. An answer to this query may require search across all the friends of the user, while the friends' information may be distributed in the clouds -or in any other storage throughout the communication network  in random partitions.","In another embodiment, a user of UE may need the information regarding \u201cwhat are my friends from high school doing for the spring break\u201d. Similarly, this query may require searching across friend activities which may be distributed on distributed storages in random partitions.","Typically, searching on the data space across all user spaces is not efficient. However, predictive social graph clustering enables high performance storage and search for social networking use cases.","As shown in , the system  comprises a user equipment (UE) sets -of UEs -having connectivity to the information clustering platform  via a communication network . By way of example, the communication network  of system  includes one or more networks such as a data network, a wireless network, a telephony network, or any combination thereof. It is contemplated that the data network may be any local area network (LAN), metropolitan area network (MAN), wide area network (WAN), a public data network (e.g., the Internet), short range wireless network, or any other suitable packet-switched network, such as a commercially owned, proprietary packet-switched network, e.g., a proprietary cable or fiber-optic network, and the like, or any combination thereof. In addition, the wireless network may be, for example, a cellular network and may employ various technologies including enhanced data rates for global evolution (EDGE), general packet radio service (GPRS), global system for mobile communications (GSM), Internet protocol multimedia subsystem (IMS), universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS), etc., as well as any other suitable wireless medium, e.g., worldwide interoperability for microwave access (WiMAX), Long Term Evolution (LTE) networks, code division multiple access (CDMA), wideband code division multiple access (WCDMA), wireless fidelity (WiFi), wireless LAN (WLAN), Bluetooth\u00ae, Internet Protocol (IP) data casting, satellite, mobile ad-hoc network (MANET), and the like, or any combination thereof.","The UEs -are any type of mobile terminal, fixed terminal, or portable terminal including a mobile handset, station, unit, device, multimedia computer, multimedia tablet, Internet node, communicator, desktop computer, laptop computer, notebook computer, netbook computer, tablet computer, personal communication system (PCS) device, personal navigation device, personal digital assistants (PDAs), audio\/video player, digital camera\/camcorder, positioning device, television receiver, radio broadcast receiver, electronic book device, game device, or any combination thereof, including the accessories and peripherals of these devices, or any combination thereof. It is also contemplated that the UEs -can support any type of interface to the user (such as \u201cwearable\u201d circuitry, etc.).","In one embodiment, the structure of the social network information management process by the information clustering platform  is considered as a type of stochastic self-organization, wherein a future state of the process is determined based, at least in part, on predictable actions.","In one embodiment, the social network information is presented by the information clustering platform  as a regular periodic motion of a dynamic information flow of a certain number of information trajectories. Thus, the corresponding information prediction process state is interpreted as a state of a dynamic process in terms of regular and stochastic motion.","In one embodiment, the social network information management process is represented as a particular model that follows a certain type of state trajectory in a multidimensional state space that is sampled by stable and non-stable states. It is noted that the transition between those states, can be initiated by aspects, wherein the aspects represent any possible impact of any external entity that can utilize that particular information management process. Therefore, at any moment in time, it is possible to predict the state of a whole information management process only by observing its corresponding model state space. In particular, several known methods such as for example \u201cslicing\u201d can be used for providing the model state space.","In one embodiment, from the information management point of view, all consumptions and\/or allocations that would be necessary to undertake to translate the information closures into any potential demanded form or recombine some new form for the current needs would be seamlessly provided as a native feature of such information management process.","In one embodiment, the information management process states may be determined based, at least in part, on inference actions showing the actions leading to inference of the data, conceptual clustering not only based on the inherent structure of the data but also the descriptions available on the data, analogy creation or creating interpretations of data using other related data, working conditions, fault prediction, usage pattern, workload estimation, etc.","In one embodiment, a unified predictive social graph is provided clustering as information management process models that can accommodate different grains of information with different types of relationships. Such information management process can reflect information closures it might handle and, concurrently, such content can reflect information management process it may reside in.","In one embodiment, the overall social graph prediction process consists of observation of the sequences of the most recent state route (trajectory). As previously stated, the trajectory defines a finite set of possible future states at given point in the (nearest) future. This knowledge is leveraged in controlling the system management and determining the optimal working parameters for the system. The set of possible future states can be further reduced by observing the history of the aspects and by trying to extract patterns in their sequences. Predicting the future impacts to the social graph significantly improves the accuracy of the state route (trajectory) prediction.","In one embodiment, the transformation for translating the data content into any potential future form or elaborate some new form for the current needs can be seamlessly provided as a native feature of the prediction mechanism. On the other hand, from the social graph management point of view, a number of social graph information states (e.g. working conditions) can be possible to determine. Such states may be, for example, inconsistence prediction, user attributes forecasting, usage patterns, workload estimation, etc.","In one embodiment, all of the transitive that represent social graph information stream are correlated, meaning that orthogonal by the moment of the creation, the closures have degree of orthogonality no more than one unit. Therefore, at any moment once the closure generation is dropped, information fragments are easily recombined and aggregated to serve any other query.","In one embodiment, the degree of orthogonality can be driven by the least meaningful information fragment, where the information fragment is defined as RDF molecules, the finest component into which the graph can be decomposed without loss of information, or by signature, or by equivalent class, a set of RDF molecules representing equivalent information.","In one embodiment, a social graph can be characterized by constructing the information gain vector. Furthermore, the aspects can be synthesized by a particular productization mechanism for consolidating the aspects into specific platforms. Subsequently, the information gain can be transformed to signatures, for example, through signatures synthesis. The signature synthesis mechanism can be adjusted to accept overlapping, in order to enable weighing.","In one embodiment, trajectories are constructed for particular signature series. Additionally, trajectory traversing, (e.g. view) can be performed either by slicing (for example through Poisson regression methods, multimodal tracking, etc.) or by emphasizing any particular aspect (e.g., rules, queries etc).","In one embodiment, various features can be provided such as, for example, difference between information based on time domain; search for particular information, since information is processed in signatures domain, the process is instant; various inference actions for the primary information domain, etc. Additionally, updates can be accounted by the trajectory and signatures synthesis process.","In one embodiment, information gain of any data can be constructed by a set of aggregate queries. Therefore, relationships between static and dynamic information entities, as well as the information entities, are defined (inserted\/retracted triples, subscriptions and queries). It is noted that a static information is just data source readings, a subscription is the value of any query over the data source reading fixed in a certain time frame, and a query is presented as one vector. Such representation may not be the only one, since any other suitable approach can be used as well.","In one embodiment, the lowest recombination element can be considered as a grain of any information fragment. Generalized information control is represented by relationship between Query\/Information product and dispersing, thus, is provided by the accounted signatures.","In one embodiment, the main profile of information control is shaped by the multitude of instances of the previously mentioned process. Since exact solution is characterized by means of limit cycle shaped in the phase space when the phase volume passes the break point of phase volume reduction, it is a matter of the aspects nature to direct and conduct the phase trajectory of the whole process.","It is noted that any, even potential, candidate of information fragment is recognized as one element of the particular phase trajectory, e.g. point. It encapsulates any potential candidate from any other information fragment converging the uncertainty of the status of any information fragment in the whole system to the relationship between stable\/unstable trajectory motion and aspects featured as the drivers of the recombination process.","By way of example, the UEs -, and the information clustering platform  communicate with each other and other components of the communication network  using well known, new or still developing protocols. In this context, a protocol includes a set of rules defining how the network nodes within the communication network  interact with each other based on information sent over the communication links. The protocols are effective at different layers of operation within each node, from generating and receiving physical signals of various types, to selecting a link for transferring those signals, to the format of information indicated by those signals, to identifying which software application executing on a computer system sends or receives the information. The conceptually different layers of protocols for exchanging information over a network are described in the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Reference Model.","Communications between the network nodes are typically effected by exchanging discrete packets of data. Each packet typically comprises (1) header information associated with a particular protocol, and (2) payload information that follows the header information and contains information that may be processed independently of that particular protocol. In some protocols, the packet includes (3) trailer information following the payload and indicating the end of the payload information. The header includes information such as the source of the packet, its destination, the length of the payload, and other properties used by the protocol. Often, the data in the payload for the particular protocol includes a header and payload for a different protocol associated with a different, higher layer of the OSI Reference Model. The header for a particular protocol typically indicates a type for the next protocol contained in its payload. The higher layer protocol is said to be encapsulated in the lower layer protocol. The headers included in a packet traversing multiple heterogeneous networks, such as the Internet, typically include a physical (layer 1) header, a data-link (layer 2) header, an internetwork (layer 3) header and a transport (layer 4) header, and various application (layer 5, layer 6 and layer 7) headers as defined by the OSI Reference Model.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0077","num":"0076"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["103","201","203","205","207","209","211","213","215","217"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0078","num":"0077"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIGS. 3 and 4A","FIG. 3","FIG. 4A","FIG. 9"],"b":["300","103","300"]},"In one embodiment, per step , of process  of , the social graph generator  processes and\/or facilitates a processing of one or more user attributes  associated with one or more users of UEs -to determine one or more social graphs .
