The United States government has certain rights in the invention.","The present disclosure relates to a niobium oxide composition useful in electrodes, particularly anodes, of secondary lithium ion batteries, electrodes and secondary batteries containing such composition, and methods of their use in electrodes and secondary batteries.","Secondary (rechargeable) lithium ion batteries are widely utilized in consumer electronic devices such as cell phones and laptop computers owing, in part, to their high energy density. A secondary battery stores electrical energy as chemical energy in two electrodes, an anode (the reductant) and a cathode (the oxidant). In a secondary rechargeable lithium ion battery, the anode and the cathode are kept apart inside the battery by a separator that is permeable to a lithium-ion electrolyte that allows lithium ions (Li) to pass between the electrodes inside the battery, but forces the electrons to move in an external electronic circuit. The anode and the cathode normally include compounds into which lithium ions may be reversibly inserted. The electrolyte typically contains as lithium salt dissolved in an organic liquid to produce lithium ions. Often the electrolyte contains a flammable organic liquid carbonate. Conventional lithium ion batteries generally use an anode that has an electrochemical potential poorly matched to the energy at which the electrolyte is reduced, which results in a lower capacity and may introduce an internal short-circuit that sets the electrolyte on fire unless charging rates are controlled.","Conventional lithium-ion secondary batteries are designed so that the electrolyte has a window between its LUMO (lowest occupied molecular orbital) and HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital). This window is typically between 1.1 and 4.3 eV below the Fermi energy (electrochemical potential) of elemental Lithium. Conventional lithium-ion secondary batteries also have an open-circuit voltage described by the equation:\n\n=()\/\n\nwhere Eis the Fermi energy of the anode, Eis the Fermi energy of the cathode, and e is the magnitude of the charge of an electron. If Elies above the energy of the electrolyte's LUMO, the electrolyte will be reduced during use of the battery unless a passivation layer forms on the anode surface. Such a solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) passivation layer contains elemental Lithium (Li) in order not to block lithium ion transfer across it.\n","When a conventional lithium ion secondary battery is charged, lithium ions are transferred from the electrolyte to the anode. Electrons (e) are also transferred to the anode at the same time. Higher voltages can be used to charge batteries more quickly, but if the voltage used in order to obtain a fast charge raises the energy of the incoming electrons above the Fermi energy (electrochemical potential) of metallic lithium, the lithium ions will inhomogenously plate out of the electrolyte onto the anode as elemental Lithium. If such a process occurs, the anode can develop a mossy surface and, eventually, a lithium dendrite can grow through the electrolyte to the cathode and short-circuit the battery with catastrophic results, such as a fire.","To prevent such short-circuits, carbon is typically used as the anode material into which lithium ions are be reversibly inserted. Insertion of lithium ions into carbon is a two phase reaction from C to LiCand provides a flat voltage of approximately 0.2 V versus Li\/Li. Unfortunately, the electrochemical potential of reduced carbon is above the electrolyte LUMO and thus carbon anodes form a passivating SEI layer as described above. This layer increases the impedance of the anode, robs lithium irreversibly from the cathode on the initial charge, and limits the charging voltage and thus the rate of charge. If the cell is charged too rapidly (typically at a voltage of 1.0 V versus Li\/Li), lithium ions are not able to traverse the SEI layer before they are plated out on the surface of the SEI layer as elemental Lithium, also as described above. This problem limits the rate of charge of a battery and can necessitate additional circuitry as a safety measure against battery short-circuits. In addition, the capacity of the cathode normally limits the capacity of a cell, and the entrapment of lithium in the anode SEI layer during charge can reduce the capacity of the cathode and therefore the energy stored in the cell.","One alternative anode material is the spinel LiTiO(Li[LiTi]O). Such an anode operates on the Ti(IV)\/Ti(III) redox couple located at 1.5 V versus Li\/Li. Such anodes are capable of a fast charge and a long cycle life because no SEI layer is formed. However, the material has a low specific capacity (\u2248120 mAh\/g) and the loss of 1.3 V relative to a carbon anode reduces the relative energy density of a battery using such a titanium-based anode. Therefore, there is a motivation to identify a solid anode material with a higher capacity and having a voltage in the range of 1.1\u2266V\u22661.5 V versus Li\/Li.","In accordance with the purpose(s) of the invention, as embodied and broadly described herein, this disclosure relates to niobium oxide compositions that may, in various aspects, be used in anodes of secondary lithium ion batteries.","In one aspect, the present disclosure provides an anode material comprising a niobium oxide.","In another aspect, the present disclosure provides an anode comprising a niobium oxide as the active electrode material.","In yet another aspect, the present disclosure provides a lithium ion battery containing said anode.","The present invention may be understood more readily by reference to the following detailed description and the Examples included therein.","Certain abbreviations commonly used throughout the specification are as follows:\n\n","The present specification makes reference to batteries.

Thus, if there are a variety of additional steps that may be performed, it is understood that each of these additional steps may be performed with any specific embodiment or combination of embodiments of the methods of the invention.","As briefly described above, the present invention provides a niobium oxide that may be used, for example, as the active material of an electrode, such as an anode, in a lithium ion battery. The inventive composition may have a crystal structure in which there are ionic displacements in the structural framework. When such niobium oxide compositions are used in an electrochemical cell or battery, lithium ions may be reversibly inserted into the niobium oxide over the voltage range of about 1.2 V to about 1.6 V versus lithium. In many embodiments, such reversible insertion may be facile and may occur rapidly.","In one aspect, the present invention provides an anode, suitable for use in a lithium ion secondary battery, wherein the anode includes a niobium oxide as described herein.","Niobium oxides of the current invention may operate at a voltage that may be substantially matched to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of an electrolyte, such as a carbonate liquid, thereby avoiding many of the problems associated with imbalances of between the anode and electrolyte.","In one aspect, a niobium oxide, such as, for example, TiNbOframework, may exhibit an oxidation and\/or reduction voltage upon extraction and\/or insertion of lithium ions that matches or substantially matches the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of an electrolyte, particularly a liquid electrolyte, such as a carbonate liquid, suitable for use in a lithium ion secondary battery.","In one aspect, such a voltage matching capability may provide a lithium ion secondary battery containing an anode formed from the niobium oxide of the invention with improved safety properties over numerous charge\/discharge cycles. In another aspect, use of such niobium oxide in the anode may can reduce the cost, complexity, and\/or time needed to construct lithium ion batteries. In addition, the niobium oxide of the invention may reduce and\/or prevent the irreversible capacity loss of the cathode that can occur when a mismatch between anode voltage and electrolyte LUMO results in the formation of an SEI passivation layer on the anode surface.","Although other anode materials that are safer than convention anode compositions, such as, for example, LiTiOspinel, have been identified, the niobium oxide of the present invention may provide increased energy density and\/or power capability, together with improved safety.","Thus, in one aspect, the niobium oxide of the invention may provide improved safety in a lithium ion secondary battery. In another aspect, it may provide increased charge and discharge rates over conventional batteries containing conventional anode materials. In yet another aspect, the niobium oxide may provide increased capacity over conventional anode materials and previously identified safer alternatives.","Niobium Oxide and Its Preparation","A niobium oxide of the present invention may have the formula LiMNbNbO, where 0\u2266x\u22663, 0\u2266y\u22661 and M represents Ti or Zr. Examples of such oxides include LiTiNbO(TNO), and LiTiNbNbO(DTNO), such as LiTiNbNbO. Partially replacing Ti with Nb enhances the intrinsic conductivity of the niobium oxide composition. For example, replacing 10% Ti atoms at Ti sites with Nb atoms can transform insulating TiNbOinto conducting TiNbNbO.","A niobium oxide of the present invention may be in the form of particles that may be of variable shape, from needles to disks. These particles may be from one to several hundreds of nanometers in any dimension. The particles may aggregated or not, and aggregates may be nearly spherical or ellipsoidal.","Embodiments of the invention may be prepared in different ways. For example, a niobium oxide may be prepared by conventional sol-gel methods or by conventional solid state reactions. For instance TNO and DTNO may be prepared by sol-gel and solid state techniques, which techniques have been tested as described below and have produced the desired materials.","In the sol-gel technique, TNO may be produced using NbO, hydrofluoric acid, Ti(OCH), ammonia, and citric-acid monohydrate as starting materials. First, NbOmay be dissolved in hydrofluoric acid to form a transparent solution. In order to remove the F ions from the solution, ammonia may be added to obtain a white Nb(OH)precipitate. After the precipitate is washed and dried, the Nb(OH)may be dissolved in citric acid to form a Nb(V)-citrate solution. A water-ethanol solution containing Ti(OCH)may be added to this solution while the pH value of the solution is adjusted using ammonia. This final mixture containing Nb(V) and Ti(IV) ions may be stirred at 90\u00b0 C. to form a citric gel. This gel may then be heated to 140\u00b0 C. to obtain a precursor. The precursor may be annealed at 900\u00b0 C. and at 1350\u00b0 C. to obtain the TNO product.","A DTNO product may be prepared by a solid state reaction, with stoichiometric amounts of the starting materials, NbONb, and TiO. The starting materials may be thoroughly ground and pressed into pellets. The pellets may be wrapped in Ta foil, sealed in a vacuum quartz tube, and annealed. The size of the oxide particles may be tailored by the annealing temperature and time. For example, annealing may occur by heating at 900\u00b0 C., then at 1100\u00b0 C., with each temperature being maintained for 24 hours to obtain particles in the nanometer size range as shown in . Oxides containing lithium (Li) (x\u22600) may be obtained electrochemically upon first discharge, the corresponding oxide without Li may be used as the cathode material in an electrochemical cell having a metallic lithium anode.","In a specific embodiment, a niobium oxide according to the present invention may be in the form of carbon coated oxide particles. The carbon coating may be continuous or discontinuous covering all or a portion of the niobium oxide. In one embodiment, the amount of the carbon coating, if present, may up to 3.0% by weight of the coated niobium oxide composition. In more specific embodiments, the carbon coating may be present in an amount of up to 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, 2.0, 2.25, 2.5 or 2.75% by weight of the coated niobium oxide composition. The presence of a carbon coating enhances the electronic conductivity of the niobium oxide and may help stabilize the Nb(IV) valence state. In other aspects, the amount of carbon coating may be from about 1-2 wt % of the coated niobium oxide. In still other aspects, the amount of carbon coating, if present, may be less than about 0.5% of the coated oxide. In additional aspects, the amount of carbon coating, if present, may be greater than 3.0% by weight of the coated niobium oxide.","A carbon coating, if present, can be formed by known methods and one of skill in the art could readily select an appropriate method to form a desirable carbon coating. In one example method one may mix an organic carbon precursor with the niobium oxide, then pyrolize the mixture at a temperature within the stability temperature range of the niobium. Such pyrollysis may be carried out under a non oxidizing atmosphere.","A niobium oxide of the present invention may be used as an active electrode material, such as an active anode material in an anode composition. Such an anode composition may include at least one or more niobium oxides of formula LiMNbNbO, and optionally additional components selected for instance from electronic conducting agents and binders. The electronic conducting material may include a carbon material, such as, for example, carbon black, acetylene back, graphite, or carbon nanotubes. The binder may include a polymer such as polyacrylonitrile (PAN), polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) or polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA). In a specific embodiment, the electrode material may contain from 60 to 75 wt % of LiMNbNbO. In a more specific embodiment, it may also contain from 30 to 15 wt % of electronic conducting agent, and\/or up to 10 wt % of a binder. In a specific example of anode composition, the proportions of niobium oxide, electronic conducting agent and binder may be 65:30:5 (wt %).","Electrodes and Batteries","In another aspect, the present invention provides an anode including an active anode material containing a niobium oxide of the invention. The anode material may be in the form of an anode composition as described above. The anode active anode material may be provided on a current collector. The current collector may be, for example, made of aluminum or copper. The anode may be used as the anode, for example, in a lithium ion secondary battery.","In one example method of obtaining an anode in a coin cell, the anode active material and a carbon material may first be mixed completely, then a binder may be added and the mass may be mixed again. The mixture may then rolled into thin sheets and punched into circular disks. A disk thus obtained may be placed on a current collector made, for example, of copper or aluminum. The typical mass of each thin circular disk of anode material may be 2-5 mg. One of ordinary skill in the art, using the teachings of this disclosure, may form anodes containing niobium oxide active material suitable for other types of electrochemical cells and batteries.","In one embodiment, a lithium ion secondary with an anode containing a niobium oxide of the invention may operate based on a Li insertion\/extraction process at 1.1-1.6 V versus Li\/Lithat is fully reversible. Such a battery may be capable of fast charge and discharge rates. The extrinsic electronic conductivity of the niobium oxide may be enhanced by carbon coating the niobium oxide. Similarly, the intrinsic conductivity may be improved by substituting Nb for Ti. C\u2014TiNbNbOis one example of a niobium oxide having enhanced intrinsic conductivity.","A lithium ion secondary wherein the anode is as described herein may exhibit a reversible specific capacity of about 285 mAh\/g on cycling between 1.0 and 2.5 V versus Li\/Li. Such a capacity may be achieved with over 95% efficiency at 0.2 C. The ability to retain such a specific capacity of about 190 mAh\/g at 16 C makes C-TNO or C-DTNO an attractive anode material alternative compared to conventional materials, such as the spinel LiTiO. illustrates Nb and Ti atoms and a 2D interstitial space for Li insertion. Provided three lithium ions (Li) per formula unit are inserted, such a structure provides a high theoretical capacity of 387.6 mAh\/g for overlapping Ti(IV)\/Ti(III) and Nb(V)\/Nb(III) redox couples.","In another embodiment, a lithium ion secondary battery may contain a cathode, which may be made of a composite cathode material on a current collector. The current collector may be, for example, made of a copper foil or an aluminum foil. The composite material may contain an active material including a compound that allows reversible insertion of lithium ions at a potential more oxidizing than that of the anode. The composite cathode material may also contain an electronic conducting agent and\/or optionally a binder. The electronic conducting agent and the binder may be selected from those mentioned for the anode. The active material may be selected from transition-metal oxides able to provide a host framework into which lithium ion may be reversibly inserted and extracted. A specific example of such a material is an oxide with a spinel framework, [NiMn]O, into which lithium ions may be reversibly inserted to form Li[NiMn]Owith 0\u2266z\u22660, and from which lithium ions may be reversibly extracted.","In a lithium ion secondary battery of the invention, the electrolyte may include a lithium salt dissolved in a liquid solvent or in a polymer. In certain embodiments, the lithium salt may be selected from lithium salts conventionally used is lithium ion secondary batteries. Examples of anions of the lithium salt include perfluoroalcanesulfonates, bis(perfluoro-alkylsulfonyl) imides, perchlorate (ClO), hexafluorophosphate (PF) or tetrafluoroborate (BF).","The liquid solvent may be an organic carbonates or an ionic liquids. Examples of organic carbonates include propylene carbonate, ethylene carbonate, and dialkyl carbonates (such as dimethylcarbonate, diethylcarbonate and methylpropylcarbonate).","The polymer may be a polar polymer selected from solvating, crosslinked or non-crosslinked polymers. A solvating polymer may be a polymer that contains solvating units containing at least one hetero atom chosen from sulfur, oxygen, nitrogen and fluorine. Example solvating polymers include polyethers of linear, comb or block structure, forming or not forming a network, based on poly(ethylene oxide), or polymers containing the ethylene oxide or propylene oxide or allyl glycidyl ether unit, polyphosphazenes, crosslinked networks based on polyethylene glycol crosslinked with isocyanates or networks obtained by poly-condensation and bearing groups that allow the incorporation of crosslinkable groups.","In one example electrochemical half-cell, the parameters of which have been verified experimentally, one electrode may contain a carbon coated niobium oxide (C-TNO) as the active material, the other electrode may contain metallic lithium, and the electrodes may be separated by a separator impregnated with a liquid electrolyte. In such an electrochemical cell, the potential versus Li\/Limay be smoothly increased from 1.3 to 1.6 V in a solid-solution reaction upon extraction of 1.5 Li per Li\/TiNbO. The potential versus L\/Limay be smoothly increased from 1.5 to 2.6 Li per TNO. A two-phase insertion reaction retains the voltage at 1.6 V versus Li\/Li. On discharging to 0.8 V in said half-cell, an SEI layer may formed, but in subsequent charge\/discharge cycles, C-TNO may exhibit a reversible specific capacity of about 350 mAh\/g, as demonstrated by ","In another example, an electrochemical full cell, the parameters of which have also been verified experimentally, may be construed. In such a cell the anode may contain a carbon coated niobium oxide (C-TNO) as the active material and the cathode may contain Li[NiMn]Oas the active material. Both electrodes may be separated by a separator impregnated with a liquid electrolyte. In such a full C-TNO\/ Li[NiMn]Ocell, capacity may be limited by the anode. Such a full cell may exhibit a reversible 3.0 V charge\/discharge over 30 cycles, whereas a similar cell with a capacity limited by the cathode may exhibit a capacity fade due to a lowering of the cathode potential to near 5.0 V versus Li\/Li.","The following examples are provided to further illustrate certain embodiments of the invention. They are not intended to limit the invention to the components, compositions, systems, techniques, or methods described in these examples. Unless indicated otherwise, parts are parts by weight, temperature is in \u00b0 C. or is at ambient temperature, and pressure is at or near atmospheric pressure.","TNO was prepared by a sol-gel technique. NbO(Alfa, 99.9%), hydrofluoric acid (40\/70 HF\/HO), Ti(OCH), ammonia, and citric-acid monohydrate were used as starting materials. First, NbOwas dissolved in hydrofluoric acid to form a transparent solution. In order to remove the Fions from the solution, ammonia was added to obtain a white Nb(OH)precipitate. After the precipitate was washed and dried, the Nb(OH)was dissolved in citric acid to form a Nb(V)-citrate solution. A water-ethanol solution containing Ti(OCH)was added to this solution while the pH value of the solution was adjusted by using ammonia. This final mixture containing Nb(V) and Ti(IV) ions was stirred to form a citric gel at 90\u00b0 C. This gel was heated to 140\u00b0 C. to obtain a precursor. The precursor was then annealed at 900\u00b0 C. and at 1350\u00b0 C. to obtain the TNO product.","DTNO was prepared by conventional solid state reaction. Stoichiometric quantities of the starting materials, NbO(Alfa, 99.9%), Nb (Alfa, 99.9%), and TiO(Alfa, 99.9%), were thoroughly ground and pressed into pellets.

The mixtures thus obtained, with different concentrations of sucrose (ranging from 2 to 5 wt %), were dried at 80\u00b0 C. before the precursors were annealed at 550\u00b0 C. for 6 h in a flowing argon atmosphere.","Micrographs of samples were taken with a scanning electron microscope (SEM, SHIMDAZU SSX-550). ) and () correspond respectively to a TNO sample obtained according to the method of Example 1, and to a C-TNO sample prepared according to the method of Example 3.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0072"},"figref":"FIG. 1(","i":"b"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0073"},"figref":"FIG. 1(","i":"c","sub":"6 "},"Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) data were collected with a Rigaku D\/max X-ray diffractometer (Cu K radiation, \u03bb=1.5418 \u212b) operating at 40 kV and 30 mA in a 2\u03b8 range of 10-80\u00b0 with a step of 0.04\u00b0.

At a discharge\/charge rate of 0.2 C, the specific capacity is 275 mAh\/g, with no capacity fade for the next 30 cycles, with even higher energy storage efficiency.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0069","num":"0079"},"figref":["FIG. 4B","FIG. 4(B)","FIG. 4B"],"sub":["1 ","2 "],"sup":["+","st ","nd","rd ","th "]},"Experiments were made on a cell wherein the anode is a C-TNO electrode according to Example 5, the electrolyte is a 1 M LiPFin 1:1 EC\/DEC solution, and the cathode is made of a 65:30:5 (wt %) mixture of active material, acetylene black as an electronic conductor, and polytetrafluoroethylene as a binder, the active material of the cathode being the spinel Li[NiMn]O(LNMO). , Cand D demonstrate a practical application of C-TNO as an anode material in a lithium ion battery over the limited voltage ranges 1.5\u2266V\u22663.5 V and 1.5\u2266V\u22663.3 V, versus Li\/Li, respectively. \u201c1-10\u201d or \u201c10-1th\u201d means that the curves correspond to the first 10 cycles. Depending on which electrode is limiting, the specific capacities of the cells were calculated based on the weight of the C-TNO anode and the LNMO cathode, respectively. \u201cC-TNO limited cell\u201d means a cell in which the amount of C-TNO at the anode is lower than the amount which would allow the number of Li ions inserted to be equal to the number of Liions that can be extracted from the cathode material. \u201cLNMO limited cell\u201d means a cell in which the amount of LNMO at the cathode is lower than the amount which would allow the number of Liions inserted to be equal to the number of Liions that can be extracted from the anode material.","A C-TNO limited cell as defined above was cycled at a rate of C\/10 in the voltage range of 1.5-3.5 V. and Cshow the C-TNO-limited cell exhibited a perfect cycling performance in the first 30 cycles with a high coulombic efficiency of more than 95%.","A LNMO limited cell as defined above was cycled at a rate of C\/10 in the voltage range of 1.5-3.3 V.  shows the LNMO-limited cells gave a poor cycling performance with a capacity loss of 1.3% per cycle and a lower coulombic efficiency of 87.8%.","Two distinct cycling performances were found for different cutoff voltages. For the C-TNO-limited full cells, the potential of the LNMO cathode is still at 4.7 V versus Li metal, that of the C-TNO anode drops down to 1.2 V. However, with the LNMO-limited cell under the same conditions, the potential of the anode is at 1.5 V, that of the LNMO cathode rises to about 5 V where many adverse side reactions can occur between the electrolyte and the strongly oxidative cathode. Carbonate electrolytes are oxidized above 4.3 V and became unstable above 5 V versus Li\/Li.","The charge\/discharge properties of the bare TNO (non carbon coated), C-TNO and C-DTNO in cells similar to those of Example 6 were also investigated. The cells were tested in three different modes: (I) discharged at a fixed 0.1 C rate, charged over the range of 0.1-32 C; (II) charged at a fixed 0.1 C, discharged over the range of 0.1-2 C; and (III) charged and discharged both over the range of 0.1-2 C. , B, and C show typical charge\/discharge profiles of C-TNO in the three different modes. In , the charge curve at a charge rate of 0.1 C and the corresponding discharge curve are the curves (1) and (2) at the right side, the charge curve at a charge rate of 32 C and the corresponding discharge curve are the curves (1) and (2) at the left side, and the curves at the intermediate rates are between them, with a rank corresponding to the number range 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1, 0.5, 0.2, 0.1 C. In , the discharge curve at a discharge rate of 0.1 C and the corresponding charge curve are the curves (1) and (2) at the right side, the discharge curve at a discharge rate of 2 C and the corresponding charge curve are the curves (1) and (2) at the left side, and the curves at the intermediate rates are between them, with a rank corresponding to the number range 2, 1, 0.5, 0.2, 0.1 C. In , the charge curve at a charge rate of 0.1 C and the corresponding discharge curve at a rate of 0.1 C are the curves (1) and (2) at the right side, the charge curve at a charge rate of 2 C and the corresponding discharge curve at a rate of 2 C are the curves (1) and (2) at the left side, and the curves at the intermediate rates are between them, with a rank corresponding to the number range 2, 1, 0.5, 0.2, 0.1 C. The most efficient mode is mode (I), where the electrode can be charged up to a capacity of 200 mAh\/g at a rate as high as 8 C, which means the electrode material possesses an outstanding Li-ion extractive diffusivity.","The cycle performances in mode (I) of bare TNO and C-TNO are compared in , which shows the evolution of the specific capacity for C-TNO at various charge rates (from 0.1 C to 32 C) \u25aa\u25aa\u25aa\u25aa\u25aa\u25aa and the corresponding discharge at a rate of 0.1 C \u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\u25cf, and the evolution of the specific capacity for bare TNO at a discharge rate of 0.1 C corresponding to various charge rates \u0394\u0394\u0394\u0394\u0394. At low rates, both of them exhibit comparable performances. However, at higher rates, the electronic contact of TNO with the current collector becomes insufficient and C-TNO reveals a better electrochemical behavior than bare TNO. A specific reversible capacity of 190 mAh\/g is obtained in C-TNO at rates of 16 C, whereas the specific capacity of the bare TNO drops to 160 mAh\/g at 4 C.","In mode (II), the electrochemical properties of bare TNO and C-TNO are compared in  which shows the evolution of the specific capacity for C-TNO at a charge rate of 0.1 C \u25aa\u25aa\u25aa\u25aa\u25aa\u25aa\u25aa and at the corresponding discharge at various rates (from 0.1 C to 2 C) \u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\u25cf, and the evolution of the specific capacity for bare TNO at various discharge rates (the charge rate being 0.1 C) \u0394\u0394\u0394\u0394. The performance improvement by the carbon coating is more pronounced at higher rates.","Comparing modes (III) and (II), an apparent difference in the rate of Li-ion transfer in the two different modes is observed. To enhance further the electrochemical properties of C-TNO, a C-DTNO was used as the anode material, i.e. a carbon coated oxide of formula TiNbNbO. In mode (III), the cycle performances of the bare TNO, C-TNO, and C-DTNO are shown in , in which \u25aa\u25aa\u25aa\u25aa represents charge of C-TNO at various rates, \u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\u25cf represents discharged of C-TNO at various rates, \u0394\u0394\u0394 represents discharges of bare TNO at various rates and \u22c4\u22c4\u22c4 represents C-DTNO at various rates.  shows that the electrochemical performance of the C-DTNO is better than that of bare TNO and C-TNO, which is due to the intrinsic and extrinsic conductivity improvement by atom substitution and carbon-coating.","In order to establish the true rate capability of the niobium oxide, a C-DTNO anode and coin cells were prepared according to the method of Example 5. The electrode material weight composition in the working electrode was: C-DTNO (65%), carbon black (30%) and PVDF (5%). The discharge rate was fixed at 2 C (0.5 hour for full discharge) and charging rates were increased gradually. In , V is the voltage, in Volts (vs Li\/Li) and C is the capacity (mAh\/g).  illustrates electrochemical characterization of the C-DTNO at high rate. The discharge current was fixed at 2 C without any holding of the voltage. Charge was carried out at various rates, starting from low rate corresponding to a charging time of 0.5 h (curves at the right side) up to a very high rate until the charging time reaches 6 seconds (curves at the left side).","The results in  show that extremely high charging rates can be achieved for the active material: more than 100 mAh\/g capacities can be achieved at a 20-second full charge; 70 mAh\/g can still be obtained at a 6-second full charge. Such charging rates are comparable to those reported for the LiTiOanode. In , \u25aa\u25aa\u25aa\u25aa represents the C-DTNO charge at various rates, and \u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\u25cf represents discharge at fixed 0.5 C.","To obtain a better insight into the mechanism of Li-ion insertion\/extraction in TNO, ex situ X-ray diffraction measurements were carried out (see ). During cell discharge (where the voltage varies from 2. V corresponding to x=0, to 1.0 V corresponding to x=3), Bragg peaks [\u2212402] and [703] grew gradually. They were accompanied by [\u2212505] and [703] peaks diminishing in the range of 0<x<3.0. Upon recharge (where the voltage varies from 1.0 V corresponding to x=3, to 2.5 V corresponding to x=0), a reverse situation was seen, and the Bragg peaks were almost totally recovered at x=0 after all Li ions were removed. As deduced from the XRD measurements detailed above, the conclusion is that the mechanism of Li-ion insertion\/extraction in the TNO system includes a two-phase process, in which a lithium-rich (2.6 Li\/formula unit) and a lithium-poor phase (1.5 Liper formula unit) coexist.","It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in the present invention without departing from the scope or spirit of the invention.
