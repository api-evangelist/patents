No. 60\/283,394, filed Apr. 12, 2001.","The subject matter of this application has been supported in part by research Grant No. CA52956 from the National Institutes for Health (NIH), Bethesda, Md.","The present invention relates to tropane alkaloid multidrug resistance inhibitors derived from and to methods of using the alkaloids in therapeutic treatments. More particularly, the present invention is directed to pervilleines A through F and pervilleine A N-oxide, and especially pervilleines A, B, and C, and their use in the treatment of diseases, such as a cancer.","A serious problem associated with cancer chemotherapy is the development of multidrug-resistant (MDR) tumor cells during the course of treatment. An important mechanism of acquiring the MDR phenotype in mammalian cells is the enhanced expression of a membrane glycoprotein, termed Pgp (Reference 1). Pgp, having a molecular weight of 170 kDa, is coded by the MDR1 gene.","Pgp functions as an energy-dependent multidrug membrane transporter that rapidly extrudes a variety of hydrophobic antitumor drugs from target cancer cells, and thereby prevents the drugs from exerting cytotoxic effects. Initial physiological and pharmacological studies with multidrug-resistant mutant cell lines correlated resistance to reduced accumulation of drugs within the cell due to increased efflux or decreased influx (1). Because the efflux pump is an ATP-dependent transport system (2), agents that are good inhibitors of ATP-dependent drug transport should inhibit the efflux of hydrophobic drugs from resistant cells and increase intracellular accumulation. Accordingly, a variety of agents have been reported to overcome or at least partially circumvent MDR (3).","First-generation modulators originally were developed for other therapeutic indications (4). Included in this category are calcium channel blockers, such as verapamil (5), the immunosuppressive agent cyclosporin A (6), analogues of the anti-hypertensive reserpine and yohimbine (7), the neuroleptic agent, trifluroperazine (4), and antiestrogens, such as tamoxifen (1). Second-generation modulators were developed that lacked the pharmacological activities of the first-generation compounds and usually possessed higher affinity for Pgp. These agents include the R isomer of verapamil (8), a nonimmunosuppressive analogue of cyclosporin D, SDZ PSC-833 (6), and others such as MS-209 (9), S-9788 (10), GF120918 (11), and LY335979 (4).","While many of these pharmacological agents have been found to completely overcome drug resistance in in vitro models, the number of reports showing such phenomena in in vivo systems is more limited (12\u201315). The lack of in vivo activity of chemosensitizers results mainly from problems associated with maintaining active doses without causing serious side effects (16). Thus, clinical phase I and phase I\/II studies often have been disappointing because of limited tolerance to prototype MDR inhibitors by themselves, which precluded attainment of potentially active levels in patients (11, 17).","For example, full reversion of MDR by verapamil requires a concentration of approximately 10 \u03bcM in most cell culture models, whereas plasma levels above 1 \u03bcM result in atrioventricular blocks (5, 18). Immunosuppressive effects and nephrotoxicity limit the clinical usefulness of cyclosporin A (6), and toxicities, such as cerebellar ataxia and hyperbilirubinemia, are caused by SDZ PSC-833 (19, 20). Also, cyclosporin A, verapamil, and SDZ PSC-833 have profound effects on the pharmacokinetics of doxorubicin, etoposide, and other oncolytic drugs (4).","As recently reported (21), the MDR modulator valspoday is being evaluated in phase III, randomized trials for the treatment of AML, multiple myeloma, and ovarian cancer. Also, Ontogen Corporation has announced completion of a phase I study conducted with the MDR-reversing agent OC 144-093 (22) and a second phase I study to examine oral administration is underway.","One part of a natural product drug discovery program involves monitoring the potential of plant extracts to reverse multiple drug resistance. Standard cell survival assays are used to determine the dose of plant extracts or compounds required to inhibit cell growth by 50% (IC) with drug-sensitive human epidermoid carcinoma parental KB-3 cells and Pgp-associated multidrug-resistant KB-V1 cells. To investigate the potential of plant extracts or compounds to reverse multidrug-resistance, KB-V1 cells are treated with different concentrations of plant extracts or compounds in the presence (1 \u03bcg\/ml) or absence of vinblastine. This concentration of vinblastine is lethal to KB-3 cells, but does not affect the growth of KB-V1 cells. Therefore, KB-3 cells serve as a control to differentiate between nonspecific cytotoxicity and selective MDR antagonism.","The assay employs 96-well microtiter plate technology, and over 3,000 different plant extracts have been tested. Using the model for bioassay-guided isolation of active principles, four moderate inhibitors of MDR have been identified: coronaridine, conoduramine, voacamine, and (\u2212)-roemerine (23, 24).","The present invention, therefore, is directed to additional multidrug resistance inhibitors that are isolated from and overcome the problem associated with prior inhibitors.","The present invention is directed to tropane alkaloid multidrug resistance inhibitors, and their use in therapeutic applications. In particular, the present invention is directed to tropane alkaloid multidrug resistance inhibitors derived from and to the therapeutic use of such inhibitors. The present invention also is directed to inhibitors disclosed herein that are synthesized, as opposed to isolated from an extract and purified.","Therefore, one aspect of the present invention is to provide multidrug resistance inhibitors derived from and use of the inhibitors in a method of modulating the efflux capability of a P-glycoprotein (Pgp) in a cell or tissue by contacting the cell or tissue with an effective amount of the multidrug resistance inhibitor.","Another aspect of the present invention is to provide a method of potentiating the activity of a therapeutic drug in a cell or tissue by contacting the cell or tissue with a multidrug drug resistance inhibitor from that modulates the efflux capability of a Pgp.","In particular, the efflux capability of the Pgp can be selectively inhibited to retain a therapeutic drug, like a chemotherapeutic drug or antibiotic drug, in the cell, while maintaining normal efflux capabilities with respect to other compounds.","Still another aspect of the present invention is to provide an improved composition for treating a disease or condition comprising:","(a) a therapeutic drug useful in the treatment of the disease or condition, and","(b) a compound derived from and capable of selectively inhibiting the efflux capability of a Pgp with respect to the therapeutic drug. For example, the disease or condition is a cancer or an infection, and the therapeutic drug is a chemotherapeutic drug or an antibiotic, respectively.","As used herein, an \u201cinfection\u201d is defined as a bacterial, viral, parasitic, or other microbiological infection, and diseases and conditions resulting therefrom.","Another aspect of the present invention is to provide a pharmaceutical composition comprising","(a) a compound selected from the group consisting of pervilleine A, pervilleine B, pervilleine C, pervilleine D, pervilleine E, pervilleine F, pervilleine A N-oxide, and mixtures thereof, and","(b) a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.","Another aspect of the present invention is to provide an article of manufacture comprising: (a) a packaged anticancer compound and (b) a package insert describing coordinated administration to a patient of said anticancer compound and a compound selected from the group consisting of pervilleine A, pervilleine B, pervilleine C, pervilleine D, pervilleine E, pervilleine F, and pervilleine A N-oxide. The above articles of manufacture optionally can include packaged pervilleine A, pervilleine B, pervilleine C, pervilleine D, pervilleine E, pervilleine F, or pervilleine A N-oxide.","These and other aspects of the present invention will become apparent from the following nonlimiting, detailed description of the preferred embodiments.","P-Glycoprotein-mediated drug efflux can yield a multidrug-resistance (MDR) phenotype that is associated with a poor response to cancer chemotherapy. In accordance with an important feature of the present invention, extremely potent novel tropane alkaloid aromatic esters that overcome MDR were obtained from a chloroform-soluble extract derived from the roots of Baillon (Erythroxylaceae) (25). Baill. (Erythroxylaceae) was collected in Madagascar. This plant is known locally as \u201cTsivano\u201d and has several folkloric uses, including as a fish poison, and to treat abdominal pain and tumors.","Certain species from the plant genus (family Erythroxylaceae) are used in traditional medicine to treat amenorrhea, hemorrhage, kidney disorders, influenza, sinusitis, upset stomach, and to combat fatigue, the feeling of hunger, and as stimulants (52\u201354). Extracts of some species have shown biological activity, such as antiinflammatory, analgesic, and antimicrobial effects (54, 55). Tropane alkaloids are known to be present in and some are currently used in medicine (56\u201358). However, their activity as potential anticancer agents has not yet been investigated.","The compounds isolated from have been termed pervilleines, and are tropane alkaloids obtained from a chloroform extract of as the result of bioactivity-guided fractionation. Starting with crude plant material, pervilleine A was obtained in 0.042% w\/w yield, and pervilleines B and C also were obtained in good yield (0.035% and 0.045% w\/w, respectively).","The pervilleines were found to restore the vinblastine sensitivity of cultured multidrug-resistant KB-V1 and CEM\/VLBcells, with ICvalues for pervilleine A, for example, of 0.36 and 0.02 \u03bcM, respectively. Similarly, the chemosensitivity of KB-8-5 cells to colchicine was restored with an ICvalue for pervilleine A of 0.61 \u03bcM. Pervilleines B and C were found to restore the vinblastine sensitivity of cultured multidrug-resistant KB-VI cells, with ICvalues of 0.17 \u03bcM for each compound.","The mechanism of this response was evaluated using a number of model systems. First, incubation of multidrug resistant KB-V1 and CEM\/VLBcells with up to 45 \u03bcM pervilleine A for 72 hours did not significantly affect either the transcription of MDR1, as revealed by reverse transcriptional-PCR-based analysis of MDR1 mRNA, or levels of Pgp, as shown by Western blots. ATP-dependent binding of [H]vinblastine observed with isolated multidrug-resistant KB-V1 cell membrane vesicles was inhibited by pervilleine A in a dose-dependent manner, and kinetic analysis indicted competitive inhibition with respect to vinblastine binding with a Kof 7.3 \u03bcM. Consistent with this effect, intracellular accumulation of [H]vinblastine was increased from 0.18 pmol [H]vinblastine\/50\u00d710cells to approximately 5 pmol [H]vinblastine\/50\u00d710cells in the presence of 40 \u03bcM pervilleine A.","As described herein, the mechanism by which pervilleine A, B, and C, or the other pervilleines, reverse the MDR phenotype has been partially characterized. However, cancer treatments that appear promising with in vitro models are often less effective against solid tumors. One method of providing a preliminary indicator of therapeutic efficacy has been described recently by Hollingshead et al. (26). The majority of the human tumor cell lines currently employed in cell culture can be grown inside hollow fibers (27) to form a heterogeneous solid tumor model. Therefore, semipermeable hollow fibers containing human tumor cells are implanted at the intraperitoneal or subcutaneous compartments of host mice, and the mice are treated with the test substances of interest. Through determination of the potential to inhibit cell growth versus potential to mediate a toxic response toward the host, a preliminary estimate of therapeutic efficacy is provided in a cost- and time-effective manner (28). This model was used for assessing MDR reversing agents in combination with conventional chemotherapeutic agents, and the results were obtained for pervilleine A, B, and C.","Therefore, to explore the potential relevance of the above responses, KB-V1 or KB-8-5 cells were placed in hollow fibers and implanted into NCr nu\/nu mice. Cell growth was not significantly inhibited when vinblastine or pervilleine A, B, or C were administered as single agents, but when used in combination, inhibitions of up to 75% for pervilleine A, and up to 77.5% for pervilleines B and C, were observed. Equimolar doses of verapamil were less effective. These data indicate that pervilleine A, B, and C are effective inhibitors of P-glycoprotein.","In accordance with an important feature of the present invention, and a chloroform-soluble extract of the Madagascan plant, Baill. (Erythroxylaceae), gave a pronounced selective inhibitory activity for a multidrug-resistant human cancer cell line (KB-V1) assessed in the presence of the antineoplastic drug, vinblastine (VLB). Chromatographic fractionation, using this cell line to monitor purification, led to the isolation and structural characterization of nine tropane aromatic ester alkaloids.","Seven of these compounds are new, and have been assigned the trival names \u201cpervilleines A\u2013F\u201d and \u201cpervilleine A N-oxide.\u201d The procedures used for the isolation and structural characterization of these seven new compounds are described hereafter. Also described is the single-crystal X-ray diffraction of one of the two known compounds obtained, tropane-3\u03b1,6\u03b2,7\u03b2-triol 3-phenylacetate. The structures of pervilleines A\u2013F, pervilleine A N-oxide, and verapamil are shown below: \n\n","The pervilleines compared favorably as inhibitors of the multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype with several standard MDR inhibitors, including verapamil, cyclosporin A, and GR120918 {N-{4-[2-(1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-6,7-dimethoxy-2-isoquinolinyl)-ethyl]-phenyl}-9,10-dihydro-5-methoxy-9-oxo-4-acridone carboxamide. Pervilleines A\u2013C are particularly potent, and represent a new chemotype of MDR inhibitor. These new natural products exhibit advantages over other MDR inhibitors, such as improved efficacy, reduced toxicity, and\/or a reduced incidence of undesired ancillary pharmacological effects.","The pervilleines were subjected to both preliminary and more focused biological testing. For example, Tables 3\u20135, respectively, summarize the following biological experiments: in vitro cytotoxicity of these compounds in a human tumor cell panel; multidrug resistance inhibition in an ovarian cancer cell line; and in vitro multidrug resistance modulation in some cell lines available at the National Cancer Institute. The conclusions from these experiments are: several of the pervilleines showed substantial selectivity for a multidrug-resistant cell line (KB, oral epidermoid) in the presence of vinblastine (Table 8); pervilleines B and C reversed drug resistance in a multidrug-resistant human ovarian adenocarcinoma (SKVLB) cell line with potency comparable to the acridone carboxamide multidrug resistance (MDR) modulator GR120918 (Table 4); pervilleines B\u2013D and F exhibited comparable potency to verapamil and cyclosporin A in increasing the cytotoxicity of the standard substance (DINIB) (Table 5).","Additional biological evaluation on pervilleine A was performed, and the effects on the reversal of multidrug resistance of pervilleine A contrasted with those of verapamil in KB-V1 and KB-V-8 cells (Table 6) and CEM\/VLBcells (Table 7). In an in vivo study performed with the NCI hollow fiber model, KB-V1 and KB-8-5 cells were placed in hollow fibers and implanted into NCr nu\/nu mice (Table 10 and ). Cell growth was not significantly inhibited when vinblastine or pervilleine A were administered as single agents, but when used in combination, inhibition of up to 75% was observed. These data further confirm that pervilleine A is an effective inhibitor of P-glycoprotein. The biological activity of pervilleine A was extremely potent. This is the first time that the hollow fiber model has been used with a combination drug regimen to demonstrate reversal of the multidrug-resistance (MDR) phenotype. Similar positive results were obtained in the hollow fiber assay for pervilleines B and C.","In the present invention, a chloroform-soluble extract of was found to significantly inhibit the growth of a multidrug-resistant (MDR) KB-V1 cell line in the presence of vinblastine (VLB), while being much less cytotoxic for KB-V1 cells in the absence of VLB or normal KB cells. The nine tropane alkaloid aromatic esters (compounds 1\u20139) were isolated from the roots of (Erythroxylaceae) by following potential to reverse multidrug-resistance with oral epidermoid carcinoma (KB-V1) cells. All isolates, including seven new structures (i.e., compounds 3\u20139), were evaluated against a panel of human cancer cell lines. Alkaloids 3 and 5\u20139 showed greatest activity with KB-V1 cells assessed in the presence of vinblastine, indicating that these compounds are potent modulators of P-glycoprotein. Confirmatory results were obtained with human ovarian adenocarcinoma (SKVLB) cells assessed in the presence of adriamycin, and synergistic studies performed with several cell lines from the NCI tumor panel. The structures of the compounds were determined using spectroscopic techniques. Single-crystal X-ray analysis was performed on the monoester, tropane-3\u03b1,6\u03b2,7\u03b2-triol 3-phenylacetate (compound 1).","In particular, activity-guided fractionation led to the isolation of nine tropane alkaloid aromatic esters (compounds 1\u20139), including seven new compounds, pervilleine A, pervilleine A N-oxide, and pervilleines B\u2013F (compounds 3\u20139) (Chart 1). These compounds were isolated, identified, and structurally determined, and their cytotoxic activity and their action as modulators of multidrug resistance determined.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"CHART 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Tropane alkaloids isolated from "},{"entry":{"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00003","num":"00003"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00003","he":"29.80mm","wi":"24.13mm","file":"US06989396-20060124-C00003.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"table","img-format":"tif"}}}}},{"entry":{}},{"entry":{"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00004","num":"00004"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00004","he":"22.01mm","wi":"49.36mm","file":"US06989396-20060124-C00004.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"table","img-format":"tif"}}}}},{"entry":{}},{"entry":{"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00005","num":"00005"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00005","he":"22.01mm","wi":"39.71mm","file":"US06989396-20060124-C00005.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"table","img-format":"tif"}}}}},{"entry":{}},{"entry":{"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00006","num":"00006"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00006","he":"15.92mm","wi":"48.26mm","file":"US06989396-20060124-C00006.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"table","img-format":"tif"}}}}},{"entry":{}},{"entry":{"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00007","num":"00007"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00007","he":"15.92mm","wi":"40.64mm","file":"US06989396-20060124-C00007.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"table","img-format":"tif"}}}}},{"entry":{}}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"R","R","R","Other"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["1","OH","OH","PhCHCO","\u2014"]},{"entry":["2","H","H","Tmb","\u2014"]},{"entry":["3","OH","OTmc","Tmb","\u2014"]},{"entry":["4","OH","OTmc","Tmb","N\u2192O"]},{"entry":["5","H","OTmc","Tmb","\u2014"]},{"entry":["6","H","OTmc","Tmc","\u2014"]},{"entry":["7","OH","OTmc","Tmc","\u2014"]},{"entry":["8","H","OTmc","3-HOPhCHCO","\u2014"]},{"entry":["9","H","OTmc","PhCHCO","\u2014"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"The air-dried powdered roots of were extracted with methanol, and, after removal of solvent, the residue was suspended in aqueous methanol (9:1) and washed with hexane. The aqueous methanol-soluble then was partitioned with chloroform. The chloroform-soluble extract showed significant inhibitory activity against a vinblastine-resistant KB (oral epidermoid carcinoma) cell line, KB-V1, assessed in the presence of VLB (KB-V1, ED5.4 \u03bcg\/mL). The residue then was subjected to a series of cytotoxicity-guided aluminum oxide column chromatographic purification steps, using this assay to monitor fractionation, to afford nine alkaloids (i.e., compounds 1\u20139).","Compounds 1 and 2 were identified as the known alkaloids, tropane-3\u03b1,6\u03b2,7\u03b2-triol 3-phenyl-acetate (59) and 1\u03b1H,5\u03b1H-tropan-3\u03b1-yl 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoate (60), by comparison to published data. Compounds 3\u20139 are novel tropane alkaloids having different acyl substituents, and their structures were assigned by extensive use of H-, C-, one-dimensional selective INEPT, and 2D NMR spectroscopic techniques.","A single-crystal X-ray analysis was performed on compound 1, crystallized as white needles from methanol, in order to establish the stereochemistry of the N-methyl group. The final R factor was 6%, and the goodness of fit, 1.22. It was determined that the N-methyl group in this compound is axial.","Compound 3 has a molecular formula of CHNO, as determined from its high-resolution electronic impact mass spectrum (HREIMS). Its IR spectrum exhibited absorption bands at 3500 (OH), 1711 (ester), 1642 (\u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated C\u2550O), 1585 (aromatic C\u2550C), 1220, and 1128 cm(C\u2014O). The H-NMR spectrum of compound 3 revealed characteristic resonances for a tropane alkaloid skeleton trisubstituted at the C-3, C-6, and C-7 positions with signals at \u03b4 5.37 (1H, br t, ca. J=4.5 Hz, H-3\u03b2), \u03b45.66 (1H, dd, J=6.9, 2.9 Hz, H-6\u03b1), and \u03b4 4.77 (1H, d, J=6.9 Hz, H-7\u03b1) (Table 1), respectively (59). The downfield chemical shift and multiplicity for the H-3 signal indicated that C-3 bears an acyl moiety in a configuration (59\u201361). The above-mentioned coupling constants for the H-6\u03b1 and H-7\u03b1 chemical shifts accounted for the presence of exo substituents at the C-6 and C-7 positions, and the downfield shifts of H-6 and H-7 clearly indicated the substitution of an acyl moiety and a hydroxyl moiety at C-6 and C-7, respectively (61). A singlet at \u03b4 2.62 (3H) was assigned to an N\u2014CHgroup, with H-1 and H-5 appearing as broad singlets at \u03b4 3.27 (2H), and the H-2 and H-4 resonances observed at \u03b4 2.37 (2H, m, H-2ax and H-4ax) and \u03b4 1.74 (2H, br d, J=12.6 Hz, H-2eq and H-4eq) (Table 1).

The resonances at \u03b4 26.4 and \u03b4 26.3 were assigned to C-2 and C-4, respectively, while the C-1 and C-5 signals appeared, in turn, at 65.8 and 62.7 ppm, and finally, the N\u2014CHsignal resonated at \u03b4 34.6 (61, 62) (Table

acyl moieties of compound 3 were identified as 3,4,5-trimethoxycinnamoyl (Tmc) and 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoyl (Tmb) units, with two signals at \u03b4 6.45 (1H, d, J=15.8 Hz) and 7.64 (1H, d, J=15.8 Hz) assignable to the trans olefinic protons of the cinnamoyl residue, and two singlets at \u03b4 6.76 (2H) and 7.35 (2H) attributed to the ortho aromatic protons of the cinnamoyl and benzoyl moieties, respectively (61). Signals for 18H (6\u00d7-OCH, \u03b4 3.89\u20134.00) confirmed the presence of three methoxyl substituents symmetrically distributed in each unit (61, 63). Further support for the identities of these substituents was obtained from the EIMS fragments at m\/z 375 (M\u2212TmbA, 6%) and m\/z 349 (M\u2212TmcA 10%) (53, 61, 63). The NMR data (Tables 1 and 2) for the Tmc and Tmb units were in agreement with those published in the literature (61, 63, 64). The positions of attachment of the Tmc and Tmb moieties to the nucleus were determined by several selective INEPT NMR experiments (65). Thus, irradiation of H-6 (\u03b4 5.66; J=6 Hz) enhanced the carbonyl carbon signal at 166.5 ppm, which was similarly enhanced by selective irradiation of the vinylic protons at \u03b4 7.64\/6.45 (H-\u03b2\/\u03b1), indicating that the Tmc residue is attached to C-6. In the same way, the Tmb moiety was placed at C-3 by irradiation of H-3 (\u03b4 5.37) and the Tmb aromatic protons (\u03b4 7.35) with the corresponding enhancement of the carbonyl carbon signal at \u03b4 164.8. The N-methyl group was assigned as axial, by analogy with compound 1. Thus, compound 3 was determined as the new tropane alkaloid 3\u03b1-(3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoyloxy)-6\u03b2-(3,4,5-trimethoxycinnamoyloxy)-7\u03b2-hydroxy tropane, and has been accorded the trivial name, pervilleine A.","The NMR spectral data of compound 4 resembled those of pervilleine A (compound 3), with proton signals for H-3\u03b2 at \u03b4 5.36 (1H, br t, J=4.5 Hz), H-6\u03b1 at \u03b4 5.97 (1H, d, J=6.9 Hz), H-7\u03b1 at \u03b4 4.81 (1H, d, J=6.9 Hz) and their corresponding carbons at \u03b4 62.3 (C-3), 74.9 (C-6), and 74.7 (C-7) (Tables 1 and 2), suggesting the presence of hydroxyl and diacyl substituents in the tropane nucleus. The acyl moieties were identified as Tmc and Tmb (Tables 1 and 2) and were placed at C-3 and C-6, respectively, by a sequence of selective INEPT experiments carried out as described for compound 3. A prominent ion at m\/z 588 (56%) in the CIMS (positive mode) corresponding to the pseudo-empirical formula of CHNOwas observed for compound 4, the same molecular formula determined for compound 3. If compound 4 were an isomer of pervilleine A (compound 3), this would not satisfactorily explain the strong deshielding observed for H-1 (1H, br s, \u03b4 4.32), H-2eq (1H, br d, \u03b4 2.38), H-4eq (1H, br d, \u03b4 2.31), and H-5 (1H, br s, \u03b4 3.85), and the downfield shift for the N\u2014CHsignal (\u03b4 3.31 s). This effect also was observed for the corresponding carbons in the C-NMR spectra, which were assigned by APT, 1D- and 2D-HETCOR experiments (Table 2). The presence of a protonated molecular ion at m\/z 604 ([M+1], 7%) in the FABMS (positive mode) showed a 16 amu difference from the molecular weight of compound 3, and the decomposition of the product when subjected to EIMS, suggested that compound 4 could be an N-oxide of pervilleine A. Wenkert and coworkers (66) have compared the C-NMR data of scopolamine N-oxide and scopolamine free base, and observed significant changes on the chemical shifts of the neighboring carbons, leading to differences [\u0394\u03b4(scopolamine N-oxide scopolamine)] of +11.4 (C-1, C-5), \u22124.7 (C-3), \u22122.5 (C-6, C-7) and +9.0 (N\u2014CH). The changes in the analogous chemical shifts observed for compound 4 and pervilleine A (compound 3) were \u0394\u03b4+11.1 (C-1), +15.7 (C-5), \u22125.2 (C-3), \u22122.8 (C-6), \u22120.6 (C-7) and +14.6 (N\u2014CH), which were clearly indicative of N-oxide substitution in alkaloid compound 4. While most of the \u0394\u03b4values matched literature values (66), the small observed differences can be explained based on the unsymmetrical substitution of the tropane nuclei in compound 3 and compound 4. Moreover, analysis of the H NMR spectrum of compound 4 showed the N\u2014CHsignal at \u03b4 3.31. Huber and coworkers (67) demonstrated by applying X-ray crystallographic and NMR studies a clear correlation of the configuration and the H-NMR chemical shift of the N-methyl group in scopolamine N-oxide. The axial methyl was found to resonate at \u03b4 3.39, while the stereoisomeric equatorial methyl occurred at \u03b4 3.60. Based on these observations, the N-methyl group in compound 4 corresponds to an axial configuration, consistent with the X-ray crystallographic study performed on compound 1. Thus, compound 4 was identified as 3\u03b1-(3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoyloxy)-6\u03b2-(3,4,5-trimethoxycinnamoyloxy)-7\u03b2-hydroxytropane N-oxide (pervilleine A N-oxide).","Compound 5 also showed similar spectroscopic data to those of pervilleine A (compound 3). The molecular formula was CHNOas obtained by HREIMS, 16 amu lower than that of compound 3, suggesting the lack of a hydroxyl group in the molecule of compound 5. The H-NMR spectrum exhibited characteristic signals for a disubstituted tropane nucleus at the C-3 and C-6 positions with signals appearing for H-3\u03b2 at \u03b4 5.34 (1H, br dd, J=5.4, 4.5 Hz), H-6\u03b1 at \u03b4 5.77 (1H, dd, J=7.5, 2.7 Hz) and CH-7 at \u03b4 2.20\u20132.25 (2H, m) (Table 9). The acyl moieties were deduced as Tmc and Tmb, and the positions of their attachment were determined as for compound 3. Accordingly, compound 5 was identified as 3\u03b1-(3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoyloxy)-6\u03b2-(3,4,5-tri-methoxycinnamoyl-oxy)-tropane, and was given the trivial name pervilleine B.","Compound 6 was assigned a molecular formula of CHNO, as determined by HREIMS, and showed the same pattern of substitution as that of compound 5 with resonances for H-3\u03b2 at \u03b4 5.21 (1H, br t, J=5.0 Hz), H-6\u03b1 at \u03b4 5.73 (1H, dd, J=7.6, 2.7 Hz), and CH-7 at \u03b4 2.22\u20132.26 (2H, m). However, signals for a Tmb moiety were not evident in the H- and C-NMR spectra of compound 6, and the signals for the Tmc moiety were duplicated (Tables 1 and 2). Hence, the structure of compound 6 (pervilleine C) was elucidated as 3\u03b1,6\u03b2-di-(3,4,5-trimethoxycinnamoyloxy)tropane.","Compound 7 was assigned a molecular formula of CHNO(HREIMS), and showed similar signals for the tropane nucleus in the H-NMR spectrum to compound 3, with signals seen for H-3\u03b2 (\u03b4 5.24; 1H, br t, J=4.5 Hz), H-6\u03b1 (\u03b4 5.72; 1H, d, J=6.3 Hz), and H-7\u03b1 (\u03b4 4.77; 1H, d, J=6.3 Hz) The portion of the H-NMR spectrum depicting the acyl groups of compound 7 was closely comparable to equivalent data for compound 6, with resonances observed at \u03b4 7.74\/7.62 (1H each, d, J=15.9 Hz, Hb), 6.47\/6.36 (1H each, d, J=15.9 Hz, H\u03b1), and 6.92\/6.75 (2H each, s, H-2\u2032, H-6\u2032). The C-NMR spectrum also supported the presence of two Tmc moieties in compound 7 (Table 2). On basis of the above evidence, the structure of compound 7 was therefore characterized as 3\u03b1,6\u03b2-di-(3,4,5-trimethoxycinnamoyloxy)-7\u03b2-hydroxytropane (pervilleine D).","The NMR spectral data for compounds 8 and 9, when compared with the spectra for the above-mentioned analogues, exhibited values consistent with the presence of one Tmc substituent and one other acyl substituent in each compound. The tropane nucleus showed NMR resonances in agreement with those of compound 5, suggesting disubstitution at the C-3 and C-6 positions. The coupling constants for H-3 (brt, J=5.2 Hz) and H-6 (dd, J=7.5, 3.0 Hz) indicated a \u03b2 and \u03b1 configuration, respectively, for these protons in 8 and 9 (Table 1). Compound 8, with a molecular formula of CHNO, as determined by HREIMS, showed in the H-NMR spectrum resonances at \u03b4 3.56 (2H, s), 7.19 (1H, d J=2.2 Hz), 6.80\u20136.84 (2H, m), and 7.22 (1H, d J=7.8 Hz) and carbon signals at \u03b4 170.1, 42.7, 134.7, 116.8, 156.9, 114.9, 130.0, and 121.0, indicating the presence of a 3-hydroxyphenylacetyl moiety (59). Selective INEPT experiments were used to confirm the substitution patterns of the Tmb unit at C-6 and the 3-hydroxyphenylacetyl group at C-3. The molecular formula of compound 9 was determined by HREIMS as CHNO, 16 amu lower than that of compound 8, suggesting there is no hydroxyl group present in compound 9. Analysis of the NMR data showed that the second acyl group was a phenylacetyl unit (59). Selective INEPT experiments led to the placement of the Tmb unit at C-6 and the phenylacetyl group at C-3 for this alkaloid. Based on the evidence presented above, the structures of compounds 8 and 9 were elucidated as 3\u03b1-(3-hydroxyphenylacetoxy)-6\u03b2-(3,4,5-trimethoxycinnamoyloxy)tropane (pervilleine E) and 3\u03b1-phenylacetoxy-6\u03b2-(3,4,5-trimethoxycinnamoyloxy)tropane (pervilleine F), respectively.","The stereochemistry at the different asymmetric carbons for pervilleines A\u2013F (compounds 3, 5\u20139) and pervilleine A N-oxide (compound 4) was determined on the basis of NMR coupling constant observations, and confirmed using molecular modeling experiments (PCMODEL Version 4.0). In this regard, different stereoisomer combinations were minimized using the MMX force field, wherein predicted coupling constants were compared with the experimental J values actually obtained finding the best matching with the stereoisomers presented herein. All structures are numbered clockwise starting from the bridgehead methine and representing arbitrarily one of the two possible enantiomers. The N-methyl group is presented in its axial configuration for pervilleines A\u2013F (compounds 3, 5\u20139) according to the structure established for compound 1 by means of X-ray crystallographic analysis.","Alkaloids 1\u20139 initially were tested against a panel of human cancer cell lines according to established protocols (68). Pervillines A and F (compounds 3 and 9) showed both strong activity and selectivity for the multidrug-resistant KB-Vl cell line in the presence of vinblastine (ED, 0.3 and 0.2 \u03bcg\/mL, respectively), while pervilleine E (compound 8) exhibited selectivity, but potency was reduced by approximately one order of magnitude (ED, 1.9 \u03bcg\/mL). Pervilleines B\u2013D (compounds 5\u20137) displayed high potency with KB-Vl cells assessed in the presence of VLB, but were less selective. Pervilleine A N-oxide (compound 4), as well as the known compounds 1 and 2 were shown to be inactive (ED\u226720 \u03bcg\/mL) for all cell lines, including KB-V1 in the presence of VLB (Table 3).","Several observations concerning structural requirements for activity within this compound group may be made from the cytotoxicity panel data of alkaloids 1\u20139 shown in Table 3. When compounds 1\u20133 and 5\u20139 are considered specifically, a C-6 Tmc ester substituent appeared essential for the elicitation of significant activity against KB-V1 cells in the presence of VL. The absence of a hydroxyl group at C-7, as in pervilleines B (compound 5) and C (compound 6), led to approximately the same cytotoxic potency shown by pervilleines A (compound 3) and D (compound 7) for KB-V1 cells in the presence of VLB, but reduced selectivity when the other cell lines in the panel are considered. Pervilleine E (compound 8), esterified at C-3 with a 3-hydroxyphenylacetyl moiety, exhibited less potency and less selectivity than pervilleine D (compound 7) with a Tmc ester at C-3. When the C-3 Tmc ester at C-3 (pervilleine C) was altered to a phenylacetyl group (pervilleine F), less potency but greater selectivity resulted. Pervilleine A N-oxide (compound 4) was not significantly active for any cell lines represented in the tumor panel. However, it is known that some N-oxides are bioreductive drugs (69, 70), compound 4 could serve as a prodrug and be metabolized to release the active pervelline A (compound 3).","In Table 4, the cytotoxic activities of pervilleines A\u2013C (compounds 3, 5, 6) and pervilleine A N-oxide are compared with the acridonecarboxamide derivative GF120918 (20), an MDR inhibitor, in ovarian adenocarcinoma (SKOV3) and multidrug-resistant ovarian adenocarcinoma (SKVLB) cell lines, performed as previously described (72). When 1 \u03bcM adriamycin was added to the latter cell line, pervilleines B and C (IC0.12 and 0.08 \u03bcM, respectively) mediated potent responses that were comparable to GR120918 (IC0.02 \u03bcM). Because the data in Tables 3 and 4 indicate that the tropane alkaloid esters evaluated were less toxic for KB-V1 and SKVLB cells than their normal counterparts in the absence of any additional drug,

Seven of these alkaloids are new compounds, namely, pervilleine A, pervilleine A N-oxide, and pervilleines B\u2013F. All of these new tropane derivatives were found to contain a trans-3,4,5-trimethoxycinnamoyloxy unit at the C-6 position, with the C-3 hydroxyl group being differentially esterified and the C-6 sometimes being hydroxylated among alkaloids 3\u20139. The known compounds tropane-3\u03b1,6\u03b2,7\u03b2-triol 3-phenyl-acetate (compound 1) and 1\u03b1H,5\u03b1H-tropan-3\u03b1-yl 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoate (compound 2) also were obtained, with the configuration of the N-methyl group of compound 1 established as axial by X-ray crystallographic analysis.","Several of these compounds showed substantial selectivity for a MDR-resistant human oral epidermoid (KB) cell line in the presence of vinblastine, with pervilleines A, B, C, D, and F all showing a similar cytotoxic potency against this cell line. In a MDR-resistant human ovarian adenocarcinoma (SKVLB) cell line in the presence of adriamycin, pervilleines B and C reversed drug resistance with potency comparable to the acridone carboxamide MDR modulator GR120918 (70). In a further in vitro biological test protocol, compounds 5\u20137 and 6 were found to exhibit comparable potency to verapamil and cyclosporin at increasing the cytotoxicity of DINIB (73, 74). The mode of action facilitated by these tropane alkaloids has been partially characterized, and synergistic activity has been demonstrated in the in vivo hollow fiber model using KB-V1 and KB-8-5 cells (75).","Abbreviations: AML, acute myeloid leukemia; BSA, bovine serum albumin; cDNA, complementary deoxyrubonucleic acid; DEPC, diethylpyrocarbonate; DMEM, Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium; MeOH, methanol; NHOH, ammonium hydroxide; CHCl, chloroform; EtNH, diethylamine; DMSO, dimethyl sulfoxide; EDTA, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid; dNTP, deoxynucleotide triphosphate; IC, 50% inhibitory concentration; MDR, multidrug-resistance; MTD, maximum tolerated dose; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; PA, pervilleine A [3\u03b1-(3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoyloxy)-6\u03b2-(3,4,5-trimethoxycinnamoyloxy)-7\u03b2-hydroxytropane]; PB, pervilleine B [3\u03b1-(3,4-5-trimethoxybenzoyloxy)-6\u03b2-(E)-(3,4,5-trimethoxycinnamoyloxy)tropane]; PC, pervilleine C [3\u03b1,6\u03b2-di(E)-(3,4,5-trimethoxycinnamoyloxy)tropane]; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Pgp, P-glycoprotein; PVP, polyvinylpyrrolidone; SDS, sodium dodecyl sulfate; VP, verapamil.","General procedures.

Compounds 1\u20139 were evaluated for cytotoxic activity against a panel of human cancer cell lines, including KB-V1 in the presence and absence of VLB, according to an established protocol (68). Similar procedures were used with the ovarian cancer cell lines listed in Table 4 (72).","In vitro multidrug resistance assay. Compounds 5\u20137 and 9, were evaluated for efficacy as potential modulators of P-glycoprotein according to established protocols (73, 74).","Chemicals and Cell Cultures. [H]Vinblastine (4.8 Ci\/mmol) was purchased from Moravek Biochemicals (Brea, Calif.). All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. Cell culture media and supplements were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. (Grand Island, N.Y.). Human oral epidermoid carcinoma KB-3 was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, Md.), and KB-V1 and KB-8-5 cells were supplied by Dr. I. B. Roninson (Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Ill.). KB-3 cells were maintained in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated calf serum and PSF (100 units\/ml penicillin G, 100 \u03bcg\/ml streptomycin sulfate, 250 ng\/ml amphotericin B). KB-V1 cells were grown in the same medium, which was further supplemented with vinblastine (1 \u03bcg\/ml). Similarly, KB-8-5 cells were cultured in the same medium supplemented with colchicine (10 ng\/ml). Human leukemic lymphoblasts CEM cells and their multidrug-resistant counterpart CEM\/VLBcells were cultured as described previously (29). Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) hollow fibers (500,000 Da molecular weight cut-off, 1.0 mm ID) were purchased from Spectrum Medical Industries (Luguan Hills, Calif.).","Cytotoxic potential. The cytotoxic potential of test substances with KB-3, KB-V1 and KB-8-5 cells was determined as described previously (24). Briefly, various concentrations of test compounds (dissolved in 10 \u03bcl of 10% DMSO) were transferred to 96-well plates, and 190 \u03bcl aliquots of cell suspensions (5\u00d710cells\/ml) were added to each well. The plates then were incubated for 72 hours at 37\u00b0 C. (100% humidity with a 5% COatmosphere in air), and 100 \u03bcl of cold 20% aqueous trichloroacetic acid were added to the growth medium in each well to fix the cells. The cultures were incubated at 4\u00b0 C. for 30 minutes, washed, air-dried, stained with sulforhodamine B solution, and washed with 1% acetic acid. Finally, 200 \u03bcl of 10 mM Tris base were added to each well and the optical densities were determined at 515 nm utilizing an ELISA plate reader. In each case, a zero-day control was performed by adding an equivalent number of cells to several wells and incubating at 37\u00b0 C. for 30 minutes, and processing as described above. Optical density values obtained with the zero-day control were subtracted, and cell survival, relative to control (solvent-treated) cultures, was calculated. The cytotoxic potential of the compounds with CEM and CEM\/VLBcells was determined as described by Beck et al. (30). Cells were grown in 24-well plates at a density of 5\u20136\u00d710cells\/ml. At 48 hours, the cell number was determined using a Coulter Counter, with a channelizer to distinguish cells from debris. The ICwas defined as the concentration of drug required to inhibit the 48 hr growth of treated cells by 50% compared with untreated controls.","[H]Vinblastine accumulation with KB-V1 vesicles. Cell membrane vesicles were prepared from KB-V1 cells following literature procedures (31, 32) with some modifications. Medium was removed from KB-V1 cells in log growth phase (about 80% confluence) and the cells were rinsed with ice-cold PBS followed by ice-cold PBS containing 2 mM EDTA. Aprotinin (1 mg\/ml) was then added, and, after a 10 minutes incubation at room temperature, the cells were harvested by gentle aspiration with a serological pipette and collected by centrifugation (100\u00d7g for 5 minutes). The cells were suspended in 0.25 M sucrose buffer (0.01 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.25 M sucrose, 0.2 mM CaCl, 1 mM EDTA) and homogenized with a Polytron at 2,500 rpm for 30 seconds. Following this procedure, <5% of the cells remained intact. The homogenate then was diluted with four volumes of 0.025 M sucrose solution (0.01 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.025 M sucrose) and centrifuged (1,000\u00d7g for 10 minutes). The supernatant was layered onto a 35% sucrose cushion (35% w\/v sucrose, 1 mM EDTA, 0.01 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) and centrifuged at 16,000\u00d7g for 30 minutes. The interface (about 5 ml) was collected and diluted with four volumes of 0.25 M sucrose, 0.01 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and centrifuged at 100,000\u00d7g for 1 hour. The resulting vesicle pellet was suspended in PBS containing 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, using a 25-gauge needle, and stored at \u221280\u00b0 C. Protein content was determined using a bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit with BSA as a standard (33).","Vinblastine accumulation with membrane vesicles assays were performed in 96-well plates as described previously (23, 24). Plasma membrane vesicles (40 \u03bcg protein) were incubated in 0.01 M Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.125 M sucrose, 5 mM MgCl, 0.5 mM ATP, and 0.16 \u03bcM [H]vinblastine (4.8 Ci\/mmol). Various concentrations of test samples, dissolved in 5 \u03bcl of DMSO, were then added (final volume, 100 \u03bcl), and incubations were conducted at ambient temperature for 20 minutes. For kinetic studies, various concentrations of [H]vinblastine were used. Reactions were terminated by aspirating the contents of each well onto a glass filter filter (printed type A filtermats, Wallac) using a 96-well harvester (Harvester 96, Tomtec). Radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting (1450 Microbeta, Wallac). Nonspecific binding was determined by performing similar incubations with reaction mixtures containing a 1,000-fold excess of unlabeled vinblastine. Nonspecific binding was subtracted from all total-binding data to yield specific binding.","[H]Vinblastine accumulation with intact cells. Measurement of the accumulation of [H]vinblastine in cell monolayers was performed by the method of Fojo et al. (34) with some modifications. Studies were performed with 24-well plates. In preparing the cell monolayers, 2 ml of a cell suspension containing 2.5\u00d710cells per ml of incubation medium (DMEM with 10% calf serum) were added to each well. Control wells contained 2 ml of assay medium. Following the addition of [H]vinblastine (16 nM, 4.8 Ci\/mmol) and various concentrations of test samples (dissolved in 10 \u03bcl of DMSO), the plates were incubated at 37\u00b0 C. in a 5% COincubator for 1 hour. Monolayers were washed three times with cold PBS, dried by inversion, and the cells were treated with trypsin. Cell suspensions were then transferred to vials containing 3 ml of scintillation solution (CytoScint\u2122, ICN), mixed vigorously, and counted. The quantity of [H]vinblastine associated with incubations containing cells was corrected by subtracting the counts associated with incubations not containing cells.","RT-PCR analysis of MDR1 mRNA expression. Culture flasks (60\u00d715 mm) containing 100\u00d710KB-3, KB-V1, CEM or CEM\/VLBcells were treated with various concentrations of pervilleine A (0\u201334 \u03bcM) or verapamil (0\u201344 \u03bcM) for 72 hours at 37\u00b0 C. in a 5% COincubator. Total RNA was isolated from cultured KB-3, KB-V1, CEM and CEM\/VLBcells with TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) (33), and quantified by UV absorbance. The reverse transcription of RNA was performed by using the SUPERScript\u2122 Preamplification System (Life Technologies, Inc.) in a final volume of 21 \u03bcl containing 5\u00d7First Strain Synthesis Buffer, 2.5 mM MgCl, 0.5 mM each dNTP, 10 \u03bcM DTT, 2 units of RNAse inhibitor, 200 units of Super-Scrip II reverse transcriptase, 0.5 \u03bcg oligo (dT), 2 \u03bcg of total RNA (3 \u03bcg for CEM and CEM\/VLBcells), and DEPC-treated water. After incubation at 42\u00b0 C. for 50 minutes, the room temperature reaction was terminated by heating to 70\u00b0 C. for 15 minutes. To the newly synthesized cDNA (2 \u03bcl), a PCR mixture containing 1.4 mM MgCl(1.2 mM for CEM and CEM\/VLBcells), 2.5 units of Taq polymerase, 0.2 \u03bcmol (0.6 \u03bcmol for CEM and CEM\/VLBcells) of primers based on the MDR1 gene (35) and custom synthesized by Ana-Gen Technology, Inc. (Palo Alto, Calif.) (5\u2032-ATATCAGCAGCCCACATCAT-3\u2032; 5\u2032-GAAGCACTGGGATGTCCGGT-3\u2032) (35). As an internal control, 0.125 \u03bcmol (0.1 \u03bcmol for CEM and CEM\/VLBcells) of primers for GAPDH (5\u2032-CGGGAAGCTTGTGATCAATGG-3\u2032; 5\u2032-GGCAGTGATGGCATGGACTG-3\u2032) (36) were added (final volume to 50 \u03bcl). The PCR was heated to 94\u00b0 C. for 3 minutes, and immediately cycled 23 times (35 times for CEM and CEM\/VLBcells) through a 1-minute denaturing step at 94\u00b0 C., a 1-minute annealing step at 58\u00b0 C., and a 1-minute elongation step at 72\u00b0 C., with a Perkin-Elmer 2400 thermocycler. After the final cycle, a 7-minute elongation step at 72\u00b0 C. was performed. Aliquots of PCR products were electrophoresed on 2% agarose gels (Bio-Rad), and PCR fragments were visualized with ethidium bromide staining.","Western blot analysis of MDR1 expression. To investigate MDR1 gene expression, western blots were performed with KB-3, KB-V1, CEM and CEM\/VLBcells treated with pervilleine A (0\u201345 \u03bcM) or verapamil (0\u201344 \u03bcM) for 72 hours at 37\u00b0 C. in a 5% COincubator. Cells (7.5\u00d710cells as starting cell amount) were harvested using SDS lysis buffer [20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.8) containing 0.4% SDS (w\/v), 5% glycerol (v\/v), 0.006% bromophenol blue, 2% \u03b2-mer-captoethanol], and lysates were boiled for 10 minutes and stored at \u221220\u00b0 C. Aliquots of lysates were used for protein determinations (bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit with BSA as standard), and equivalent amounts of protein were electrophoresed by SDS-PAGE with precast 7.5% Tris-glycine acrylamide gels (Novex, San Diego, Calif.). Following transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk. Blotting was performed with rabbit polyclonal antibody mdr (Ab-1) (Oncogene Research Products, Inc.) and analyzed by streptavidin horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Amersham Life Science) and visualized using a ECL western blotting detection system (Amersham Life Science).","In vivo hollow fiber test. In vivo hollow fiber test was performed using a literature procedure with some modifications (28). Confluent monolayers of KB-3, KB-V1 or KB-8-5 cells were harvested, collected by centrifugation and resuspended in conditioned medium at a concentration of 7.5\u00d710cells\/ml. Fibers filled with cells were incubated in 6-well plates overnight at 37\u00b0 C. in a 5% COatmosphere. Female athymic NCr nu\/nu mice at 5\u20136 weeks of age were obtained from Frederick Cancer Research Facility. Each mouse hosted up to 6 fibers, which were cultured in two physiological compartments. For intraperitoneal implants, a small incision was made through the skin and musculature of the dorsal abdominal wall, the fiber samples were inserted into the peritoneal cavity in a craniocaudal direction and the incision was closed with skin staples. For subcutaneous implants, a small skin incision was made at the nape of the neck to allow insertion of an 11-gauge tumor implant trocar. The trocar, containing the hollow fiber samples, was inserted caudally through the subcutaneous tissues and fibers were deposited during withdrawal of the trocar. The incision was closed with a skin staple.","In preliminary studies, cell growth was assessed with fibers containing various cell densities. As a result, a cell density of 7.5\u00d710cells\/ml was found to be suitable for drug studies for KB-3, KB-V1, and KB-8-5 cells. For treatment protocols, vinblastine and verapamil were dissolved in PBS; pervilleines A, B, and C were coprecipitated with PVP (37) to increase solubility, and then dissolved in PBS. Mice were randomized into 6 groups (3 mice per group): PBS vehicle control group; vinblastine treatment group; verapamil treatment group; pervilleine A, B, or C treatment group; verapamil plus vinblastine group; and pervilleine A, B, or C plus vinblastine group. Test compounds were administrated once daily by intraperitoneal injection from day 3\u20136 after implantation. Body weights were measure daily.","On day 7, mice were sacrificed and fibers were retrieved. The fibers were placed into 6-well plates, with each well containing 2 ml of fresh, prewarmed culture medium and allowed to equilibrate for 30 minutes at 37\u00b0 C. To define the viable cell mass contained within the intact hollow fibers, a MTT dye conversion assay was used. Briefly, 1 ml of pre-warmed culture medium containing 1 mg MTT\/ml was added to each dish. After incubating at 37\u00b0 C. for 4 hours, the culture medium was aspirated and the samples were washed twice with normal saline containing 2.5% protamine sulfate solution by overnight incubation at 4\u00b0 C. To assess the optical density of the samples, the fibers were transferred to 24-well plates, cut in half and allowed to dry overnight. The formazan was extracted from each sample with DMSO (250 \u03bcl\/well) for 4 hours at room temperature on a rotation platform. Aliquots (150 \u03bcl) of extracted MTT formazan were transferred to individual wells of 96-well plates and assessed for optical density at a wavelength of 540 nm. The effect of the treatment regimen was determined by the net growth percentage of the cells relative to change in body weight.","Results","Growth inhibitory potential. An in vitro cell survival assay was employed as an initial method for monitoring the potential of test compounds to reverse multidrug-resistance. As summarized in Table 6, neither pervilleine A nor verapamil demonstrated appreciable growth inhibitory potential with KB-3 cells in culture. This cell line is highly susceptible to vinblastine (IC=0.04 \u03bcM) and colchicine (IC=0.05 \u03bcM). In the absence of vinblastine, neither test substrate inhibited the growth of KB-V1 cells (ICvalues>34 or 44 \u03bcM for pervilleine A or verapamil, respectively). However, when vinblastine was added to the media in the presence of pervilleine A or verapamil, chemosensitivity was restored (IC=0.36 or 0.79 \u03bcM, respectively). For pervilleine A, these data yielded ICratios of 66.6 and >95 for KB-3\/KB-V1 (+vinblastine) and KB-V1 (\u2212vinblastine)\/KB-V1 (+vinblastine), respectively, which compare favorably with the corresponding values obtained with verapamil (47 and >55, respectively), and indicated a lack of nonspecific cytotoxicity. For KB-8-5 cells (Table 6), even though pervilleine A showed greater growth inhibitory activity (IC=14 \u03bcM) than verapamil (IC>44 \u03bcM) in the absence of colchicine, the ICratios of KB-3\/KB-8-5 (+colchicine) and KB-8-5 (colchicine)\/KB-8-5 (+colchicine) were still favorable (40.3 and 23.3, respectively, for pervilleine A, and 13.1 and >15.4, respectively, for verapamil).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0096","num":"0095"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00007","num":"00007"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 6"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Reversal of MDR in KB-V1 and KB-8-5"},{"entry":"cells by pervilleine A and verapamil"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"98pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"63pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Cell Line","Pervilleine A","Verapamil"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"KB-3","24\u2009\u2002","37\u2009\u2002"]},{"entry":[{},"KB-V1 (\u2212)",">34\u2009\u2009\u2009\u2002",">44\u2009\u2002\u2009\u2009"]},{"entry":[{},"KB-V1 (+)","\u20030.36","\u20030.79"]},{"entry":[{},"KB-8-5 (\u2212)","14\u2009\u2002",">44\u2009\u2002\u2009\u2009"]},{"entry":[{},"KB-8-5 (+)","\u20030.61","\u20022.9"]},{"entry":[{},"KB-3\/[KB-V1 (+)]","66.6","47\u2009\u2002"]},{"entry":[{},"[KB-V1 (\u2212)]\/KB-V1 (+)]",">95\u2009\u2002\u2009\u2009",">55\u2009\u2002\u2009\u2009"]},{"entry":[{},"KB-3\/[KB-8-5 (+)]","40.3","13.1"]},{"entry":[{},"[KB-8-5 (\u2212)]\/[KB-8-5 (+)]","23.3",">15.4\u2009\u2009"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"left","id":"FOO-00029"},"sup":"a","sub":"50 "}]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"left","id":"FOO-00030"},"sup":"b"}]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"left","id":"FOO-00031"},"sup":"c"}]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"left","id":"FOO-00032"},"sup":"d","sub":"50 "}]}]}}]}}},"A related group of studies conducted with drug-resistant CEM\/VLBcells is summarized in Table 7.

Relative to parental KB-3 cells, KB-V1 cells are >200-fold more resistant to the growth inhibitory effect of vinblastine (6), and this as a model was employed for the discovery of various agents capable of reversing MDR (23, 24). As a result of this process, interesting natural product MDR reversing agents have been discovered (25). For example, because pervilleine A bears structural resemblance to verapamil, a well-known prototype-reversing agent, comparative studies were performed with the two compounds. In each case, the response mediated by pervilleine A was found to be equal to or greater than the response mediated by verapamil. In addition to KB-V1 cells, pervilleine A effectively reversed the MDR phenotype with KB-8-5 (Table 6) and CEM\/VLBcells (Table 7).","Previous studies have demonstrated that the overexpression of Pgp is a major cause for developing MDR, and decreasing expression of Pgp at either the transcriptional or protein level is one mechanism for reversing MDR (40, 41). To explore the mechanism by which pervilleine A enhances the vinblastine-sensitivity of MDR cells, the potential of pervilleine A to alter MDR1 mRNA or protein expression with KB-V1 and CEM\/VLBcells in culture was investigated. Treatment with various concentrations of pervilleine A for 72 hours did not significantly alter protein () or mRNA expression (data not shown), and similar negative results were obtained in parallel studies conducted with verapamil (concentrations ranging up to 44 \u03bcM). With verapamil, these results are consistent with those of Hu et al. (42), who demonstrated a limited effect on MDR1 mRNA levels in KB-V1 cells after a 24-hour incubation. With CEM\/VLBcells, however, no inhibition of Pgp expression noted previously with verapamil was observed (40). This may be due to differences in experimental conditions, because it is known that the effect of modulators on Pgp expression might be cell line and modulator-dependent (42). In any event, it is clear that Pgp transcription and protein expression with cultured KB-V1 and CEM\/VLBcells were not affected by pervilleine A.","On the other hand, pervilleine A clearly altered functional aspects of Pgp. When KB-V1 cells were treated with verapamil or pervilleine A in the concentration range of 0\u201340 \u03bcM (), [H]vinblastine accumulation increased by about 27-fold (from basal levels of 0.18 pmol [H]vinblastine\/50\u00d710cells, to approach 5 pmol [H]vinblastine\/50\u00d710cells). This level of accumulation approached that of sensitive cells (7.1\u00b10.17 pmol vinblastine\/50\u00d710cells), indicating that restoration of the vinblastine-sensitivity of resistant cells results from enhanced intracellular accumulation of vinblastine.","Plasma membranes obtained from MDR cells bind greater quantities of anticancer drugs than their counterparts derived from drug-sensitive cells (43), and [H]vinblastine associated with plasma membrane vesicles isolated from MDR cells (23, 24, 32, 43, 44) can be used as a model to investigate the mechanism of Pgp-mediated drug transport\/efflux. Treatment of membrane vesicles isolated from multidrug-resistant KB-V1 cells with pervilleine A or verapamil in the concentration range of 0\u2013100 \u03bcM () in the presence of 0.16 \u03bcM [H]vinblastine reduced [H]vinblastine accumulation by about 65-fold (from 5.93 pmol [H]vinblastine\/mg protein in control incubations to about 0.09 pmol [H]vinblastine\/mg protein in the presence of pervilleine A or verapamil). Thus, as is the case with verapamil, pervilleine A increased intracellular drug accumulation by inhibiting the efflux mechanism of Pgp. In order to characterize the mode of interaction, kinetic studies were performed with membrane vesicles derived from KB-V1 cells in which the effect of verapamil or pervilleine A on [H]vinblastine accumulation was determined. With both test agents, competitive inhibition was observed, suggesting interaction with the binding site normally occupied by vinblastine. In a similar manner, Cornwell et al. (44) suggested verapamil and vinblastine bind to the same site in membrane vesicles from KB-V1 cells, based on the results of vinblastine binding and vinblastine photoaffinity labeling studies. However, Pascaud et al. (45) have proposed Pgp has distinct but interacting binding sites for cytotoxic drugs (e.g., vinblastine) and reversing agents (e.g., verapamil), through analysis of the ATPase activity of Pgp. It is presently uncertain if pervilleine A action involves a unique common binding site, or two mutually exclusive, but distinct, binding sites.","Studies have been performed to define the structural or physicochemical features of reversers that might account for their effectiveness (8, 46\u201350). It has been suggested (48) that planar aromatic rings and nitrogen atoms are common features shared by all modulators. A CH\u2014CH\u2014N\u2014CH\u2014CHsequence was observed (50) in most active compounds, and a methoxyphenyl moiety was found to enhance the reversing activity. The relative disposition of aromatic rings and the basic nitrogen atom are important for modulators of Pgp-associated MDR (8), suggesting a ligand-receptor relationship. Verapamil and pervilleine A bear features shared by other MDR reversers in having a tertiary nitrogen, two aromatic rings, and methoxyphenyl groups. Verapamil has three domains in common with vinblastine that appear to be important for its ability to interact with Pgp and modulate MDR (8): two aromatic rings and a basic nitrogen atom. In addition to these structural features, lipid solubility and molar refractivity might play dominant roles in reversing MDR (48). Since pervilleine A demonstrated activity in in vitro studies, the hollow fiber model was employed to further investigate in vivo potential. This is the first reported use of the hollow fiber model to assess MDR reversing agents in combination with cancer chemotherapeutic agents. In combination with vinblastine, the hollow fiber test was used to assess the capacity of verapamil or pervilleine A to effect the growth of multidrug-resistant tumor cells growing in the i.p. and s.c. compartments of mice. At pharmacologically relevant doses, the data in Table 10 indicate that both verapamil and pervilleine A are capable of reversing vinblastine sensitivity with KB-V1 and KB-8-5 cells implanted at the i.p. site (P<0.0001), which is consistent with in vitro data (Table 6). However, responses at the s.c. site were less clear (Table 10), and only pervilleine A showed a significant reversing effect (P=0.008) with KB-8-5 cells. Relative to verapamil, it is possible that pervilleine A is distributed more effectively in the rodent body.","Alternatively, with KB-8-5 cells, pervilleine A may be more effective than verapamil, in terms of reversing resistance to vinblastine. Overall, the relatively poor responses observed at the s.c. site might be due to ineffective drug delivery, or the lack of blood vessel development, since the present hollow fiber assay protocol would not enable angiogenesis (51). However, these results indicate the utility of the hollow fiber model for combination drug studies, and the promising results with pervilleine A would support more advanced testing with conventional in vivo animal models.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0121","num":"0120"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00011","num":"00011"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"301pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 10"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Calculated and observed growth inhibition of KB-V1 and KB-8-5 cells"},{"entry":"implanted at i.p. and s.c. sites"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"224pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"Growth inhibition (%)"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"105pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"7pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"112pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"i.p.",{},"s.c."]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"6"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Cell line",{},"Calculated","Observed","Calculated","Observed"]},{"entry":["tested","Reversor","inhibition","inhibition","inhibition","inhibition"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"6","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["KB-V1","verapamil","\u2002\u20091 + 5.2 = 6.2","56.6 (P < 0.0001)","\u2002\u20090 + 10.2 = 10.8","13.6 (P = 0.098)"]},{"entry":[{},"pervilleine A","\u2002\u20091 + 1 = 2","68.6 (P < 0.0001)","\u2002\u20090 + 3.3 = 3.3","14.6 (P = 0.188)"]},{"entry":["KB-8-5","verapamil","1.2 + 4.7 = 5.9","\u2002\u200952 (P < 0.0001)","2.3 + 1.4 = 3.7","11.7 (P = 0.06)"]},{"entry":[{},"pervilleine A","1.2 + 3.3 = 4.5","74.7 (P < 0.0001)","2.3 + 2.6 = 4.9","\u2002\u200928 (P = 0.008)"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"6","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"6","align":"left","id":"FOO-00042"},"sup":"a"}},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"6","align":"left","id":"FOO-00043"},"sup":"b"}},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"6","align":"left","id":"FOO-00044"},"sup":"c"}}]}}]}}},"Verapamil and pervilleine B or C, as well as pervilleine A, bear features shared by other MDR reversing agents, in having a tertiary nitrogen, two aromatic rings, and methoxyphenyl groups ClogP values and molar refractivity weakly correlated with potential to reverse MDR.","Because pervilleines B and C also demonstrated promising activity with in vitro studies, the hollow fiber model was employed to further investigate in vivo potential. As currently described, in combination with vinblastine, the hollow fiber test was used to assess the capacity of verapamil or pervilleines B or C to effect the growth of multidrug-resistant tumor cells growing in the i.p. and s.c. compartments of mice. At pharmacologically relevant doses, the data in Table 9 indicate both verapamil and pervilleines B or C were capable of reversing vinblastine sensitivity with KB-V1 cells implanted at the i.p. site (P<0.0001), which was consistent with in vitro data (Table 8). Poor responses were observed at the s.c. site (Table 9), possibly due to ineffective drug delivery, or the lack of blood vessel development, since the present hollow fiber assay protocol would not enable angiogenesis (51).","A primary question addressed by the current study was the in vivo activity of pervilleines A, B, and C. As demonstrated, the potential of each of these agents to activities in reverse multidrug resistance was similar. Therefore, because each of the alkaloids bear the trans-3,4-trimethoxycinnamoyl unit at the C-6 position, this may be an important structural element for activity within this compound class, and the substituents at C-3 and C-7 may play less important roles. In sum, pervilleines A, B, and C are effective inhibitors of Pgp with comparable or greater activity than verapamil.","As set forth below, administration of a multidrug resistance inhibitor of the present invention to a mammal has several potential benefits, including, for example, improving treatment using a chemotherapeutic or antibiotic drug.","The multidrug resistance inhibitors can be therapeutically administered as the neat chemical, but it is preferable to administer the inhibitors as a pharmaceutical composition or formulation. Accordingly, the present invention further provides for pharmaceutical formulations comprising, for example, a multidrug resistance inhibitor, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt or prodrug thereof, together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and, optionally, other therapeutic and\/or prophylactic ingredients. The carriers are \u201cacceptable\u201d in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious to the recipient thereof.","The amount of a multidrug resistance inhibitor required for use in therapy varies with the nature of the condition being treated, the length of time modulation is desired, and the age and the condition of the patient, and is ultimately determined by the attendant physician. In general, however, doses employed for adult human treatment typically are in the range of 0.001 mg\/kg to about 200 mg\/kg per day. A preferred dose is about 1 \u03bcg\/kg to about 100 \u03bcg\/kg per day. The desired dose can be conveniently administered in a single dose, or as multiple doses administered at appropriate intervals, for example as two, three, four or more subdoses per day. Multiple doses often are desired, or required, because modulation of Pgp activity can be temporary.","A \u201ctherapeutically effective\u201d dose refers to that amount of the compound that results in achieving the desired effect. Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of such compounds can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., for determining the LD(the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED(the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index, which is expressed as the ratio between LDand ED. Compounds which exhibit high therapeutic indices are preferred. The data obtained from such data can be used in formulating a range of dosage for use in humans. The dosage of such compounds preferably lies within a range of circulating concentrations that include the EDwith little or no toxicity. The dosage can vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed, and the route of administration utilized.","Formulations of the present invention can be administered in a standard manner, such as orally, parenterally, sublingually, transdermally, rectally, transmucosally, topically, via inhalation, or via buccal administration. Parenteral administration includes, but is not limited to, intravenous, intraarterial, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intrathecal, and intraarticular.","For veterinary use, a multidrug resistance inhibitor, or a nontoxic salt or prodrug thereof, is administered as a suitably acceptable formulation in accordance with normal veterinary practice. The veterinarian can readily determine the dosing regimen and route of administration that is most appropriate for a particular animal.","A pharmaceutical composition containing a multidrug resistance inhibitor can be in the form of tablets or lozenges formulated in conventional manner. For example, tablets and capsules for oral administration can contain conventional excipients such as binding agents (for example, syrup, accacia, gelatin, sorbitol, tragacanth, mucilage of starch or polyvinylpyrrolidone), fillers (for example, lactose, sugar, microcrystalline cellulose, maize-starch, calcium phosphate, or sorbitol), lubricants (for example, magnesium stearate, stearic acid, talc, polyethylene glycol, or silica), disintegrants (for example, potato starch or sodium starch glycollate), or wetting agents (for example, sodium lauryl sulfate). The tablets can be coated according to methods well known in the art.","Alternatively, a multidrug resistance inhibitor can be incorporated into oral liquid preparations such as aqueous or oily suspensions, solutions, emulsions, syrups, or elixirs, for example. Moreover, formulations containing these compounds can be presented as a dry product for constitution with water or other suitable vehicle before use. Such liquid preparations can contain conventional additives, like suspending agents, such as sorbitol syrup, methyl cellulose, glucose\/sugar syrup, gelatin, hydroxyethylcellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose, aluminum stearate gel, and hydrogenated edible fats; emulsifying agents, such as lecithin, sorbitan mono-oleate, or acacia; nonaqueous vehicles (which can include edible oils), such as almond oil, fractionated coconut oil, oily esters, propylene glycol, and ethyl alcohol; and preservatives, such as methyl or propyl p-hydroxybenzoate and sorbic acid.","Such preparations also can be formulated as suppositories, e.g., containing conventional suppository bases, such as cocoa butter or other glycerides. Compositions for inhalation typically can be provided in the form of a solution, suspension, or emulsion that can be administered as a dry powder or in the form of an aerosol using a conventional propellant, such as dichlorodifluoromethane or trichlorofluoromethane. Typical transdermal formulations comprise conventional aqueous or nonaqueous vehicles, such as creams, ointments, lotions, and pastes, or are in the form of a medicated plaster, patch, or membrane.","Additionally, compositions of the present invention can be formulated for parenteral administration by injection or continuous infusion. It is envisioned that injection or continuous infusion is the preferred method of administration. Formulations for injection can be in the form of suspensions, solutions, or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and can contain formulation agents, such as suspending, stabilizing, and\/or dispersing agents. Alternatively, the active ingredient can be in powder form for reconstitution with a suitable vehicle (e.g., sterile, pyrogen-free water) before use.","A composition in accordance with the present invention also can be formulated as a depot preparation. Such long acting formulations can be administered by implantation (for example, subcutaneously or intramuscularly) or by intramuscular injection. Accordingly, the compounds of the invention can be formulated with suitable polymeric or hydrophobic materials (as an emulsion in an acceptable oil, for example), ion exchange resins, or as sparingly soluble derivatives (as a sparingly soluble salt, for example).","A multidrug resistance inhibitor also can be used in combination with other therapeutic agents which can be useful in the treatment of cancer and other conditions or disease states. The invention thus provides, in another aspect, a combination of a therapeutic, multidrug resistance inhibitor together with a second therapeutically active agent.","A multidrug resistance inhibitor, can be used in the preparation of a medicament for coadministration with the second therapeutically active agent in treatment of conditions where modulation of Pgp activity is beneficial. In addition, a multidrug resistance inhibitor can be used in the preparation of a medicament for use as adjunctive therapy with a second therapeutically active compound to treat such conditions. Appropriate doses of known second therapeutic agents for use in combination with a multidrug resistance inhibitor are readily appreciated by those skilled in the art.","For example, a therapeutic, multidrug resistance inhibitor can be used in combination with a cancer therapy, such as chemotherapy. In particular, a multidrug resistance inhibitor can be used in conjunction with chemotherapeutic drugs, such as cis-platin, doxorubicin, Vinca alkaloids, taxol, cyclophosphamide, ifosphamide, chlorambucil, busulfan, mechlorethamine, mitomycin, dacarbazine, carboplatin, thiotepa, daunorubicin, idarubicin, mitoxanthrone, bleomycin, esperamicin A, plicamycin, carmustine, lomustine, tauromustine, streptozocin, melphalan, dactinomycin, topotecan, adriamycin, camptothecin, interferon (alpha, beta, gamma), interleukin 2, irinotecan, docetaxel, and procarbazine, and therapeutically effective analogs, prodrugs, and derivatives thereof, for example. A multidrug resistance inhibitor also can be used in combination with drugs used to treat a condition caused by a pathogen, virus, parasite, or other microbiological vector, for example, an antiinfective, like an antibiotic.","Additional chemotherapeutic agents that can be used with a present multidrug resistance inhibitor include, but are not limited to, alkylating agents, antimetabolites, hormones and antagonists thereof, radioisotopes, antibodies, as well as natural products, and combinations thereof. For example, a multidrug resistance inhibitor of the present invention can be administered with antibiotics, such as doxorubicin and other anthracycline analogs, nitrogen mustards, such as cyclophosphamide, pyrimidine analogs such as 5-fluorouracil, cisplatin, hydroxyurea, taxol and its natural and synthetic derivatives, and the like. As another example, the inhibitor can be administered in conjunction with leuprolide or goserelin (synthetic peptide analogs of LH-RH).
