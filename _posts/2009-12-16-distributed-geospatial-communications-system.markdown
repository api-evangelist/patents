{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","U.S. GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This utility patent application claims priority to provisional patent application No. 61\/140,129, filed on Dec. 23, 2008, entitled \u201cEMBEDDED DISTRIBUTED GEOSPATIAL COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM, ARCHITECTURE AND DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM, AND METHOD OF COMMUNICATING VIA SAME.\u201d This utility patent application incorporates provisional patent application No. 61\/140,129 by reference in its entirety.","The invention described herein may be manufactured, used, imported, sold, and licensed by or for the Government of the United States of America without the payment or any royalty thereon or therefor.","The invention disclosed broadly relates to the field of communications and data management and more specifically to the field of data management over a distributed geospatial communications system.","One of the salient features of today's modern organizations on a global, national, regional and local level is the ability to leverage information technology to command and control systems in real or near-real time. Advances in the technologies that integrate sensor and communications systems, for instance, facilitate determination of the precise location of mobile vehicles. Various modern information systems permit such location determination, including space, airborne, terrestrial and marine-based command and control systems.","Every vehicle equipped with such a command and control system is able to determine the location using geospatial positioning technology such as the global positioning system (GPS), the long range navigation (LORAN) system, or any others, and then report that vehicle's information to higher command structures\/systems using secure wireless linkages. Vehicles equipped with command and control systems also receive a variety of messages from higher command structures\/systems, including the known locations of other related vehicles and other unknown or suspected locations of non-related vehicles. Command and control systems also allow vehicles to send and receive warning messages and in turn permit, for instance, the alerting of related vehicles about such significant events whether developing or in progress. Various U.S. Patents disclose the networking of mobile nodes for the purpose of sharing information. Two pertinent U.S. Patents in this area are described below.","U.S. Pat. No. 7,049,952 discloses a system for detecting the occurrence of anomalies, includes a plurality of spaced apart nodes, with each node having adjacent nodes, each of the nodes having one or more sensors associated with the node and capable of detecting anomalies, and each of the nodes having a controller connected to the sensors associated with the node. The system also includes communication links between adjacent nodes, whereby the nodes form a network. Each controller is programmed to query its adjacent nodes to assess the status of the adjacent nodes and the communication links.","U.S. Pat. No. 6,930,596 discloses a system for detecting the occurrence of anomalies, includes a plurality of spaced apart nodes, with each node having adjacent nodes, each of the nodes having one or more sensors associated with the node and capable of detecting anomalies, and each of the nodes having a controller connected to the sensors associated with the node. The system also includes communication links between adjacent nodes, whereby the nodes form a network. Each controller is programmed to query its adjacent nodes to assess the status of the adjacent nodes and the communication links.","The above-described systems rely on the proper management and functioning of integrated databases. Much of the current art on database management systems revolves around the idea of building massive repositories of data, and resolving the complex synchronization issues that arise among them. Though some work has been done in the area of distributed embedded database management systems, it is focused on the notion that these embedded devices act as a sort of cache to address the data needs of the user when there is no connectivity to a dedicated server. The current art, therefore, requires that functioning of and access to the master data stores (such as a central database in communication with a central server) are required in order for the distributed system to work. Situations arise, however, where access to a central (main) database is unavailable, yet there remains an urgent need for utilization of the system (and particularly affected individual, i.e., local, nodes).","Therefore, there is a need to overcome the deficiencies with the prior art and more particularly for a more efficient way to facilitate the exchange of pertinent data between mobile nodes over a communications network even in the absence of a dedicated central data store.","Embodiments of the present invention address deficiencies of the art in respect to data management over a distributed geospatial communications system and provide a novel and non-obvious method, computer system and computer program product for facilitating exchange of pertinent data between mobile nodes over a wireless communications network. In an embodiment of the invention, a method on a first mobile node for facilitating exchange of pertinent data between mobile nodes over a wireless communications network can be provided. The method can include establishing, by the first mobile node, a wireless network connection with at least one other mobile node inside a predefined geospatial area, wherein the wireless network connection is established over the wireless communications network. The method can further include determining that a future position of the first mobile node is outside the predefined geospatial area and transmitting pertinent data residing on the first mobile node over the wireless communications network exclusively to the at least one other mobile node inside the predefined geospatial area, wherein the pertinent data is associated with the predefined geospatial area.","In another embodiment of the invention, an alternative method on a first mobile node for facilitating exchange of pertinent data between mobile nodes over a wireless communications network can be provided. The method can include determining, by the first mobile node, that a current position of the first mobile node is within a predefined geospatial area. The method can further include establishing a wireless network connection with at least one other mobile node inside the predefined geospatial area, wherein the wireless network connection is established over the wireless communications network. The method can further include transmitting a query for pertinent data over the wireless communications network exclusively to the at least one other mobile node inside the predefined geospatial area, wherein the pertinent data is associated with the predefined geospatial area and receiving pertinent data residing on the at least one other mobile node over the wireless communications network.","In a general embodiment, the method of the present invention provides for the transfer of data between mobile nodes, wherein the data is particular to a predefined geospatial area. More particularly, the method involves the establishment of a wireless network connection between a first mobile node situated within a predefined geospatial area and a second mobile node, the determination\u2014by the first mobile node\u2014that the first mobile node will be outside of the geospatial area at some future time; and transmitting the pertinent data from the first mobile node to the second mobile node via the wireless network connection. Accordingly the data which is particular to the geospatial area is transmitted or \u201chanded off\u201d to the second wireless node which is either situated in the geo spatial area or about to be situated in the predefined area. In this inventive manner\u2014and in sharp contrast to prior art methods\u2014the data is transmitted directly from the first node to the second node without any centralized databases such that the data is substantially always resident in the geospatial area.","Additional aspects of the invention will be set forth in part in the description which follows, and in part will be obvious from the description, or may be learned by practice of the invention. The aspects of the invention will be realized and attained by means of the elements and combinations particularly pointed out in the appended claims. It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are not restrictive of the invention, as claimed.","Embodiments of the present invention address deficiencies of the art in respect to data management over a distributed geospatial communications system and provide a novel and non-obvious method, computer system and computer program product for facilitating exchange of pertinent data between mobile nodes over a wireless communications network. The present invention overcomes the problems with the prior art by providing a system of mobile devices operable to spontaneously form ad-hoc networked distributed data repositories with or without connectivity to a central data repository. This is advantageous over the prior art as it removes the requirement for a central data depository, thereby providing an additional degree of freedom for the overall system.","Moreover, the present invention enables networked mobile nodes to automatically pick up and drop off data pertaining to a predefined geospatial area when entering or leaving the predefined geospatial area, thereby ensuring that the most pertinent data is perpetually at hand for each mobile device while within the predefined geospatial area. Again, this is advantageous as it provides an effective method of maintaining, sharing, and disseminating pertinent information across a wireless communications network. This is further advantageous because it reduces the search space for data being requested, thereby reducing the processing burden of finding pertinent data and reducing bandwidth use.","Referring now to the drawing figures in which like reference designators refer to like elements, there is shown in  an illustration of a block diagram showing the network architecture of a distributed geospatial communications system in accordance with the principles of the present invention.  shows an embodiment of the present invention wherein mobile nodes - interact with each other, as well as data repository , over a communications network , which can be a circuit switched network, a packet switched network and\/or a wireless communications network, such as a cellular phone radio frequency network.

Data repository  delivers data based on search parameters or querying information provided by a client. It should be noted that although  shows only one dedicated data repository , the system of the present invention supports any number of dedicated data repositories connected via network . Further, the data repository  may be centralized in one location or distributed among multiple data repositories connected via network . Alternatively, the system of the present invention supports zero dedicated data repositories connected via network . In one embodiment of the present invention, the database management system is a client-server application that may include a client portion that resides on mobile nodes - and a server portion that resides on data repository . In another embodiment of the present invention, the data repository  delivers to a mobile node an application embodying a client portion that resides on the mobile node. In a preferred embodiment, data repository  is stationary.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["202","100","204","119","100","119","114","204","206","100","115","102","106","206","100"]},"Next, in step , the logic  of node  transmits, via transmitter , a query for pertinent data over the wireless communications network  exclusively to the at least one other mobile node, such as node , inside the predefined geospatial area. In one embodiment, the term pertinent data refers to data that is associated with the predefined geo spatial area. For example, the data may be about or otherwise pertain to the predefined geospatial area. In another embodiment, the term pertinent data refers to data that is associated with at least one of the following: the predefined geospatial area, a predefined temporal description and a predefined subject matter description. In step , the node  receives, via receiver , pertinent data from the at least one other mobile node over the wireless communications network .","In step , the logic  of node  determines whether to store the pertinent data that was received, wherein the determination may be on a variety of parameters, such as an amount of free data storage space on the node . Additionally, the presence of a prior version of the pertinent data on the node  may also be taken into account. Also, the node  may decide to delete expired data in data repository  of node  to make room for the new pertinent data, if the priority of the new pertinent data is higher or the new pertinent data is more pertinent that the expired data. Further, based on the aforementioned parameters, the node  may decide to modify parameters for deeming data pertinent, such as shrinking the area of interest represented by the parameters.","If the determination of step  is positive, then the pertinent data is stored in data repository  of node  in step . It should be noted that node  may alternatively interact with dedicated data repository  instead of node .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["302","100","115","102","106","302","100"]},"In step , node  is moving towards exiting a predefined geospatial area. In step , the logic  is used to determine the future position of the node . In one embodiment, logic  reads a current location and speed stored by GPS  to make the determination of step . In step , the logic  determines whether the future position is within the predefined geospatial area.","If the result of the determination of step  is negative, then in step , the logic  of node  transmits, via transmitter , all pertinent data in data repository  of node  over the wireless communications network  exclusively to the at least one other mobile node, such as node , inside the predefined geospatial area. In step , the node  receives the pertinent data from node  over the wireless communications network . In step , the logic of node  determines whether to store the pertinent data that was received, similar to step . If so, data is stored in step . It should be noted that node  may alternatively interact with dedicated data repository  instead of node .","A feature of note is the ability of the node  to transmit pertinent data to more than one other node  in step  above. In one embodiment, the pertinent data is broadcast by node  to all other nodes with which node  has a network connection within the predefined geo spatial area. Upon reception by the multiple receiving nodes, it is decided by the receiving nodes, either individually or collectively, which nodes, if any, will be storing the pertinent data. The process undertaken for deciding whether to store the pertinent data that was received is described in more detail in step , as executed by the logic  of node .","In one embodiment, nodes - have the ability to network directly with each other in the absence of a central data repository such as data repository . Further, nodes -, have the ability to determine the priority level of pertinent data and the ability to determine which nodes are best suited to relay pertinent data, thereby allowing priority knowledge to be shared expeditiously among the mobile nodes. Also, nodes - are operable to query the system so as to determine the status of surrounding local nodes. In the event that the query determines that a local node that is currently connected to a dedicated server detects via the query that a neighboring local node is unable to connect to any dedicated server, the node in connection with a dedicated server is operable to selectively act as either a relay of data for the centralized server, or act as a server in its own right for the neighboring node unable to connect to any servers. Thus, the system of the present invention ensures that the data needs of all nodes within the system are addressed, regardless of ad-hoc network partitioning.","Additionally, each node is operable to selectively synchronize some or all of its onboard stored data with conventional data stores (stored on or in communication with data repository ). This is desirable, as traditional data storage means and systems (such as those in communication with the data repository ) offer significantly greater storage and processing power than the individual nodes. Thus, the present invention can leverage traditional centralized data storage systems (such as centralized, stationary computer data storage means ) when the required connectivity exists. Also, nodes may be configures such that time critical data is transmitted to only a specific designated portion of the system. For example, while some time critical information may need to reach every node, other information may only pertain to those nodes within a particular region or with a specific user profile, and thus that information may only be relayed to those pertinent nodes. This embodiment enables conservation of valuable bandwidth, and consequently higher transmission speeds throughout the system.","In another embodiment, each information item (e.g., data packet transmitted by a data repository  or node -) is tagged with necessary metadata. Such metadata may include, but is not limited to, the criticality of the data (information), the identity of the data source, the geospatial region and time interval to which the data applies, the time when the data was last updated, and the type of data it is. Such metadata enables the receiving node to more quickly analyze the received data, and produce an actionable report based thereon.","In yet another embodiment, the present invention is operable to determine when information must be deleted from the onboard data storage means of the nodes, and to take action to delete same when determined appropriate. In particular, when the system determines that information should be deleted from system data stores, the system broadcasts a command to all neighboring nodes indicating the impending deletion of such information. This broadcasted message includes the data item itself, so that neighboring nodes may either store it or relay it. This function occurs primarily when an existing information item must be discarded in order to make room for a new item that is deemed to be of higher importance. This broadcast, which may be repeated depending on the importance of the information in question, reduces the probability of information being lost, yet allows for the storage of newer data and data of higher importance.","The present invention can be realized in hardware, software, or a combination of hardware and software in the system described in the figures above. A system according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention can be realized in a centralized fashion in one computer system or in a distributed fashion where different elements are spread across several interconnected computer systems. Any kind of computer system\u2014or other apparatus adapted for carrying out the methods described herein\u2014is suited. A typical combination of hardware and software could be a general-purpose computer system with a computer program that, when being loaded and executed, controls the computer system such that it carries out the methods described herein.","An embodiment of the present invention can also be embedded in a computer program product, which comprises all the features enabling the implementation of the methods described herein, and which\u2014when loaded in a computer system\u2014is able to carry out these methods. Computer program means or computer program as used in the present invention indicates any expression, in any language, code or notation, of a set of instructions intended to cause a system having an information processing capability to perform a particular function either directly or after either or both of the following a) conversion to another language, code or, notation; and b) reproduction in a different material form.","A computer system may include, inter alia, one or more computers and at least a computer readable medium, allowing a computer system, to read data, instructions, messages or message packets, and other computer readable information from the computer readable medium. The computer readable medium may include non-volatile memory, such as ROM, Flash memory, Disk drive memory, CD-ROM, and other permanent storage.

Furthermore, the computer readable medium may comprise computer readable information in a transitory state medium such as a network link and\/or a network interface, including a wired network or a wireless network that allows a computer system to read such computer readable information.","In this document, the terms \u201ccomputer program medium,\u201d \u201ccomputer usable medium,\u201d and \u201ccomputer readable medium\u201d are used to generally refer to media such as main memory removable storage drive, a hard disk installed in hard disk drive, and signals.
