title: Overlaying images in automated insurance policy form generation
abstract: Overlaying images in automated insurance policy form generation includes electronically converting a first form in a first format to a second format to and in response to receiving a Web page request, electronically communicating the second form to be displayed within the Web browser instead of electronically communicating the first form in the first format to be displayed within the Web browser. In the case where the first format is AdobeÂ® portable document format (PDF) and the second format is Joint Picture Expert Group (JPEG) format, this enables the user of the browser to overlay images on the forms within the Web page interface of the browser, while it appears to the user they are overlaying images on the original PDF versions of the forms. The final integrated PDF form is then generated from the data indicating the location of the overlay image on the underlying JPEG form. This process may also apply to insurance policy forms wherein the overlay image is a state specific stamp to be placed on the underlying form.

Technical Field","This disclosure generally relates to data services, and to automated form generation and completion.","2. Description of the Related Art","Insurance agents (e.g., general agents) often compile a repository of insurance endorsement forms, organize that collection and maintain the format and version of the forms over time separately for various different insurance carriers. These processes consume a high number of hours of working time and, due to the fact that many of the forms have similar appearances and file names, such processes can be prone to user error. The insurance carrier delegates which forms belong on a policy and applies rules for determining when those forms are mandatory or optional.","Some existing insurance policy issuance utilities require that the general agent maintain insurance policy document templates (either in electronic or paper form) to which the user (e.g., general agent) must attach the proper policy jackets and include the proper state specific insurance policy stamps. Typically, a policy is provided in the form of a policy jacket including one or more paper documents. The time spent on this insurance policy form maintenance and generation in the process of issuing insurance policies can add up to hundreds of hours wasted each year, reducing the number of policies an individual insurance agent can process.","A computer-implemented method may be summarized as including receiving a first form in a first format, wherein the first form is an electronic form that is electronically fillable; electronically converting the first form to a second format to generate a second form in the second format, wherein the second form is an electronic form that is not electronically fillable; in response to receiving a client request, electronically communicating the second form to be displayed within a user interface of a client associated with the client request instead of electronically communicating the first form in the first format to be displayed within the user interface, wherein the second form as displayed within the user interface is substantially visually indistinguishable from the first form were the first form to be displayed within the user interface, and wherein the second format is a format such that an image file in the second format is able to have other images visually placed over an image stored in the image file in the second format within the user interface in a manner that data indicating a position of the other images relative to the image stored in the image file in the second format on which the other images are placed is able to be captured and stored using functionality of the client or a service accessed by the client; receiving data indicating a position of an overlay image overlaid on the second form, wherein the overlay image is stored in an electronic file with the overlay image ultimately to be overlaid on an image stored by an electronically fillable form; and generating a third form in the first format, wherein the third form is an electronic form that is electronically fillable, the generating including incorporating the overlay image on an image stored by the third form at a location on the image stored by the third form corresponding to the data indicating the position of the overlay image on the second form. The first format may be a format such that an image file in the first format is not able to have other images visually placed over an image stored in the image file in the first format within the user interface in such said manner relative to the image stored in the image file in the first format. The first format may be portable document format and the second format is Joint Picture Expert Group format.","The method may further include at least partially electronically filling the first form before electronically converting the first form.

Unless described otherwise, the construction and operation of the various blocks shown in  are of conventional design. As a result, such blocks need not be described in further detail herein, as they will be understood by those skilled in the relevant art.","The computer system  may include one or more processing units , (collectively ), a system memory  and a system bus  that couples various system components including the system memory  to the processing units . The processing units  may be any logic processing unit, such as one or more central processing units (CPUs) , digital signal processors (DSPs) , application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), programmable gate arrays such as field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), etc. The system bus  can employ any known bus structures or architectures, including a memory bus with memory controller, a peripheral bus, and a local bus. The system memory  includes read-only memory (\u201cROM\u201d)  and random access memory (\u201cRAM\u201d) . A basic input\/output system (\u201cBIOS\u201d) , which can form part of the ROM , contains basic routines that help transfer information between elements within the computer system , such as during start-up.","The computer system  may include a hard disk drive  for reading from and writing to a hard disk , an optical disk drive  for reading from and writing to removable optical disks , and\/or a magnetic disk drive  for reading from and writing to magnetic disks .

The hard disk drive , optical disk drive  and magnetic disk drive  may include interfaces or controllers (not shown) coupled between such drives and the system bus , as is known by those skilled in the relevant art. The drives ,  and , and their associated computer-readable storage media , , , may provide nonvolatile and non-transitory storage of computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules and other data for the computer system . Although the depicted computer system  is illustrated employing a hard disk , optical disk  and magnetic disk , those skilled in the relevant art will appreciate that other types of computer-readable storage media that can store data accessible by a computer may be employed, such as magnetic cassettes, flash memory, digital video disks (\u201cDVD\u201d), Bernoulli cartridges, RAMs, ROMs, smart cards, etc. For example, computer-readable storage media may include, but is not limited to, random access memory (RAM), read-only memory (ROM), electrically erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM), flash memory, compact disc ROM (CD-ROM), digital versatile disks (DVD) or other optical disk storage, magnetic cassettes, magnetic tape, magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices, solid state memory or any other medium which can be used to store the desired information and which may be accessed by processing unit ","Program modules can be stored in the system memory , such as an operating system , one or more application programs , other programs or modules  and program data . Application programs  may include instructions that cause the processor(s)  to provide overlaying images in automated insurance policy form generation such as, for example, overlaying images in automated insurance policy form generation performed during the policy issuance service provided by the policy issuance server  based on data received by the general agent system  including indications of where on a form an image is to be placed. The generated forms are generally printable and include documents and printable images. Other program modules  may include instructions for handling security such as password or other access protection and communications encryption.

For example, the computer system  can operate in a networked environment using logical connections to one or more mobile devices, landline telephones and other service providers or information servers. Communications may be via a wired and\/or wireless network architecture, for instance wired and wireless enterprise-wide computer networks, intranets, extranets, telecommunications networks, cellular networks, paging networks, and other mobile networks.","Although not required, the embodiments will be described in the general context of computer-executable instructions, such as program application modules, objects, or macros stored on computer- or processor-readable storage media and executed by a computer or processor. Those skilled in the relevant art will appreciate that the illustrated embodiments as well as other embodiments can be practiced with other system configurations and\/or other computing system configurations, including hand-held devices, multiprocessor systems, microprocessor-based or programmable consumer electronics, personal computers (\u201cPCs\u201d), network PCs, mini computers, mainframe computers, and the like. The embodiments can be practiced in distributed computing environments where tasks or modules are performed by remote processing devices, which are linked through a communications network such as network . In a distributed computing environment, program modules may be located in both local and remote memory storage devices.","AIM systems may offer the user built-in options to issue insurance policies. These built-in options vary from internally generating the document directly from policy data, to sending policy data to word processing utilities which generate the actual document using templates. External policy issuance utilities may also follow this model, and accept policy data which is then placed in pre-defined locations and eventually produce a printable policy document in a similar manner. Although each of these approaches addresses certain difficulties inherent to issuing insurance policies, there still exists the potential of user error surrounding the issuance process and may also involve an excessive amount of time to maintain these systems.","Advantageously, the embodiments of the general agent system described herein instead or additionally provide an integration library and associated programs that produce policy data in a standardized declarative language format (e.g., in Association for Cooperative Operations Research and Development Extensible Markup Language (ACORD XML)), which is then transmitted to the policy issuance server . Note that the transmitted XML need not communicate to the policy issuance server  where to place the data on any particular policy document or form, and the user (e.g., the general agent) need not have seen the policy form templates nor its endorsement forms prior to using the system. This substantially reduces potential of user error surrounding the policy issuance process and also reduces the amount of time to maintain the general agent systems.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":"300"},"The process  starts at , wherein the basic policy data is received by the policy issuance server (e.g., in ACORD XML format). For example, the general agent or other user may enter basic policy data into the general agent system, and then send a request that includes the basic policy data to the policy issuance server for a list of required and optional policy forms based on the received basic policy data.","At , based on the received policy data, the policy issuance server automatically determines and sends the list of required and optional policy forms to the general agent system. The policy issuance server may use the received policy data to determine the listed optional forms, and those that are marked as required for the particular policy. The policy issuance server may automatically apply custom business rules for each individual insurance carrier to compile policy documents, automating an otherwise typically error-prone and time consuming process. The policy issuance server may also provide the general agent the ability to overlay or place their own images within a Web browser interface on top of a carrier's forms. This need may arise in instances where the general agent wants to include state specific stamps on policy forms in accordance with state specific insurance laws and regulations. The policy issuance server may automatically generate the insurance policy form templates based on forms previously received corresponding to the applicable insurance carrier and any customized insurance carrier forms on which stamps have been placed by the general agent, and then populate the forms with the appropriate received basic policy data. Alternatively, the forms may be populated with the appropriate received basic policy data and then the general agent may customize the forms by electronically placing their own images within a Web browser interface on top of the completed forms.","At , for example, the general agent may select forms from the list of required and optional policy forms and optionally overlay any state specific desired stamps or other images on the selected forms within a graphical user interface of a Web browser. The forms may be accessed at the policy issuance server, general agent system, or any other system or database in which the forms are stored. This process is detailed further in  and the accompanying description.","At , the general agent system selects forms from the required and optional policy forms to include on an insurance quote document. Such may be performed via the user interface.","At , the policy issuance server may send a list of all forms for a particular carrier to the general agent if requested for an additional endorsement to the policy being quoted. For example, if the user decides that an endorsement form that is not listed needs to be attached to the policy, the user can request a list of all of the forms the corresponding carrier has made available to the general agent. At this point, the general agent may again select forms from the list of all of the forms the corresponding carrier has made available to the general agent and optionally overlay any state specific desired stamps or other images on the selected forms within a graphical user interface of a Web browser.","At , the general agent system electronically attaches the selected electronic endorsement forms to the electronically stored policy. For example, the general agent system may include the selected electronic endorsement forms in the same folder or object in which the electronically stored policy is stored or associated, or may otherwise electronically associate the selected electronic endorsement forms to the electronically stored policy.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0065"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":"400"},"At , after the policy has been bound, the general agent system may then submit the completed policy's data, exported to ACORD XML, to the policy issuance server.","At , the policy issuance server automatically validates the policy data to ensure the policy is valid. This validation may include electronically automatically checking the policy data against formatting rules, checking for data integrity and checking that the data complies with applicable insurance regulations and policy issuance procedures.","At , if the policy is valid, the policy issuance server sends a policy issuance policy identifier (policy ID) to enable the policy issuance workflow to be completed by the general agent. For example, this new ID is used to generate a uniform resource locator (URL) to a Web page on the policy issuance server that will allow the user to complete the service's issuance workflow.","At , based on the received policy data, the policy issuance server automatically generates completed policy forms (e.g., in Adobe\u00ae portable document format (PDF)) when the policy workflow is completed. For example, the policy issuance server may automatically generate the insurance policy form templates based on forms received from the corresponding insurance carrier, including electronically placing state specific stamps or other images on the PDF forms as previously indicated by the general agent system. The policy issuance server may then populate the forms with the applicable received policy data. Alternatively, the policy issuance server may first populate the forms with the applicable received policy data and then generate the final forms by electronically placing the state specific stamps or other images on the populated forms as indicated by the general agent system. In another embodiment, the PDF forms may have already had the state specific stamps or other images electronically placed or incorporated into the PDF forms as previously indicated by the general agent system before policy issuance validation.","At , the completed policy forms are made available to the user for verification and the policy is automatically marked issued once verified. For example, the general agent system polls another generated URL, again using the policy ID, until a link to the issued policy's PDF URL is available. Once the PDF's link is retrieved, the PDF is downloaded, saved to the general agent system's attachment directory, logged to the general agent system's activity log and displayed to the user for validation. The policy can be modified and re-issued, and different images overlaid as needed on the various policy forms, until the policy has been marked as issued on policy issuance server. After the policy has been issued and verified, the general agent can then mail out the policy (e.g., physically mailing a paper form of the policy). This also marks the policy as completed on the policy issuance server. Once the policy has been mailed out, it may be modified by an endorsement.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0072","num":"0071"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":"500"},"At , the policy issuance server receives modified policy data after the policy is issued. For example, the general agent system may electronically communicate updates or changes in the policy data (e.g., insured or beneficiary name changes, coverage changes, etc.) to the policy issuance server.","At , the policy issuance server automatically identifies policy changes and validates policy data. For example, the policy issuance server may compare the received modified policy data to the existing policy data to identify particular changes. The policy issuance server may perform the validation on the identified changes. The validation may include electronically automatically checking the policy data against formatting rules, checking for data integrity and checking that the data complies with applicable insurance regulations and policy issuance procedures.","At , based on the received modified policy data, the policy issuance server automatically identifies and generates completed applicable policy endorsement forms. For example, the policy issuance server may automatically generate the insurance policy endorsement form templates based on forms received from the corresponding insurance carrier, including electronically placing state specific stamps or other images on the .pdf forms as previously indicated by the general agent system. The policy issuance server may then populate the forms with the applicable received policy data. Alternatively, the policy issuance server may first populate the forms with the applicable received policy data and then generate the final forms by electronically placing the state specific stamps or other images on the populated forms as indicated by the general agent system. In another embodiment, the PDF forms may have already had the state specific stamps or other images electronically placed or incorporated into the .pdf forms as previously indicated by the general agent system before modified policy data has been received or before policy changes have been identified.","At , the policy issuance server automatically electronically attaches the completed endorsement forms to the electronically stored policy. For example, the policy issuance server may include the completed endorsement forms in the same folder or object in which the electronically stored policy is stored or associated, or may otherwise electronically associate the completed endorsement forms to the electronically stored policy.","At , the completed policy forms including endorsement forms are made available to the user for verification (e.g., by the policy issuance server automatically posting a link to the completed endorsement forms or sending a link to the completed endorsement forms to the general agent system).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0078","num":"0077"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":"600"},"Internally, the general agent system may use mapping files  to export policy data  retrieved from the AIM database  as valid ACORD XML . These mapping files  may also be formatted as XML and are distributed with the AIM client  software (e.g., AIM.exe). These mapping files  can be broken into parts, which are compiled into a full map file before being processed by AIM client software . The appropriate mapping files are loaded based on the policy's line(s) of business that are currently being exported. Before the mapping files are processed, the raw policy data  is loaded into policy objects  and it is these policy objects  that are directly mapped to ACORD XML. The policy data may also include information indicating the location on particular forms of the policy on which to overlay particular images (e.g., state specific stamps) as well as the size of the image to be overlaid on the form.","In the mapping files , each of the policy objects  are represented as data sources and the pieces of data held by the object are represented as fields. The AIM client software  processes the map files sequentially, allowing the map files to dictate how the policy's objects are accessed and what data is being exported. The mapping files  takes these data sources and fields, and places them into ACORD XML nodes . The latter part of this process is also performed sequentially, allowing the AIM client software  to adhere to the ordering of the mapped ACORD XML nodes . This ACORD XML  is then communicated to the policy issuance Web service  such that policy issuance server may automatically generate the insurance policy form templates, including incorporating any state specific stamps on the forms. this form generation may be based on the information indicating the location on particular forms of the policy on which to overlay particular images or stamps and based on forms received from the corresponding insurance carrier or other sources. The policy issuance Web service  may then populate the forms with the applicable policy data of the received ACORD XML .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0081","num":"0080"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":"700"},"Referring also again to , the general agent system  may, for example, use a Web browser interface to access the policy issuance server  and view insurance policy form templates, which are often in PDF format. However, traditionally there has not been a way to view a PDF file in a Web browser with the ability to overlay an image (e.g., a state specific stamp) with mouse control directly on top of the PDF and incorporate the overlay image into the PDF at the corresponding location. The process  described below provides a solution to this problem that enables a general agent to use the general agent system  to visually place the image on the insurance form template within the Web browser. In particular, the user selects the desired image to be placed on the form template by positioning the selected image on the form template by clicking a mouse button while the cursor is pointing at the image on the image and dragging the image across the screen to the desired position on the form template. The process  of overlaying images provides one embodiment of overlaying images within a Web browser as part of or separate from the automated policy issuance process described herein.","At , the applicable policy forms are received by the policy issuance server. These may be received from the insurance carrier, general agent or other party and may be in PDF format, for example.","At , the policy issuance server converts the one or more received electronic forms stored in an electronic file from the received file type into another file type, e.g., from PDF format to Joint Picture Expert Group (JPEG or JPG). For example, the received file type format may support an electronically fillable form (e.g., the form stored in the file having the received file type format has included form related tags or metadata having to do with particular form fields included in the file) and the file type format into which the form is converted stores an image of the original electronic form, but is not electronically fillable. The particular file type format to which the forms are being converted, for example, is one in which images in such a format may have other images visually placed over them within a graphical user interface of a Web browser, or of a Web page displayed in the Web browser, in such a manner that the position of the other image relative to the image on which it is placed is captured and stored using the functionality of the Web browser or application being accessed by the Web browser. Also, if a client other than a Web browser is being used to access the forms, the particular format to which the forms are being converted, for example, is one in which images in such a format may have other images visually placed over them within the particular type of client being used in such a manner that the position of the other image relative to the image on which it is placed is stored using functionality of the particular client or application being accessed by the client.","At , the converted forms are displayed in the Web browser or other client. For example, the policy issuance server responds to a request received via the Web browser and displays the converted image or images (e.g., JPEG images) corresponding to a particular form received in a different format (e.g., PDF format). In one embodiment, the general agent uses the general agent system to access various forms or form templates on the policy issuance server and the policy issuance server responds by displaying the converted form or group of forms requested within the Web browser of the general agent system. Alternatively, the policy issuance server may wait to convert the form or form template (e.g., from PDF to a JPEG image) until the request is received from the general agent system to access the particular form or form template on the policy issuance server. In various other embodiments, these converted forms or form templates may be stored at the policy issuance server, general agent system, or any other third party system or database.","At , one or more of the various images (e.g., state specific stamps) that are available to be placed on or overlaid on one or more of the displayed converted forms are also displayed. For example, the policy issuance server responds to a request received via the Web browser and displays images that are available to be placed on or overlaid on one or more of the displayed converted forms. These various images may be received from the insurance carrier, general agent or other party and may be in various formats, for example, and may have also been previously converted to JPEG or other format (e.g., from PDF to a JPEG image). In various other embodiments, these images may be stored at the policy issuance server, general agent system, or any other third party system or database.","At , an indication of a location on which the overlay image is to be overlaid on a particular form or form template is received. For example, within the Web browser of the general agent system, the general agent selects (e.g., clicks on) a particular displayed state specific stamp icon and drags the selected icon to a location on a particular form or form template displayed within the Web browser on which the general agent wants the stamp to be placed. Since the particular form or form template displayed within the Web browser is in JPEG format (e.g., as opposed to its original PDF format), the Web browser has the ability to overlay an image (e.g., the state specific stamp) with mouse control directly on top of the form or form template displayed within the Web browser. Thus, displaying the JPEG image of each PDF page of the form or form template within the Web browser instead of the original PDF of the form or form template gives the user the impression that they are placing the overlay image directly on the PDF document. The size of the overlay image, color of the overlay image, and orientation of the overlay image may also be selected and indicated within the Web browser.","Other embodiments may include various other ways of selecting the overlay image using various applicable GUI controls. Also, other embodiments may include various other ways of indicating the location on which the overlay image is to be placed on a particular form and the size of the overlay image including, but not limited to: entering a name or a tag of the overlay image, directly entering coordinates and dimensions of the overlay image, dragging a corner of a selection box which indicates the size and location of the overlay image, etc.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0089","num":"0088"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 7"]},"At , the coordinates on the PDF form or form template on which to place an overlay image are determined from the received indicated location at which the overlay image was placed on the JPEG image of the form. For example, once the general agent had, using a mouse, selected, dragged and dropped the overlay image on the JPEG image, the Web browser or image application accessed by the Web browser captures the specific coordinates of the JPEG image underneath the overlay image and on which the overlay image is located. These are then translated into the corresponding coordinates of the original PDF form version of the underlying JPEG image. This translation may be performed by the policy issuance server or the general agent system. If performed by the general agent system, the corresponding coordinates of the original PDF form version of the underlying JPEG image may then be communicated to the policy issuance server.","At , a new PDF form or form template corresponding to the underlying JPEG image is generated including the overlay image placed on the new PDF form or form template at the determined corresponding coordinates. For example, the policy issuance server may use the corresponding coordinates of the original PDF version of the underlying JPEG image to use a PDF form generation or editing tool to automatically generate the new PDF including the overlay image placed on the new PDF form or for template at the determined corresponding coordinates. Alternatively, this form generation may be performed by the general agent system and then the general agent system may send the generated form to the policy issuance server.","At , the policy issuance server then attaches the new PDF form to the policy. In other embodiments, the electronic forms or form templates generated from the underlying image and overlay image may be in various other formats instead of PDF. Also, in other embodiments, instead of JPEG, the particular format of the underlying image may be other formats which are also formats in which images in such formats may have other images visually placed over them within a graphical user interface of a Web browser in such a manner that the position of the other image relative to the image on which it is placed is stored using the functionality of the Web browser or application being accessed by the Web browser. Also, if a client other than a Web browser is being used to access the forms, the particular format of the underlying image, for example, is one in which images in such a format may have other images visually placed over them within the particular type of client being used in such a manner that the position of the other image relative to the image on which it is placed is stored using functionality of the particular client or application being accessed by the client.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0093","num":"0092"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":["900","900","900","902","906","906","906","904","906","908","902"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0094","num":"0093"},"figref":"FIG. 10","b":["1000","1002","1004","1006","1008","1010","1000"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0095","num":"0094"},"figref":"FIG. 11","b":["1100","1102","1104","1106"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0096","num":"0095"},"figref":["FIG. 12","FIG. 11"],"b":["1200","1200","1106","1202","1204"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0097","num":"0096"},"figref":["FIG. 13","FIG. 12"],"b":["1300","1300","1300","1302","1308","1314","1316","1304","1306","1308","1308","1310","1308"]},"The underlying form  being displayed in JPEG format within the Web browser also allows the user to drag, with the mouse cursor , the overlay image  to the desired location on the underlying form  within the Web browser.
