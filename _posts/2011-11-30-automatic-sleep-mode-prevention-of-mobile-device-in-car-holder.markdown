{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE PRESENT INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENT INVENTION"],"p":["This application is a national phase application of PCT International Application Number PCT\/IB2011\/05538, filed on Nov. 30, 2011, published as WO 2012\/073204,which in turn claims priority and benefit from U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61\/417,997, filed on Nov. 30, 2010, both of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.","The present invention relates to mobile devices generally and to their operating conditions when charging in particular.","Vehicles are often equipped with a mounted phone cradle affixed to the dashboard. Such cradles are typically configured to hold a mounted mobile communications device in a generally upright manner facing the driver. When a mobile communications device is placed in such a stand, a driver may access it with relative convenience for a number of purposes including, for example, \u201chands free\u201d phone usage, navigation, mp3 playing, etc.","For these purposes, it is generally more convenient for the driver if the screen backlight is constantly \u201con\u201d, such that the device may be operated with a minimum of delay without distracting the driver from the road any more than absolutely necessary. For the same reasons, it is also generally more convenient if the device is in an unlocked state when so mounted.","Unfortunately, as keeping the backlight on constantly consumes battery power, wastes energy and consequently shortens the battery life, most mobile communications devices are configured with a \u201csleep mode\u201d that turns off the backlight when the device is not in active use. Keeping the device constantly unlocked is also problematic; it can result in undesired activation caused by touching the screen or unintentionally pressing buttons. For example, when a device is placed in a pocket, unintentional dialing and\/or any other undesired operations performed unwittingly may result in unwanted expenses and\/or privacy issues.","Mobile device users often charge their device's batteries while driving. There are a number of mechanisms available for using current from a vehicle's alternator to charge the battery of a mobile communications device while it is held by a phone cradle. For example, some phone cradles are configured to provide a connection between the alternator and the device held by the cradle. Alternatively, a device may be held by the phone cradle and its battery may be charged via a plug connection to an electric source such as, for example, the cigarette lighter.","There is provided in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a mobile communications device including a charger detector to detect when the device is charging, at least one orientation sensor to at least indicate a positional attitude for the device, where a persistent general upright attitude indicates that the device is in a phone cradle in a vehicle, and a decision unit to modify at least one of screen backlighting and device locking in accordance with a charge\/cradle state determined in accordance with input from the charge detector and the at least one orientation sensor.","Further, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the at least one orientation sensor is at least one of: a gyro, an accelerometer and a magnetic orientometer.","Still further, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the device also includes a GPS unit to provide GPS data regarding a location of the device.","Additionally, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the decision unit is configurable to use the GPS data to determine if movement\/location of the device is consistent with being inside the vehicle.","Moreover, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the decision unit is configurable to determine if the vehicle is one of moving and parking.","Further, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the also includes an application to be brought to the foreground when the charge\/cradle state is determined.","Still further, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the device also includes at least one application programmer interface (API) to facilitate interaction between the decision unit and other software\/hardware\/firmware components installed on the device.","Additionally, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the components include at least one of a bluetooth car set device, a driving profile and hands free setting.","There is also provided, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a mobile communications device including a charger detector to detect when the device is charging, a GPS unit to provide GPS data indicative of whether the device is located in a vehicle, and a decision unit to modify at least one of screen backlighting and device locking in accordance with a charge\/driving state determined in accordance with input from the charge detector and the GPS unit.","There is also provided, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a method for preventing sleep mode in a mobile communications device, including detecting active charging of the device, establishing that the device is in an automotive vehicle, based on the detecting and establishing, determining that a charging\/vehicle state exists, and when the charging\/vehicle state exists, instructing a screen backlight of the device to remain on, and disabling key locking for the mobile communications device.","Further, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the determining includes using input from an orientation sensor to determine that the device is in a generally upright position.","Still further, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the determining includes using GPS data from a GPS unit to determine that the location\/movement of the device is consistent with a moving\/parked vehicle.","Additionally, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the method also includes opening a default application in the foreground of the device when the charging\/vehicle state exists.","Moreover, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the method also includes returning the screen backlight and key locking to a default state when the charging\/vehicle state no longer exists.","There is also provided, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a mobile communications device including at least one application programmer interface (API) to provide status information from components of the device, where the status information is indicative of the device being operated in an automobile, and a decision unit to modify at least one of screen backlighting and device locking in accordance with a driving state determined in accordance with at least the status information.","Further, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the device includes at least one orientation sensor to at least indicate a positional attitude for the device, where a persistent general upright attitude indicates that the device is in a phone cradle in a vehicle.","Still further, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the device also includes a charger detector to detect when the device is charging.","Additionally, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the device also includes a GPS unit to provide GPS data indicative of whether the device is located in a

For example, the dimensions of some of the elements may be exaggerated relative to other elements for clarity. Further, where considered appropriate, reference numerals may be repeated among the FIGURES to indicate corresponding or analogous elements.","In the following detailed description, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the invention. However, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known methods, procedures, and components have not been described in detail so as not to obscure the present invention.","Applicants have realized that the fact that drivers may tend to charge their mobile communications devices in a phone cradle while driving may be leveraged to determine with reasonable accuracy when there may be a need to keep the device backlight on and prevent device locking. As will be disclosed hereinbelow, once this need may be determined, standard APIs application programming interfaces (APIs) may be employed to keep the backlight on and to maintain the device in an unlocked state.","Reference is now made to  which illustrates a novel driving state detection and sleep mode prevention system, designed and operative in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Mobile communications device  may be held by phone cradle  which may be, for example, affixed to the dashboard of a car (not shown). Charger  may receive electrical input from the car by any suitable means.","Device  may comprise display screen , charger detector unit  and orientation sensor . Charger detector unit  may be any known functionality for detecting a connection between charger  and device . Orientation sensor may be one or more suitable functionalities such as are known in the art for detecting the orientation of device , for example, an accelerometer, gyro, magnetic orientometer such as, for example, a compass, etc. It will be appreciated that such functionalities may be routinely installed on mobile communications devices with a direct manipulation style of user interface.","Charger detector  may be configured to use known methods to detect the presence of charger  when it may be connected to device . When a connection to charger  may be detected, charger detector  may alert decision unit . Decision unit  may be configured to determine whether or not device  is in a cradle\/charge state, i.e. whether or not device  is physically positioned in cradle  while charging.","After receiving the \u201ccharging alert\u201d from charger detector , decision unit  may then sample input from orientation sensor  to determine whether or not device  may be in a generally upright position that may be generally consistent with being held by phone cradle . An exemplary rule for determining that device  may be in phone cradle  may be represented as: DT=90+\u2212E, where \u201cD\u201d equals the attitude of device  as expressed by orientation sensor  in degrees, DTrepresents a series of at least N samplings every T seconds, and \u201cE\u201d equals a pre-defined maximum angle adjustment in terms of degrees variance from 90 degrees. Accordingly, if the horizontal orientation of the device was 90+\u2212E degrees for more than N times, decision unit  may infer that device  may be currently positioned in a vertical mode which may be consistent with it being positioned in phone cradle .","When decision unit  determines that device  may be in a cradle\/charge state, it may employ standard known APIs to keep the backlight on for screen . Alternatively, decision  may use standard known APIs to turn off sleep mode, which may also include other functionalities not necessarily related to screen backlighting. Decision unit  may also disable phone locking.","It will be appreciated that charger detector  and orientation sensor  may continue to operate while backlighting\/phone locking may be disabled. When charger detector  detects that charger  may no longer be connected, or when decision unit  determines (based on input from orientation sensor ) that device  may no longer be in phone cradle , default functionality may be reengaged for backlighting and phone locking.","It will be appreciated that the ability to monitor the backlight of screen , have it turned on continuously and prevent device locking when in phone cradle  and while driving, may substantially enhance the safety of driving and maximize utilization of mobile communication device. The present invention may free the driver from the need to click on screen  in order to switch it on while driving. Similarly, a driver may no longer be required to unlock device  in order to make a phone call.","In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, APIs may be defined to facilitate interaction with decision unit  by other applications. For example, Applicant has realized that such APIs may enable the present invention to be extended to provide support for Bluetooth devices as well. Bluetooth devices may be used to facilitate \u201chands free\u201d mode when driving by connecting device  to a mounted microphone and\/or speaker. However, similar to screen backlighting, Bluetooth devices typically use relatively large amounts of battery power. Accordingly, decision unit  may be configured to use APIs to turn off Bluetooth devices when device  is not in a cradle\/charge state","Decision unit  may also use such APIs to adjust the modes and settings of device . For example, typical devices  may be configured with multiple usage profiles reflecting default or user selected preferences for use in given operating conditions. Typical examples of such profiles may include: \u201cNormal\u201d, \u201cSilent\u201d, \u201cDriving\u201d, etc. Decision unit  may change the default profile to \u201cDriving\u201d whenever a cradle\/charge state may be detected. Decision unit  may similarly initiate \u201chands free\u201d operation for device  when it is in a cradle\/charge state.","Applicants have also realized it may be convenient to execute a default application in the foreground whenever device  is in a cradle\/charge state. In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, decision unit  may bring driving application  to the foreground whenever a cradle\/charge state may be determined An exemplary driving application  may comprise a display platform for displaying a variety of relevant information while driving, such as car speed, traffic information, traffic camera alert, auto-opening navigation software etc. Accordingly, the present invention may facilitate interaction between the car and its driver\u2014facilitating sending and receiving information from the car, process and display the information communicated and present useful information regarding the car systems.","Driving application  may also function as a specific \u201cdriving\u201d screen, displaying common tasks used for driving. For example, it may be used to detect when a driver has vacated a parking space, or to activate a device camera for \u201chand gesture\u201d operation mode. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/936762, entitled \u201cSystem and method for identifying parking spaces for a community of users\u201d, assigned to the common assignees of the present invention and hereby incorporated in its entirety by reference, may disclose an example of parking space functionality that may be suitable for implementation within the context of driving application . Driving application  may also be used to activate the microphone for voice commands as well as for any other driving related tasks. It may also be used to receive information relevant to the specific location of the driver which might be useful to him\/her.","Applicants have realized that some devices  may not be configured with orientation sensors . However, such devices may have GPS units . In accordance with an alternative preferred embodiment, decision unit  may use input from GPS unit  to determine whether or not device  is moving in a manner consistent with a moving vehicle. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/936762 may disclose a GPS based functionality for identifying movement consistent with a moving vehicle. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/936762 may also disclose a system for generating and\/or accessing maps of known parking spaces in a given locale. Accordingly, decision unit  may use such functionality with input from GPS unit  regarding whether or not device  may be assumed to be in a moving or parked vehicle, thereby to determine whether a driving\/charging state may exist instead of a cradle\/charge state as in the previous embodiments. When a driving\/charging state may be determined, decision unit  may respond in generally the same manner as if a cradle\/charge state were determined","It will be appreciated that regardless of whether or not device  may actually be charging, a generally upright positioning of device  may in any case still be indicative of a situation where it may be convenient for a user to keep the backlight on and\/or disable key locking. For example, device  may be in cradle  but not charging. Alternatively, a user may have purposely propped up device  while using it, for example, to watch a streaming video. In such situations the user may prefer to keep the backlight on regardless of whether or not the device may be charging. Furthermore, a generally upright position may be indicative of charging in a cradle even if a charging process may not be explicitly detected. Therefore, in accordance with an alternative preferred embodiment of the present invention, decision unit  may be configured to prevent sleep mode whenever device  may be in an upright manner even if there may be no explicit indication of charging.","However, it will also be appreciated that there may be situations in which device  may be charging in a generally upright state even though it may not be mounted in a vehicle. For example, a user may charge a device  in a charging stand, or the device may coincidentally be propped up in a generally upright manner while charging. In such situations it may be preferable to leave the settings for backlighting and\/or locking as per a default.","Therefore, in accordance with an alternative embodiment, input from GPS unit  may also be used in combination with input from orientation sensor  to determine whether or not device  may be in a cradle\/charge state. As discussed hereinabove, the GPS based functionality of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/936762 may be employed to determine whether or not a device may be in a moving or parked vehicle. Decision unit  may receive input from such a system and\/or GPS functionality to verify whether or not a detected cradle\/charge state is also consistent with a moving or parked vehicle.","For example, the system and\/or GPS functionality of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/936762 may indicate that device  is stationary in a non-parking spot. In such a situation, decision unit  may not keep backlighting on and\/or disable locking even though it may have otherwise determined that device  was in a cradle\/charge state. If, however, the indication is that device  is stationary in a known parking spot, decision unit  may \u201cassume\u201d that a detected cradle\/charge state may be valid.","Similarly, the system of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/936762 may detect that while indeed device  may be moving, the movement may not be consistent with that of a driver operated automotive vehicle. For example, based on GPS input, it may be determined that device  may be moving along the known route of a train. In such a situation it may not be relevant to keep backlighting on and\/or to disable locking.","Applicant has also realized that device  may be equipped with other functionalities that may be indicative of situations where it may be preferable to prevent sleep mode in device . For example, it may be preferable to prevent sleep mode whenever \u201chands free\u201d mode is active and\/or whenever the default profile may be \u201cDriving\u201d. In accordance with another preferred embodiment of the present invention, decision unit  may keep the backlight on and\/or disable locking whenever \u201chands free\u201d mode and\/or the \u201cDriving\u201d profile are detected. It will be appreciated that as disclosed hereinabove, device  may be configured with APIs that may provide such status information to device .","Unless specifically stated otherwise, as apparent from the preceding discussions, it is appreciated that, throughout the specification, discussions utilizing terms such as \u201cprocessing,\u201d \u201ccomputing,\u201d \u201ccalculating,\u201d \u201cdetermining,\u201d or the like, refer to the action and\/or processes of a computer, computing system, or similar electronic computing device that manipulates and\/or transforms data represented as physical, such as electronic, quantities within the computing system's registers and\/or memories into other data similarly represented as physical quantities within the computing system's memories, registers or other such information storage, transmission or display devices.","Embodiments of the present invention may include apparatus for performing the operations herein. This apparatus may be specially constructed for the desired purposes, or it may comprise a general-purpose computer selectively activated or reconfigured by a computer program stored in the computer.
