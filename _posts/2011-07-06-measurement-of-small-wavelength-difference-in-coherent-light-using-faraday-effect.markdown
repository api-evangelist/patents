No. 13\/134,486 filed Jun. 6, 2011 titled \u201cMagnetic Field Detection Using Faraday Effect\u201d and assigned Navy Case 99670.","The invention described was made in the performance of official duties by one or more employees of the Department of the Navy, and thus, the invention herein may be manufactured, used or licensed by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.","The invention relates generally to detection of small wavelength differences. In particular, this invention relates to a quantum enhanced method for determining small differences in coherent photon wavelengths using weak value amplification of a Faraday Effect.","Detecting the presence of two nearly coincident wavelengths can become necessary for various operations, such as for detection of small Doppler shifts. However, conventional devices and processes exhibit deficiencies in cost and\/or portability.","Conventional wavelength discrimination devices yield disadvantages addressed by various exemplary embodiments of the present invention. Various exemplary embodiments provide an apparatus for determining a target wavelength \u03bb of a target photon beam wavelength \u03bb using a prism composed of a Faraday medium having Verdet value V.","The apparatus includes a photon emitter, a pre-selection polarizer, a prism composed of a Faraday medium, a post-selection polarizer, a detector and an analyzer. The photon emitter projects a monochromatic light beam at the target wavelength \u03bb substantially parallel to a magnetic field having strength B. The target wavelength is offset from established wavelength \u03bb\u2032 as \u03bb=\u03bb\u2032+\u0394\u03bb by wavelength difference of \u0394\u03bb<<\u03bb.","The light beam passes through the pre-selection polarizer and the prism. The beam is incident to an interface surface at incidence angle \u03b8to the normal of the surface and is refracted into a secondary medium as first and second circularly polarized light beams separated by separation angle \u03b4 and having average refraction angle \u03b8. The secondary medium has an index of refraction of n.","The two circularly polarized light beams pass through the post-selection polarizer and reach the detector, which measures target pointer rotation angle Abased on the separation angle \u03b4. The analyzer determines the wavelength difference \u0394\u03bb, first by calculating offset pointer rotation angle \u0394A=A\u2212A\u2032from calibrated pointer rotation angle A\u2032based on the separation angle \u03b8\u2032 that corresponds to the established wavelength \u03bb\u2032, and second by estimating the wavelength difference based on",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0009"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002","num":"00002"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":["\u0394","\u03bb"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}},{"mo":"-","mfrac":{"mrow":[{"mn":"2","mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mi":["\u025b\u03c0","\u0394","cos"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}],"msub":[{"mi":"n","mn":"0"},{"mi":["A","w"]}],"msup":{"mi":["\u03b8","\u2032"]}},{"mi":["VB","sin"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}],"msub":{"mi":"\u03b8","mn":"0"}}]}}],"mo":"\u2248"},"mo":","}}},"br":{}},"In the following detailed description of exemplary embodiments of the invention, reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof, and in which is shown by way of illustration specific exemplary embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention. Other embodiments may be utilized, and logical, mechanical, and other changes may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present invention is defined only by the appended claims.","In accordance with a presently preferred embodiment of the present invention, the components, process steps, and\/or data structures may be implemented using various types of operating systems, computing platforms, computer programs, and\/or general purpose machines. In addition, those of ordinary skill in the art will readily recognize that devices of a less general purpose nature, such as hardwired devices, or the like, may also be used without departing from the scope and spirit of the inventive concepts disclosed herewith. General purpose machines include devices that execute instruction code. A hardwired device may constitute an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) or a floating point gate array (FPGA) or other related component.","This disclosure provides an overview of how a combined application of a recently discovered Faraday effect and weak value amplification can be used to measure \u0394\u03bb=\u03bb\u2212\u03bb\u2032 (thereby detecting \u03bb) when \u03bb\u2032 is known. The methodology has potential spectroscopic utility in such areas as measuring small Doppler shifts and detecting the presence of otherwise indistinguishable chemical or biological spectroscopic markers. Such measurements can be made using either classically intense laser light or single photon streams. For example, let \u03bb and \u03bb\u2032 be two wavelengths such that \u03bb=\u03bb\u2032+\u0394\u03bb with \u0394\u03bb being small.","A longitudinal magnetic field induces a circular differential refraction of a linearly polarized photon beam at the boundary between a Faraday medium and a medium with negligible Verdet constant as reported by A.
