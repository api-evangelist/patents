title: Shared registry with multiple keys for storing preferences and other applications on a local area network
abstract: A method and system for storing and automatic retrieval of data is provided. A “registry” is one way a computer system manages personal preference data such as configuration preferences and other data that users may want specific devices, applications and/or users to access. The present invention enables computer users to use a number of computer devices under essentially any circumstance and allows users and/or applications to provide individualized preference data for each situation. The registry is n-dimensional and data is stored using, for example, an identifier having three or more keys. Other features of the invention, such as wild cards and times tamps, result in a flexible robust registry system.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates generally to computer systems and, more particularly, to systems and methods for storing and retrieving information.","2. Related Art","Computer users today are becoming increasingly sophisticated and demand systems that can provide automatic individualized preferences to any network device they use. On any given day, a computer user may use a number of electronic devices to access, for example, a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN) or the Internet. These electronic devices may include, for example, personal computers (PCs) and Internet appliances such as Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), cellular telephones, web pads, and the like. The user will typically prefer to have each of the devices he or she uses during the day configured in a particular orientation and\/or have access to particular data depending on the device and its location, It would be desirable to have a system that automatically sets personal preferences and allows users to access relevant data when the user moves from device to device in accessing a network such as a LAN, a WAN, the Internet, and the like.","Currently available registry systems such as Microsoft Windows Registry provide computer users one method of setting personal preferences to devices such as PCs. The Windows Registry allows users to store personal preferences relating to applications and device configuration in a particular computer device, or on a network. For example, the Windows Registry allows users to store personal preferences for web-page browsers or device configurations, such as assigning a particular printer to be the default printer for a particular user on a particular device. If the same user goes to another device, unless the user manually sets preferences for each device, his\/her preference settings will not be the same for each device. On the other hand, if the user uses a network registry, the user's preference settings will be the same on all machines even though the user may prefer that each device have a different set up. Thus, the Windows Registry provides users a limited means of storing personal configuration preferences that automatically activate when a user logs on to a particular computer or Internet appliance, or on a network.","The Microsoft Windows Registry may be viewed as being two-dimensional. The Windows Registry has a tree structure with a couple of different roots. As configured, the Windows Registry is only able to identify personal preferences based on a particular application and\/or user. In other words, under Windows Registry, specific configurations or data can only be identified to a particular user or groups of users and\/or a particular application or applications. This may be particularly limiting given the current advancement in computer technology and user behavior in which the user may prefer to have the same computer interface experience regardless of which device or location he is using.","Thus, it would be highly desirable to have a registry system which is three-dimensional or greater, providing more flexibility with automatic preference settings.","A robust, multiple key, data storage system is provided which automatically stores and retrieves data for specific situations. In one embodiment, the data storage system includes a \u201cregistry.\u201d A computer system utilizes the registry to manage personal preference data such as configuration preferences and other data that users may want specific devices, applications and\/or users to access. The present invention enables computer users to use several computer devices and personalize, for example, the user interface of the device and\/or application configurations (as well as other data) based on factors such as user identification, device identification, application identification, location identification, and the like.","One feature of the present invention is that it is n-dimensional. The registry allows users to select data such as interface configuration preferences not only unique to a particular user with a particular application, but also to set user preferences particular to the combination of three or more variables including, for example, user identification, application identification, device identification, location identification, and the like.","Another feature of the present invention is the use of wildcards as variables in the data identifier and timestamps for selecting one data entry from among a number of matches with a data query. Wildcards are floating variables that can take on any key value. Wildcards allow data entries to be associated with any input for a particular variable. Timestamps may act as a multiple match determiner to obtain a single data entry for a single registry inquiry. For example, when preference data is stored in the registry of the present invention, the registry also stores the time that the preference data was stored. This allows the registry to prioritize the various preference data stored in the registry for determining which data entry among a plurality of matches to a data query will be used as the user preference data. In one variation of the invention, the system may search for and eliminate data entries that have been superseded by more recent entries according to the timestamp.","In another embodiment of the present invention, the registry is linked to a local area network (LAN) or wide area network (WAN). Such networks are typically connected to one or more computer devices (e.g., PCs) and\/or Internet appliances (e.g., webpads). The registry may be, for example, a database and may be able to identify a particular preference data associated with a particular combination of variables, for example, user, application, device, and\/or location. In this embodiment, the registry automatically provides specific configuration and data preferences to any device and\/or appliance that the user chooses to utilize on the network.","In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the registry provides configuration and data preferences to various devices located in a home network. Such a registry may be located in, for example, a central computer such as a PC, and be in communication with the devices included in the home network. When users move from device to device, carry a device from one location to another location, and\/or change applications, the registry provides automatic configuration and\/or data preferences that may be specific to those factors (e.g., who the user is, which device the user is utilizing, where the user is utilizing the device, and the like). In still another variation of the present invention, the registry may be incorporated into a network system which has an authority structure and\/or a mirror imaging system such that configuration and data preferences may be located in both a central location as well as in remote locations.","Embodiments of the present invention provide a data storage system that is able to consider an unlimited number of variables when identifying the applicability of stored preference data. These multiple variables, combined with the wildcard and timestamp features, result in a flexible and robust data storage system well suited for a user preference registry.","As the growth in computer use rises and the types of electronic devices that integrate with networks proliferate, the sophistication and needs of electronic device users have resulted in a demand for information and communication systems with greater flexibility. Today, computer users have a \u201cubiquitous\u201d relationship with their computers. On a typical day, a user may utilize a number of computer devices. A hypothetical worker may work for a company headquartered in a large building. His office, which is located in the company building, will have a PC that he uses a number of times throughout a typical day. When he leaves his office to meet other co-workers in another part of the building, he may carry a cellular telephone with Internet access and\/or a personal digital assistant (PDA) that he may want to use when he is out of his office. When he arrives at the meeting place, he may want to access the company's network at the PC located in that meeting room. Each time the worker wants to use one of these computer devices, he may have particular preferences as to how these devices are configured based on how they are used and where they are located. According to the present invention, these preferences may be initially set by the system and\/or user and automatically provided by the system according to a plurality of parameters, for example, user ID, application ID, device ID, location ID, and the like.","For example, a user may want his PDA to have a different homepage depending upon whether he is attending a meeting with his co-workers in a conference room or he is in his office. If he is in the conference room, he may want a home page that is more relevant to his capacity as a company employee. However, while at his office, he may want a more general-purpose home page.","Further, the types of data that a user may want to access may differ depending on his location. For example, the user may want immediate access to personnel files when he is in the human resources department. However, in the accounting department, he might prefer immediate access to revenue or salary information. When the user moves to the production department, he may want access to files relating to production information. Thus, as the user's needs change, depending on where his location in his workplace, his default for immediate data access also changes.","In another example, a user may have several computer devices, such as PCs and Internet appliances, located throughout his or her household. During the course of a typical day, the user may move from room to room, accessing different devices throughout the household. The user's preferences for a user interface and types of data immediately accessible may vary, depending on the device and the location of the user and\/or device. If, for example, the user's Internet appliance is located in the garage, the user may want that Internet appliance to have a home page with an automotive focus. When the user proceeds to the kitchen, the user may have access to a different Internet appliance in the kitchen and prefer a different home page on that Internet appliance. Also, if the user is carrying around a portable Internet appliance such as a PDA or a webpad, the user must manually adjust the appliance for personal preference each time the user moves to a different location in the household. In addition, there are typically multiple computer users in a household. Thus, it would be highly desirable to have a system which can provide personal preferences that are uniquely tailored to the user ID, device ID, application ID, location ID and any number of other parameters.","The \u201cregistry\u201d of a computer system plays the lead role in setting up device and software configuration. For ease of understanding, the examples provided herein show the registry as having a database structure. However, it should be appreciated that the present invention does not require the shared multiple key registry to be configured in a database format.","In general, the present invention provides an n-dimensional shared key registry. One feature of the present invention is that the registry may accommodate an identifier with an unlimited number of keys to identify particular data in the registry. The keys are components of the identifier that identifies particular preference data. Specific preference data may be assigned to a particular identifier having a particular combination of keys.","The registry of the present invention may be, for example, a database that stores \u201cpreference data.\u201d Preference data may be any type of data but is typically device and\/or application configuration information. In other words, the registry may be viewed as a central repository for preference data, e.g., configuration data. Each preference data typically relates to a particular type or types of data needed by one or more applications and are called herein \u201cvalues.\u201d The relationship between the values and the preference data may be best explained by the following example. If the \u201cvalue\u201d is a default home page setting for an Internet browser, then the \u201cpreference data\u201d for the home page value may be Gateway Computer's home page, \u201cwww.gateway.com.\u201d Thus, the \u201cvalue\u201d is a default home page, and one \u201cpreference data\u201d for this default home page value is \u201cwww.gateway.com.\u201d An \u201cidentifier\u201d having a particular combination of \u201ckeys\u201d may identify each preference data. These parameters or \u201ckeys\u201d are also known to those skilled in the art as \u201cdimensions\u201d and may include, for example, user ID, application ID, device ID, location ID, and the like.","The registry may include other features such as \u201ctimestamps\u201d and \u201cwildcards.\u201d The timestamp is a time record stored with preference data, indicating when the preference data was stored, or alternatively, a particular time selected by the system or the user. The timestamp enables the registry system to prioritize different preference data. The wildcard may be used in an identifier and is analogous to a joker in the card game \u201cPoker\u201d, providing flexibility for the registry system to set default preferences. These features will be discussed in more detail below.","The relationship among the identifier, keys, value, preference data and timestamps may be better understood by referring to  illustrating this relationship. An \u201cidentifier\u201d  is composed of keys , ,  and . The identifier  may have an unlimited number of keys (e.g., n-dimensional). Each preference data  is associated with a particular identifier  (having a particular combination of keys , , , and ), value , and timestamp .","Referring to the example shown in , Fred turns on his PC at home and accesses his browser, Microsoft Internet Explorer. The Microsoft Internet Explorer goes to the registry  (as shown in ) to obtain a default home page address. Based on the combination of keys in the n-key identifier, the registry  provides a default home page address, in this case, \u201cwww.gateway.com.\u201d In , user ID \u201cFred\u201d , device ID \u201cPC\u201d , location ID \u201cHome\u201d  and application ID \u201cMicrosoft Explorer\u201d  are the present combination of the component keys for the identifier . The value  sought by the Microsoft Internet Explorer in the registry  is \u201cHomepage\u201d . The registry , based on the identifier information, produces the data , \u201cwww.gateway.com\u201d . Along with the stored data, the registry  may store a timestamp , in this case, a time value  of \u201c00:00:00,\u201d indicating when the data was stored in the registry . To summarize, the keys , , , and  are the components of the identifier . The \u201cvalue\u201d  is what type of preference data the application seeks from the registry . The \u201cdata\u201d  associated with this particular combination of identifier , value , and timestamp  is \u201cwww.gateway.com\u201d .","When the system or the user queries the registry  for preference data having a particular combination of an identifier  and a value , the registry  may only produce one such data even though there may be several preference data  with identifier  and value  combinations matching the inquiry criteria (i.e., multiple matches). The timestamp  is one manner in which the registry  prioritizes multiple matches. For example, the registry  may select the preference data  with the latest timestamp . A more detailed discussion as to how the registry  produces only one preference data  for a particular combination of an identifier  and a value  even though several preference data  may satisfy the inquiry criteria will be discussed in greater detail below.","In another example, a user uses his\/her PDA in the parking lot of his\/her work office building. When the user turns on his\/her PDA and accesses his\/her web browser, the browser looks up the default home page in the registry  so as to display the preferred web site (e.g., the Gateway home page, \u201cwww.gateway.com\u201d), which was previously set by the application or user for situations in which the user was located in his\/her work parking lot. In this case, the present invention provides an n-dimensional registry  that recognizes, for example, the user ID of the user, the device ID of the user's PDA, the location ID of the user's location in the work parking lot, and the application ID of the Microsoft Internet Explorer or other web browser to determine the default home page for the web browser. The Gateway home page that the user sees on his PDA screen is the result of the web browser application accessing the registry to extract the preference data (e.g., \u201cwww.gateway.com\u201d) which corresponds to the n-dimensional identifier provided to the registry. Once the registry (the registry may be remotely located) receives the information relating to the identifier and value, the registry may provide the application with the preference data (e.g., \u201cwww.gateway.com\u201d) associated with the identifier and value. Thus, the present invention provides a means to assign specific configurations and data to specific identifiers (i.e., combinations of keys) and values. In other words, the present invention provides the means to retrieve specific configuration information and\/or data and apply that configuration information and\/or data to specific situations.","The registry may also include another feature called a \u201cwildcard.\u201d The wildcard is analogous to a joker or wild card in the card game \u201cPoker.\u201d It is used in the identifier and is a key that may take on any key value. For example, if a particular preference data has a wildcard for the user ID key, then that preference data may apply to any user. Similarly, if a wildcard is used for the device ID and\/or location ID keys, the preference data may apply towards all devices and\/or locations.","The registry may further include the use of \u201ctimestamps.\u201d The timestamp is a time record stored with the preference data, indicating when the preference data was stored, or alternatively, a particular time selected by the system or the user. The timestamp is one manner in which the registry system prioritizes different preference data. The timestamp becomes important when more than one record in the registry satisfies a set of particular registry inquiry criteria based on a particular identifier (i.e., combination of keys) and value. The system is configured so that it selects only one registry record per set of inquiry criteria by selecting the record and its preference data having the highest timestamp.","The importance of the timestamp may be best illustrated by the following example. When an inquiry is made to the registry seeking a record that matches a particular identifier (i.e., combination of keys) and value, the registry searches for all records that match the inquiry criteria (i.e., the specific combination of keys, wildcards, and\/or value). Often, there may be two or more records that satisfy such an inquiry. For example, a record corresponding to a system or application default setting, and a record corresponding to a user setting or personal preference entered by a particular user, may both satisfy the inquiry criteria. Although the identifier for both the default setting and the user setting may satisfy the inquiry criteria, they will likely have different time stamps. This will result in the registry system preferring to select one setting over the other setting. For example, the default setting may have a timestamp of zero, while the user setting may have a timestamp greater than zero. The registry will pick the record (and its preference data) corresponding to the user setting because it has the greater timestamp value. Thus, the timestamp provides a method for prioritizing registry records having an identifier and value combination that match the registry inquiry.","Another way of using timestamps is for the user to set a timestamp at a high or infinite value. By doing so, the user may create preference data that cannot be \u201cdefeated\u201d or overwritten by subsequently stored data having an identifier and value combination that will match the same query. Thus, timestamps provide a way of creating a hierarchy for preference data.","In preferred embodiments of the present invention, memory space in the registry may be more efficiently utilized in several manners. For example, the registry may use wildcards and be stored as a sparse array structure. By using wildcards, default settings may be efficiently set for users not listed in the registry or for users listed in the registry but having no preferences. As another example, superseded preference data may be deleted, thus freeing up memory space. A method for deleting one preference data if it has been superseded by another preference data having a later timestamp is illustrated in  and will be discussed below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["210","220","200","210","210","210","220","220","230","240","242","244","240","244","246","248","242","242","200","250"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["301","310","330","335","310","310","320","325","320","325","325","335","310","337","332","337","332","301","332","320","310"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["200","301","301","200","310","355","350","200","200","355","350","200","310","355","200","355","355"]},"In any case, the preference data stored in the registry ( and\/or ) includes device and data preferences for a specific combination of user ID, device ID, location ID and\/or application ID keys. During the course of a typical day, a user may access a number of Internet appliances  and\/or computer devices  in the user's home . For example, the user may access the computer device , Computer , in the parents' bedroom when the user wakes up in the morning. The registry (e.g.,  or ) automatically provides configuration or preference data to the computer device  according to the application ID, device ID (computer device ), user ID, and\/or location ID. For example, when the user activates a browser and logs on to the Internet using the computer device , the registry ( or ) provides data to automatically configure the computer device  to the user's personal preferences based on the user ID, device ID, application ID and\/or location ID (e.g., the user may prefer his\/her home page to be \u201cwww.gateway.com\u201d while the user is in the parents' bedroom).","While still in the parents' bedroom, the user may also decide to pick up a mobile Internet appliance, such as a PDA. The PDA may also have as its home page in the parents' bedroom the same home page as the computer device , Computer , based almost on the same key combination (e.g., user ID equal to \u201cuser,\u201d location equal to \u201cparents' bedroom,\u201d and the device ID equal to \u201cPDA\u201d instead of \u201cPC\u201d). On the other hand, the user may prefer a different home page for the different devices, or a different home page regardless of which device the user is utilizing depending instead on the user's location. Thus, the user may set his preferences such that once the user leaves the parents' bedroom and carries his PDA into other rooms in the house , the personal preferences (e.g., default home page) for the PDA may change because the location ID key will change.","For example, if the user moves from the parents' bedroom to the garage, the user's home page for the PDA may change from \u201cwww.gateway.com\u201d to something more appropriate for the garage, such as the web page for the American Automobile Association, \u201cwww.AAA.com.\u201d Later, the user may move into the kitchen still carrying his\/her PDA, and the home page on the PDA may change again, for example, to something more oriented towards cooking such as Julia Child's homepage, \u201cwww.juliachilds.com.\u201d Thus, the user's Internet browser home page for the PDA may differ based on changes to the location ID key depending on the user's preferences stored in the registry (e.g.,  or ).","The user's spouse may also have his or her own personal preferences for each application, device and\/or location in the house . For example, after the user finishes utilizing the computer device , Computer , in the parents' bedroom, the spouse may access the same computer device , Computer , and log on to the Internet using the same browser. Based on the key information (e.g., user ID, application ID, device ID, location, and the like) provided to the registry , the spouse's home page may be different from the user's home page. The spouse's home page in the parents' bedroom may be \u201cwww.netscape.com.\u201d When the spouse moves to the living room and uses the master computer  to access the Internet, the spouse may see a different home page on the master computer  based on the information provided to the registry (e.g.,  or ) (e.g., user ID=spouse, application ID =Netscape Navigator, device=master computer and location=Living Room).","Another more detailed exemplary embodiment will now be used to explain how the registry of the present invention stores and retrieve data with reference to . For purposes of understanding, this discussion will utilize a three-dimensional (three-key) registry. The three dimensions (keys) considered will be \u201cuser,\u201d \u201cdevice\u201d and \u201clocation.\u201d The \u201cvalue\u201d (i.e., the information type) that will be set and sought in this example again is \u201chome page\u201d for a web browser (e.g., Microsoft Explorer). However, it is understood that another value, such as the design of the \u201cbackground\u201d of the desktop screen, or any other value may have been used. It is also understood that the values in this system may be treated (and actually are in this embodiment) as simply another dimension or key. The only difference between the values and any other keys is that wildcards are not typically used for the values. This is because typically it does not make sense for an application to ask for a non-qualified or specific type of value. A wildcard in this case would not return any useful information. In any case, in the present example, both wildcards and timestamps will be included to provide an exemplary illustration of the roles that these features may play in the invention. The timestamps posted in this example are provided in human readable times, and for the purposes of this example, have been made for the same date.","For convenience in this example, the registry will be included as part of a system referred to herein as the personal storage area (herein \u201cPSA\u201d). In general, the PSA is an application programming interface (API), i.e., a software service that applications use to request and carry out lower-level services performed by an operating system. In the following example, two \u201cfunction calls\u201d are used to interact with the PSA system\u2014one will set the values (SetData) and one will get the values (GetData). The actual system may have more functions (such as enumeration type functions), but they are not needed to understand the storage scheme of the registry and the PSA. In this example, the SetData function accepts five parameters\u2014user, device, location, value, and data. The GetData function takes four parameters\u2014user, device, location and value. GetData retrieves the data related to or identified by these dimensions and provides it to the application needing the information. Assuming that each parameter has its own data type, the prototypes of these two functions look like this:","SetData (User user, Device device, Location location, Value value, Data data)","Data GetData (User user, Device device, Location location, Key key)","Referring to , this example illustrates a series of steps, showing records in the registry and the state of the PSA system when a particular set of data is stored or sought. A \u201crecord\u201d is a related set of variables that may comprise keys, a value, preference data, a timestamp, and the like. For example, in , the row which includes Fred, PC, Home, homepage, www.gateway.com, and 00:00:00 makes up a record. Since the PSA is an API for other applications to use, these steps show only one way of how the system may function. The example has two users \u201cFred\u201d and \u201cBarney,\u201d and two devices called \u201cwebpad\u201d and \u201cpc\u201d, which represent a web pad device and a PC.","Typically when the present invention is implemented, it would be preferred to have default settings for the various applications. That is, in Step 1 of the following example, we set a default value for every user on every device, in every location. These default settings may be initially entered into the registry when an application, such as the web browser Microsoft Internet Explorer, is installed on the system or device. Alternatively, these default settings may be set with a registry-specific user interface. Further, the particular users \u201cFred\u201d and \u201cBarney\u201d and\/or devices \u201cwebpad\u201d and \u201cpc\u201d may not initially exist in the registry. Various steps in the operation of storing and getting preference data from the registry will now be explained.\n\n","SetData (\u201cBarney\u201d, \u201c*\u201d, \u201c*\u201d, \u201chomepage\u201d, \u201cwww.tomshardware.com\u201d)\n\n","It is now important to note an optimization that the PSA may use. The second record  will never be found again, as the timestamp  for the newest record  will always cause its entry to be found. In one variation of the invention, the PSA system may thus remove the second record  from the registry.  illustrates how the registry of the PSA looks like after the PSA internally removes that record .","Although it might seem as though additional entries might be removed as a result of the creation of the record  (e.g., the first two fields in the first row  and second row ), it is important to note that, while some entries are currently not used for any users or devices, they are still defaults for new users, if such new users or devices are added, as shown by Step 9. The method for deleting old preference data will be illustrated in a flow chart (see ) and discussed in more detail below.\n\n","Referring to , the flow chart illustrates a method for storing new preference data, as well as deleting old preference data superseded by the new preference data, together with the identifier (a set of keys such as user ID, device ID, and the like) and the value (e.g., homepage) associated with the preference data in a shared multiple key registry. The present invention provides for an n-dimensional (i.e., unlimited dimensional) registry that may store various types of preference data, such as device and application configurations. Specifically, the flow diagram illustrated in  applies to a four-dimensional or four-key registry. In this illustration, the four key fields are device ID, user ID, application ID, and location ID.","The flowchart in  does not illustrate the situation in which preference data stored in the registry  may immediately become a candidate for deletion. This situation may occur, for example, if the user is allowed to alter the timestamp when storing the preference data in the registry . A system administrator may store data in the registry  with a \u201cmaximum timestamp\u201d so that the data may never be overwritten. Thus, any data subsequently stored in the registry with the same identifier and value may never be found because its timestamp is less than the maximum timestamp. It should be appreciated that, while the method illustrated in  does not handle this situation, the method may be easily modified by one skilled in the art to handle this situation.","Referring to , the registry obtains the identifier (user ID, application ID, device ID and location), the value, and the preference data to be stored, and then stores these fields into a new record (same format as the SetData function call described above) at step . The registry system then checks to see if there are any current records that may be removed because the new record has superseded them. Next, if there are records presently in the registry, the system copies the first record in the registry (i.e., the entry in the registry containing already stored preference data and its associated value and identifier information) to a field called curRecord at step . At step , the registry system determines whether the record in the curRecord is valid. This step is done for determining whether the registry system has run through the entire database and is at the end of the database. If the record in the curRecord is invalid, then the registry recognizes that it has reached the end of the database and proceeds to store the new preference data with its associated value and identifier information (i.e., the data obtained in step ) at step .","If the record in the curRecord is valid, then the PSA system checks to see if the identifier field for the curRecord matches the identifier field of the new record obtained in step . This check is accomplished by comparing each key field of the curRecord identifier to each key field of the new record identifier in steps  to . If each key field of the curRecord identifier matches or is a wildcard for each key field of the new record identifier, then the record corresponding to the curRecord will be deleted from the database at step . If any of the key fields do not match, then this method continues record-by-record through the registry database at steps  and  and then  through  until all current records in the database have been checked for being superseded by the new record. Upon loading another record into the curRecord, the PSA system goes back to the beginning of the entire method described above by first checking to see if the record in the curRecord is valid or invalid at step . Of course, the step of actually recording the new data, as obtained by step , will not be completed at step  until all the old records having the same identifier as the new record are deleted. Although the process for deleting superseded records is shown as including five steps, one skilled in the art would understand that it may be achieved with a single step comparing all the key fields of the identifier at one time.","At step , the PSA system creates a new record in the database by copying the information obtained in step  into the database and setting the timestamp to, for example, the current time. In summary, the flow chart of  shows a PSA system that first, in steps  to  runs through the registry records and deletes all the old records that are superseded by the new record being added to the registry, before the new record is stored. These steps are not needed, but may be used to assist the system in saving memory space.","Referring to , the flow chart illustrates a method for retrieving preference data corresponding to a particular identifier and value from the registry. Again, although the present invention provides for an n-dimensional (i.e., unlimited dimensional) registry, the flow chart in  shows a method for a four-dimensional or four-key registry. In this example, the four key fields are device ID, user ID, application ID, and location ID.","At step , the PSA system receives the identifier and value information provided by a computer device, such as for example, an Internet appliance or PC. Next at step , the PSA system retrieves a first record in the registry (i.e., the first record in the registry that contains previously stored preference data and its associated value and identifier information) and copies it to a record called curRecord. Further, the PSA system sets a variable called data to null and a variable called newest equal to zero. Next at decision step , the PSA system checks to see if the process has finished looking through all the entries in the registry. If the curRecord field is valid at step  (indicating that the PSA system has not reached the end of the database), then the system moves to step .","Steps  to  compare the identifier (e.g., the four device ID, user ID, application ID and location ID keys) and the value fields obtained in step  to the corresponding fields in the curRecord record that is downloaded in step  or . If the key fields and value field obtained in step  match the key fields and value field of the curRecord through decision steps  to , then the system checks to see if the timestamp in the curRecord record is greater than the timestamp stored in the variable newest at step . If the timestamp in the curRecord record is greater than the timestamp in newest, then the system replaces the old record in the data variable with the record in the curRecord, and sets the variable newest to curRecord's timestamp field at step . Upon completion of step , the system loads the curRecord record with the next record in the registry database, and the entire process of checking the validity of the record and comparing the identifier and value information obtained in step  to the identifier and value fields in the curRecord is executed again. Similarly as discussed above with respect to , these steps illustrated in  may be consolidated into a single step query to the registry.","Eventually, the PSA system will reach the end of the database, which the system will know by finding an invalid curRecord record at step . If an invalid curRecord record is found, the system has completed its review of the entire registry database and provides a return equivalent to the record in the data variable. If there is a null value in the data variable, no match for the identifier and value obtained in step  was found, and the system provides a return which indicates this condition. Therefore, the PSA system preferably finds a single record in the registry which matches the identifier and value fields provided in step  and is the most recent entry in the registry, and returns from this record the data needed to set, for example, the user's preferences.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0089"},"figref":"FIG. 7A","b":["710","715","715","720","730","740"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0090"},"figref":["FIG. 7B","FIG. 7A","FIG. 7B"],"b":["750","750","710","750","775","750","755","750","760","765","755","760","765","750"]},"Other embodiments of the present invention are also possible. For example, all of the previously mentioned embodiments were directed to a three or four-dimensional (key) shared key registry. The embodiments described were characterized by their keys (e.g., user ID, device ID, application ID and location ID). However, the present invention provides for a multiple key registry (in fact, an n-dimensional registry) incorporating more and\/or different dimensions (keys). For example, seasons (e.g., fall, winter, spring, and summer) may be another dimension. Other possible dimensions include days of the week, time of the day, and the like. For example, configuration and data preferences may depend on the day of the week or time of day. Furthermore, device ID keys may also be expanded. For example, devices may be distinguished by various characteristics, for example, models, types (e.g., PC versus PDA), brands, and the like. Moreover, the user may designate that a particular preference be applied not only to one particular device, user, application, and\/or location, but also to more than one and\/or all devices, users, applications, and\/or locations. The registry structure is flexible so that a user may be even more specific (i.e., higher dimensional) when specifying when a preference and its related data are applicable. Those skilled in the art will recognize that any number of key combinations is possible using the n-dimensional approach of the present invention.","The present invention's flexible registry system may also be capable of providing automatic dissemination of many types of information for very specific situations. For example, Internet appliances located in the kitchen of the residence  (as shown in ) may be such items as toasters, coffee makers, etc. A user, for example, may want these devices to have access to certain types of data primarily designed for other applications such as a personal calendar application. The data for a personal calendar application may be highly relevant to the Internet appliances in the kitchen. For example, a toaster and a coffee maker may be set so that they are turned on and off depending on the user's schedule according to his\/her calendar application data.","The present invention may also include an authority structure and levels, which would prevent certain users from accessing certain data from certain devices and\/or locations. For example, the user and spouse may limit what their children may access through their PC , Computer , in the children's bedroom. Similar to a system manager authority, the user and the spouse may set up the registry in the master computer such that their children are unable to access adult home pages which the user and spouse may access in their bedroom. Thus, the present invention provides for a registry system that provides individualized configuration settings for specific situations as defined by unlimited key parameters such as user ID, application ID, device ID, location ID, and the like.","Although various embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described, it will be understood that it is not intended to limit the invention to the preferred embodiments and it will be obvious to those skilled in the art that various changes and modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. Thus, the invention is intended to cover alternatives, modifications, and equivalents, which may be included within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the claims."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIGS. 4A through 4I"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIGS. 7A and 7B"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
