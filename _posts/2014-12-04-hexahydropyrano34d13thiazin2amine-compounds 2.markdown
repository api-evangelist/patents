No. 13\/596,208, filed on Aug. 28, 2012, which claims benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61\/529,367, filed on Aug. 31, 2011, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.","The present inventions relate to small molecule inhibitors of \u03b2-site amyloid precursor protein (APP) Cleaving Enzyme 1 (BACE 1) and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts. This invention relates to inhibiting, in mammals, including humans, the production of A-beta peptides that can contribute to the formation of neurological deposits of amyloid protein. The present invention also relates to the treatment of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative and\/or neurological disorders in mammals, including humans. More particularly, this invention relates to thioamidine compounds useful for the treatment of neurodegenerative and\/or neurological disorders, such as AD and Down's Syndrome, related to A-beta peptide production.","Dementia results from a wide variety of distinctive pathological processes. The most common pathological processes causing dementia are AD, cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CM) and prion-mediated diseases (see, e.g., Haan et al., Clin. Neurol. Neurosurg. 1990, 92(4):305-310; Glenner et al., J. Neurol. Sci. 1989, 94:1-28). AD is a progressive, neurodegenerative disorder characterized by memory impairment and cognitive dysfunction. AD affects nearly half of all people past the age of 85, the most rapidly growing portion of the United States population. As such, the number of AD patients in the United States is expected to increase from about 4 million to about 14 million by 2050.","Aminodihydrothiazine or thioamidine compounds are described in WO 2010\/038686 as useful inhibitors of the \u03b2-secretase enzyme. Described therein are also certain compounds that are intermediates to the aminodihydrothiazine compounds. Surprisingly, Applicants determined that at least some of these intermediates are brain-penetrable BACE inhibitors and as such would be expected to be BACE inhibitors and modulators for the treatment of AD and other neurodegenerative diseases (see Olsen et al., Ann. Rep. Med. Chem. 2007, 42:27-47). Accordingly, the present invention is directed to the use of these compounds in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, including AD. The invention is also directed to novel thioamidine compounds and their use in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, including AD.","The invention is directed to compounds, including the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, having the structure of formula I:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0006"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"41.91mm","wi":"56.13mm","file":"US09550795-20170124-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{}},"Ris hydrogen, Calkyl, Calkenyl or \u2014(C(RR))(Ccycloalkyl);

For example, the compounds of the invention, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, may exist in unsolvated and solvated forms. When the solvent or water is tightly bound, the complex will have a well-defined stoichiometry independent of humidity. When, however, the solvent or water is weakly bound, as in channel solvates and hygroscopic compounds, the water\/solvent content will be dependent on humidity and drying conditions. In such cases, non-stoichiometry will be the norm.","The compounds of the invention may exist as clathrates or other complexes. Included within the scope of the invention are complexes such as clathrates, drug-host inclusion complexes wherein, in contrast to the aforementioned solvates, the drug and host are present in stoichiometric or non-stoichiometric amounts. Also included are complexes of the compounds of the invention containing two or more organic and\/or inorganic components which may be in stoichiometric or non-stoichiometric amounts. The resulting complexes may be ionized, partially ionized, or non-ionized. For a review of such complexes, see J. Pharm. Sci., 64 (8), 1269-1288 by Haleblian (August 1975).","The compounds of the invention have asymmetric carbon atoms. The carbon-carbon bonds of the compounds of the invention may be depicted herein using a solid line (-), a solid wedge () or a dotted wedge (). The use of a solid line to depict bonds to asymmetric carbon atoms is meant to indicate that all possible stereoisomers (e.g., specific enantiomers, racemic mixtures, etc.) at that carbon atom are included. The use of either a solid or dotted wedge to depict bonds to asymmetric carbon atoms is meant to indicate that only the stereoisomer shown is meant to be included. It is possible that compounds of Formula I may contain more than one asymmetric carbon atom. In those compounds, the use of a solid line to depict bonds to asymmetric carbon atoms is meant to indicate that all possible stereoisomers are meant to be included. For example, unless stated otherwise, it is intended that the compounds of Formula I can exist as enantiomers and diastereomers or as racemates and mixtures thereof. The use of a solid line to depict bonds to one or more asymmetric carbon atoms in a compound of Formula I and the use of a solid or dotted wedge to depict bonds to other asymmetric carbon atoms in the same compound is meant to indicate that a mixture of diastereomers is present.","Stereoisomers of Formula I include cis and trans isomers, optical isomers such as R and S enantiomers, diastereomers, geometric isomers, rotational isomers, conformational isomers, and tautomers of the compounds of the invention, including compounds exhibiting more than one type of isomerism; and mixtures thereof (such as racemates and diastereomeric pairs). Also included are acid addition or base addition salts wherein the counterion is optically active, for example, D-lactate or L-lysine, or racemic, for example, DL-tartrate or DL-arginine.","When any racemate crystallizes, crystals of two different types are possible. The first type is the racemic compound (true racemate) referred to above wherein one homogeneous form of crystal is produced containing both enantiomers in equimolar amounts. The second type is the racemic mixture or conglomerate wherein two forms of crystal are produced in equimolar amounts each comprising a single enantiomer.","The present invention comprises the tautomeric forms of compounds of the invention Where structural isomers are interconvertible via a low energy barrier, tautomeric isomerism (\u2018tautomerism\u2019) can occur. This can take the form of proton tautomerism in compounds of the invention containing, for example, an imino, keto, or oxime group, or so-called valence tautomerism in compounds which contain an aromatic moiety. It follows that a single compound may exhibit more than one type of isomerism. The various ratios of the tautomers in solid and liquid form is dependent on the various substituents on the molecule as well as the particular crystallization technique used to isolate a compound.","The compounds of this invention may be used in the form of salts derived from inorganic or organic acids. Depending on the particular compound, a salt of the compound may be advantageous due to one or more of the salt's physical properties, such as enhanced pharmaceutical stability in differing temperatures and humidities, or a desirable solubility in water or oil. In some instances, a salt of a compound also may be used as an aid in the isolation, purification, and\/or resolution of the compound.","Where a salt is intended to be administered to a patient (as opposed to, for example, being used in an in vitro context), the salt preferably is pharmaceutically acceptable. The term \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable salt\u201d refers to a salt prepared by combining a compound of formula I with an acid whose anion, or a base whose cation, is generally considered suitable for human consumption. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts are particularly useful as products of the methods of the present invention because of their greater aqueous solubility relative to the parent compound. For use in medicine, the salts of the compounds of this invention are non-toxic \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable salts.\u201d Salts encompassed within the term \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable salts\u201d refer to non-toxic salts of the compounds of this invention which are generally prepared by reacting the free base with a suitable organic or inorganic acid.","Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of the compounds of the present invention when possible include those derived from inorganic acids, such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, hydrofluoric, boric, fluoroboric, phosphoric, metaphosphoric, nitric, carbonic, sulfonic, and sulfuric acids, and organic acids such as acetic, benzenesulfonic, benzoic, citric, ethanesulfonic, fumaric, gluconic, glycolic, isothionic, lactic, lactobionic, maleic, malic, methanesulfonic, trifluoromethanesulfonic, succinic, toluenesulfonic, tartaric, and trifluoroacetic acids.

In another embodiment, base salts are formed from bases which form non-toxic salts, including aluminum, arginine, benzathine, choline, diethylamine, diolamine, glycine, lysine, meglumine, olamine, tromethamine and zinc salts.","Organic salts may be made from secondary, tertiary or quaternary amine salts, such as tromethamine, diethylamine, N,N\u2032-dibenzylethylenediamine, chloroprocaine, choline, diethanolamine, ethylenediamine, meglumine (N-methylglucamine), and procaine. Basic nitrogen-containing groups may be quaternized with agents such as lower alkyl (C-C) halides (e.g., methyl, ethyl, propyl, and butyl chlorides, bromides, and iodides), dialkyl sulfates (i.e., dimethyl, diethyl, dibuytl, and diamyl sulfates), long chain halides (e.g., decyl, lauryl, myristyl, and stearyl chlorides, bromides, and iodides), arylalkyl halides (e.g., benzyl and phenethyl bromides), and others.","In one embodiment, hemisalts of acids and bases may also be formed, for example, hemisulfate and hemicalcium salts.","Also within the scope of the present invention are so-called \u201cprodrugs\u201d of the compound of the invention. Thus, certain derivatives of the compound of the invention which may have little or no pharmacological activity themselves can, when administered into or onto the body, be converted into the compound of the invention having the desired activity, for example, by hydrolytic cleavage. Such derivatives are referred to as \u201cprodrugs.\u201d Further information on the use of prodrugs may be found in \u201cPro-drugs as Novel Delivery Systems, Vol. 14, ACS Symposium Series (T. Higuchi and W. Stella) and \u201cBioreversible Carriers in Drug Design,\u201d Pergamon Press, 1987 (ed. E. B. Roche, American Pharmaceutical Association). Prodrugs in accordance with the invention can, for example, be produced by replacing appropriate functionalities present in the compounds of any of formula I with certain moieties known to those skilled in the art as \u201cpro-moieties\u201d as described, for example, in \u201cDesign of Prodrugs\u201d by H Bundgaard (Elsevier, 1985).","The present invention also includes isotopically labeled compounds, which are identical to those recited in formula I, but for the fact that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of the present invention include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, fluorine and chlorine, such as H, H, C, C, C, N, O, O, P, S, F, and Cl, respectively. Compounds of the present invention, prodrugs thereof, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts of said compounds or of said prodrugs which contain the aforementioned isotopes and\/or other isotopes of other atoms are within the scope of this invention. Certain isotopically labeled compounds of the present invention, for example those into which radioactive isotopes such as H and C are incorporated, are useful in drug and\/or substrate tissue distribution assays. Tritiated, i.e., H, and carbon-14, i.e., C, isotopes are particularly preferred for their ease of preparation and detectability. Further, substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium, i.e., H, can afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements and, hence, may be preferred in some circumstances. Isotopically labeled compounds of formula I of this invention and prodrugs thereof can generally be prepared by carrying out the procedures disclosed in the Schemes and\/or in the Examples and Preparations below, by substituting a readily available isotopically labeled reagent for a non-isotopically labeled reagent.","Typically, a compound of the invention is administered in an amount effective to treat a condition as described herein.

Alternatively, pharmaceutically acceptable salts are suitable for medical applications because of their greater aqueous solubility relative to the parent compound.","In another embodiment, the present invention comprises pharmaceutical compositions. Such pharmaceutical compositions comprise a compound of the invention presented with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The carrier can be a solid, a liquid, or both, and may be formulated with the compound as a unit-dose composition, for example, a tablet, which can contain from 0.05% to 95% by weight of the active compounds. A compound of the invention may be coupled with suitable polymers as targetable drug carriers. Other pharmacologically active substances can also be present.","The compounds of the present invention may be administered by any suitable route, preferably in the form of a pharmaceutical composition adapted to such a route, and in a dose effective for the treatment intended.

The BACE1 enzyme is affinity purified material from conditioned media of CHO-K1 cells that have been transfected with a soluble BACE construct (BACE1deltaTM96His). Compounds are incubated in a \u00bd log dose response curve from a top concentration of 100 \u03bcM with BACE1 enzyme and the biotinylated fluorescent peptide in 384-well black plates (Thermo Scientific #4318). BACE1 is at a final concentration of 0.1 nM with a final concentration of peptide substrate of 150 nM in a reaction volume of 30 \u03bcL assay buffer (100 mM Sodium Acetate, pH 4.5 (brought to pH with acetic acid), and 0.001% Tween-20). Plates are covered and incubated for 3 hours at 37\u00b0 C. The reaction is stopped with the addition of 30 \u03bcL of 1.5 \u03bcM Streptavidin (Pierce, #21125). After a 10 minute incubation at room temperature, plates are read on a PerkinElmer Envision for fluorescent polarization (Ex485 nm\/Em530 nm). The activity of the beta-secretase enzyme is detected by changes in the fluorescence polarization that occur when the substrate is cleaved by the enzyme.
