abstract: A hand-held ultrasound system includes integrated electronics within an ergonomic housing. The electronics includes control circuitry, beamforming and circuitry transducer drive circuitry. The electronics communicate with a host computer using an industry standard high speed serial bus. The ultrasonic imaging system is operable on a standard, commercially available, user computing device without specific hardware modifications, and is adapted to interface with an external application without modification to the ultrasonic imaging system to allow a user to gather ultrasonic data on a standard user computing device such as a PC, and employ the data so gathered via an independent external application without requiring a custom system, expensive hardware modifications, or system rebuilds. An integrated interface program allows such ultrasonic data to be invoked by a variety of such external applications having access to the integrated interface program via a standard, predetermined platform such as visual basic or c++.

No. 6,530,887 and claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60\/140,430, filed on Jun. 22, 1999, the entire contents of the above applications being incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.","Conventional ultrasound imaging systems typically include a hand-held probe coupled by cables to a large rack-mounted console processing and display unit. The probe typically includes an array of ultrasonic transducers which transmit ultrasonic energy into a region being examined and receive reflected ultrasonic energy returning from the region. The transducers convert the received ultrasonic energy into low-level electrical signals which are transferred over the cable to the processing unit. The processing unit applies appropriate beam forming techniques to combine the signals from the transducers to generate an image of the region of interest.","Typical conventional ultrasound systems include a transducer array each transducer being associated with its own processing circuitry located in the console processing unit. The processing circuitry typically includes driver circuits which, in the transmit mode, send precisely timed drive pulses to the transducer to initiate transmission of the ultrasonic signal. These transmit timing pulses are forwarded from the console processing unit along the cable to the scan head. In the receive mode, beamforming circuits of the processing circuitry introduce the appropriate delay into each low-level electrical signal from the transducers to dynamically focus the signals such that an accurate image can subsequently be generated.","In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention, provides for further improvements in portable ultrasound medical imaging systems developed for use with personal computers. In one embodiment the control circuitry and beamforming circuitry are localized in a portable assembly. Such an integrated package simplifies the cable requirements of the assembly, without adding significant weight.","Traditional ultrasonic imaging systems have been dedicated systems having specialized hardware for processing the large amounts of data generated by ultrasonic transducers providing input to such systems. These imaging systems tend to be unwieldy, expensive, and difficult to upgrade. Further, since dedicated systems have specialized components, it is difficult to employ the gathered ultrasound data in other contexts, such as by downloading to another application for processing and\/or operations which are unavailable on the native dedicated system. Accordingly, it is beneficial to provide an ultrasonic imaging system operable on a standard, commercially available, user computing device without specific hardware modifications, and adapted to interface with an external application without modification to the ultrasonic imaging system. In this manner, a user may gather ultrasonic data on a standard user computing device such as a personal computer (PC), and employ the data so gathered via an independent external application without requiring a custom system, expensive hardware modifications, or system rebuilds.","A system and method for gathering ultrasonic data on a standard user computing device and employing the data via an integrated interface program allows such ultrasonic data to be invoked by a variety of external applications having access to the integrated interface program via a standard, predetermined platform such as visual basic or c++.","The system provides external application integration in an ultrasonic imaging system by defining an ultrasonic application server for performing ultrasonic operations. An integrated interface program with a plurality of entry points into the ultrasonic application server is defined. The entry points are operable to access each of the ultrasonic operations. An external application sends a command indicative of at least one of the ultrasonic operations. The command is transmitted via the integrated interface program to the ultrasonic application server. Concurrently, at periodic intervals, raw ultrasonic data indicative of ultrasonic image information is received by the ultrasonic application server over a predetermined communication interface. A result corresponding to the command is computed by the ultrasonic application server, and transmitted to the external application by the integrated interface program.","An embodiment of the invention includes a probe having a plurality of circuit boards or circuit panels that are mounted within a generally rectangular cavity within a hand-held housing. The circuit panels each have one or more integrated circuits and are mounted in planes that are parallel to one another. These integrated circuits can be fabricated using a standard CMOS process that support voltage levels between 3.3 V and 200 V.","A particular embodiment of the invention utilizes two or three circuit boards or panels, a center panel having a center system controller and a communication link to an external processor. The center panel can be mounted between a pair of surrounding panels, each including a memory and a beamforming circuit. The system accommodates the use of different probe elements and can employ a variable power supply that is adjusted to different levels for different probes. Also, it is desirable to use a variable clock generator so that different frequencies can be selected for different probes.","Another preferred embodiment of the invention provides a small probe that is connected by a first cable to an interface-housing. The interface housing can contain the beamformer device and associated circuits and is a small light weight unit that can be held in one hand by the user while the other hand manipulates the probe. The probe can be any of several conventional probes that can be interchangeably connected by cable to the interface housing. Alternatively, the interface housing can be worn on the body of the user with a strap, on the forearm or the waist with a belt, for example, or in a pocket of the user. A preferred embodiment using such an interface can include two or three circuit boards as described in greater detail herein. The interface housing is connected to a personal computer by standard FireWire or serial bus connection.","In another preferred embodiment, the probe incorporating the beamformer, or the probe with the interface housing can be connected to a wearable personal computer. In this embodiment, the computer performing scan conversion, post signal processing or color doppler processing is located in a housing worn by the user, such as on the forearm, on the waist or in a pocket. A power supply board can be inserted into the probe, into the interface housing or in another external pod and can include a DC-DC converter. The display system can also include a head mounted display. A hand-held controller can be connected to the computer or interface by wire or wireless connection.","A preferred embodiment of the invention can utilize certain safety features including circuits that a check the power supply voltage level, that test every channel of the beamformer and assists in setting gain levels, that counts pulses per second and automatically shuts off the system to prevent over-radiating of the patient.","Another preferred embodiment of the invention employs the use of dedicated controls that the user can employ to perform specific tasks during a patient study. These controls are readily accessible and intuitive in use. These controls provide for freezing or unfreezing of the image on the display, for recording an image in electronic memory, to measure distances in two dimensions using a marker or caliper and a \u201cset\u201d function fix two markers or calipers on screen, a track ball, touchpad or other manually manipulated element to control the marker, a time gain compensation control, such as 8 slide pots, to correct for sound attenuation in the body, scale or depth control to provide a zoom feature and for selection of focal zones.","The system can be employed with a number of probe systems and imaging methods. These include the generation of color Doppler, power Doppler and spectral density studies. These studies can be aided by the use of contrast agents that are introduced into the body during a study to enhance the response to ultrasound signals. Such agents can also include medications that are acoustically released into the body when they are activated by specific acoustic signals generated by the probe transducer array.","In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, a system for ultrasonic imaging includes a probe and a computing device. The probe has a transducer array, and a control circuitry and a digital communication control circuit. The control circuitry includes a transmit\/receive module, beamforming module and a system controller. A computing device connects to the digital communication control circuit of the probe with a communication interface. The computer processes display data.","The communication interface between the probe and the computing device is a wireless interface in several embodiments. In an embodiment, the wireless is a radio frequency (RF) interface. In another embodiment, the wireless interface is an infrared interface (IR). In an alternative embodiment, the communication interface between the probe and the computing device is a wired link.","In a preferred embodiment, the beamforming module is a charge domain processor beamforming module. The control circuitry has a pre-amp\/time-gain compensation (TGC) module.","A supplemental display device is connected to the computing device by a second communication interface. The supplemental display device is a computing device in several embodiments. At least one of the communication interfaces is a wireless interface.","In an embodiment, the communication between the probe and the computing device is a wireless interface. The second communication interface between the supplemental display device and the computing device is wireless. In an embodiment, the second communication interface includes a hub to connect a plurality of secondary supplemental devices.","In another preferred embodiment, the ultrasonic imaging system includes a handheld probe system which is in communication with a remotely located computing device. The computing device can be a handheld portable information device such as a personal digital assistant provided by Compaq or Palm, Inc. The communication link between the probe and the computing device is a wireless link such as, but not limited to, IEEE 1394 (FireWire). The computing device may be used for controlling, monitoring or displaying ultrasonic imaging data.","A method of controlling an ultrasonic imaging system from a unitary operating position facilitates ultrasonic image processing by defining ultrasonic imaging operations and defining a range of values corresponding to each of the ultrasonic imaging operations. An operator then selects, via a first control, one of the ultrasonic imaging operations, and then selects, via a second control, a parameter in the range of values corresponding to the selected ultrasonic imaging operation. The ultrasonic imaging system applies the selected ultrasonic imaging operation employing the selected parameter. In this manner, the operator produces the desired ultrasonic image processing results by employing both the first control and the second control from a common operating position from one hand, thereby allowing the operator to continue scanning with a free hand while continuing to control the ultrasonic imaging system.","The ultrasonic imaging system is controlled from a control keypad accessible from one hand of the operator, or user. The other hand of the operator may therefore be employed in manipulating an ultrasonic probe attached to the ultrasonic imaging system for gathering ultrasonic data employed in the ultrasonic imaging operations. The first control allows qualitative selection of the various ultrasonic imaging operations which may be invoked using the system. The second control allows quantitative selection of parameters along a range to be employed in the ultrasonic operation. The range of parameters may be a continuum, or may be a series of discrete values along the range. The control keypad includes two keys for scrolling through the qualitative ultrasonic operations, and two keys for selecting the quantitative parameters along the corresponding range.","The ultrasonic imaging system in accordance with preferred embodiments may be used for patient monitoring systems such as bedside monitoring system, pacemaker monitoring, for providing image guided implants, and pacemaker implantation. Further, preferred embodiments of the systems of the present invention may be used for cardiac rhythm management, for radiation therapy systems and for image guided surgery, such as, but not limited to, image guided neurosurgery, breast biopsy and computer enabled surgery.","The ultrasonic imaging operations which may be invoked include scanning operations, to be applied to live, real time ultrasonic image gathering, and processing operations, which may be applied to live or frozen ultrasonic images. Typical scanning ultrasonic imaging operations which are known to those skilled in the art and which may be applied by the ultrasonic imaging system include size, depth, focus, gain, Time Gain Compensation (TGC) and TGC lock. Typical processing ultrasonic operations imaging include view, inversion, palette, smoothing, persistence, map, and contrast.","Preferred embodiments of the present invention include control and data transfer methods that allow a third party Windows\u00ae based application to control, for example, a portable Windows\u00ae based ultrasound system by running the ultrasound application as a background task, sending control commands to the ultrasound application server and receiving images (data) in return. Further, the embodiment configures a portable ultrasound Windows\u00ae based application as a server of live ultrasound image frames supplying another Windows\u00ae based application that acts as a client. This client application receives these ultrasound image frames and processes them further. In addition, an alternate embodiment configures the portable ultrasound Windows\u00ae based application as a server, interacting with a third party client application via two communication mechanisms, for example, a component object model (COM) automation interface used by third party, hereinafter referred to as an external application or a client to startup and control the portable ultrasound Windows\u00ae based application and a high-speed shared memory interface to deliver live ultrasound images.","A preferred embodiment includes and configures a shared memory interface to act as a streaming video interface between a portable Windows\u00ae based Ultrasound application and another third party Windows\u00ae based application. This streaming video interface is designed to provide ultrasound images to a third party client in real-time.","A preferred embodiment allows the third party Windows\u00ae based application to control the flow rate of images from the portable ultrasound Windows\u00ae based application through the shared memory interface within the same PC platform and the amount of memory required to implement this interface. These controls consist of a way to set the number of image buffers, the size of each buffer and the rate of image transfer. This flow rate control can be set for zero data loss thus ensuring that every frame is delivered to the third party Windows\u00ae Windows based application from the ultrasound system, or minimum latency thus delivering the latest frame generated by ultrasound system to the third party Windows\u00ae based application first.","A preferred embodiment formats the ultrasound image frame such that probe, spatial, and temporal information can be interpreted by the third party Windows\u00ae based application as it retrieves the images (generated by the portable ultrasound Windows\u00ae based application) from the shared memory interface. The actual image data passed between the server (i.e. portable ultrasound application) and the client application (third party Windows\u00ae based application) is a Microsoft\u00ae device independent bitmap (DIB) with 8 bit pixels and a 256 entry color table. The image frame also contains a header that provides the following additional information, for example, but not limited to, Probe Type, Probe Serial Number, Frame Sequence Number, Frame Rate, Frame Timestamp, Frame Trigger Timestamp, Image Width (in pixels), Image Height (in pixels), Pixel Size (in X and Y), Pixel Origin (x,y location of the first pixel in image relative to the Transducer Head, and Direction (spatial direction along or across each line of the image).","Further, the preferred embodiment controls the shared memory interface used to transfer ultrasound images between a Windows\u00ae based portable ultrasound system and a third party Windows\u00ae based system through the use of ActiveX\u00ae controls. The Windows\u00ae based portable ultrasound application contains an ActiveX\u00ae control that transfers a frame into the shared memory and sends out a Windows\u00ae Event (that includes a pointer to the frame just written) to the third party Windows\u00ae based application. This third party application has a similar ActiveX\u00ae control that receives this Event and pulls the image frame out of shared memory.","In accordance with a preferred embodiment the present invention includes a method for providing streaming video in an ultrasonic imaging system including providing an ultrasonic application server having at least one ultrasonic operation and corresponding ultrasonic data. The method further includes sending, from an external application, a command indicative of one of the ultrasonic operations, executing in the ultrasonic application server, a result corresponding to the commands and sending data from the ultrasonic server to the external application. A shared memory is in communication with the ultrasonic application server and the external application. The method further includes an integrated interface program having a plurality of entry points into the application server, transmitting via the integrated interface program a command to the ultrasonic application server, receiving over a predetermined communication interface, ultrasonic data indicative of ultrasonic image formation and transmitting the result to the external application via the integrated interface program.","The integrated interface program is adapted to transmit real-time imaging data including ultrasonic imaging for radiation therapy planning and treatment, minimally invasive and robotic surgery methods including biopsy procedures, invasive procedures such as catheter introduction for diagnostic and therapeutic angiography, fetal imaging, cardiac imaging, vascular imaging, imaging during endoscopic procedures, imaging for telemedicine applications, imaging for veterinary applications, cryotherapy and ultrasound elastography.","In preferred embodiments, the streaming video includes radio frequency data, real-time image data and transformation parameters. The external application can reside on the same computing device as the ultrasonic application server or be resident on a different computing device. The external application communicates with the ultrasonic application server using a control program using a component object model automation interface and a shared memory interface.","The command in the method for providing streaming video includes operations selected from the group consisting of an ultrasound application initialization\/shutdown functions such as, for example, start ultrasound application, load preset files, exit application; ultrasound setup functions such as, for example, set shared memory parameters, initialize communication to shared memory, set image frame size, set shared memory size, set transfer priority (for low latency, high throughput, or first in, first out), set image resolution and format; and ultrasound image capture functions such as, for example, freeze live data, fetch live data, and resume live imaging.","The ultrasonic application server includes a graphical user interface having image control presets which are operable to store image settings. The image settings include application controls such as, for example, image mode, patient name, patient ID; B-mode controls, for example, size, depth, focus, TGC, change examination type; M-mode controls, for example, sweep speed, scan line position; image quality controls, for example, brightness, contrast, invert, palette, smoothing persistence; and Doppler controls, for example, color region of interest, pulse repetition rate, wall filter, steering angle, color gain, color invert, color priority, color baseline and line density control.","The foregoing and other objects, features and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following more particular description of preferred embodiments of the invention, as illustrated in the accompanying drawings in which like reference characters refer to the same parts throughout the different views. The drawings are not necessarily to scale, emphasis instead being placed upon illustrating the principles of the invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0094","num":"0093"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["1","3","5","9","3","10","12","14","16","18","15","16","3","5","40","40","3","20"]},"The components in the portable ultrasound system require a continuous source of data for correct operation. For instance, the beamformer  requires steering data, the transmit circuitry  requires data to instruct it where to focus the next pulse and when to fire, and the TGC  needs to know what gain level is appropriate at the given time. Additionally, further information may be required synchronous to the scanning operation to control how the beamformed data is sent back to the host. For instance, a DATAVALID signal can be helpful to reduce the amount of data that the host  actually link  can be a wireless connection such as an infrared (IR) link. The probe  thus includes a communications chipset .","The components in the portable ultrasound system require a continuous source of data for correct operation.

Along with data, the various parts of the ultrasound system relies on common synchronization for the system to work in harmony. For example, the transmitter must be fired at an exact time with respect to when the beamformer is looking at a particular position.","Engineering goals of the ultrasonic probe include small size, thermal management, low-power consumption, and the capability and flexibility to allow efficient high resolution imaging as well as calibration and experimentation. The small size and low-power operation implies dense storage. The capability and flexibility entails the ability to use irregular firing sequences, concurrent reprogramming and use for seamless adaptive beamforming modes, as well as full flexibility to perform debugging and complete-set imaging. Ergonomic, economic portable design also requires a cost-effective, non-encumbering connection between the scan head  and the PC host .

Each analog circuit board A, B includes a respective transmit\/receive chip A, B; a preamp\/TGC chip A, B; a beamformer chip A, B; all of which are interconnected with a pair of the memory chips A-, B-, A-, B- via an operational bus A, B.

A frequency impulse response (FIR) filter  processes the resulting imaging signal, which is digitized by the analog-to-digital (A\/D) converter . In a particular embodiment of the invention, both the FIR filter  and the A\/D converter  are fabricated on chip with the beamforming processors .","The choice of a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) implementation as well as extensibility for ease of modification, points to the use of VRAMs for the memory modules. VRAM is a standard Dynamic RAM (DRAM) with an additional higher-speed serial access port. While DRAM has two basic operations, for example, read and write memory location, VRAM adds a third operation: transfer block to serial readout register. This transfers a block (typically 128 or 256 words) of data to the serial readout register which can then be clocked out at a constant rate without further tying up the DRAM core. Thus refresh, random access data read\/write, and sequential readout can operate concurrently. Alternate embodiments may include a synchronous Dynamic Ram (synchDRAM) memory.","In the probe \u2032, dual-ported operation is beneficial so the data loading performed by the host  can be decoupled from data sent to memory modules. A modular architecture which allows additional VRAMs to be added in order to obtain additional bandwidth is useful, particularly when the exact data rate requirements may change. Using wide memories, the data does not have to be buffered before going to the various destination modules in the system. A particular embodiment uses five 256K word by 16 bit VRAMs which yields a total of 80 output lines. If fewer output lines are required, VRAM a first embodiment. However, a further preferred embodiment uses SDRAM to provide further improvements in the speed and capacity of the system.","The control circuitry, as shown in , is embodied in a digital circuit board . The digital circuit board  includes a FireWire chipset , a system control chip  to control the scan head, and a memory chip . In a particular embodiment of the invention, the memory chip  is a VRAM chip and the system control chip  is interconnected to the various memory chips ,  over a control bus , which in this particular application is 16 bits wide.","As illustrated, the system control chip  provides scan head control signals to be transmit\/receive chips A, B over respective signal lines A, B. The transmit\/receive chips A, B energize the transducer array  over transmit lines A, B. Received energy from the transducer array  is provided to the transmit\/receive chips A, B over receive lines A, B. The received signals are provided to the pre-amp\/TGC chips A, B. After being amplified, the signals are provided to the beamformer chips A, B. Control signals are exchanged between the beamformer and the system controller over signal lines A, B to adjust the scan beam.","The five VRAM chips A-, A-, B-, B-,  serve to supply the real-time control data needed by the various operating modules. The term \u201coperating modules\u201d refers to the different parts of the system that require control data\u2014namely the beamformers A, B, transmit\/receive chips A, B, and preamp\/TGC chips A, B. The system controller  maintains proper clocking and operation of the VRAM to assure continuous data output. Additionally, it generates clocks and control signals for the various operating modules of the system so that they know when the data present at the DRAM serial port output is for them. Finally, it also interfaces with the host (PC)  via a PC communications protocol (e.g., FireWire or high speed bus) to allow the host  to write data into the VRAM.","Some of the VRAMs are shared by multiple modules. The 64-bit output of four VRAMs A-, A-, B-, B- is used by both the transmit module as well as the beamformer. This is not a problem, because typically only one requires data at any given time. Additionally, the transmit module chip uses relatively less data and thus it is wasteful to have to dedicate entire VRAMs for transmit operations. In order to allow the VRAM data to be shared by multiple modules, codes are embedded in the VRAM data that the controller deciphers and asserts the appropriate MODCLOCK line.","The fifth VRAM  is used to generate data that is not shared by multiple modules. For example, it is convenient to put the control for the TGC here because that data is required concurrently with beamformer data. It can also be useful to have one dedicated control bit which indicates when valid data is available from the beamformer and another bit indicating frame boundaries. Thus, because the location of the data in the VRAM corresponds to the position in the frame scanning sequence, additional bits are synchronized with the operation of the system. CCD clock enable signals can also be generated to gate the CCD clock to conserve power. Lastly, the VRAM can be used to generate test data for a D\/A converter to test the analog circuitry with known waveforms.","As the system is reduced in size, the number of VRAMs may be reduced. In a SDRAM system clocked twice as fast, the four shared VRAM chips may be merged into two SDRAM chips in a 128 line system, for example.","The data sent to the beamformer and transmit modules are bit-serial within a channel, with all channels being available in parallel. For the transmit module, two transmit channels share each bit line with alternating clocks strobing in data for the two channels. All per channel transmit module coefficients (such as start time) are presented bit-serially.","The data in the VRAM is organized into runs. A run consists of a one word header, which is interpreted by the VRAM controller, followed by zero or more actual data words which are used by the various modules. The headers (see Table 1) specify where the data in the run is destined, how fast it should be clocked out, and how many values there are in the run. (Note that the run destination is only for the data coming out of the 4 VRAMs. The bits coming out of the controller VRAM always have the same destinations.) The headers are also used to encode the special instructions for Jump, Pause, and End described below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0118","num":"0117"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"280pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE

data in the VRAM are read out basically sequentially but some variations are allowed to reduce the memory requirements and facilitate system operation based on several observations about how the ultrasound system operates.","The first observation is that the peak control data rate requirements are far higher than the average rates needed. This is because, during close zone imaging, the focus may be updated at every clock to maintain maximal sharpness. However, for deep zones approaching the far field, the focusing parameters need not vary very quickly. Thus the data maybe supplied at a lower rate. This is accomplished by the use of a 2-bit RATE field associated with each run (see Table 2). The RATE field allows the specified run to be clocked out at either the full system clock rate (which can be 8-32 MHZ), one-half, one-quarter, or one-eighth of that rate.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0121","num":"0120"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 2"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Rate Field Definitions"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"98pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"70pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":["Rate",{},{}]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"98pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"70pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Bit 12","Bit 11","Data Meaning","Pause Length"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["0","0","New Data Every Clock","PauseCount Clock"]},{"entry":["0","1","New Data Every Other Clock","PauseCount*2 Clocks"]},{"entry":["1","0","New Data Every 4 Clocks","PauseCount* Clocks"]},{"entry":["1","1","New Data Every 8 Clocks","PauseCount*8 Clocks"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"The next observation is that there are often large gaps during which time data is not required. After a transmit pulse is fired into a deep zone, a relatively large amount of time can pass before its echo is received and the beamformer is activated. Thus it is advantageous to not have to waste VRAM space for work time periods. For this reason, explicit pause commands are allowed. When the system controller  receives a pause command, it waits the specified number of clock cycles before reading the next word in the VRAM memory. The PAUSECOUNT is an 11 bit number which can take on the range 1-2047. This is additionally scaled by the RATE field to allow pauses of up to 16376 (2047*8) system clock cycles. Note that the RATE field can only take on the values 0, 2 and 3 because a pause of RATE 1 is interpreted as a wait command, described next. This is not a problem, however, because typically only RATE 0 is used for maximum wait accuracy (to within one clock) and RATE 3 is used for maximum wait time (up to 16376 clock cycles).","Because the data from the beamformer  has to be sent back to the host  over a bandwidth-constrained link, buffering and flow-control are required to prevent data loss. The buffering is achieved by a 16K by 18 FIFO while the flow control is achieved by feeding the FIFO fullness indication back to the system controller . In this way, if the FIFO becomes too full, the scanning stops until the FIFO has been emptied. However, the scanning should not stop arbitrarily because it is timed with the propagation of the sound waves. Thus explicit synchronization points can be inserted into the code, and at these points the controller waits until the FIFO is empty enough to proceed safely. The wait command is used to indicate these synchronization points. The wait command causes the controller to wait until the WAITPROCEED line is high. In one embodiment, this is connected (via the aux FPGA) to the \u201cnot half-full\u201d indicator on the FIFO. Thus the wait commands can be placed at least every 8K data-generating cycles to assure that data overflow cannot occur. Because this is greater than one ultrasound line, it still allows multi-line interleaving to be used.","The next command is the jump command. This allows non-sequential traversal through the VRAM memory. This is employed so that the VRAM memory can be modified concurrently with the readout operation and also to make it easier to add and remove variable size control sequences. To understand why this is useful, consider the following example: Imagine that one wants to change the data in VRAM locations - while continuing operation of the scanning using the other locations. If the host were to just modify locations -, there is no guarantee that they will not be used exactly when they are in the middle of being modified. Thus the data would be in an indeterminate state and can lead to an erroneous sequence. However, if location  is first modified to be a jump to location , and locations to - are then modified to their new values, and location  is then finally modified to its new value, this race condition cannot occur. (Assuming that it is not reading locations - at the start of the modifications but blank regions can be left to get around this.) Additionally \u201csubroutines\u201d (which can only be used once per scan due to the fact that the return is coded as an absolute jump) can be used to allow easy change of the scan sequence.","A jump always takes 128 cycles to execute because the system controller has to load this new start address into the VRAMs and transfer the new row of data to the serial shift register. This typically takes only about 25 cycles, but because other parts of the system controller may have access to the VRAM (such as the refresh or host controller), a safe upper bound is used to maintain a fixed delay.","The last command is the end command. This is used at the end of the sequence for a frame to tell the system controller that the frame has completed. The controller then stops fetching instructions until it is restarted (from location ) by host if it is in single-frame mode. If it is in continuous mode then it will start immediately on the next frame. (After 128 cycles required for the implied jump ).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0127","num":"0126"},"figref":["FIG. 5A","FIG. 3A"],"b":["218","282","284","286","288","288","288","288"]},"Additionally the arbiter  sends the host controller  a RELREQ or relinquish request signal to ask the host controller  to give up ownership of the DRAM core because some other section wants it. Note that only the host  controller needs to be asked to relinquish the bus because the readout controller  and refresh controller  both only use the DRAM core for fixed short intervals. The host controller , however, can hold on to the DRAM as long as there is data coming over the FireWire to be written into the DRAM, so it needs to be told when to temporarily stop transferring data.","Note that the serial section of the VRAMs is not multiplexed\u2014it is always controlled by the readout controller . The VRAM serial data also only goes to the readout controller .","The readout controller  controls the sequencing of the data out the VRAMs' serial access ports. This involves parsing the data headers to determine what locations should be read, clocking the VRAM Serial Clock at the correct time, driving the module control lines, and also arranging for the proper data from the VRAM's DRAM core to be transferred into the serial access memory.","The host controller  is the part of the VRAM Controller that interfaces to the host  via FireWire to allow the host to write into the VRAM. When the host wants to write into the VRAM, it sends asynchronous packets specifying which VRAM and which addresses to modify as well as the new data to write. The host controller  then asks the arbiter  for access to the VRAM. When the DRAM core is not in use by either the readout  or refresh  controller, the arbiter  grants control to the host controller . The host controller  then takes care of address and control signal generation. When the whole packet has been decoded, the host controller  releases its request line giving up the DRAM control, allowing the other two sections to use it.","The refresh controller  is responsible for periodically generating refresh cycles to keep the DRAM core of the VRAM from losing its data. The refresh controller  has its own counter to keep track of when it needs to request a refresh. Once it gains access to the VRAMs via the arbiter , it generates one refresh cycle for each of the VRAMs sequentially. This reduces the amount of spikes on the DRAM power supply lines as compared to refreshing all 5 VRAMs in parallel.","The REFRATE inputs control how many system clock cycles occur between refresh cycles.

Only one section may have access to the DRAM port of the VRAM at any given time. The arbiter  does not reassign control of the VRAM to another section until the section with control relinquishes it by de-asserting its IN_USE line. The sections are prioritized with the Readout Controller  getting the highest priority and the host controller  getting the lowest priority. The reasoning is that if the readout controller  needs access to the VRAM, but does not get it, then the system may break down as the serial output data will be incorrect. The refresh controller  can tolerate occasional delay, although it should not happen much. Finally, the host controller  can potentially tolerate very long delays because the host can be kept waiting without too many consequences except that the writing of the VRAM may take longer.","A highly capable, yet cost-effective and physically non-encumbering connection between the scan head and host computer is possible using the FireWire standard (also known as IEEE 1394). The FireWire standard is used for multimedia equipment and allows 100-200 Mbps and preferably in the range of 400-800 Mbps operation over an inexpensive 6 wire cable. Power is also provided on two of the six wires so that the FireWire cable is the only necessary electrical connection to the probe head. A power source such as a battery or IEEE1394 hub can be used. The FireWire protocol provides both isochronous communication for transferring high-rate, low-latency video data as well as asynchronous, reliable communication that can be used for configuration and control of the peripherals as well as obtaining status information from them. Several chipsets are available to interface custom systems to the FireWire bus. Additionally, PCI-to-FireWire chipsets and boards are currently available to complete the other end of the head-to-host connection. CardBus-to-FireWire boards can also be used.","Although the VRAM controller directly controls the ultrasound scan head, higher level control, initialization, and data processing and display comes from a general purpose host such as a desktop PC, laptop, or palmtop computer. The display can include a touchscreen capability. The host writes the VRAM data via the VRAM Controller. This is performed both at initialization as well as whenever any parameters change (such as number or positions of zones, or types of scan head) requiring a different scanning pattern. During routine operation when data is just being continually read from the scan head with the same scanning parameters, the host need not write to the VRAM. Because the VRAM controller also tracks where in the scan pattern it is, it can perform the packetization to mark frame boundaries in the data that goes back to the host. The control of additional functions such as power-down modes and querying of buttons or dial on the head can also be performed via the FireWire connection.","Although FireWire chipsets manage electrical and low-level protocol interface to the FireWire interface, the system controller has to manage the interface to the FireWire chipset as well as handling higher level FireWire protocol issues such as decoding asynchronous packets and keeping frames from spanning isochronous packet boundaries.","Asynchronous data transfer occurs at anytime and is asynchronous with respect to the image data. Asynchronous data transfers take the form of a write or read request from one node to another. The writes and reads are to a specific range of locations in the target node's address space. The address space can be 48 bits. The individual asynchronous packet lengths are limited to 1024 bytes for 200 Mbps operation. Both reads and writes are supported by the system controller. Asynchronous writes are used to allow the host to modify the VRAM data as well as a control word in the controller which can alter the operation mode. Asynchronous reads are used to query a configuration ROM (in the system controller FPGA) and can also be used to query external registers or I\/O such as a \u201cpause\u201d button. The configuration ROMs contain a querible \u201cunique ID\u201d which can be used to differentiate the probe heads as well as allow node-lockings of certain software features based on a key.","Using isochronous transfers, a node reserves a specified amount of bandwidth, and it gets guaranteed low-overhead bursts of link access every 1\/8000 second. All image data from the head to the host is sent via isochronous packets.

Note that these are how the packets are passed on by the TI LINK controller chip. The difference between this and the format over the wire is that the CRCs are stripped and the speed code (spd) and acknowledgment code (ackSent) are appended to the end.

The payload data is little endian and thus need not be converted if written by an Intel PC host.

The ISO Packet Length has to be set in the controller to allow it to correctly format the ISO packets back to the host via FireWire. An explicit counter in the system controller is used due to the fact that the TI GPLynx chip does not assert the end-of-packet indication until one word too late.

A value of 6 means resp_type_error indicating that some field of the packet was invalid or unsupported. In this case, if the request was a block request then the dataLength of the response packet must be 0 and no data should be included. A resp_type_error is returned if the dataLength or destinationOffsetLow of the request packet were not multiples of 4 or if the dataLength was not between 4 and 32 (for block packets).

The longest request the Adaptec device drivers should request is 8 quadlets because that is the length of the configuration ROM. In any case, it is assumed that if a long transfer failed, it falls back to a smaller request.","The FireWire specification expects each FireWire node to have a configuration ROM that contains various details about the device, its requirements, and its capabilities. This ROM is to be queried via Read Request packets. There are two types of ROM implementations: a minimal ROM and a general ROM. The former has only one quadlet (4-byte) piece of data indicating a 24-bit vendor DD. The general ROM has many other fields, and many which are optional ranging from the ASCII name of the vendor and device to its power consumption and how to access its capabilities.","One of the required fields in a general ROM is a node unique ID. This consists of the 24-bit vendor ID and a 40-bit chip ID. The 40-bit chip-ID is up to the vendor to assign such that all nodes have unique values. The node unique ID's are required to keep a consistent handle on the device if the FireWire bus is reset or reconfigured during operation. When a device is first opened, the application reads its configuration ROM and determines if it wants to work with it. If so it records its node unique ID and opens a connection to the device via that node unique ID. This is then at any given time mapped to its FireWire ID (16-bit) by the host adapter and its device driver. If the topology changes or a FireWire bus reset occurs, the node's FireWire ID can change, however the node unique ID will not. Thus, in such an event, the adapter automatically determines the new FireWire ID and continues. Thus for smooth operation, particularly with multiple heads attached to the system, implementing node unique IDs and the configuration ROM is required.","The configuration ROM is divided into several sections. The sections of particular interest are the first word, which defines the length and CRC of the ROM, the next 4 words comprising the Bus_Info_Block, which gives some fixed 1394-specific information (such as Node Unique ID), and the last 3 words representing the Root Directory which is a set of key-value tagged entries. Only the two required key-value pairs are included the ROM built into the FPGA. An 8-word ROM that can be used is shown in Table 13.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0172","num":"0174"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00013","num":"00013"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"371pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE

the probehead-to-host communication of beamformed data. This is conceptually a stream of 16-bit numbers punctuated by frame markers. The frame markers are important to keep in sync with where in the frame the data corresponds. While some ultrasound systems use elaborate frame and line markers embedded in the data, the integrated system can use a single auxiliary bit, which is not sent as part of the data, to mark frame boundaries. Line boundaries can be derived by knowing the VRAM sequencing program.","While asynchronous packets can be sent at will and do not have any guarantee of bandwidth availability, isochronous packets can be used as low-overhead way to send a guaranteed rate of data. Once a peripheral reserves a specified amount of bandwidth, it gets guaranteed bursts of link access every 1\/8000 second. All data from the head to the host is sent via isochronous packets. Because isochronous packets are limited to 1\/8000 second, this is a frame of data. The FireWire specification describes the use of synchronization bits which can be used to tag each isochronous packet with a 4 bit SYNC code. The Adaptec FireWire-to-PCI bridge can then use the Sync field to assure proper frame alignment. However, the TI GPLynx Controller chip only supports frame-level granularity of when to send packets and not packet level so when the System Controller tells the FireWire link chip it has data, it must be prepared to send a whole frame of data. Because the FIFO is much smaller than a frame, a sage option is to reduce the effective FireWire frame size to one packet. Then a specific Beginning of Frame (BOF) code in the high byte of the first word of every ultrasound frame and force the start of ultrasound frames to occur at the beginning of FireWire frames (and packets) and do frame-level synchronization in the Ultrasound application software. For efficiency, a full ultrasound frame of data can still be read in one FireWire call (and hence one interrupt).","There are three steps in setting up for Isochronous head-to-host data transfers. These initialization steps need only be performed once per probe initialization.","The first step is to reserve isochronous bandwidth. This reservation causes a central record of the request (in the FireWire isochronous cycle manager node) to be kept to assure that the total bandwidth allocated does not exceed the total bandwidth of the link. For example, this reservation is achieved using the Adaptec API BusConfig 0 command with Cmd field set to P_ALLOCATE_RESOURCE. A requested payload in bytes is passed in. This can be the amount of data desired in every 1\/8000 second. Setting this value too high simply wastes reserved bandwidth on the FireWire interface which is not a problem if there is only one device. Setting this value too low may constrain the head-to-host data rate. No overflows or data loss are likely to occur, the scanning may simply proceed slower. The resource allocation call will return both an isochronous channel number as well as the payload size granted. This payload size granted may be less than that requested if part of the link has already been reserved.","The next step is to set the system controller ISO packet length word to tell how long of an ISO packet to expect.","The final step is to initialize the probehead LINK chip. This is done via the writeback to LINK chip asynchronous packets described above. In particular, initializing registers , , and is necessary. The probehead can then be told to start sequencing and the data will flow back.","If multiple probes are connected to the system then the isochronous bandwidth reservation can take place once but at any given time, only one probe's isochronous transmission (as well as its sequencing) is enabled.","As previously described, isochronous data transfers are used to deliver the probe head data to the host. Maintaining frame synchronization is necessary. The FireWire will support sub-frame packetization of about 3000 bytes but it is up to the system controller to implement frame synchronization on top of this. Synchronization is achieved via two methods:","1. The high byte of the first word in the first packet of a frame is set to the Beginning of Frame (BOF) code. (This can be set in the system controller Mode word).","2. All frames are padded to consume a whole number of packets.","When these two are combined, they guarantee that frame synchronization will be maintained if the correct number of packets are read at a time and the resynchronization can be effected by just scanning the high-byte of the first word of each packet in the data stream.","An example packetization is shown in Table 14. This depicts 4 packets of 4 words (8 bytes) apiece showing one complete ultrasound frame and the first packet of the next frame. The ultrasound frame size is 10 words. As can be seen, the Hi byte of the first word is set to the BOF code. This can be examined to assure that proper synchronization has been maintained. The data is then split into the three packets -. Because the frame ends in the middle of packet , the end of packet  is padded with the BOF code in the high word. Importantly, this means that the first word of the fourth packet will be the first word of the second frame even though the ultrasound frame size is not a multiple of the packet size.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0185","num":"0187"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00014","num":"00014"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 14"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Example Packetization of Isochronous"},{"entry":"Head-to-Host Data"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"63pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"70pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Packet","Word","Lo Byte","Hi Byte"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"1","1","Data 1 Lo","BOF"]},{"entry":[{},"(Frame 1)","2","Data 2 Lo","Data 2 Hi"]},{"entry":[{},{},"3","Data 3 Lo","Data 3 Hi"]},{"entry":[{},{},"4","Data 4 Lo","Data 4 Hi"]},{"entry":[{},"2","1","Data 5 Lo","Data 5 Hi"]},{"entry":[{},"(Frame 1)","2","Data 6 Lo","Data 6 Hi"]},{"entry":[{},{},"3","Data 7 Lo","Data 7 Hi"]},{"entry":[{},{},"4","Data 8 Lo","Data 8 Hi"]},{"entry":[{},"3","1","Data 9 Lo","Data 9 Hi"]},{"entry":[{},"(Frame 1)","2","Data 10 Lo","Data 10 Hi"]},{"entry":[{},{},"3","Data 1 Lo","BOF"]},{"entry":[{},{},"4","Data 1 Lo","BOF"]},{"entry":[{},"4","1","Data 1 Lo","BOF"]},{"entry":[{},"(Frame 2)","2","Data 3 Lo","Data 2 Hi"]},{"entry":[{},{},"3","Data 3 Lo","Data 3 Hi"]},{"entry":[{},{},"4"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}}},"The TSB12LV31 (or 32) performs packetization of the isochronous data but informs the system controller of packet boundaries via the ISORST signal. The system controller then uses this to reset its internal word-to-byte multiplexer as well as packetization circuitry. If it receives a frame marker from the FIFO then stops clocking data out of the FIFO until it receive a ISORST pulse.","The module interface defines how the various modules in the system are controlled by the VRAM controller. There are two types of modules, those that receive data from the four VRAMs which are shared (two on each analog board), and those that receive data from the VRAM on the digital board, (via the VRAM controller) which is dedicated. The two types of modules use different control signals to synchronize their operation.","Much of the timing depends on the speed of the runs of the module (shared\/dedicated VRAM usage.)  shows typical timing for the different module interfacing modes for a typical program sequence.","As previously stated, VRAMDATA, the data from the loopback VRAM, control the execution. The diagonal shaded boxes denote header data used by the VRAM controller while the shaded boxes denote module data in . The data in the four other VRAMs go to the modules. The data from the first VRAM is looped back into the system controller and then used for dedicated data supply for things like the TGC, feedback control, etc.","In clocks - in  a run of data at a rate 1\/1 destined for module . The header is clocked out at clock . The pulse of NEWRUNCLOCK at clock  lets the modules know that the next clock will be the first in a run. They thus reset their internal run-related state if necessary. The data is clocked out during clocks , , and . Since the data is destined for module , the MODCLOCK is pulsed once per new data word. Module  should latch the data at VRAMDATA on the rising edge of MODCLOCK.","Note that the access and hold times of the VRAM (Tand Tin ) must be observed carefully. Since the access time of the VRAM is 15 ns-25 ns depending on the speed grade the hold time can be as low as 4 ns, this does not leave a lot of margin when operating at data no earlier than T-Tbefore the rising edge of their module clock. (Any skew between SC and the MODCLOCK tightens this bound accordingly but due to the way the VRAM controller was designed to generate both signals as gated clocks from the same MASTERCLK the skew is minimal assuming that the loading conditions are not too dissimilar.) given a master clock frequency of 33 MHz and the fast VRAM, this gives 15 ns slack. Using the slower VRAMs gives 5 ns slack.","The modules accepting data at the full rate must additionally make sure that they do not latch the data more than Tafter the rising clock. This is because the same clock is used to retrieve the next words from the VRAM. Thus in general modules should make sure to delay the data inputs at least as much as they delay the clock inputs to effectively clock at or before the rising edge of their module clock. This second constraint does not exist when \u00bd, \u00bc, or \u215b rate data is used.","Since the first example is of 1\/1 rate data, the MODULEFASTCLOCK signal follows the MODULECLOCK line. They will only differ when \u00bd, \u00bc, or \u215b rate data is used.","Clocks - show a run of length 2 at rate \u00bc","destined for Module . Thus new data will be clocked out of the VRAMs only once every 4master clock. Here MODULEFASTCLOCK will exhibit different behavior than MODULECLOCK. Again the NEWRUNCLOCK at clock  signals that a new run is beginning on the next clock cycle. During clock , the VRAM controller has latched the header data indicating that the next run is for module  at a rate of \u00bc. Also during clock , the VRAM generates the module data that the module will use. At clock , a MODCLOCK occurs, telling module  to latch in and use the VRAM's data. Note that the data will present until the master clock before the next MODCLOCK.","Although MODCLOCK is only clocked once per new data word, MODULEFASTCLOCK is clocked once per master clock for the duration of the run. This is useful for modules, such as the beamformer which may only need data at a lower rate but need to perform computation at the full rate. The MODNEWDATA signal can also be used by modules using the MODFASTCLOCK lines to determine on which of the fast clocks new data has been presented.","Clocks - show the result of a pause command. Here the NEWRUNCLOCK is sequenced as usual but no MODCLOCK or MODFASTCLOCK is generated.","As noted above, the particular embodiment was chosen based on a number of criteria, including simplicity of implementation using an FPGA. This motivated the use of VRAMs. An ASIC interface using more dense SDRAM requires at least some buffering, but this can be built into the controller, or alternatively, with the beamformer, T\/R circuit or amplifier modules. In this way they receive bursts of data as opposed to the simple synchronous, continuous data that the above system supplies. The benefit is that SDRAMs are more dense and can provide data at higher rates, which reduces the parts count. Such a configuration is shown in , for example, in which the 64 or 128 channel (-) system is configured on one or two printed circuit boards. In this two board system, the T\/R circuit and the preamplifier\/TGC circuit are fabricated in a single integrated circuit and are placed on one board with a CDP beamformer that is formed as a second integrated circuit. The beamformer control circuits can include the calculation of weighted inputs with processor . The memory for this system is either a SDRAM or VRAM located on the second board along with the system controller and the digital communication control circuit.","Returning to , the standard FireWire cable  includes a plurality of FireWire signal lines  and a FireWire power line . In order to provide the necessary voltages, the FireWire power line  is fed to an inline DC-DC converter . The DC-DC converter  generates the necessary voltages and provides them over a plurality of power lines . These new power lines  are repackaged with the FireWire signal lines  in a custom cable \u2032. In the probe housing \u2032, the FireWire signal lines  are connected to the FireWire chipset  and the custom power lines  are connected to a power distributor , which filters and distributes the various voltages over respective internal voltage lines A, B, . In addition, the power distributor  may perform additional DC-DC conversions, as described in more detail below.","The transmit\/receive control chip is needed to interface with the transducer array. In a transmit mode, the chip can provide delays to the high-voltage driving pulses applied to each of the selected transducer elements such that the transmitted pulses will be coherently summed on the image place at the required transmit focus point. In a receive mode, it provides connection of the reflected sound waves received by a selected element to its corresponding amplifier. The functions of a multi-channel transmit\/receive chip can be separated into two parts: a core function which provide low-voltage transmit\/receive control and a buffer function which level shifts the low-voltage transmit\/receive control into high voltage and directly interfaces with the transducer array. The core function of the transmit\/receive chip includes a global counter which broadcasts a master clock and bit values to each channel processor; a global memory which controls transmit frequency, pulse number, pulse sequence and transmit\/receive select; a local comparator which provides delay selection for each channel. For example, for a 60 MHZ clock and a 10 bit global counter, it can provide each channel with up to 17 \u03bcs delay; a local frequency counter which provides programmable transmit frequency; a local pulse counter which provides different pulse sequences. For example, a 7-bit counter can provide programmable transmitted pulse lengths from one pulse up to 128 pulses; a locally programmable phase selector which provides sub-clock delay resolution. For example, for a 60 MHz master clock and a two-to-one phase selector provides 8 ns delay resolution.","While typically the period of the transmit-chip clock determines the delay resolution, a technique called programmable subclock delay resolution allows the delay resolution to be more precise than the clock period. With programmable subclock delay resolution, the output of the frequency counter is gated with a phase of the clock that is programmable on a per-channel basis. In the simplest form, a two-phase clock is used and the output of the frequency counter\u2014is either gated with the asserted or Deasserted clock. Alternatively, multiple skewed clocks can be used. One per channel can be selected and used to gate the coarse timing signal from the frequency counter.","As can be seen in , a semiconductor process that can support both high-voltage and low-voltage operations is ideally matched for a single-chip solution to the transmit\/receive chip described above. The core function of the transmit\/receive chip can be implemented on low-voltage transistors to reduce power consumption. The level-shifting function can be implemented on high-voltage transistors to provide the necessary driving pulses to the transducer array. However, only selected semiconductor processes can make the integration of both high-voltage (buffer ) and low-voltage transistors () on one chip  possible. As a result, the high\/low voltage process has been so far offered only with 0.8-to-1 um-design rules. With these design rules, a 64-channel transmit\/receive chip can easily be integrated on a single chip in less than 1 cmchip area.","In order to save power and silicon area, a multi-chip module  can be used to implement a transmit\/receive chip. For example, a deep-sub-micron process can be used to implement the core function  of the module, and a separate process can be used to implement the buffer  function. As shown in , the multi-chip set can be mounted in a single package to realize the transmit\/receive control function. With multi-chip module approach, a 128-channel transmit\/receive controller can easily be integrated on one package.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0204","num":"0206"},"figref":["FIG. 3D","FIG. 12","FIG. 3D"],"b":["10","410","404","412","404"],"sup":"3 "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0205","num":"0207"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6"],"b":["32","500","502","500","5","40","5","40","5","5"]},"The ultrasonic application server running on the user computer device , therefore, receives the US data, and makes it available to be invoked by an external application for further processing.

In addition to real-time B-mode ultrasound images for displaying soft-tissue structures in the human body, Doppler ultrasound data can be used to display an estimate of blood velocity in the body in real time. Three different velocity estimation systems exist: color-flow imaging (CFI), power-Doppler and spectral sonogram.","The color-flow imaging modality interrogates a specific region of the body, and displays a real-time image of mean velocity distribution. The CFI's are usually shown on top of the dynamic B-mode image. To determine the direction of blood flow, different colors indicate velocity toward and away from the transducer.","While color flow images display the mean or standard deviation of the velocity of reflectors (i.e., blood cells) in a given region, power Doppler (PD) displays a measurement of the amount of moving reflectors in the area, similar to a B-mode image's display of the total amount of reflectivity. A PD image is an energy image in which the energy of the flow signal is displayed. These images give no velocity information but only show the location of flow.","The spectral Doppler or spectral sonogram modality utilizes a pulsed-wave system to interrogate a single range gate and displays the velocity distribution as a function of time. This sonogram can be combined with a B-mode image to yield a duplex image. Typically, the top side of the display shows a B-mode image of the region under investigation, and the bottom shows the sonogram. Similarly, the sonogram can also be combined with the CFI image to yield a triplex image. Thus, the time for data acquisition is divided between acquiring all three sets of data.

Stabilized microbubbles are used for ultrasound contrast imaging because of their unique acoustic properties compared to biological tissues. They present superior backscattering and nonlinear behavior, and fragility upon exposure to ultrasound. A number of ultrasound imaging modalities have been created to exploit these features.","In fundamental B-Mode imaging, the transmitting and receiving frequencies are the same. The echogenicity of blood is significantly increased with the administration of a contrast material. Gas microbubbles scatter sound much more intensely than an equivalent size liquid or solid particle owing to the acoustic impedance mismatch (particularly the difference in compressibility) between the gas and the surrounding tissue or blood. This effect will be observed in Doppler and M-Mode imaging techniques as well. One disadvantage of using fundamental B-Mode for contrast imaging is that the level of the echoes created by the bubbles is similar to the level of the echoes resulting from the biological tissues.","A technique using the second harmonic relies on the fact that bubbles generate harmonics of the transmitted frequency at a level much higher than the harmonics generated by the tissues. By creating images from the signal received at twice the transmitted frequency, high image contrast is achieved between regions with and without bubbles. A problem with this imaging modality is that a short pulse (typically used in B-mode imaging) has a broad bandwidth and the transmitting and receiving frequencies overlap, contaminating the harmonic image with the fundamental frequency. To alleviate this problem, the pulse length is increased to achieve a narrow bandwidth, however, at the expense of decreasing the axial resolution of the image.","The pulse inversion method (also called wideband harmonic imaging or dual pulse imaging), solves the problem of overlapping frequencies observed with the second harmonic technique. Each scan line is formed by summing the signals received from two ultrasound pulses, where the second pulse is inverted and slightly delayed relative to the first. This procedure cancels the response of all linear scatters (if there is no tissue movement between the two pulses) while enhancing the effects of nonlinear scatterers. Because there is delay between the two pulses, any bubble displacement adds an additional signal, resulting in velocity-dependent enhancement.","Because most ultrasound contrast agents are destroyed by ultrasound irradiation, intermittent or gated imaging techniques have been used. By acquiring an image frame at each cardiac cycle (or after several cardiac cycles), ultrasound exposure is reduced, increasing the longevity of the contrast agents in the region of interest on the image. Another benefit of intermittent imaging is the filling of vascular space during the off-cycle. The degree of filling produces enhancement that is directly related to blood volume of blood flow, since the higher flow rate, the greater the number of bubbles that enters the region of interest, and thus the greater the fractional blood volume.","The stimulated acoustic emission method (also known as transient response imaging) typically involves color Doppler with the transmitting power set high to ensure bubble disruption with the first pulse. When the bubbles collapse, a broadband acoustic signal is generated. Since ultrasound Doppler systems compare the backscattered signal with respect to a \u201cclean\u201d reference signal, this loss of frequency correlation caused by the bubble collapse is interpreted by the machine as a random Doppler shift, resulting in a mosaic of colors at the location of the microbubbles.","A preferred embodiment of the invention employs a spatial filter in providing a power doppler image, for example. This spatial or high pass filter can also be used effectively with a contrast agent to further differentiate between blood flow and the surrounding vessel or artery. First the power is computed and a two pulse canceller is employed. The ratio of the power of the signal before and after the filter provides a data set yielding clear images of moving fluid within the body.","A preferred embodiment of the invention employs a spatial filter in providing a power doppler image, for example.

Standardization of multimedia networking is underway, and IEEE 1394 is emerging as the leading contender, capable of interfacing with a number of audio-visual (AV), computer and other digital consumer electronics and providing transmission bandwidth of up to 400 Mbps.","Preferred embodiments use IEEE 1394 technology which uses a wireless solution for the transmission of 1394 protocols over IEEE 802.11, the emerging standard for wireless data transmission in the corporate environment and increasingly in the home as well. In a preferred embodiment IEEE 1394 is implemented as a Protocol Adaptation Layer (PAL) on top of the 802.11 radio hardware and Ethernet protocols, bringing together a convergence of these important technologies. This protocol adaptation layer enables the PC to function as a wireless 1394 device. The engineering goal is for real delivered IEEE 1394 bandwidth sufficient for the transmission of a single high-definition MPEG2 video stream (or multiple standard-definition MPEG2 video streams) from one room in a facility to another.","Preferred embodiments of the present invention include the use of wireless transmission of IEEE 1394 at 2.4 GHz using Wi-LAN's Wideband Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (W-OFDM) technology. This development establishes W-OFDM, the most bandwidth-efficient wireless transmission technology, as one of the technologies capable of providing data rates necessary for in-home multimedia networking.","The Wireless IEEE 1394 system includes an MPEG-2 data stream generator, which feeds a multiple transport stream into a Set Top Box (STB) such as provided by Philips Semiconductors. The STB converts this signal to an IEEE 1394 data stream and applies it to the W-OFDM radio system such as provided by Wi-LAN\u2122. The radio transmitter then sends the IEEE 1394 data stream over the air to the corresponding W-OFDM receiver in the host computer, for example. On the receive side, the IEEE 1394 signal is demodulated and sent to two STBs, which display the content of the different MPEG-2 data streams on two separate TV monitors. Using IEEE 1394 as the interface for the wired part of the network optimizes the entire system for transmission of isochronous information (voice, live video) and provides an ideal interface to multimedia devices in the facility. W-OFDM technology is inherently immune to the effects of multipath. Like all modulation schemes, OFDM encodes data inside a radio frequency (RF) signal. Radio communications are often obstructed by occurring noise, stray and reflected signals. By sending high-speed signals concurrently on different frequencies, OFDM technology offers robust communications. OFDM-enabled systems are highly tolerant to noise and multipath, making wide-area and in-home multi-point coverage possible. Additionally, as these systems are very efficient in use of bandwidth, many more high-speed channels are possible within a frequency band. W-OFDM is a cost-effective variation of OFDM that allows much larger throughputs than conventional OFDM by using a broad frequency band. W-OFDM further processes the signal to maximize the range. These improvements to conventional OFDM result in the dramatically increased transmission speeds.","OFDM technology is becoming increasingly more visible as American and European standardization committees are choosing it as the only technology capable of providing reliable wireless high data rate connections. European terrestrial digital video broadcasting uses OFDM and the IEEE 802.11 working group recently selected OFDM in its proposed 6 to 54 Mbps wireless LAN standard. The European Telecommunications Standards Institute is considering W-OFDM for the ETSI BRAN standard.

Ultrasound elastography is an imaging technique whereby local axial tissue strains are estimated from differential ultrasonic speckle displacements. These displacements are generated by a weak, quasi-static stress field. The resultant strain image is called an elastogram. Most pathological changes are associated with changes in tissue stiffness. Palpation is an effective method for lesion detection and evaluation. Many cancers (breast, prostate) are isoechoic, and hence difficult to detect by ultrasound alone.","Elastography uses the principle by which a small compression (strain) of the tissue results in a small compression of the signal (similar to frequency modulation.) Ultrasound elastography conveys new and clinically important tissue information. The tradeoffs among engineering and elastographic image parameters are now reasonably well understood. Elastography can operate in hypoechoic areas, for example, shadows. Reliable small elastic contrast exists among normal soft-tissue components, good carrier-to-noise ratio (CNR) allows its visualization. Pathology generally exhibits large elastic contrast. Areas that can benefit from the elastography include breast, prostate, vasculature, small parts and treatment monitoring.","Currently, breast cancer is the most frequent cancer in women. Every ninth woman in the U.S. is affected during her lifetime. It is well known that palpation of the breast is a very helpful mean to detect conspicuous lesions. Although a lot of effort is put into screening methods for breast cancer, in the majority of cases the patient herself is the first who notices palpable changes in her breast during self-examination. Although it can support the diagnostics of breast tissue, there is still a need for an imaging modality that can provide a direct measure of material parameters related to tissue elasticity such as Young's modulus. Concerning breast imaging, the elasticity tensor can be reconstructed three-dimensionally using magnetic resonance imaging. A semi-quantitative measure of elasticity with ultrasound has recently become a real-time imaging modality. As described hereinbefore, the strain imaging or elastography method is helpful to describe mechanical properties of tissue in vivo. Elastography compares ultrasonic radio frequency (RF) data of an object before and after the application of a slight compression step. Time delays between the pre- and post-compression RF signals can be estimated and converted to mechanical displacement in the axial direction. The derivative of axial displacement leads to axial strain as a semi-quantitative measure of elastic properties.","The quality of strain images or elastograms is limited by noise due to signal decorrelation in the time delay estimation. One method to minimize this source of error is to apply motor-driven compression plates and to use multi-compression averaging. Another method is to correct for lateral displacements by interpolating A-lines two-dimensionally. For breast imaging, initial clinical results have been published, which indicate that ultrasound elastography has the potential for improving differential diagnosis of benign and malignant breast lesions. Preferred embodiments of the present invention ultrasound systems can be used for ultrasound elastography and provide elastograms which can be used to diagnose benign and malignant lesions.","In accordance with a preferred embodiment, when the suspect lesion is found, a slight compression can be applied to the breast and a palpation performed with the transducer including both compression and relaxation. Usually the system is able to store the last two compression cycles in a cine-buffer of the ultrasound system, including approximately 80 images. In the conventional B-mode it is only possible to record demodulated echo data, i.e., gray-scaled imaged data. In order to acquire RF data for elastography at the same time, a color-mode window of 20\u00d740 mm, i.e., 20 mm depth and 40 mm width can be used. The RF data from the color-mode window, which is usually used to calculate flow parameters, can be recorded as IQ-data (base-band data). Prior to the off-line calculation of strain images, the limited bandwidth of color-mode RF data is compensated for. The ultrasound system is reprogrammed to use broadband transmit pulses and broadband receive filter for the color-mode. After performing time delay estimation on every two successive frames of an IQ-data series, a series of time-delay images or axial displacement images is obtained, respectively.","The purpose of imaging elastic tissue properties using ultrasound elastography is to support the detection, localization and differential diagnosis of lesions. Strain imaging is a semi-quantitative method. Therefore, it is definitely possible to evaluate elastograms qualitatively. A qualitative method for the evaluation of ultrasound elastograms uses a gray-scaled colormap. The appearance (visualization, brightness, margin) and size of each lesion on the elastogram in comparison to the B-mode image, in order to distinguish breast tissues is used. However, the results of a qualitative image analysis depend on the choice of the colormap and image scaling, respectively.","As described hereinbefore, the ultrasound systems of the present invention are used in minimally invasive surgery and robotic surgery methods including biopsy procedures, catheter introduction for diagnostic and therapeutic angiography, fetal imaging, cardiac imaging, vascular imaging, imaging during endoscopic procedures, imaging for telemedicine applications and imaging for veterinary applications, radiation therapy, and cryotherapy, without limitation. The embodiments use computer based tracking systems and CT and MR images to pinpoint the precise location of the target areas. Alternative preferred embodiments of ultrasound systems can at lower cost and using smaller footprint devices provide images just prior, during, and just after the procedure. Preferred embodiments overcome the need of requiring a separate ultrasound appliance to be wheeled into the procedure room and a method to move images from the ultrasound to the device that is tracking position and registering targets against previously captured CT and MR images. A preferred embodiment of the ultrasound system provides a fully integrated solution, since it can run its' ultrasound application on the same platform as any third party application that is processing the images. The system includes a streaming video interface, an interface between a third party application and the system's ultrasound application. A key component of this system allows the two applications to run on the same computer platform (using the same operating system (OS)) such as, for example, Windows\u00ae based platform, other platforms such as Linux can also be used and thus providing a seamless integration of the two applications. The details of the software interface to move images from the system's ultrasound application to another application are described herein below.","Preferred embodiments include control and data transfer methods that allow a third party Windows\u00ae based application to control, for example, a portable Windows\u00ae based ultrasound system by running the ultrasound application as a background task, sending control commands to the ultrasound application and receiving images (data) in return. Further, the embodiment configures a portable ultrasound Windows\u00ae based application as a server of live ultrasound image frames supplying another Windows\u00ae based application that acts as a client. This client application receives these ultrasound image frames and processes them further. In addition, an alternate embodiment configures the portable ultrasound Windows\u00ae based application as a server, interacting with a third party client application via two communication mechanisms, for example a component object model (COM) automation interface used by third party, hereinafter referred to interchangeably as external or a client to startup and control the portable ultrasound Windows\u00ae based application and a high-speed shared memory interface to deliver live ultrasound images.","A preferred embodiment includes and configures a shared memory interface to act as a streaming video interface between a portable Windows\u00ae based Ultrasound application and another third party Windows\u00ae based application. This streaming video interface is designed to provide ultrasound images to a third party client in real-time.","A preferred embodiment allows the third party Windows\u00ae based application to control the flow rate of images from the portable ultrasound Windows\u00ae based application through the shared memory interface within the same PC platform and the amount of memory required to implement this interface. These controls consist of a way to set the number of image buffers, the size of each buffer and the rate of image transfer. This flow rate control can be set for zero data loss thus ensuring that every frame is delivered to the third party Windows\u00ae based application from the ultrasound system, or minimum latency thus delivering the latest frame generated by ultrasound system to the third party Windows\u00ae based application first.","A preferred embodiment formats the ultrasound image frame such that probe, spatial, and temporal information can be interpreted by the third party Windows\u00ae based application as it retrieves the images (generated by the portable ultrasound Windows\u00ae based application) from the shared memory interface. The actual image data passed between the server (i.e. portable ultrasound application) and the client application (third party Windows\u00ae based application) is a Microsoft\u00ae device independent bitmap (DIB) with 8 bit pixels and a 256 entry color table. The image frame also contains a header that provides the following additional information, for example, but not limited to, Probe Type, Probe Serial Number, Frame Sequence Number, Frame Rate, Frame Timestamp, Frame Trigger Timestamp, Image Width (in pixels), Image Height (in pixels), Pixel Size (in X and Y), Pixel Origin (x, y location of the first pixel in image relative to the Transducer Head, and Direction (spatial direction along or across each line of the image).","Further, the preferred embodiment controls the shared memory interface used to transfer ultrasound images between a Windows\u00ae based portable ultrasound system and a third party Windows\u00ae based system through the use of ActiveX\u00ae controls. The Windows\u00ae based portable ultrasound application contains an ActiveX\u00ae control that transfers a frame into the shared memory and sends out a Windows\u00ae Event (that includes a pointer to the frame just written) to the third party Windows\u00ae based application. This third party application has a similar ActiveX\u00ae control that receives this Event and pulls the image frame out of shared memory.","The graphical user interface includes one or more control programs, each of which is preferably a self-contained, for example, client-side script. The control programs are independently configured for, among other functions, generating graphical or text-based user controls in the user interface, for generating a display area in the user interface as directed by the user controls, or for displaying the processed streaming media. The control programs can be implemented as ActiveX\u00ae controls, as Java applets, or as any other self-contained and\/or self-executing application, or portion thereof, operable within a media gateway container environment and controllable through the web page.","Ultrasonic content can be displayed within a frame in the graphical user interface. In an embodiment, the program generates an instance of an ActiveX\u00ae control. ActiveX\u00ae refers to a set of object-oriented programming technologies and tools provided by Microsoft\u00ae Corporation of Redmond, Wash. The core part of the ActiveX\u00ae technology is the component object model (COM). A program run in accordance with the ActiveX\u00ae environment is known as \u201ccomponent,\u201d a self-sufficient program that can be run anywhere in the network, as long as the program is supported. This component is commonly known as an \u201cActiveX\u00ae control.\u201d Thus, an ActiveX\u00ae control is a component program object that can be re-used by many application programs within a computer or among computers in a network, regardless of the programming language with which it was created. An ActiveX\u00ae control runs in which is known as a container, which is an application program utilizing the COM program interfaces.","One advantage of using a component is that it can be re-used by many applications, which are known as \u201ccomponent containers.\u201d Another advantage is that an ActiveX\u00ae control can be created using one of several well-known languages or development tools, including C++, Visual Basic, or PowerBuilder, or with scripting tools such as VBScript. ActiveX\u00ae controls can be downloaded as small executable programs, or as self-executable code for Web pages animation, for example. Similar to ActiveX\u00ae controls, and suitable for the client-side scripts, are applets. An applet is typically a self-contained, self-executing computer program written in Java\u2122, a web-based object-oriented programming language promulgated by SUN Microsystems Corporation of Sunnyvale, Calif.","The control programs can be stored and accessed locally at the client system, or downloaded from the network. Downloading is typically done by encapsulating a control program in one or more markup language-based files. The control programs can also be used for any commonly-needed task by an application program running in one of several operating system environments. Windows\u00ae, Linux and Macintosh are examples of operating system environments that can be used in preferred embodiments.","A preferred embodiment of the Ultrasound Imaging System has specific software architecture for the image streaming capabilities. This Ultrasound Imaging System is an application that controls the Ultrasound Probe of a preferred embodiment and allows to obtain and display visual images for medical purposes. The Imaging System has it's own graphical user interface. This interface has reach in features and is conveniently organized to provide maximum flexibility working with the separate images as well as streams of images. Some of the possible medical applications require developing of graphical user interfaces with significantly different features. This involves integration of the Imaging System into other more complicated medical system. The preferred embodiment allows exporting imaging data in a highly effective and convenient fashion for original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to have direct access to imaging data.","The quality of the Image Streaming solution in accordance with a preferred embodiment is measured by the following criteria such as, data transfer performance. Imaging data consume significant amount of memory and processor power. Large number of separate image frames are required to produce live medical video patient examination. It becomes very important to minimize data coping operations in a process of transferring data from one process generating video data to a process consuming video data. The second criteria includes industry standard imaging format. Since applications consuming video imaging data are intended to be developed by third party companies data can be represented in industry standard formats. A third criteria is convenience. Imaging data may be presented by means of a programming interface that is convenient to use and does not require additional learning.","Further, the criteria includes scalability and extendibility. Streaming data architecture may be easily extendable to accommodate new data types. It may provide basic framework for future multiplication of video streams targeting more then one data receiving process.","The image streaming architecture of the preferred embodiment provides methods of data transportation between two processes. The image streaming architecture defines operational parameters regulating data transferring process, and describes the mechanism of transferring parameters between processes. One of the methods to transfer operational parameters from a third party client application to the imaging system of a preferred embodiment is by using existing COM interface.","In a preferred embodiment, the image transferring architecture intensively uses object-oriented programming methodology and inter-processing capabilities of the Microsoft Windows\u00ae operating system. Object-oriented methodology provides a necessary foundation allowing an architectural solution that satisfies the necessary requirements. It also lays ground for future enhancements and extensions making modification relatively simple and backward compatible.","Video imaging data represent complicated data structures with mutual interferences between different data elements. It also permits and often requires different interpretation of the same data elements. The preferred embodiment of the following image transferring architecture includes a shared memory for physical data exchange. For example, Windows\u00ae shared memory is a fast and economical way to exchange data between processes. Further, the shared memory can be subdivided into separate sections of a fixed size in certain embodiments. Each section can then be at a minimum a controllable unit. In addition, the imaging data can be abstracted as objects. Each frame of the imaging data can be represented by a separate object. The objects can then be mapped to the sections of the shared memory.","Preferred embodiments can include the locking-unlocking of a section-object. The programming API notification mechanism used is an event-driven mechanism. Event-driven mechanisms are implementation based on C++ pure-virtual functions.","In a preferred embodiment, the image transferring architecture consists of three layers: an application programming interface (API) layer, a programming interface implementation and shared memory access layer, and a physical shared memory layer. The application programming interface layer provides two different C++ class library interfaces to applications on a client and server side. All the associated sequence of instructions that belongs to the application itself is part of this layer as well. Application derived classes and their implementation are the key elements of application programming interface layer. The server which is the imaging data provider side uses, for example, Object Transmitter class and related derived and base classes. The client which is the imaging data consumer side uses an Object Factory class, for example, and related derived and base classes.","The programming interface implementation layer provides two different Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs) implementing classes for the applications. This layer maps objects of the classes associated with the application to an internal implementation of objects accessing the shared memory physical system object. This layer allows the hiding of all implementation specific member variables and functions from the scope of the application. Thus, the application programming interface layers become uncluttered, easy to understand and use. The server side application can use, for example, ObjectXmitter.DLL, while the client side application can use, for example, ObjectFactory.DLL.","The physical shared memory layer represents the operating system object implementing shared memory functionality. It also describes the structure of the shared memory, it's segmentation, and memory controlling blocks.","With respect to the organization of the shared memory since shared memory is intended to be used for interprocess communications the operating system specifies a unique name at the time of it's creation. In order to manage the shared memory, other interprocess communications (IPC) system objects are required. They need to have unique names as well. To simplify a unique name generation process only one base is required. All other names are derived from the base one by an implementation code. Thus, the application programming interface requires the specification of only one base name for the logical shared memory object. The same unique name can be used by both the server side of the application and the client side of the application.","The server side of the application is responsible for the creation of shared memory creation. In a process of creation, it has to specify not only unique name of the shared memory but other configuration parameters. These parameters include, but are not limited to, segments count which specifies the number of segments to be allocated, segment size and operational flags. There are three such flags in a preferred embodiment. The first one specifies the segment submission and retrieval order. It can be one of, Last In First Out (LIFO), First In First Out (FIFO), or Last In Out (LIO). LIO is a modification of the usual LIFO in such a way that whenever at the time when a new frame arrives, if it finds frames that were ready for retrieval, but yet not locked for retrieval, they are erased. The second flag specifies shared memory implementation behavior under a condition when a new segment allocation is requested but there is no segment available. Typically it may happen when receiving application process data slower then submitting the application. This flag may allow deleting one of the previously allocated segments. If it does not allow deleting one of the previously allocated segments, it reports an exceptional condition back to the application. Using this flag application may automatically select overwriting of data in a shared memory or it may control the data overwrite process itself. The third flag can be used only when the second one allows overwriting segments in a shared memory. It specifies how to select a segment to be overwritten. By default, shared memory implementation deletes the youngest or the most recently submitted data segment. Alternatively, the oldest segment can be selected for overwrite process.","At the time of the creation of the shared memory it's physical layout is initialized. Since the operating system does not allow address calculation in a physical shared memory data pointers are not used within shared memory. All addressing within the shared memory controlling blocks and segments is implemented in terms of relative offsets from the Virtual Origin (VO). With the offset zero from the VO, the shared memory heading structure is allocated. It contains all the parameters listed herein above.  is a block diagram illustrating the structure of the physical shared memory.","Immediately after the allocation of the shared memory heading structure  follows the creation of array of headers for every memory segment. The memory segment header contains the occupied size of the segment, unique tag of the class of the object mapped to the segment, and the segment state. Each segment can be in one of four states: unused where the segment is available for allocation, locked for write where the segment is mapped to an object of a specific class and currently is being formed, written, wherein the segment is mapped to an object of a specific class and available for retrieval, and locked for read, wherein the segment is mapped to an object of a specific class and currently is in a process on data retrieval. Since every segment has it's own state it is possible for the application to lock more then one segment for object forming and object retrieval. This allows the system to have flexible multithreaded architecture on both the server and client sides of the application. Further, the ability to have more then one segment in a \u201cwritten\u201d state provides a \u201cbuffering\u201d mechanism nullifying or minimizing performance difference of the applications on the server and client sides.","The last element in a physical shared memory layout contains memory segments. The logical shared memory besides physical shared memory contains a physical system mutex  and system event . The physical mutex provides mutual exclusive access to physical shared memory. The physical event is of a manual control type. It stays at the level \u201chigh\u201d all the time when at least one of the segments has a \u201cwritten\u201d state. It goes to the level \u201clow\u201d only when there is no single segment in a \u201cwritten\u201d state. This mechanism allows to retrieve \u201cwritten\u201d objects from the shared memory without passing control to an operating system within the same time-slice allocation for the thread.","In a preferred embodiment, the object transmitting programming interface consists of three classes: namely, AObjectXmitter, USFrame, and BModeFrame. The AObjectXmitter class allows the initiation of an object transferring service specifying desired operational parameters. Once the AObjectXmitter class object is instantiated the initialized objects of USFrame and BModeFrame classes can be created. The USFrame class constructor requires a reference to an object of the AObjectXmitter class. The first action that has to be accomplished upon instantiation of the USFrame object is to establish association of the object with one of the segments in the shared memory. The function Allocate( ) maps an object to an unused shared memory segment and locks this segment for the current object usage. At the time of mapping an object a bitmap size may be provided by an application. The provided size represents only the size required for bitmap data not including the memory size required for other data elements of the object.","The BModeFrame class is a class derived from the USFrame class. It inherits all the methods and functionality that the base class has. The only additional functionality provided by BModeFrame class is additional methods allowing to provide information related specifically to the BMode operation.","After the USFrame or BModeFrame class object has been instantiated and mapped to the shared memory segment the application can fill all desired data elements of the object. It is not necessary to provide a value for every data element. At the time when an object is being mapped to the shared memory segment, all data elements of the object are being initialized with default values. The only data elements that are not initialized upon mapping are bitmap data elements. When the server side of the application has provided all desired data elements it can hand over the object to the client side of the application by calling a method, for example, Submit( ).","The USFrame or BModeFrame object can be reused by means of subsequent remapping and resubmitting. Alternatively, it can be deleted and a new one can be created when it is appropriate for an application. Since object instantiation does not require any interprocess-communication mechanisms, it is as simple as memory allocation for an ordinary variable.","There are at least two advantages of the architecture of the preferred embodiment. Since the ObjectXmitter class does have knowledge about the USFrame or BModeFrame class, it is very easy to introduce additional classes similar or directly or indirectly derived from the USFrame class. This allows to produce future versions of Object Transmitting Programming Interface without requiring any modifications to the code or sequence of instructions that was developed for existing embodiments. Further, Object Transmitting Programming Interface classes do not have any member variables. This provides two more benefits of the interface. The first one is that these classes are COM object interface oriented and can be directly used for the COM object interface specification and implementation. The second benefit is that these classes effectively hide all implementation specific details making the interface very clear, easy to understand and use.","The Object Transmitting Programming Interface is implemented by the ObjectXmitter.DLL. For every object created by the application there is a mirroring implementation object being created by the code residing in the ObjectXmitter.DLL. Since every programming interface class has corresponding mirroring class in implementation modifications are facilitated and extend currently to specified image types. This can be accomplished by the creation of the corresponding mirroring classes in the implementation DLL. Implementation objects are responsible for handling of the shared memory and the mapping of programming interface objects. An embodiment of the present invention includes the DLL allowing instantiate of only one ObjectXmitter class object using only one communication channel with the one client application. Object Transmitting implementation transmits not only object data but provides additional information describing the object type transferred.","The Object Factory Programming Interface consists of three classes: AObjectFactory, USFrame, and BModeFrame. The class AObjectFactory contains three pure virtual member functions. This makes this class an abstract class that cannot be instantiated by an application. It is required from the application to define its own class derived from the AObjectFactory class. There is no need to define any \u201cspecial\u201d class derived from the AObjectFactory class. Since the application intends to process images that would be received, the chances that it will have a class processing images are very high. An image processing class can very well be derived from AObjectFactory class.","The class derived from an AObjectFactory class has to define and implement only pure virtual functions such as, for example, OnFrameOverrun( ), OnUSFrame( ), and OnBModeFrame( ). For instance, a derived class can be defined as follows:\n\n","Upon instantiation of an object of the class ImageProcessor base class member function Open( ) can be called. This function provides a shared memory name that matches to the shared memory name being used by the server side of application. Function Open( ) connects the client application to the server application via a specified shared memory.","At any moment after opening the shared memory, the application can expect a call on a virtual function OnFrameOverrun( ), OnUSFrame( ), and OnBModeFrame( ). Every invocation of OnUSFrame( ) function carries as an argument an object of USFrame class type. Every invocation of OnBModeFrame( ) function carries as an argument an object of BModeFrame class type. There is no need for an application to instantiate an object of USFrame or BModeFrame class. USFrame and BModeFrame objects are \u201cgiven\u201d to an application by underlying implementation on an AObjectFactory class.","The only action that application needs to accomplish is to process received frame and to release the \u201cgiven\u201d object. The application does not attempt to delete a frame object, as deletion is done by an underlying implementation. Member function Release( ) of USFrame object is called only when all data processing is done by the application and USFrame object or object of the derived class is no longer needed by the application.","Once the application has received an object of a class USFrame or BModeFrame it can retrieve imaging data and process them appropriately. The application needs to be aware that it does processing of the frame object data in a separate thread and make sure that processing function is written using a thread-safe programming technique. Since any of the pure virtual functions are being called within a separate thread created by the implementation DLL none of the subsequent calls are possible before virtual function returns control back to the calling thread. This means that as long as the application has not returned control to implementation created thread any new frames cannot be received by the application. Meanwhile the server side of the application can continue to submit extra frames. This eventually causes the shared memory to overflow and prevents any new frame transmission.","All the time when the application processes frame data it keeps shared memory resources locked from subsequent remapping. The more frames not released by the application the less shared memory segments are available for Object Transmitting Interface on the server side of the application. If framing objects are not being released with an appropriate speed ratio eventually all memory segments of the shared memory are locked by the client application. At that time the image transmitting application stops sending new frames or overwrites frames that are not locked yet by the receiving application. If all the segments were locked by the receiving application the transmitting application does not even have an option to overwrite existing frames.","The function OnFrameOverrun( ) is called when the Frame Overrun is raised by the servicing application. This condition is raised any time when the servicing application makes an attempt to submit a new frame and there is not any available shared segments to map an object to. This condition can be cleared only by the client side of application by means of calling function ResetFrameOverrun( ). If this function is not called by the client application the Frame Overrun condition is raised and OnFrameOverrun( ) pure virtual function is called again.","The Object Factory Interface has the same advantages that were outlined herein above in describing the Object Transmitting Interface. In addition to these advantages, it implements an event-driven programming method that minimizes programming effort and maximizes execution performance. At the same time there are functions such as, for example, USFrames( ), BModeFrames( ), GetUSFrame( ), and GetBModeFrame( ). These functions can be used to implement less efficient \u201cpolling\u201d programming methods.","The Object Factory Programming Interface is implemented by the ObjectFactory.DLL. This DLL retrieves an object class type information as well as object related data from the shared memory. It creates an object of the type that is used by the transmitter. The Object factory implementation maps newly created objects to the corresponding data. Object factory implementation has a separate thread that fires newly generated and mapped object via pure virtual function event. The application \u201cowns\u201d this object for the duration of processing and by calling Release( ) function indicates that the object is no longer needed by the application. The factory implementation releases resources allocated for the object locally as well as shared memory resources.","The processing flow described herein above is pictorially represented in the block diagram . Preferred embodiments, include the ease of code maintenance and feature enhancement for the image transferring mechanism. The Object Transferring and Object Factory Interfaces as well as their implementations allow such modifications to be made at a relatively low development cost. With respect to Object Modification, the shared memory implementation is completely independent from the transferred data types. Thus, any type modification does not require making any changes to the underlying code controlling shared memory. Since transferred data is encapsulated within classes of a particular type the only action that is needed to modify transferring an object is to modify the corresponding class defining such object. Since objects represent a class derivation tree any modification of the base class causes appropriate change of every object of the derived classes. Such modifications of the object types do not affect application code not related to modified object classes.","The new types of objects can be introduced by deriving a new class from one of the existing classes. A newly derived class can be derived from the appropriate level of the base classes. An alternative way to create a new object type is by the creation of a new base class. This method may have the advantage in the case when a newly defined class differs from existing ones significantly.","With respect to multiple Object Transferring Channels, alternate preferred embodiments, can support more than one AObjectXmitter class object and more then one corresponding communication channel. It also can be extended in such a way that it allows communication channels transmitting objects in opposite directions. This allows the application to distribute imaging data to more then one client application. It can accept incoming communication controlling image creation and probe operation.","Further, wireless and remote image streaming channels can be accommodated in preferred embodiments. A same Object Transmitting Programming Interface can be implemented to transfer images not via the shared memory but via the high-speed wireless communication network such as, for example, ISO 802.11a. It also can be used to transfer images across a wired Ethernet connection. Remote and wireless image streaming assumes that the recipient computing system can differ in performance. This makes the selection of a model of the recipient's device one of the important factors for the successful implementation.","The streamed imaging included in preferred embodiments thus utilizes a shared-memory client-server architecture that provides high bandwidth with low overhead.","The Ultrasound Imaging System software application of a preferred embodiment is used as a server of live ultrasound image frames by a client application. This client-server relationship is supported by two communications mechanisms as described hereinabove. A COM automation interface is used by the client application to start-up and control the ultrasound imaging system application. A high-speed shared-memory interface delivers live ultrasound images with probe identification, spatial and temporal information from the application to the client application.","Complexities of the shared-memory implementation are encapsulated for the client application in a simple ActiveX\u00ae COM API(TTIFrameReceiver). The shared-memory communications have flexible parameters that are specified by the client application. Queue order, number of buffers, buffer size and overwrite permission are all specified by the client when opening the image frame stream. The queue order mode can be specified as First-In-First-Out (FIFO), Last-In-Last-Out (LIFO) and Last-In-Out (LIO). In general, the FIFO mode is preferred when zero data loss is more important than minimum latency. The LIO mode delivers only the most recent image frames and is preferred when minimum latency is more important than data loss. The LIFO mode can be used when minimum latency and minimum data loss are both important. However, in the LIFO mode, frames might not always be delivered in sequential order and a more complicated client application is required to sort them after they are received. Overwrite permission, when all of the shared-memory buffers are full, is specified as not allowed, overwrite oldest and overwrite newest.","Each image frame contains a single ultrasound image, probe identification information, pixel spatial information and temporal information. The image format is a standard Microsoft device independent bitmap (DIB) with 8-bit pixels and a 256-entry color table.","The TTFrameReceiver ActiveX\u00ae control provides two schemes for receiving frames. The first scheme is event driven. A COM event, FrameReady, is fired when a frame has been received. Following the FrameReady event, the image and associated data can be read using the data access methods of the interface. After image and other data have been copied, the client releases the frame by calling the ReleaseFrame method. The next FrameReady event does not occur until after the previous frame is released. In another embodiment, the client can poll for the next available frame using the WaitForFrame method.","In a preferred embodiment, both the client application and the server application are executed on the same computer. The computer can be running the Microsoft\u00ae Windows\u00ae 2000\/XP operating system, for example, without limitation. The client application (USAutoView) can be developed using Microsoft\u00ae Visual C++ 6.0 and MFC. The source code can be compiled, for example, in Visual Studio 6.0. The server side COM Automation interface and the TTFrameReceiver ActiveX\u00ae control may be compatible with other MS Windows\u00ae software development environments and languages.","In an embodiment of the present invention, the name of the server side COM automation interface (ProgID) is, for example, \u201cUltrasound.Document\u201d and the interface is registered on the computer the first time the application is run. The dispatch interface can be imported into a client application from a type library.","In a preferred embodiment, automation interface is extended to support frame streaming with the addition of different methods such as void OpenFrameStream (BSTR*queueName, short numBuffers, long bufferSize, BSTR*queueOrder, short overwritePermission). The Opens frame stream transmitter on the server side; opens the shared-memory interface to the client application, queueName is a unique name of the shared-memory \u201cfile\u201d and is the same name that is used when opening the receiver, numBuffers is the number of buffers in the shared-memory queue, bufferSize is the size of each buffer in the shared-memory queue in bytes wherein the buffer size is 5120 bytes larger than the largest image that can be transmitted, queueOrder \u201cLIO\u201d, \u201cFIFO\u201d, or \u201cLIFO\u201d, overwritePermission is 0 for overwrite not allowed, 1 for overwrite oldest, or 2 for overwrite newest. Note, OpenFrameStream must be called before opening the TTFrameReceiver control.","The next additional methods include void CloseFrameStream( ) which closes the frame stream transmitter on the server side, void StartTransmitting( ), which tells the server side to start transmitting ultrasound frames, void StopTransmitting( ), which tells the server side to stop transmitting ultrasound frames, and short GetFrameStreamStatus( ), which gets the status of the frame stream transmitter. It is important to check that the stream transmitter is open before opening the TTFrameReceiver. The COM automation interface is non-blocking and the OpenFrameStream call cannot occur at the instant it is called from the client application.","In a preferred embodiment, the TTFrameReceiver ActiveX\u00ae Control is the client application's interface to the live ultrasound frame stream. Frame Stream Control Methods include boolean Open(BSTR name), which opens the frame stream receiver. The frame stream receiver cannot be opened until after the frame stream transmitter on the server has been opened. It also includes boolean Close( ), which closes the frame stream receiver, long WaitForFrame(long timeoutms), which wait for a frame to be ready or until end of timeout period, and boolean ReleaseFrame( ), which release the current image frame. The current frame can be released as soon as all of the desired data has been copied. The next frame cannot be received until the current frame is released. The return values of the other data access functions are not valid after the current frame is released until the next FrameReady event.","Data Access Methods in a preferred embodiment for the image includes long GetPtrBitmapInfo( ), which gets a pointer to the header (with color table) of the DIB that contain the image. The ultrasound image is stored as a standard Microsoft device independent bitmap (DIB). BITMAPINFO and BITMAPINFOHEADER structures can be cast to the returned pointer as needed. Memory for the BITMAPINFO structure is allocated in shared-memory and may not be de-allocated; instead, ReleaseFrame( ) can be called to return the memory to the shared-memory mechanism. Further methods include long GetPtrBitmapBits( ), which gets a pointer to the image pixels. The returned pointer can be cast as needed for use with the Microsoft DIB API. Memory for the bitmap pixels is allocated in shared-memory and may not be de-allocated; instead, ReleaseFrame( ) is called to return the memory to the shared-memory mechanism.","The methods related to probe identification include short GetProbeType( ), which gets the defined ultrasound probe type being used, BSTR GetProbeType( ), which gets the defined probe name, long GetProbeSN( ), which gets the serial number of the probe being used.","With respect to temporal information, the methods include short GetSequenceNum( ), which gets the sequence number of the current frame. The sequence number is derived from an 8-bit counter and thus repeats every 256 frames. It is useful for determining gaps in the frame sequence and for re-ordering frames received when using the LIFO buffer order mode. Further, double GetRate( ), gets the frame rate when combined with the sequence number, provides precise relative timing for the received frames, BSTR GetTimestamp( ), which gets a timestamp for the current frame which provides an absolute time for the current frame that may be useful when synchronizing to external events. The resolution is approximately milliseconds. Timestamps can be averaged and used in conjunction with rate and sequence number to achieve higher precision. Lastly, with respect to temporal information, the methods include BSTR GetTriggerTimestamp( ), which gets a timestamp for the start of ultrasound scanning wherein the ultrasound probe is stopped when \u201cfreezing\u201d the image. The trigger timestamp is recorded when live imaging is resumed.","Spatial Information in preferred embodiments has the following methods, short GetXPixels( ), which get the width of the image in pixels; short GetYPixels( ), which gets the height of the image in pixels; double GetXPixelSize( ), which gets the size of each pixel in the x-direction, (x-direction is defined to be horizontal and parallel to each image line); and double GetYPixelSize( ), which gets the size of each pixel in the y-direction. The y-direction is defined to be vertical and perpendicular to each image line. Further, double GetXOrigin( ), which get the x-location of the first pixel in the image relative to the transducer head and double GetYOrigin( ), which gets the x-location of the first pixel in the image relative to the transducer head.

The handler copies data from the data access methods and then calls ReleaseFrame( ). It is recommended that any kind of indefinite processing, for example, function that invokes message loops be avoided in the handler. Further, void FrameOverrun( ) is used when the server is unable to send a frame or a frame has to be overwritten in the buffers because the buffers are full. This only applies to the FIFO and LIFO modes, since the LIO automatically releases old buffers. This event is usefully for determining whether the client application is reading frames quickly enough and whether the number of buffers allocated is sufficient for the latency of the client.","In a preferred embodiment, USAutoView is a sample client application that automates the server side and displays live ultrasound image frames.

The two properties of the display interface are long DIBitmapInfo and long DIBits. DIBitmapInfo corresponds to a pointer to a block of memory that contains the BITMAPINFO structure for the DIB. DIBits corresponds to a pointer to a block of memory that contains the image pixels. To load a new image, the DIBitmapInfo is set to the pointer to the bitmap info of the DIB. Then DIBits is set to the pointer to the bitmap bits. When DIBits is set, the pointer that was set for DIBitmapInfo is expected to still be valid and both the bitmap info and bitmap bits are copied internally for display on the screen. Both DIBitmapInfo and DIBits are set to zero to clear the image. Source code for this control is included in the USAutoView workspace.

Once the system software is installed the probe device is connected into a desktop or laptop. The probe can be an industry standard transducer connected to a 28 oz. case that contains the system's beamforming hardware. If the probe is connected to a laptop, then a 4-pin FireWire cable is connected to a IEEE 1394 serial connection located on a built-in MediaBay. However, if the probe is connected to a desktop, the computer may not be equipped with a MediaBay. One can connect the probe using an External DC Module (EDCM) connector. Before connecting the probe, one needs to make sure that the FireWire is connected on both the right and left sides of the computer.","In an embodiment, the EDCM is designed to accept a 6-pin IEEE 1394 (also referred to as FireWire) cable at one end and a Lemo connector from the probe at the other end.

The 6-pin IEEE 1394 input to the EDCM can originate from any IEEE 1394 equipped host computer running, for example, the Windows\u00ae 2000 operating system. An external IEEE 1394 hub may also be necessary to provide the requisite DC voltage to the EDCM. In a host computer equipped with IEEE 1394, there are one of two types of IEEE 1394 connectors; a 4-pin or a 6-pin. The 6-pin connector is most often found in PC-based workstations that use internal PCI-bus cards. Typically, the 6-pin connector provides the necessary DC voltage to the EDCM. A 6-pin-male to 6-pin-male IEEE 1394 cable is used to connect the host computer to the EDCM.","The 4-pin connector is found in laptop computers that do not contain a MediaBay in accordance with a preferred embodiment or provide a DC voltage output. When using this connector type, an external IEEE-1394 hub can be used to power the EDCM and the probe.","When power is not provided from the host computer, an external IEEE-1394 hub can be used between the host computer and the EDCM.

The appropriate connector (4-pin or 6-pin) is inserted into the host computer and the 6-pin connector into the hub. The hub is then connected to the EDCM using a 6-pin-male to 6-pin-male IEEE 1394 cable. An IEEE 1394 hub is only necessary when the host computer cannot supply at least +10 to +40 DC volts and 10 watts power to the EDCM.
