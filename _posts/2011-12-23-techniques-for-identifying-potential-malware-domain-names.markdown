Indeed, malware applications may come in a variety of forms and may introduce viruses, steal account information, charge subscription fees while providing no value, and perform other malicious actions. Malware applications are generally associated with potential malware domain names. For example, domain name \u201civklhvfyyvf.org\u201d may represent a potential malware domain name since such a domain name, with such an anomalous sequence of alphanumeric characters, would be an unlikely destination for a web surfer. Many malware distribution sites may use such fabricated domain names to spread malware applications to unsuspecting users. However, using conventional computer security techniques to detect potential malware domain names may be limited, time-consuming, and resource-intensive.","In view of the foregoing, it may be understood that there may be significant problems and shortcomings associated with conventional malware domain name identification technologies.","Techniques for identifying potential malware domain names are disclosed. In one particular exemplary embodiment, the techniques may be realized as a system for identifying potential malware domain names. The system may comprise one or more processors communicatively coupled to a network. The one or more processors may be configured to receive a request for network data, where the request for network data may comprise a domain name. The one or more processors may also be configured to apply a lexical and linguistic analysis to the domain name. The one or more processors may also be configured to identify whether the domain name is a potential malware domain name based on the lexical and linguistic analysis.","In accordance with other aspects of this particular exemplary embodiment, the domain name may comprise a Uniform Resource Locator (URL).","In accordance with further aspects of this particular exemplary embodiment, the lexical and linguistic analysis may comprise analyzing lexical features of the domain name, the lexical features comprising at least one of the following: hyphen count; keyword count; character length; word-to-digit ratio; top level domain or domain origination; and predetermined suspicious alphanumeric character sequences.","In accordance with additional aspects of this particular exemplary embodiment, the lexical and linguistic analysis may comprise a keyword analysis based on separating the domain name into constituent keywords or sub-keywords.","In accordance with other aspects of this particular exemplary embodiment, the lexical and linguistic analysis may comprise a phonetic analysis based on at least one of a pronunciation dictionary and a number of phenomes identified in the domain name.","In accordance with further aspects of this particular exemplary embodiment, the lexical and linguistic analysis may comprise a language model analysis based on applying N-gram statistical analysis to an actual native language of the domain name and actual visitor. In some embodiments, the N-gram may be a trigram.","In accordance with additional aspects of this particular exemplary embodiment, the statistical analysis may yield a probability value that indicates the probability that the domain name is a potential malware domain name.","In accordance with other aspects of this particular exemplary embodiment, the one or more processors, in the event the domain name is identified as a potential malware domain name, may be further configured to perform at least one of the following: deny the request for network data; transmit a notification that the domain name is a potential malware domain name; request authorization to request network data, add to a malware domain blacklist; and build a classifier configured to provide fine-tuned identification of potential malware domain names.","In another particular exemplary embodiment, the techniques may be realized as a method for identifying potential malware domain names. The method may comprise receiving, at a potential malware domain identification module, a request for network data, where the request for network data comprises a domain name. The method may also comprise applying a lexical and linguistic analysis to the domain name. The method may further comprise identifying whether the domain name is a potential malware domain name based on the lexical and linguistic analysis.","In another particular exemplary embodiment, the techniques may be realized as an article of manufacture for identifying potential malware domain names. The article of manufacture may comprise at least one non-transitory processor readable storage medium and instructions stored on the at least one medium. The instructions may be configured to be readable from the at least one medium by at least one processor and thereby cause the at least one processor to operate so as to: receive, at a potential malware domain identification module, a request for network data, wherein the request for network data comprises a domain name; apply a lexical and linguistic analysis to the domain name; and identify whether the domain name is a potential malware domain name based on the lexical and linguistic analysis.","The present disclosure will now be described in more detail with reference to exemplary embodiments thereof as shown in the accompanying drawings.

One or more portions of data may be backed up or archived based on a backup policy and\/or an archive applied, attributes associated with the data source, space available for backup, space available at the data source, or other factors.","According to some embodiments, clients , , and\/or  may contain one or more portions of software for identification of potential malware domain names such as, for example, potential malware domain identification module . As illustrated, one or more portions of potential malware domain identification module  may reside at a network centric location. For example, server A may be a server, a firewall, a gateway, or other network element that may perform one or more actions to identify a potential malware domain. According to some embodiments, network  may be an external network (e.g., the Internet) and server A may be a gateway or firewall between one or more internal components and clients and the external network.","Potential malware domain identification module  may identify potential malware domain names, which may be directed to one or more malware applications. For example, these malware applications may include a fake anti-virus software product, a fake network security software product, a fake anti-spyware software product, a fake computer disk optimization software product, a fake operating system update software product, a fake operating system registry tool software product, and\/or a fake computer optimization software product.","As discussed above, conventional computer security techniques for identifying potential malware domain names may be limited, time-consuming, and resource-intensive. For example, some conventional techniques may be directed to analyzing traffic patterns or observing types of files downloaded from various domain names. These techniques, however, may take large quantities of time and resources. Network analysis may take weeks to identify potential malware domain names, which is not quick enough to respond to certain malware distribution sites that may only exist for a few hours. Analyzing malware may be limited to current known definitions, which again, may lead to potential lag time in response to potential malware domain names, not previously known. Based on an analysis of domain name blacklists, it should be appreciated that many potential malware domain names are fabricated, such as \u201civklhvfyyvf.org\u201d or an unimaginative \u201c777777.ru.\u201d","Potential malware domain identification module  may identify a potential malware domain name based on a variety of techniques. Heuristics may indicate that a domain name have a lower likelihood of being a potential malware domain name when the domain name is shorter, pronounceable, memorable, recognizable, and\/or avoid numbers. Furthermore, a domain name that is based on a known native language or actual visitor may typically reduce the risk of being a potential malware domain name as well. Thus, in general, if a domain name does not follow heuristics and\/or a particular native language and actual visitor, then the domain name may be identified as suspicious or as a potential malware domain name.","Accordingly, potential malware domain identification module  may use lexical analysis and\/or linguistic features to identify potential malware domains.","For lexical analysis, a variety of lexical features of a domain name may be analyzed. These lexical features may include whether the domain name starts\/ends with a number, word-to-digit ratio, hyphen count, and\/or character length. Malware domains may also employ long domains constructed from keywords and hyphens, which may be easily routed for disposal.","Suspicious alphanumeric character sets (e.g., \u201c00,\u201d \u201cvv,\u201d \u201c4,\u201d \u201c1,\u201d \u201c0,\u201d etc.) may also raise flags to potential malware domains since there may be an expectation that legitimate domains minimally use numbers in their domain names. For example, if the domain contains certain numbers such as \u201c0\u201d and \u201c1,\u201d or if the domain begins or ends with digits and\/or if the domain contains a year, the domain may have greater potential to be a malware domain. It should also be appreciated that certain alphanumeric character sequences may also be indicators of suspicious domains since domains including these sequences may be used as to appear as a legitimate character sequence. For instance, \u201cvv\u201d may be used to appear as \u201cw\u201d or \u201c4\u201d may be used to substitute as \u201cfor\u201d in a domain name. Therefore, a potential malware domain \u201cvvellsfago.com\u201d may be used to confuse legitimate domain \u201cwellsfargo.com.\u201d Other patterns and\/or character sequences may be used in the lexical analysis.","The origination of a top level domain may also be used to identify potential malware domains. For example, knowing where the domain name originates may be a powerful tool for detection since it may be generally unlikely that the majority of North American web surfers would download software from .tk, .in, and\/or .cn domains.","In additional to lexical analysis, potential malware domain identification module  may also utilize linguistic features to identify potential malware domains. These linguistic features may include keyword analysis, phonetic analysis, and\/or language modeling.","Keyword analysis may take and separate a top level domain, for example, into a set of constituent keywords and\/or sub-keywords. For example, under this approach \u201cfacebook.com\u201d may become \u201cface book\u201d for the purposes of analysis, and potential malware domain identification module  may then be able to determine whether the domain name is a potential malware domain based on constituent keywords or sub-keywords.","A keyword count may be performed. The keyword count may be two for \u201cfacebook\u201d and ten for \u201civklhvfyyvf.\u201d Potential malware domains may tend to have more keywords than lower risk or legitimate domains.","A large dictionary of English words with their corresponding pronunciations to search the domain name for the keywords that most likely comprise the domain name may also be used. This may be analogous to considering that a long domain name is actually a phrase or sentence and analyzing the long domain accordingly.","Other keyword analysis may include using a sample of known malware sites to identify keywords that are more common in malware sites. This analysis may be achieved using a chi-squared (X2) test, where for each keyword, a statistically significant correlation may be determined between a word \u201cw\u201d and malware domains by comparing two variables: if domain is a malware domain and if domain contains word \u201cw.\u201d A number of these keywords extracted from the domain name may be counted.","It should be appreciated that a chi-squared (X2) test may any statistical hypothesis test where a sampling distribution of the test statistic is a chi-squared distribution when null hypothesis is true, or any in which this is asymptotically true, meaning that the sampling distribution (if the null hypothesis is true) may be made to approximate a chi-squared distribution as closely as desired by making the sample size large enough. Examples of chi-squared tests may include: Pearson's chi-squared test, Yates' correction for continuity, Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel chi-squared test, linear-by-linear association chi-squared test, portnateau test in time-series analysis, and\/or likelihood-ratio tests.","In phonetic analysis, a pronouncing dictionary may be used and an entire number of phonemes across all keywords may be summed up. A phoneme may be a smallest segmental unit of sound employed to form meaningful contrasts between utterances. Thus, for \u201cfacebook\u201d (from facebook.com) there may be six phonemes whereas \u201civklhvfyyvf\u201d (from ivklhvfyyvf.com) may generate twenty-one phonemes. Similar to keyword count described above, lower risk domains may have fewer phonemes and malware domains may have more phonemes. This may lend credence to the fact that good domain names should be easy to remember and pronounceable.","In language modeling, expectation that legitimate websites have memorable domain names, such as facebook.com, google.com or bing.com, may be used. For example, domain names may be composed of words and phrases without whitespace that are common in the language spoken by the web surfer. Language models based on a user's native language may be used to sample representative texts and representing them as three-character sequences (known as trigrams). An N-gram may be a contiguous sequence of N items from a given sequence of text or speech for predicting the next item in such a sequence in the form of a (n\u22121)-order Markov model used in probability, communication theory, computational linguistics, etc. A trigram may be a special case of the N-gram, where N is 3. Accordingly, trigrams may be used in natural language processing for performing statistical analysis of texts, in this case domain names.","Therefore, the keyword \u201cCat,\u201d under the language model analysis, may be represented as the sequence \u201c$$C,\u201d \u201c$Ca,\u201d \u201cCat.\u201d A likelihood or probability of this sample of text being generated by the language model (e.g., English) may be determined. Here, the probability of the language model generated for facebook.com may be greater than the probability for ivklhvfyyvf.org, thereby identifying ivklhvfyyvf.org as a greater malware domain risk.","Language modeling may be built on sampled legitimate domain names. For example, these legitimate domains may be built from various sources, such as Alexa, Download.com, FileHippo, Wikipedia, etc. Use of the log (probability) of the language model may also be used as a feature to identify potential malware domains.","Similar to trigrams, there may be some utility from analyzing keywords in this manner as well.","It should be appreciated machine learning may be used as well. For example, machine learning may be used to help build a classifier in order to perform and fine-tune potential malware domain name detection in potential malware domain identification module .","By using potential malware domain identification module , a number of advantages may be realized. Current techniques for malware detection may require extensive effort. For example, many approaches may require deployment of sensors, constant monitoring, and expert analysis to generate rules. These techniques may require substantial overhead. Techniques according to various embodiments of this disclosure may utilize far less resources to train and deploy. Furthermore, potential malware domain identification module  may provide immediate benefit since new potential malware domains may be more readily identified. Ultimately, the techniques presented may provide greater efficiency, lower cost, and greater reliability in identifying potential malware domain names when compared to traditional methods and techniques.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","200","212","210","214","217","218","220","222","224","226","228","230","232","233","234","237","238","235","290","235","239","240","242","246","212","228","247","212","230","248","212","250","252"]},"Bus  allows data communication between central processor  and system memory , which may include read-only memory (ROM) or flash memory (neither shown), and random access memory (RAM) (not shown), as previously noted.
