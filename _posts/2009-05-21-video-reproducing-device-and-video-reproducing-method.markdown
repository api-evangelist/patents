{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS","EFFECTS OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["The disclosure of Japanese Patent Application No. JP2008-198671 filed on Jul. 31, 2008 including the specification, claims, drawings and abstract is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","The disclosures made herein relate to a device, a program and a method for reproducing a video content including pictures and sounds (voices) on the basis of video data.","As broadly known, there is a video reproducing device including a skip function. The skip function is a function of interrupting, when a predetermined operation is performed while reproducing the video content, the reproduction thereof, then advancing a reproducing point to a position equivalent to predetermined length of seconds (e.g., 30 sec) on a video time basis, and resuming the reproduction. Therefore, if a predetermined operation is conducted just when a reproducing scene is changed over to CM (commercial message) from a TV program, it is possible to skip the CM scene. Further, if the reproduction resumes from a different CM scene even by skipping the CM scene concerned, the user can skip this CM scene by performing the predetermined operation once again. Moreover, the skip function enables the user to skip, e.g., a scene of the TV program in which no interest arises without being limited to the CM scene.","The time for which the reproducing point advances owing to the skip function is, however, fixed, and hence there might be a case where a skipped section (skipped frames) contains a scene that the user desires to view. In this case, it follows that the viewer misses a chance to view the scene without being aware of this scene. Moreover, there might be a case of resuming the reproduction from the middle of the scene that the user desires to view after skipping. In this case, the user must perform a rewinding operation of returning the reproducing point to the head of the scene that the user desires to view.","Furthermore, the video reproducing device includes a back-skip function together with the skip function as the case may be. The back-skip function is a function of interrupting, when the predetermined operation is carried out while reproducing the video content, then returning the reproducing point to a position equivalent to a predetermined length of time (e.g., 5 sec) on the video time base, and resuming the reproduction. For example, when skipping after an elapse of several seconds since the reproducing scene has been changed to the CM from the TV program, it follows that the reproduction often resumes from the middle of the scene of the TV program after skipping. In such a case, the back-skip, if done, enables the user to return the reproducing point to a point anterior to the head of the scene of the TV program.","The time for which the reproducing point returns owing to the back-skip function is, however, fixed, and hence the reproducing point hardly returns to exactly the head of the scene that the viewer desires to view. Consequently, the viewer has no alternative but to view, even if not desired to view, the portion (frames) anterior to the head of the scene that the viewer himself or herself desires to view after skipping.","The following are related arts to the invention.\n\n","According to an aspect of the disclosures made herein, a video reproducing device includes an extracting unit that extracts, when acquiring video data for reproducing a video content including sounds and pictures, a section containing a predetermined type of scene from within the video content related to the acquired video data; a reproducing unit that reproduces, when accepting a predetermined instruction about the video data from an operator, the video content based on the video data; an interrupting unit that interrupts, when receiving a skip instruction from the operator in the midst of reproducing the video content in the reproducing unit, the reproduction of the video content; a specifying unit that specifies a resuming point of the reproduction based on a relationship between the section extracted by the extracting unit and a reproducing point of the video content with respect to the video data of which the reproduction is interrupted by the interrupting unit; and a resuming unit that resumes the reproduction of the video content from the resuming point specified by the specifying unit.","With this configuration, when instructed to skip during the reproduction of the video content, the resuming point is specified based on a relationship between the extracted section of the video content and the reproducing point thereof, and the reproduction of the video content resumes from the resuming point. Herein, if the extracted section of the video content is a section containing, e.g., a highlight scene and when the section includes a point that is forward by a predetermined length of time from the reproducing point on the video time base, an edge point of the head of the section or a vicinal point thereof can be set as the resuming point. Further, if the extracted section of the video content is a section including, e.g., a CM scene and when the section includes a point that is forward by a predetermined length of time from the reproducing point on the video time base, an edge point of the tail of the section or a vicinal point thereof can be set as the resuming point. As a result, a skip over the head of the scene that a user desires to view as in the case of the highlight scene is prevented, and it follows that all the scene that the user desires to view as in the case of the CM scene is skipped at one time, and it therefore follows that the user neither misses a chance to view a want-to-view scene nor views the portion (frames) anterior to the head of the want-to-view scene but can view the video content from the head of the want-to-view scene.","An operation according to the video reproducing device disclosed above may be realized by a video reproducing program or a video reproducing method. Namely, the operation may also be realized by the video reproducing program for making a computer operate as a plurality of means functioning in the same way as the respective units of the video reproducing device described above function, and may also be realized by the video reproducing method by which the computer executes the same functions as those of the respective units by way of a plurality of steps. Moreover, the operation may also be realized by loading a readable-by-computer medium stored with the video reproducing program described above into the computer, and making the computer read and execute the video reproducing program.","The objects and advantages of the invention will be realized and attained by means of the elements and combinations particularly pointed out in the claims.","The embodiment of the disclosures made herein will be described below referring to the drawings in detail. The drawings illustrate a preferred embodiment. It should be understood, however, that the embodiment can be implemented by many different embodiments, and is not limited to the embodiment described herein.","A television system will hereinafter be described with reference to the accompanying drawings by way of an embodiment of a video reproducing device disclosed earlier.","[[Architecture]]",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"The TV system in the embodiment includes a TV signal transmission device , a head end device , an EPG (Electronic Program Guide) server device , and a personal computer with a TV function (which will hereinafter be abbreviated to TV PC) .

The recording control module , when instructed to start recording the on-broadcasting content from the operator via the user interface module , executes the recording, then, when instructed to stop recording, executes the stop, and adds the record of this content to the recording video management table . Moreover, the recording control module performs the timer-based recording of the reservation information (content) reaching the start date (specified by the broadcasting scheduled date and the broadcasting start time) in the registered pieces of reservation information in the reservation information management table . Further, the recording control module , when stopping the timer-based recording, adds the record of the content to the recording video management table that will be explained later on, and deletes the reservation information on the timer-based recording from the reservation information management table . Note that if the TV tuner unit includes the hardware functioning as the encoder, the recording control module employs this encoder.

Each record has fields such as a genre field, a composition field, a highlight field, a CM field and a news field. The genre field is a field recorded with the name of the genre. The composition field is a field recorded with a reproducing point moving method in such a case that a normal moving destination of the reproducing point due to the skip during the reproduction of the video content of the very genre becomes the section (frames) containing a scene of the composition (music). Further, the highlight field is a field recorded with a reproducing point moving method in a case where a normal moving destination of the reproducing point due to the skip during the reproduction of the video content of the very genre becomes the section (frames) containing a highlight scene. The CM field and the news field are recorded with reproducing point moving methods in the same way as the composition field and the highlight field are recorded with those methods. Herein, the moving method is specified by a pattern number. The pattern numbers are given No.  through No. . No.  gives a definition that the reproducing point moving destination is set after 3 sec from the head of the section. Moreover, No.  gives a definition that the reproducing point moving destination is set to the head of the section, and No.  gives a definition that the reproducing point moving destination is set before 1 sec from the tail of the section.

Thereafter, the CPU terminates the skip process related to .","It should be noted that the CPU executing step S corresponds to the resuming unit described above.","[[Operational Effect]]","In the TV PC  according to the embodiment, when the recording control module finishes recording the broadcasted TV program and saves the video data  in the storage unit , the section (frames) containing the predetermined type of scene is extracted, and the section table  (see ) about the video data  is generated (steps S-S). The section table  is stored with the information on the section containing the predetermined type (composition, highlight, CM, news) of scene and with the pattern number associated with the combination of the genre of the TV program related to this video content and the scene type.","Thereafter, when the operator gives the instruction of selecting the arbitrary video content from within the recorded video contents and reproducing the selected video content, the video content is reproduced based on the video data  related to this video content. The picture of the video content is, as depicted in , screened in the picture framing area  displayed together with the time line , and the indicator indicating the reproducing point is displayed on the time line . Furthermore, the section (frames) extracted from within the on-reproducing video content is expressed as the blocks , . It is therefore feasible to grasp where the section containing the predetermined type of scene exists on the video time base, from the positions and the lengths of the leading edges and the tailing edges of the blocks , on the time line  and from internal information.","Moreover, when the operator gives a skip instruction during the reproduction of the video content, the reproduction of the video content is interrupted (step S), then the moving destination of the reproducing point is specified (steps S-S, the first processing loop L), and the reproduction of the video content resumes (step S).","Herein, for example, if the point of time (TE) after 30 sec from the point of time (TS) at which the skip instruction is given exists nowhere in the section extracted from the video content (step S; Yes), it follows that the reproducing point is moved to a 30-sec forward position in the same way as hitherto done (step S).","Further, for example, in the case of reproducing the video content of the TV program of which the genre is categorized as sports, if the point of time (TE) after 30 sec from the point of time (TS) at which to give the skip instruction exists in the section with \u201chighlight\u201d defined as its scene type (which is the section having \u201c0\u201d as the pattern number) (step S; No, S; No, S; Yes, S; Yes), as illustrated in , the point of time after 3 sec from the leading edge of this section is specified as the moving destination of the reproducing point (step S), and the reproducing point is moved to that point of time (step S). In this case, a time width of the skipped portion (skipped frames) is often shorter than 30 sec, with the result that the operator neither overlooks the head of the want-to-view scene nor has a necessity for adjusting a return quantity back to the resuming point by performing a back-skip.","Moreover, for example, in the case of reproducing the video content of the TV program of which the genre is categorized as music, if the point of time (TE) after 30 sec from the point of time (TS) at which to give the skip instruction exists in the section with \u201cmusic\u201d defined as its scene type (which is the section having \u201c1\u201d as the pattern number) (step S; No, S; No, S; Yes, S; No), as illustrated in , the point of time coincident with the leading edge of this section is specified as the moving destination of the reproducing point (step S), and the reproducing point is moved to that point of time (step S). In this case, a time width of the skipped portion (skipped frames) is shorter than 30 sec, with the result that the operator neither overlooks the head of the want-to-view scene nor has the necessity for adjusting the return quantity back to the resuming point by performing the back-skip.","Furthermore, for example, in the case of reproducing overall genres of TV programs, if the point of time (TE) after 30 sec from the point of time (TS) at which to give the skip instruction exists in the section with \u201cCM\u201d or \u201cnews\u201d as its scene type (which is the section having \u201c2\u201d as the pattern number) (step S; No, S; Yes, S; Yes), as illustrated in , the point of time before 1 sec from the tailing edge of this section is specified as the moving destination of the reproducing point (step S), and the reproducing point is moved to that point of time (step S). In this case, a time width of the skipped portion (skipped frames) is often longer than 30 sec, with the result that the operator neither clicks twice or more the 30-sec skip button  nor has the necessity for adjusting the return quantity back to the resuming point by performing the back-skip.","Moreover, for example, in the case of reproducing overall genres of TV programs, also when the tailing edge of the section (which is the section having \u201c2\u201d as the pattern number) of which the scene type is \u201cCM\u201d or \u201cnews\u201d exists between the point of time (TS) at which to give the skip instruction and the point of time (TE) after 30 sec (step S; No, S; Yes, S; Yes), the point of time before  sec from the tailing edge of this section is specified as the moving destination of the reproducing point (step S), and the reproducing point is moved to that point of time (step S). In this case, the time width of the skipped portion (skipped frames) is shorter than 30 sec, with the result that the operator neither misses a chance to view the want-to-view scene nor has the necessity for adjusting the return quantity back to the resuming point by performing the back-skip.","Further, with respect to the section containing the scene of \u201ccomposition (piece of music)\u201d in the TV program of which the genre is categorized into \u201cdrama\u201d or \u201canimation\u201d, in the same way as in the section containing the scene of \u201cCM\u201d or \u201cnews\u201d, if the point of time (TE) after 30 sec from the point of time (TS) at which to give the skip instruction exists in the section of \u201ccomposition\u201d or if the tailing edge of the section of \u201ccomposition\u201d exists between the point of time (TS) at which to give the skip instruction and the point of time (TE) after 30 sec, the reproducing point is moved to a position equivalent to 1 sec anterior from the tailing edge of the section of \u201ccomposition\u201d.","[[Explanations Concerning Units]]","In the embodiment discussed above, the respective units -in the TV PC  may each be constructed of a software component and a hardware component and may also be constructed of only the hardware component.","The software component can be exemplified by an interface program, a driver program, a table and data and by a combination of some of these components.
