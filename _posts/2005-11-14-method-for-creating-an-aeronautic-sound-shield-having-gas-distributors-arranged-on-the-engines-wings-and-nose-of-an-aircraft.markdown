title: Method for creating an aeronautic sound shield having gas distributors arranged on the engines, wings, and nose of an aircraft
abstract: The present invention blocks and/or attenuates the upstream travel of acoustic disturbances or sound waves from a flight vehicle or components of a flight vehicle traveling at subsonic speed using a local injection of a high molecular weight gas. Additional benefit may also be obtained by lowering the temperature of the gas. Preferably, the invention has a means of distributing the high molecular weight gas from the nose, wing, component, or other structure of the flight vehicle into the upstream or surrounding air flow. Two techniques for distribution are direct gas injection and sublimation of the high molecular weight solid material from the vehicle surface. The high molecular weight and low temperature of the gas significantly decreases the local speed of sound such that a localized region of supersonic flow and possibly shock waves are formed, preventing the upstream travel of sound waves from the flight vehicle.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates generally modifying the local speed of sound characteristics of a gas or fluid flow, more particularly to modifying these characteristics using the distribution of a high molecular weight and\/or low temperature gas into to the flow, and most particularly to attenuating the acoustic disturbance and\/or noise associated with aircraft by modifying the local speed of sound characteristics using high molecular weight and\/or low temperature gas upstream of the aircraft.","2. Description of the Related Art","Reduction of noise generated by jet engines has become an important aspect of aircraft design. Sound waves from aircraft traveling at subsonic speed propagate in all directions relative to the aircraft. The reduction of noise generated by aircraft has obvious benefits, including reducing noise pollution and, thereby, reducing safety risks to persons in the vicinity of aircraft. Also, sound waves have a tendency to contribute to wear and fatigue of aircraft components.","Many technical solutions have been employed in order to reduce noise generated by aircraft. These include using physical barriers attached to aircraft in order to provide a physical shield to block or attenuate sound waves and injecting gases directly into the jet engine exhaust in order to suppress noise. These solutions provide some reduction to noise levels, but normally result in some reduction in aircraft efficiency or performance. In addition, all of these solutions relate to decreasing sound waves only \u201cdownstream\u201d from the aircraft, but do not address sound waves emanating \u201cupstream\u201d from the aircraft.","Therefore, it is desired to provide a relatively low-cost apparatus and method to attenuate or block aircraft noise emanating in any direction from an aircraft, without affecting aircraft performance.","The invention proposed herein comprises a device and method for blocking an\/or attenuating the upstream movement of acoustic disturbances or sound waves emanating from an aircraft flying at subsonic speeds. By blocking the acoustic disturbances, the invention eliminates or reduces the sound perceived by an approaching aircraft.","Accordingly, it is an object of this invention to provide a method to block or attenuate acoustic disturbances or sound waves emanating from an aircraft flying at subsonic speeds.","It is a further object of this invention to provide a shield for acoustic disturbances or sound waves emanating from an aircraft that does not significantly degrade aircraft performance.","It is yet a further object of this invention to provide a method to reduce noise from an aircraft that is relatively low-cost.","This invention meets these and other objectives related to reducing aircraft sound by providing a device and method to block the upstream travel of sound waves by the formation of local supersonic flow and possibly shock waves due to an increase in the local speed of sound. By distributing a high molecular weight, and preferably, low temperature gas into the air flow upstream or around an aircraft or flight vehicle, the local speed of sound is greatly decreased, thereby producing local areas of supersonic flow. Shock waves form upstream and around the aircraft structure in these pockets of supersonic flow. The acoustic disturbances and\/or sound waves from the flight vehicle can be blocked and\/or attenuated with the appropriate positioning of gas injection locations.","In addition, the pockets of supersonic flow and local shock waves alter the pressure distribution around the aircraft. This change in the pressure distribution leads to changes in the aerodynamic and stability and control characteristics of the aircraft. This could be used advantageously to impart forces and moments to the aircraft, providing an alternative method of controlling the aircraft without the use of conventional, moving control surfaces.","The invention, as embodied herein, comprises a device and method for blocking and\/or attenuating acoustic waves emanating from aircraft. The invention also provides a method for controlling an aircraft by altering the pressure distribution around the aircraft.","In general, the invention provides for distributing a high molecular weight gas (\u201cHMW gas\u201d) into the airflow adjacent\/around the aircraft. As used herein, the term \u201chigh molecular weight gas\u201d means a gas having a molecular weight of above 100. The HMW gas creates a local area or pocket wherein the speed of sound is reduced, compared to the surrounding airflow. Due to the reduction of the speed of sound in the local area, local areas of supersonic flow, and possibly shock waves, will be formed. Acoustic disturbances or sound waves emanating from the aircraft will be blocked or attenuated by the local areas of supersonic flow. The HMW gas may be distributed into the airflow at a position, or multiple positions, where the user determines it is appropriate to block acoustic waves emanating from the aircraft.","In addition to blocking acoustic waves, the local areas of supersonic flow and local shock waves alter the pressure distribution around the aircraft. By altering the pressure distribution around aircraft, changes in the aerodynamic and stability and control characteristics of the aircraft occur. Thus, by changing these characteristics, forces may be imparted to portions of the aircraft in order to alter the aircraft's direction.","Referring to , the invention comprises one or more gas distributors  positioned on a structure  of an aircraft  traveling at subsonic speeds. The gas distributors  distribute a HMW gas  to an area where the user desires to provide reduction in noise created by the aircraft . The HMW gas  decreases the speed of sound in a local area  where it is distributed. The size of the local area  is dependant upon the amount and speed at which the HMW gas  is distributed, which may be selected by one skilled in the art consistent with the disclosure herein.","In operation, the HMW gas  is distributed to form a local area  of supersonic flow and possibly shock waves due to a decrease in the local area speed of sound. Acoustic waves  emanating from the aircraft  are blocked or attenuated by the local area  of supersonic flow and shock waves.","The gas distributors  may employ any mechanism that provides for distributing the HMW gas  to create local areas  of supersonic flow sufficient in size to provide the desired attenuation of noise from portions of or from an entire aircraft . Two preferred gas distributor  mechanisms are an injection system  (shown in and ) and a sublimation system  (shown in ).","One preferred injection system  is a direct injection system as shown in . For the direct gas injection system, typical components include a gas storage tank , a gas injection valve , and a gas injector . In this system, the HMW gas  is stored at high pressure in the gas storage tank  and the gas injection valve  is opened to feed the HMW gas  through the gas injector  into the air flow. Gas injection pressures may be controlled by a regulator, thus controlling the gas penetration distance and dispersion.","Another preferred injection system  is a transverse injection system as shown in . The components of a transverse injection system include the same components described above for a direct injection system except the gas injector  is replaced by an extended boom  that extends from the structure  and distributes the HMW gas  through one or more injectors  at the end of the boom .","A preferred sublimation system  is shown in . This system includes a coating  that is applied to the structure  that remains adhered, in a chemically unaltered form, to the structure  until the aircraft  is airborne. As the aircraft  travels, the coating  sublimes directly into a HMW gas . The coating  may be covered prior to use of the aircraft  to ensure that it does not sublime prematurely (prior to use of the aircraft). In such a system , the coating  would be made of a liquid\/solid version of the HMW gas  material.","The structure  or portion of an aircraft where the gas distributors  are attached may be selected depending upon the type and location of sound emanating from the aircraft  one desires to attenuate. For certain applications of the present invention, it may be desired to ensure that acoustic waves from the aircraft  do not travel upstream of the aircraft  to prevent said waves from reaching persons in front of the aircraft . For these applications, it would be preferred to place the gas distributors  on the nose and\/or leading edges of the aircraft . To specifically attenuate engine noise, the gas distributors  may be placed on the engines or on the wings adjacent to the engines. To provide control of the aircraft  through altering pressure distribution as described above, gas distributors  may be placed on or near the wings, tail section, or nose of the aircraft .","A HMW gas  has a molecular weight of at least 100. For comparison, air has a molecular weight of 29. It is preferred that the HMW gas  has a molecular weight above 120 and it is most preferred that the HMW gas  has a molecular weight above 140. Many monatomic and polyatomic gases and gas mixtures may be employed as HMW gases  to be used in the present invention. Some characteristics favorable to integration with the invention include being colorless, odorless, non-toxic, nonflammable, chemically inert, and thermally stable. Preferred candidate gases should also be readily available from commercial sources and relatively inexpensive.","Examples of such HMW gases  are monatomic Xenon, Xe, (molecular weight of 131) and polyatomic n-perfluorobutane, CF, (molecular weight of 238). Other refrigerant gases, such as R134A (molecular weight of 102) and R125 (molecular weight of 125), may also be considered. The use of gas mixtures may be especially interesting in terms of the capability of formulating \u201ccustom\u201d HMW gases  with desired properties.","One particular preferred HMW gas  for the present invention is sulfur hexafluoride, SF, (molecular weight of 146), which was used for some of the calculations below to further describe the present invention. It possesses many characteristics favorable to integration with the invention, such as being colorless, odorless, non-toxic, nonflammable, chemically inert, and thermally stable. SFis readily available from commercial sources and is inexpensive. SFis commonly used as an insulating gas in electrical equipment and as an etchant in the semiconductor industry. It is chemically inert and stable in the presence of most materials to temperatures of about 500\u00b0 C. (932\u00b0 F.). At atmospheric pressure, SFsublimes directly from a solid to a gas.","It is also preferred that the HMW gas  be provided at a temperature below ambient. As used herein, ambient temperature is the temperature of air outside of an aircraft . As shown further below, the reduction in the speed of sound is increased as the temperature of the HMW gas  decreases below ambient.","The following briefly describes the mathematical basis of the present invention.","The local speed of sound, a, is defined in Equation 1, where \u03b3 is the ratio of specific heats, Ris the specific gas constant for air, and T is the local temperature.\n\n=\u221a{square root over (\u03b3)}\u2003\u2003(EQN. 1)\n","The local Mach number, M, is related to the local velocity, V, and speed of sound using Equation 2.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mi":"M","mo":"=","mfrac":{"mi":["V","a"]}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":"EQN","mo":[".","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},"mn":"2"}}}]}}}}},"The specific gas constant can be related to the universal gas constant, R, and the molecular weight, MW, using Equation 3.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002","num":"00002"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["R","air"]},"mo":"=","mfrac":{"msub":{"mi":["R","universal"]},"mi":"MW"}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":"EQN","mo":[".","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},"mn":"3"}}}]}}}}},"Substituting Equation 3 into Equation 1, the speed of sound is given by Equation 4.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00003","num":"00003"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mi":"a","mo":"=","msqrt":{"mrow":{"mi":["\u03b3","T"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mfrac":{"msub":{"mi":["R","universal"]},"mi":"MW"}}}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":"EQN","mo":[".","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},"mn":"4"}}}]}}}}},"For constant values of the ratio of specific heats and the universal gas constant, the speed of sound may be decreased by increasing the molecular weight and decreasing the temperature.
