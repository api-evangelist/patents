{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Networks can provide communication paths to access a plurality of electronic information. One example of such a network is the Internet, which can provide communication paths to access a plurality of web sites. The web sites can be formed of a number of individual web pages that are linked together. With the proliferation of web pages, determining the similarity of various web pages can be useful. Similar web pages can include identical web pages, and may include some web pages that are non-identical. Determining identical web pages can be a straight forward process. Determining whether non-identical web pages are similar can be more challenging.","Examples of the present disclosure may include methods, systems, and computer readable media with executable instructions, and\/or logic. According to one or more examples of the present disclosure, an example method for determining document structure similarity can include segmenting path sequences of Document Object Model (DOM) trees from a number of web pages into B components. Path signals corresponding to the path sequences are determined based on a count of the occurrences of particular paths in the Bcomponent, and unique path signals are transformed into discrete wavelet signals. The discrete wavelet signals are analyzed at multiple DOM tree resolution levels.","As used herein, the term \u201cincludes\u201d means includes but not limited to, the term \u201cincluding\u201d means including but not limited to. The term \u201cbased on\u201d means based at least in part on. The term \u201cdocument,\u201d as used herein, includes but not limited to, electronic files such as web pages and word processing files, among others.","This disclosure provides one or more systems and methods for determining document structure similarity using discrete wavelet transformation. Determining document structure similarity using discrete wavelet transformation according to examples of the present disclosure can be utilized as an auxiliary mechanism to a pool of web pages (represented as a tree structured data) to rapidly locate particular DOM trees given a particular web page. The systems and methods described herein for determining similarity can not only achieve high precision, but also can result in increased computing speed.","According to examples of the present disclosure, such systems and methods can determine similarity based on a whether documents, such as web pages, are approximately equivalent. Similar web pages need not be completely identical to be similar. Instead web pages may be identical in part, or possess certain characteristics of interest that are alike. According to some examples of the present disclosure, a measure of similarity can be determined. According to various examples, the measure of similarity can be a numerical value, such as a difference of numerical values computed for each document. According to certain examples, the measure of similarity can be a binary indication of one or more characteristics of the document structures matching or not matching. Determining similarity between two documents, including determining document structure similarity, can be most useful where the determination can be made in real time. Thus, speed in determining document structure similarity can be advantageous. To that end, computational efficiency can be adjusted commensurate with the precision of the similarity determination.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["120","120"]},"The DOM is a cross-platform and language-independent convention for representing and interacting with objects in various programming languages, such as HTML, eXtensible Hyper Text Markup Language (XHTML), and eXtensible Markup Language (XML) documents, among others. Aspects of the DOM, such as its elements, may be addressed and manipulated within the syntax of the programming language being used. The public interface of a DOM can be specified in its Application Programming Interface (API).","An HTML page can be rendered in a browser, for example. Web browsers rely on layout engines to parse HTML into a DOM. The browser assembles all the objects that are contained in the HTML page and downloaded from a web-server in its memory. Once completed, the browser then renders these objects in the browser window. The HTML objects, which belong within the DOM, can have descending relationship with each other. The topmost object in the DOM can specify the navigator (i.e., browser) itself, for example. The next level in the DOM can specify the browser's window, and the next level can specify the particular electronic information displayed in the browser's window, for example.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["120","120","122","122","122","124","128","130","120","120"]},"A particular DOM tree, such as DOM tree , can have many paths that share portions of a path with other paths. For example, DOM tree  has several additional paths such as the path starting at HTML node  through body node  and division node  to image node . DOM tree  further has a path starting at HTML node  through body node  and division node  to text node . These two example paths differ only in their respective leaf nodes (e.g., image node  versus text node ) but are otherwise share a portion of each path that includes the HTML node , body node , and division node . DOM tree  can have additional paths from HTML node  through body node  that are not shown in , as indicated in  at , in addition to the path to the text leaf node at the far right of DOM tree . The methods of the present disclosure can be applied to tree structure different from the example DOM tree  shown in .","One method for determining whether two documents are similar can be to determine if their respective corresponding DOM trees are identical. Tree matching methods can be used for comparing DOM trees for similarity in web page clustering and web wrapper induction. Among them, tree edit distance (TED) and simple tree matching (STM) are two previous approaches. These previous approaches are both full tree matching methodologies. That is, each of these previous approaches attempt to determine whether trees are identical. They can be accurate but can also be computationally intensive since determining identical trees can involve evaluation of each node and edge.","Previous approaches, such as a space vector model (e.g., cosine distance, Euclidean distance), toward matching approximations may take into account a number of times a portion of a tree (e.g., DOM tree) appears in the trees being compared, with positional information being disregarded. Disregarding positional information can render such previous approaches un-sensitive to structural differences. Such previous approaches can produce inaccurate results for at least the reason that a same quantity of tree branches can be arranged in multiple ways to produce different tree structures. Ignoring positional information, therefore, introduces errors that cannot be detected from only branch portion occurrence analysis. Therefore, such previous approaches may not be well suited for DOM tree similarity detection applications.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["202","218","204","204","202","106"]},"The computing system shown in  can also include a path sequence segmentation module  to segment the path sequences into B equal components, and determine path signals corresponding to the path sequences based on a count of the occurrences of particular path sequences in the Bcomponent. The path sequence segmentation module  can receive as inputs, the path sequences  from the HTML parser , and output path signals . A Harr wavelet transformation module  can receive the path signals , transforming unique path signals into discrete wavelet signals , for example. An analyzer  can receive the wavelet signals  and compute a cumulative distance value of the discrete wavelet signals at multiple DOM tree resolution levels, from which a page similar decision  can be output.","The computing system shown in  can be a computing system such as is discussed further with respect to . With respect to the components of the computing system shown in , each of the HTML parser , path sequence segmentation module , Harr wavelet transformation module , and\/or analyzer  can be individual apparatuses, such as a computing device including a processor coupled to a non-transitory computer-readable medium having computer-readable instructions stored thereon. The processor can execute the computer-readable instructions to perform the respective function. The components of the computing system shown in  can also be logical modules, which may be implemented by hardware and\/or embodied on computer readable medium, for example, and executed by a common processor.","The HTML parser  shown in  can, for each web page, parse the HTML defining a respective web page, thereby converting the respective web page into a DOM Tree. The HTML parser  can further convert the resulting DOM tree into a sequence of paths (i.e., path sequences). For example, the DOM tree shown in  can be converted into path sequences T=[html\/head\/title\/text, html\/body\/div\/image, . . . , html\/body\/text]. For convenience and faster processing, the sequence paths may be converted into numbers (e.g., hexadecimal values) with a hashing function. As an example, the sequence paths may be represented in this manner as T=[10AE, 13E1, . . . , 2F1E]. The numerically-represented sequence paths may be more easily manipulated further by digital processing resources.","The various components of the computing system shown in  are discussed in more detail in conjunction with .  illustrates a method for determining document structure similarity using discrete wavelet transformation in accordance with one or more examples of the present disclosure. More particularly  illustrates an example of how the path signals can be obtained.","The path sequences, from the HTML parser  shown in , for a number of web pages can be summarized in a path-page matrix , such as is shown in . The number of web pages can be, for example, a web page collection, associated with one or more web sites. Path-page matrix  can include a number of rows corresponding to web pages  (e.g., Page, Page, . . . , Page) and a number of columns corresponding to a distinct path  (e.g., Path, Path, . . . , Path). The path-page matrix  can indicate how many times the various paths occur within a DOM tree corresponding to a particular web page. The value for a particular path (e.g., Path, Path, . . . , Path) entered in the path-page matrix  can also indicate which of the various paths occur, and which paths do not occur, within a DOM tree corresponding to the particular web page.","A particular row of matrix  can correspond to a particular web page. For example, a row  of path-page matrix  corresponding to web page X is shown extracted from the path-page matrix  in . Row  can include a number of entries that numerically summarize the characteristics of each unique path  (e.g., Path, Path, . . . , Path) of a path sequence for a particular web page  (e.g., web page X). Each of the number of entries in row  can correspond to a unique path  (e.g., Path, Path, . . . , Path). For example, first entry - corresponds to Path, and so on, through the mentry -, which corresponds to Path.","The path sequence segmentation module  shown in  can divide a path sequence  into B (e.g., 8) equal components, as shown in . Each path sequence can be converted to a path signal by counting the occurrences of a particular path p in the Bcomponent. For example, the first component - shown in  reflects that path p occurs 2 times in the first component. As is further shown, path p occurs 0 times in the second component (e.g., X), 2 times in the third component (e.g., X), 1 times in each of the fourth, fifth and sixth components (e.g., X, X, and X), 0 times in the seventh component (e.g., X), and 0 times in the eighth component - (e.g., X). The cumulative quantity of occurrences (e.g., 2+0+2+1+1+1+0+0=7) for the B equal components of a path sequence can be entered path-page matrix  for the entry - corresponding to Pathof Page, as shown.","The characteristics for the path sequence Pathof Pageare also shown graphically in  by graph . Graph  represents the path sequence, and is divided into 8 equal components, with divisions  defining the various components along graph . The dots  show the position of the path p in the path sequence. For example, path p occurs twice in the first component (e.g., left-most portion) of graph . Again, the signal of path p (i.e., signal path) is f=[2 0 2 1 1 1 0 0], as indicated by the quantity and placement of dots along graph .","According to some examples of the present disclosure, weighting schemes can be used in arriving at a signal path from a path sequence, based on the properties of a certain tree and path. However, for the example discussed here, such weighting schemes are not implemented.","The Harr wavelet transformation module  shown in  can function to transform unique path signals into discrete wavelet signals, such as Haar wavelet signals. Each path signal undergoes a discrete wavelet transform, which transforms the path signal into a wavelet signal. For example, the discrete wavelet transform can be a Haar wavelet transform. The Haar wavelet is a single cycle of the square wave having a period of 1. Haar wavelet analysis is similar to Fourier analysis in that it allows a target function over an interval to be represented in terms of an orthonormal function basis.

The transformed Haar wavelet signal vector  includes B (e.g., 8) components, corresponding to the B components of path sequence . The B (e.g., 8) components of the transformed Haar wavelet signal vector are y1, . . . , y8. For this example, and as indicated in , the 8 components of Haar wavelet signal vector  are y1, y2, y3, y4, y5, y6, y7, and y8. The example illustrated in  shows that component y1 has a value of 7, as indicated at -, and that component y8 has a value of 0, as indicated at -, among other entries.

This can be determined by finding the dot product of the path signal vector and the Haar wavelet transform matrix.","Continuing with the previous example, the Haar transform is used to provide the different levels of resolution of a path signal.

Depending on the situation, one or more paths of interest, rather than all paths, can be used in arriving at the similarity decision between DOM trees. Paths of interest can be identified, for example, according to a path weighting scheme.","The matrix multiplication can cause the discrete wavelet transformation to be of order O(N) for signals of N components. According to some examples of the present disclosure, the wavelet transform can be reduced to an order of O(N) so as to speed up the transform process, such as by using a method proposed by Mallet in 2001.","The analyzer , shown in , can function to compute distance on multi level resolutions, which computes the distance values for every common path of two DOM trees, and then sums the distance values for the respective DOM trees as a cumulative (e.g., final) DOM tree distance.

That is, component B of each path of two DOM trees can be compared as a basis for determining similarity of the corresponding documents. This method can reduce the entire DOM tree comparison to a particular portion comparison. According to other examples of the present disclosure, different components in different paths can be chosen to compare, which can be a form of proximity measure.","According to various examples of the present disclosure, two signals can be compared for similarity by checking from the top down (e.g., initiating the comparison from the root node towards a leaf node).

That is, the methodology of the present disclosure behaves in the same manner as the vector space model when B equals 1. In practice, some experiments have been conducted on several small data sets on YAHOO!\u00ae (internet) news pages and AMAZON\u00ae (internet store) pages. The results show that the method of the present disclosure can determine the tree similarity with high precision. A typical two tree similarity decision time for the conducted experiments performed is 0.417 s for an exact tree matching algorithm, 0.031 s for vector space method and 0.047 s for the example method of the present disclosure using eight components. Reducing the number of components can reduce the running time in a linear fashion.","Using wavelets for document similarity determinations can provide a new perspective by extracting the positions at different resolutions.
