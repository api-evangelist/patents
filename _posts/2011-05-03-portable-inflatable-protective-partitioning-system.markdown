{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["GOVERNMENTAL INTEREST","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF INVENTION"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured, used and licensed by or for the United States Government.","This invention relates to a device and methods for containing hazardous airborne contaminates and more specifically to a portable inflatable, protective partitioning system and method of operating the system for quick, efficient management of the airborne hazardous environment.","The present invention particularly relates to a device to contain hazardous airborne contaminates released following the explosion and\/or dissemination of Chemical Warfare Agents (CWA), Toxic Industrial Chemicals (TIC), smoke, and toxic by-products, and to be capable of quick, efficient management of the airborne hazardous environment. In order to ensure the safety of first responders, a protective barrier, effectively blocking the movement of the hazardous clouds, could be employed.","Previously, plastic sheets and tape were used to create barriers to the indoor spread of airborne materials at the site of an event. Setup of plastic barriers using tape is time consuming and labor intensive. In harsh conditions with high humidity, where soot or solids in the air are prevalent, the ability of the tape to adhere to surfaces is greatly reduced. These barricades do not allow for safe, effective passage across the barrier and likewise are deficient in providing a concealed region for decontamination protocols.","A portable, inflatable, protective, partitioning system (PIPPS) according to the present invention forms a barrier in a location such as a hallway and provides a safe, effective passage across the barrier to form a concealed region for decontamination protocols. The PIPPS includes an inflatable separation device that can be built from a high-grade, synthetic material, and is composed of an inflatable support section which contains two doorways separated by an inner compartment, and an outer, expandable bladder. Inflation of the inflatable separation device forms an enclosed interior space with a cover that envelops the inflated support frame and obstructs the progression of hazardous clouds by dividing a structural space with the cover into two areas, creating a partition blocking the majority of the vertical surface area of the hall. Subsequent inflation of the perimeter bladder between the cover and exterior surfaces of the structural space forms an air-tight seal against the walls. Utilization of the internal compartment of the support section allows first responders to enter and exit the contaminated areas. Positive or negative pressure can be used to purge the passageway of tainted air or allow first responders to proceed through while not allowing the hazardous cloud containing hazardous airborne contaminants that were released following the explosion and\/or dissemination of Chemical Warfare Agents (CWA), Toxic Industrial Chemicals (TIC), smoke, and\/or toxic by-products, to advance. The inflatable separation device is easy to inflate and operational within minutes of deployment, and portable enough to be moved to other locations quickly.","The portable inflatable protective partitioning system of the present invention is self supporting and self contained.","The portable inflatable protective partitioning system incorporates a rigid inner section that maintains the systems conformation and an inflatable bladder that allows for adaptation to a number of abstract applications, such as hallways, stairwells, tunnels or mobile tractor trailer systems.","The PIPPS provides a rapidly erected barrier with a substantially air-tight seal to mitigate the diffusion and convective transport of hazardous materials and air throughout a building structure. The addition of a portable airlock to a barrier is a large advantage to containment of smoke or airborne material, since it provides ingress and egress mechanisms that control the flow of the airborne environment. Furthermore, creating a barrier to allow decontamination and air purification before transport between separated sides can prevent the dermal and inhalation spread of contaminating substances. Another novel feature of the barrier is its use of a strong, inflatable frame to give it structural rigidity coupled with its inflatable bladder which can create an air-tight seal within a vast array of quadrilateral geometries to accommodate, e.g., hallways, stairwells, elevator shafts, and air ducts. This provides for a solid foundation and universal function, within applications which were previously ignored. The PIPPS is also physically non-taxing to implement, in that the majority of the work is done by a compressor, unlike in previous barrier installments, where bodily exertion was an acceptable consequence of the method. The hallway barrier provides a protective partition from hazardous materials, establishes an integrated decontamination effort, aids in casualty relief, and efficiently contains the incident.","According to the present invention, the PIPPS comprises an inflatable support frame, a cover that envelops the support frame and forms, an enclosed interior space when the support frame is inflated, and an inflatable perimeter sealing bladder disposed about the cover and adapted to form a seal between the cover and exterior surfaces of a structural space when the support frame and the sealing bladder are inflated. The inflatable support frame may include interconnected, inflatable tubes, wherein the interconnected inflatable tubes are constructed of material selected for durability, elasticity, high chemical and heat resistance and its ability to hold air. The interconnected inflatable tubes may include upper tubes, side tubes and bottom tubes interconnected so that the support frame generally forms a rectangular, box-like structure.","Also according to the present invention, the cover that envelops the support frame and forms an enclosed interior space may have front and rear walls and side walls and a ceiling and a floor. The cover may be formed of a material selected for durability, high chemical and heat resistance and its ability to prevent gas from flowing there through. The cover may be secured to the support frame so that upon inflation of the support frame, the cover forms generally rectangular front and rear walls, generally rectangular side walls and a generally rectangular ceiling and a generally rectangular floor. The front and, rear walls may each have a doorway that can be closed and sealed with a flap shaped door and through arms to change air within the interior-section.","Still further according to the present invention, the inflatable perimeter sealing bladder may be attached to the side walls and the ceiling of the cover. The inflatable perimeter sealing bladder may also be removably attached to the side walls and the ceiling of the cover. When inflated the inflatable perimeter sealing bladder forms an airtight seal against the surfaces of the structural space being divided by the cover. The present invention further includes a system for inflating the inflatable support frame, and the inflatable perimeter sealing bladder, including a means for directing compressed air through the inlet of a first pressure relief valve to inflate the support frame to a first required pressure and a means for directing compressed air from the first pressure relief valve and through a second pressure relief valve to inflate the bladder and vent extra air flow so that the bladder remains at a second required pressure adapted to form the seal between the cover and exterior surfaces. This inflation system may entail directing compressed air through the inlet of a pressure relief valve and then through a first check valve into an inflatable frame so that the frame is inflated to a first required pressure such that a cover that envelops the support frame forms an enclosed interior space. The compressed air is then directed from the first pressure relief valve and through a second required pressure relief valve and then through a second check valve to inflate an inflatable bladder to a second pressure and vent extra-air flow so that the bladder remains at the second pressure. When inflated according to this system the bladder forms a seal between the cover and exterior surfaces of a structural space. The means for directing compressed air according to this system may be an air compressor.","The present invention further encompasses a method of sealing off a structural space by inflating an inflatable support frame having a plurality of interconnected, inflatable tubes, forming an enclosed interior space with a cover that envelops the inflated support frame, dividing the structural space with the cover into two areas, and inflating a perimeter sealing bladder disposed between the cover and exterior surfaces of the structural space to form an air-tight seal between the two areas of the structural space separated by the cover.","Further according to the present invention, the step of inflating the inflatable support frame includes inflating inflatable upper tubes, side tubes and bottom tubes interconnected so that the inflatable support frame generally forms a rectangular, box-like structure.","Still further according to the present invention, the enclosed interior space is formed with a cover that envelops and is secured to the inflated support frame so that upon inflation of the support frame, the cover forms generally rectangular front and rear walls, generally rectangular side walls and a generally rectangular ceiling and a generally rectangular floor.","Yet further according to the present invention, inflating the inflatable support frame and the inflatable sealing bladder, comprises the steps of: directing compressed air through the inlet of a first pressure relief valve to inflate the support frame to a first pressure; and directing compressed air from the first pressure relief valve and through a second pressure relief valve to inflate the bladder and vent extra air flow so that the bladder remains at a second pressure adapted to form the seal between the cover and exterior surfaces.","Also according to the present invention, inflating the inflatable support frame and the inflatable sealing bladder, comprises the steps of: directing compressed air from an air compressor to inflate the support frame to a first pressure; and directing compressed air from the air compressor to inflate the bladder to a second pressure adapted to form the seal between the cover and exterior surfaces.","Referring to , there is illustrated a perspective view of the portable, inflatable, protective; partitioning system (PIPPS)  of the present invention in an inflated state, but without the outside bladder for easier understanding of the invention. PIPPS  can be stored and carried in a bag  as shown in . The PIPPS  can be easily transported and unpacked from carrying case  at the location where it is needed. Initially, PIPPS  is laid out flat on the floor within the confines of the space, such as a hallway, to be contained.","PIPPS  includes an inflatable support frame , as shown in detail in  and described hereinafter, consisting of a plurality of rugged, inflatable upper tubes ,, inflatable side tubes ,,,, and inflatable bottom tubes , . In addition, there are upper inflatable connector tubes ,, side inflatable connector tubes , and bottom inflatable connector tubes and . All of the inflatable tubes are secured and interconnected in a manner that the same air source can be used to inflate all of them simultaneously. The inflatable upper tubes ,, inflatable side tubes ,,,, inflatable bottom tubes , are interconnected so that support frame  is generally in the shape of a rectangular, box-like structure. In one embodiment of the invention, the support frame , when fully inflated, measures three feet wide, seven feet high and ten feet wide. Upon inflation, support frame  supports PIPPS , preferably within an enclosed structural space such as for example, a room, corridor or hallway, ultimately to form a barrier between areas of the structural space located on opposite sides of the support frame. In accordance with the present invention, the support frame expands upon inflation to cover the majority of the surface area for the opening of the enclosed structural space, leaving only the crevices and unique geometries for the bladder, described in detail, hereinafter, to expand and fill.","As shown in  and discussed hereinafter, it can be understood that the support frame  forms a continuous network of interconnected tubes such that all tubes can be fully inflated by the channeling of air through a point on any of the tubes. The inflatable tubes of the support frame  can be constructed of material selected for durability, elasticity, high chemical and heat resistance, and its gas impermeability.","PIPPS , as shown in , has an external cover  constructed of a material that completely covers the support frame  to form an enclosed interior space  when the frame is inflated. The external cover  can be permanently attached to the support frame  so that upon inflation of the support frame, the external surface forms generally rectangular front and rear walls , , respectively, generally rectangular side walls ,, respectively, top wall or ceiling  and bottom wall or floor . The material of the cover can be constructed of a material selected for durability, high chemical and heat resistance and its gas impermeability.","In the front and rear walls , , respectively, which form the two sides of the barrier , are located doorways ,. Each of the doorways , can be closed and sealed with flap shaped door ,, respectively. The doors can be closed and sealed with any means, such as a zipper , , to create an airtight barrier that securely seals the one environment on one side of the barrier  from the environment on the other side of the barrier .","When either door ,  is zippered shut, a barrier exists between the front and rear walls ,  of the PIPPS . Together, the doors , , form an interior air lock within the confines of the existing front and rear walls , , respectively, generally rectangular side walls ,, respectively, top wall or ceiling  and a bottom wall or floor  to allow people passage between sides without allowing undesirable gases on one side of the PIPPS  to pass to the other side.","Also located in the front and rear walls ,  are a plurality of pass through arms A, B on front wall  and C-D (not shown) on rear wall . The pass through arms A, B, C,D communicate with the enclosed interior space  of PIPPS  while a barrier remains between the interior and exterior environments. The pass through arms are shaped to allow for changing pressure within the interior chamber  or insertion of hoses or cables into the interior chamber, while preserving a sealed environment.","As shown in , disposed around the side walls ,  and across the top wall  of the external cover  of PIPPS  is an inflatable perimeter sealing bladder , adapted to form a seal between the cover and exterior surfaces of a structural space when the support frame and the sealing bladder are inflated. The perimeter sealing bladder  is permanently attached to the side walls ,  and the ceiling  by any means such as but not limited to a sealing cement or glue. It is also within the terms of the present invention to removably mount the bladder to the external cover  of PIPPS  so that, for example, it can, be left off the device in the event it is not necessary for a given opening's geometry.","Bladder  is constructed of such material that is specifically selected for durability, elasticity, high chemical and heat resistance and its ability to hold air and form an airtight seal against the surfaces of the walls ,  and the ceiling of a structural space being divided by the cover, as shown in . The perimeter sealing bladder  is shaped as a three-sectioned threshold or entrance of such dimensions as to conform tightly to the side and upper walls , , , respectively, of the support structure  in its interior dimensions and to conform tightly to the wall surfaces ,  and ceiling  of a structural space selected from the group comprising rooms, hallways, corridors whereby the cover  divides the structural space into two separate areas. In cross-section, the perimeter sealing bladder  can be shaped as a circular or oval tube, as a squared off tube, or can even feature a concave face, as best to conform to the surface of the support structure .","The present invention-anticipates various means of inflating the perimeter sealing bladder . In one embodiment, the air compressor  is first connected to the support frame  and the support frame is inflated as shown in . Then, the air compressor is disconnected from the support frame  and connected to the sealing bladder . The sealing bladder  is inflated until it is in sealing contact with the wall surfaces ,  and ceiling  of a hallway, room or other space as generally shown in .","In an alternative embodiment of the invention, the support frame  and perimeter sealing bladder  can be inflated simultaneously using separate compressors  if available.","It is also within the terms of the present invention for a compressed air cylinder or foot pump to be used in place of the air compressor. This is advantageous in that it removes the electrical requirements and adds flexibility to the system.","In an alternative embodiment as shown generally in , the air compressor  directs compressed air through the inlet of pressure relief valve  and through the check valve  into frame . The check valve  prevents pressure relief valve  from emptying the frame . The relief exit  from pressure relief valve  is diverted to the inlet of pressure relief valve , and causes the frame  to inflate to a first required pressure. Pressure relief valve  is set to the required inflation pressure for the sealing bladder . Once the bladder  is inflated to a second required pressure, pressure relief valve  vents extra air flow to a vent. A check valve  in the line from the pressure relief valve  to the bladder  prevents pressure relief valve  from emptying the bladder. The bladder  requires constant inflation to maintain a seal, so if the pressure in the sealing bladder drops below a pre-established set point, pressure relief valve  will close, ensuring continued inflation of the sealing bladder.","Once PIPPS  has been inflated, the compressor  is left on to maintain the seal and a secondary blower\/filter (not shown) can be used in conjunction with the pass through arms A, B, C and D to clean air which passes between the two doors ,, preventing undesirable material from the contaminated side of the hall from infecting the clean side of the hall, as people pass through the doors. In other words, the barrier can act as an airlock so that a person can open one door, step into the interior area and then close the door; and then permit the air to purge from the interior area before exiting through the other door.","Referring to , the interior section or space  can also be used as a decontamination room, allowing individuals to pass from the contaminated side, into the decontamination room, to go through decontamination protocols, such as bleach and physical removal, and then pass safely into the clean side. The pressure inside both the support frame  and perimeter sealing bladder  can be monitored using gauges (not shown) integrated into the framework of the PIPPS , allowing users to verify the system's inflatable integrity. Once an incident has been contained, and need for the PIPPS has ceased, it can be cleaned\/decontaminated via standard procedures, and packaged back into its carrying case  for future deployment.","The PIPPS  provides a rapidly erected barrier formed by the cover and sealing bladder in a structural space such as a room, corridor or hallway to separate two areas of the structural space with a relatively air-tight seal to mitigate the diffusion and convective transport of hazardous materials and air between the two areas and necessarily throughout a building structure. The addition of a portable airlock to a barrier is a large advantage to containment of smoke or airborne material, since it provides ingress and egress mechanisms that control the flow of the airborne environment. Furthermore, creating a barrier to allow decontamination and air purification before transport between separated sides can prevent the dermal and inhalation spread of contaminating substances. Another function of the PIPPS  could be to prevent oxygen rich air on one side of the barrier to a fire source on an opposite side of the barrier.","Another novel feature of the barrier is its use of a strong, inflatable frame to give it structural rigidity coupled with its inflatable bladder which can create an air-tight seal within a vast array of quadrilateral geometries to accommodate, e.g., hallways, stairwells, elevator shafts, and air ducts. In the context of the present invention, air-tight also means gas-tight. This provides for a solid foundation and universal function, within which applications were previously ignored. The PIPPS is also physically non-taxing to implement, in that the majority of the work can be done by a compressor, unlike in previous barrier installments, where bodily exertion was an acceptable consequence of the method. In sum, the hallway barrier of the present invention provides a protective partition from hazardous materials, establishes an integrated decontamination effort, aids in casualty relief, and efficiently contains the incident.","Although the invention has been shown and described with respect to a certain preferred embodiment or embodiments, certain equivalent alterations and modifications will occur to others skilled in the art upon the reading and understanding of this specification and the annexed drawings.
