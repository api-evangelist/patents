{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS","Overview","EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of priority under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7119(e) of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61\/433,138, filed Jan. 14, 2011, by Addepalli et al., entitled \u201cSYSTEM, METHOD, AND PROCESSES ASSOCIATED WITH CONNECTED VEHICLES,\u201d which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.","This disclosure relates in general to the field of communications and, more particularly, to a system and a method for providing resource sharing, synchronizing, media coordination, transcoding, and traffic management in a vehicular environment.","Networking architectures have grown increasingly complex, where innovation that is more recent has focused on designing for particular communication environments. In particular, configuring suitable network architectures for vehicular environments (e.g., automobiles, airplanes, trains, boats, etc.) presents unique difficulties. Vehicles can be mobile across a large geographic area, can have internal networks related to the vehicle itself, can include more than one end user at a time, and can have more than one owner during the life of the vehicle. Providing the ability to conduct transactions in vehicular network environments in a secure manner and providing a flexible identity management framework for various elements conducting the transactions presents significant challenges to system designers, automobile manufacturers, and service providers alike.","A method in one example embodiment includes maintaining a list of authorized devices; creating an association between a wireless device being operated by an end user and an onboard unit (OBU) element, which is provisioned in a vehicle; establishing a session over a designated port for an application to be executed on the OBU element; and accessing resources associated with the vehicle through the OBU element. Authentication of the wireless device can occur via a wired equivalent privacy (WEP) WiFi access point provided by the OBU element. Authentication of the wireless device can also occur via a radio-frequency identification (RFID) tag. The resources can include any number of items such as speakers, a display, a microphone, a global positioning system (GPS) receiver, or any other suitable element that may be provisioned in the vehicle.","After successful authentication of the wireless device, the OBU element can respond to a request by the wireless device for a new data channel with a port number. In particular instances, a command connection is established between the wireless device and the OBU element. The command connection can be used to exchange requests for particular data associated with the resources of vehicle.","In a second aspect of the present disclosure, a method can include establishing a first connection between a first wireless device and a media hub element provisioned in a vehicle; receiving content from the first wireless device; and sharing the content with a second wireless device having a second connection with the media hub element. In more particular embodiments, the method can include receiving additional content generated by the first wireless device while operating in the vehicle, where the additional content is synchronized between the first wireless device and the media hub element.","In yet other instances, the method can include establishing a particular connection between the media hub element of the vehicle and a media hub element provisioned in a residential environment. The particular connection is used to synchronize content between the media hub elements.","Other example embodiments can include synchronizing selected content in the media hub element of the vehicle with a media hub element provisioned in a cloud network. The selected content can be associated with a backup protocol in which the selected content is replicated in the media hub element provisioned in the cloud network. The method can further include downloading particular content at the media hub element of the vehicle; caching the particular content; detecting a deficiency in network connectivity; and streaming the particular content to the wireless device based on the deficiency in network connectivity.","Other example implementations can include storing a portion of content at the media of element; and detecting a deficiency in network connectivity such that the portion of content continues to play uninterrupted on the wireless device. The method can further include receiving a search query at the media hub element; redirecting at least a portion of the search query to a next destination; and streaming particular content to the wireless device. The particular content can match criteria provided in the search query.","In a third aspect of the present disclosure, a method is provided that includes establishing a first connection between an OBU element of a vehicle and a first wireless device. The OBU element can be configured to execute a first application associated with the first wireless device. The method can also include establishing a second connection between the OBU and a second wireless device. The OBU element is configured to execute a second application and a third application associated with the second wireless device. The method may also include executing deep packet inspection as part of a classification protocol for traffic propagating through the OBU element. At least a portion of the traffic can be classified in a strict priority category such that its associated bandwidth characteristic is prioritized. The strict priority category is associated with safety related-messages and voice traffic. Voice traffic can be removed from the strict priority category as a result of deterioration in link capacity.","In particular implementations, the method can include selectively dropping at least some packets in order to comport with a particular queuing characteristic associated with the second wireless device. In other example scenarios, the method can include employing an approximate fair dropping (AFD) protocol in order to ensure that at least some flows are classified into a same queue for sharing a class of bandwidth.","The method can also include selectively altering a receive window in ACK packets in order to affect throughputs for particular flows that propagate through the OBU element. In particular scenarios, a packet identified as being in a high priority queue is provided a certain quality of service metric while remaining queues share a remaining bandwidth according to a preset ratio that factors in at least one network condition.","In a fourth aspect of the present disclosure, a method is provided that includes establishing a session between a wireless device and an OBU element provisioned in a vehicle; matching available bandwidth with requested bandwidth associated with the session, where the matching is provided through a network controller configured to allocate bandwidth among competing video streams; and converting a container format for packets associated with the session. The matching may include matching a container format, a frame rate, and a spatial resolution of an original stream to those associated with the wireless device.","Transcoding activities can be employed in order to requantize a transform parameter in a compressed stream associated with the wireless device. In other instances, transcoding activities are employed in order to decode and re-encode a particular stream associated with the wireless device. An update interval of a bandwidth measurement can be dynamically tuned based on a latency requirement of a particular video application associated with the wireless device.","A particular application having a particular latency requirement can receive a lower update frequency and a larger buffer allocation at the network controller. In other examples, a particular application having a particular latency requirement receives a higher update frequency such that a particular video rate is matched to an instantaneous rate of a particular wireless link. A particular rate can be allocated for a particular video stream bearing a higher spatial resolution.","A particular rate can be allocated in order to minimize a weighted sum of distortion of participating streams associated with the wireless device. A particular rate can be allocated in order to maintain equal quality amongst participating streams associated with the wireless device. Peak-signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) measurements can be used in order to allocate a portion of bandwidth to the wireless device. User preference settings associated with artifacts in decoded video content can be used in order to allocate a portion of bandwidth to the wireless device.","Turning to ,  is a simplified block diagram of a communication system  for enabling intelligent packet management in a vehicular environment. In regards to the organization of certain sections of this Specification, a first aspect of the present disclosure addresses resource sharing between the vehicle and mobile devices. A second aspect of the present disclosure addresses vehicle\/home\/cloud dynamic and automatic synchronizing of information, along with management of media content. A third aspect of the present disclosure addresses transcoding video for particular applications. A fourth aspect of the present disclosure addresses quality of service and traffic management for multiple clients and heterogeneous applications in vehicular networks.","The example architecture of  includes an end user (driver)  operating a vehicle  that includes an on-board unit (OBU) . In this particular example, OBU  includes processing elements , which include a computing processor  and a routing processor . OBU  also includes a memory element , network interfaces , a user interface , and a display . OBU  can be suitably coupled to a plurality of sensors -, a plurality of controls (e.g., electronic control units (ECUs)) -, and a plurality of actuators, such as actuator . In one example embodiment, sensors -and controls -may be part of an automotive diagnostic system, indicated by vehicle diagnostics , which may also be suitably integrated with OBU . OBU  may also be suitably coupled to various in-vehicle mobile devices -at any given time, where such devices may be associated with particular end users (passengers or driver) within vehicle . OBU  may also include capabilities associated with navigation system  (e.g., a global positioning system (GPS)).  also includes networks , representing various types of connectivity to vehicle  (e.g., via antenna ). Each established network of networks  has a logical coupling to remote network nodes or other external electronic devices, which may include transaction systems , authorized entities , and other vehicles .","Elements of  may be coupled to one another through one or more interfaces (e.g., network interfaces ) employing any suitable connection (wired or wireless), which provides a viable pathway for electronic communications. Additionally, any one or more of these elements may be combined or removed from the architecture based on particular configuration needs. Communication system  may include a configuration capable of transmission control protocol\/Internet protocol (TCP\/IP) communications for the electronic transmission or reception of packets in a network. Communication system  may also operate in conjunction with a user datagram protocol\/IP (UDP\/IP) or any other suitable protocol, where appropriate and based on particular needs. In addition, communication system  may also include a configuration capable of accommodating legacy bus subsystems that may be employed to convey information across the myriad of machine devices (e.g., sensors -, controls -, actuator ) in vehicle .","Embodiments of communication system  can enable secure transactions in a vehicular environment by using flexible identity management for agents associated with the transactions. Given the plethora of transaction agents (e.g., machine devices, humans, software agents, mobile devices, and authorized entities) and possible transactions (e.g., accessing one or more wireless\/mobile\/cellular networks and using network bandwidth and services, gaining access to various resources of the vehicle based on an identity profile and\/or associated databases, gaining access to transaction applications in the vehicle, and engaging in commercial activities), numerous transaction scenarios may occur over the life of the vehicle. Such transaction scenarios may encompass, for example, toll or parking payments, vehicle miles traveled (VMT) systems, Internet commerce, original equipment manufacturer (OEM), gas and electric charging stations, roadside and\/or drive-through kiosks, banking applications, vehicle dealer systems, location based service (LBS) system, vehicle system and its resources, mobile network operator system, travel agencies, rental and leasing agencies, network connection to Internet sites, vehicle-to-vehicle commerce, vehicle-to-mobile-device commerce, in-vehicle commerce systems, etc. Accordingly, it is important to have a unified, flexible, and secure identity and access framework to ensure that appropriate transactions can be executed by different agents over time in a secure manner. A unified identity management framework enables aggregation and association of these agents and transactions.","Communication system  may include OBU  that validates credentials of each agent, grants appropriate levels of access, manages potential conflicts (e.g., by assigning priority to different agents), and provisions the appropriate wireless\/mobile connectivity. An agent may be provisioned for authentication and access to a particular vehicle by provisioning at least one virtual subscriber identity module (VSIM) and\/or an identity profile in OBU  of communication system . For each agent, an individualized, multi-factor authorization process may be used to validate the particular agent's credentials for accessing OBU  and for authorizing transactions on OBU . Authentication and confidentiality schemes may be specified for transaction applications corresponding to the particular transactions. Finally, appropriate wireless\/mobile connectivity may be dynamically determined by evaluating the transaction, the agent, and a current geographical location of the vehicle. Thus, vehicular transactions may be securely enabled by managing the identity and authentication of agents associated with transactions.","For purposes of illustrating the operational aspects of communication system , it is important to first understand the activities and problems that may be present in electronic communication scenarios in a vehicular environment such as the one shown in . The following foundational information may be viewed as a basis from which the present disclosure may be properly explained. Such information is offered earnestly for purposes of explanation only and, accordingly, should not be construed in any way to limit the broad scope of the present disclosure and its potential applications.","Many useful, but disparate, networks may exist in today's vehicles. For example, a controller-area network (CAN) bus, a geographical positioning system (GPS), and personal mobile devices (e.g., mobile phones, smart mobile phones\/devices, e-book readers, tablets, laptops\/net books, portable navigation systems, multimedia devices, etc.) facilitate the coexistence of some of the many possible networks within a single vehicle such as a personal automobile. A CAN bus is a vehicle bus standard designed to allow microcontrollers, sensors, and other devices associated with a vehicle to communicate with each other within the vehicle (e.g., without a host computer). CAN is a message based protocol, designed for and typically used by automotive applications. With appropriate network access, the CAN bus can be used to provide real-time vehicle diagnostics from associated sensors and controls to a manufacturer of the vehicle or to any other authorized entity. A separate network in the vehicle may exist for IP devices involved in the vehicle navigation system (e.g., GPS) and, possibly, another network associated with simple content delivery. Other networks could be used for Internet access for end users through, for example, mobile devices. Hence, various levels of network usage, different purposes of network usage, and different agents (e.g., humans, machine devices, external devices, mobile devices) associated with the network usage may occur in a single vehicle. Network usage in each of the identified cases may have a different usage scope, different latency, different associated routing, different policy requirements, and the like.","In a vehicle that does not offer combined networking capabilities for the various possible networks, each of the devices associated with a particular network (e.g., CAN bus sensors, mobile devices, GPS, etc.) may have a one-to-one mapping to either a human agent or to the vehicle. Network access and any resulting fees from such access are typically dictated by the human agent or vehicle mapped to the particular device. While some of these devices may be used by other human agents (e.g., another human agent borrows a cell phone, has account privileges on a laptop, borrows an automobile with a GPS, etc.) network access and fee accrual does not ordinarily accommodate the preferences of the new user. In some cases, a mobile router used to facilitate network access among various agents associated with a vehicle, could provide predetermined network access and billing, without regard to the particular agent or transaction.","In a vehicle that provides networking capabilities between entities inside the vehicle and the external world (\u201cconnected vehicle\u201d), the amount of possible transactions and the changeability of agents associated with those transactions require a flexible framework to ensure security and appropriate network access. In a real-life scenario for a connected vehicle, multiple agents may use the vehicle and perform transactions on or via the vehicle over any given time period. Individual users such as, for example, an owner, a driver, a passenger, a temporary driver (e.g., borrower or renter), or a new owner of a used automobile, may use the vehicle as a personal computing and communication platform for navigational, recreational, and\/or business-related purposes. A manufacturer of the vehicle may want to collect vehicle centric data from the vehicle and send firmware\/software upgrades to the vehicle. Government entities may want to identify and locate the vehicle for law enforcement or government regulation (e.g., emissions controls) purposes. Vehicle dealers may want to obtain sensor data and other vehicle diagnostic information for maintenance updates and\/or scheduling. Thus, a one-to-one exclusive mapping between an agent (e.g., a human or a device) and a connected vehicle does not exist.","In a contrasting example, a one-to-one mapping is typically provided between a mobile phone and a single user. In a mobile phone, credentials that bind the user and the device may be stored in a physical subscriber identity module (SIM) or provisioning module. Thus, if the mobile device is subsequently operated by a new user (e.g., someone borrowing the mobile phone), the credentials in the current SIM, associated with the original user, can be used to access a cellular network and to bill for the network access usage. Thus, the original user mapped to the mobile phone can be billed for any network usage fees incurred by the new user. In some cases involving the same service provider, the mobile phone can be provisioned with the new user's credentials by physically replacing the existing SIM hardware with a SIM of the new user. However, SIM swapping or identity reassignment across different service providers is often problematic or simply not feasible in a mobile phone.","In a connected vehicle, agents may change over any given period of time, and it may be impossible or impractical to physically switch a SIM in the vehicle or to make a trip to a service center each time a new agent needs network access to or from the vehicle. In one example, a manufacturer of an automobile may want to use a transaction application to collect real time data from sensors in the vehicle. If the automobile is manufactured in one country and shipped to another country (e.g., manufactured in Japan and shipped to the United States), then before the automobile is even purchased it would have traveled across international boundaries and multiple telecom service provider areas. Thus, if the manufacturer (i.e., the agent) provisions the automobile with credentials for a first service provider usable in the first country, the manufacturer may prefer a different service provider to be provisioned in the automobile once the automobile is shipped to another country.","Another example of possible agent changes in a vehicle includes owners, drivers, renters, and passengers of a vehicle. When an automobile is sold to a customer, the new owner needs access rights to various transactions (e.g., toll payments, gas and charging stations, Internet commerce, personal vehicle settings, etc.) provided by the vehicle. In addition, the new owner may need wireless access to networks and devices external to the vehicle using an appropriate service provider and a desired billing scheme. These access rights may need to change each time the vehicle is driven by a different driver (e.g., another person in the owner's family, a current renter of a rental car, etc.). In addition, if the vehicle is sold again, a new owner and associated drivers and passengers also need access rights and the previously existing access rights need to be removed from the vehicle. Finally, multiple agents may want to access the vehicle concurrently, such as a driver and one or more passengers of the vehicle who desire access rights to at least some of the vehicle transactions. For example, a passenger may want to use an Internet commerce transaction to download music or videos, or the passenger may want to pay for transportation costs, such as toll expenses and\/or gas and charging station expenses.","Supporting a multi-agent and multi-transaction vehicular environment may also require more protection layers than typically used in traditional authentication schemes such as a simple user identification (\u201cuser ID\u201d) and password. In one example, additional protection layers may be used for certain transactions and agents to avoid compromising security (e.g., highly sensitive transactions such as transactions allowing modifications by a manufacturer of the vehicle itself) and\/or regulatory compliance of a transaction. Thus, flexible agent identity management is needed with a strong authentication component that provides adequate security for dynamically changing agents and transactions, such that security, privacy, authenticity, accountability, and regulatory compliance are not compromised.","A system for enabling secure transactions in a vehicular environment using flexible identity management for agents associated with the transactions, outlined by , can resolve many of these issues. In accordance with one example implementation of communication system , a method is provided for agent identity management that is flexible, secure, and allows network access to be switched dynamically for different agents. The method provides for authenticating an agent to OBU  of vehicle , provisioning an identity profile associated with the agent, and provisioning one or more virtual subscriber identity modules (VSIMs) associated with the agent. For a human agent, the identity profile can include individualized vehicle preferences (e.g., seat position, cabin temperature settings, radio or other media, navigation locations, etc.). Boundaries such as parental controls and transaction access controls may also be provided in an identity profile, which can be added by another agent having appropriate authority. The method also provides for verifying whether a particular transaction is authorized when the transaction is associated with the agent. For authorized transactions requiring remote network access to external devices, the method allows for opportunistic selection of network credentials, such as VSIMs, WiFi, etc., associated with the particular agent, which may be determined by evaluating the agent, the transaction, and a current geographical location of the vehicle. Thus, transactions are securely enabled for different agents by providing a dynamic identity framework for agents. In addition, network access can be opportunistically selected depending on one or more factors, including the agent, the transaction, and the current location of the vehicle.","Note that in this Specification, references to various features (e.g., elements, structures, modules, components, steps, operations, characteristics, etc.) included in \u201cone embodiment\u201d, \u201cexample embodiment\u201d, \u201can embodiment\u201d, \u201canother embodiment\u201d, \u201csome embodiments\u201d, \u201cvarious embodiments\u201d, \u201cother embodiments\u201d, \u201calternative embodiment\u201d, and the like are intended to mean that any such features are included in one or more embodiments of the present disclosure, but may or may not necessarily be combined in the same embodiments.","Turning to the infrastructure of , end user  can be associated with a human agent (e.g., a driver or passenger) having any type of relationship to the vehicle such as an owner, a renter, a temporary driver, a family member or friend of the owner, etc. End user  may initiate communication in communication system  via some network, and such communication may be initiated through any suitable device, inclusive of an in-vehicle mobile device or , display , and navigation system . In one embodiment, additional displays may be provided for one or more passengers in vehicle . In-vehicle mobile devices -are inclusive of mobile phones, smart mobile phones (smartphones), e-book readers, tablets, iPads, personal digital assistants (PDAs), laptops or electronic notebooks, portable navigation systems, multimedia gadgets (e.g., cameras, players, etc.), and any other device, component, element, or object capable of initiating voice, audio, video, media, or data exchanges within communication system . Data, as used herein in this specification, refers to any type of numeric, voice, video, or script data, or any type of source or object code, or any other suitable information in any appropriate format that may be communicated from one point to another in electronic devices and\/or networks.","In-vehicle mobile devices -, and mobile devices external to vehicle , may communicate with OBU  of communication system  through any wired or wireless communication link and may be configured as a personal area network (PAN) or a wireless personal area network (WPAN) or any other appropriate architecture or system that facilitates communications in a network environment. Wired and wireless communication links may be inclusive of any electronic link such as wireless technologies (e.g., Bluetooth, Zigbee, IEEE 802.11x, WiFi Direct, 60 GHz, ultra wideband (UWB), etc.), a USB cable, an HDMI cable, etc. Connection between mobile devices and OBU  may be configured based on particular needs and logistics. In one particular example, an external mobile device may be connected to OBU  through a USB cable or wireless network when, for example, the external mobile device is a diagnostic tool used by a mechanic for servicing vehicle .","Networks  represent a series of points or nodes of interconnected communication paths for receiving and transmitting packets of information that propagate through communication system . Networks  offer communicative interfaces between any of the components of  and remote network nodes and other electronic devices (e.g., transaction systems , authorized entities , and other vehicles ), and may be any local area network (LAN), wireless local area network (WLAN), wide area network (WAN), wireless wide area network (WWAN), metropolitan area network (MAN), wireless metropolitan area network (WMAN), wireless single hop or multi-hop vehicle-to-vehicle network, virtual private network (VPN), Intranet, Extranet, or any other appropriate architecture or system that facilitates communications in a network environment. Networks  may include any suitable communication link to OBU  such as wireless technologies (e.g., IEEE 802.11x), satellite, cellular technologies (e.g., 3G, 4G, WiMAX\/LTE, etc.), etc., or any combination thereof. Networks  may also include configurations capable of transmission control protocol\/Internet protocol (TCP\/IP) communications, user datagram protocol\/IP (UDP\/IP), or any other suitable protocol, where appropriate and based on particular needs.","Embodiments of OBU  may include one or more distinct interfaces, represented by network interfaces , to facilitate communication via the various networks described herein. Such network interfaces  may be inclusive of multiple wireless interfaces (e.g., WiFi, WiMAX, 3G, 4G, white space, 802.11x, satellite, 60 GHz, Bluetooth, near field communication (NFC), LTE, GSM\/WCDMA\/HSPA, CDMA1x\/EVDO, DSRC, GPS, etc.).","Other interfaces represented by network interfaces , may include physical ports (e.g., Ethernet, USB, HDMI, etc.), and the like. Similarly, each of the network elements and user equipment (e.g., mobile devices) of communication system  can also include suitable interfaces for receiving, transmitting, and\/or otherwise communicating data or information in a network environment.","OBU  can include one or more memory elements (e.g., memory element ) for storing information to be used in achieving operations associated with the enablement of secure transactions using flexible identity management, as outlined herein. Any of the memory or storage items discussed herein should be construed as being encompassed within the broad term \u2018memory element\u2019 as used herein in this Specification.","In example embodiments, the operations for enabling the four aspects outlined herein may be implemented (e.g., by OBU ) by logic encoded in one or more tangible media, which may be inclusive of non-transitory media (e.g., embedded logic provided in an ASIC, digital signal processor (DSP) instructions, software potentially inclusive of object code and source code to be executed by a processor or other similar machine, etc.). In some of these instances, one or more memory elements (e.g., memory element ) can store data used for the operations described herein. This includes the memory elements being able to store software, logic, code, or processor instructions that are executed to carry out the activities described in this Specification.","Additionally, OBU  may include processing elements , including computing processor  and routing processor , that can execute software or algorithms to perform the activities to enable the four aspects (identified above). A processor can execute any type of instructions associated with the data to achieve the operations detailed herein in this Specification. In one example, the processors (as shown in ) could transform an element or an article (e.g., data) from one state or thing to another state or thing. In another example, the activities outlined herein may be implemented with fixed logic or programmable logic (e.g., software\/computer instructions executed by a processor) and the elements identified herein could be some type of a programmable processor, programmable digital logic (e.g., an FPGA, an EPROM, an EEPROM), or an ASIC that includes digital logic, software, code, electronic instructions, flash memory, optical disks, CD-ROMs, DVD ROMs, magnetic or optical cards, other types of machine-readable mediums suitable for storing electronic instructions, or any suitable combination thereof. Any of the potential processing elements, modules, microprocessors, digital signal processors (DSPs), and other devices described in this Specification should be construed as being encompassed within the broad term \u2018processor.\u2019","Regarding a physical implementation of OBU , any suitable permutation may be applied based on particular needs and requirements, including the design of the particular vehicle in which OBU  is implemented. OBU  could be a computing device, a simple processor, a microprocessor, a digital signal processor (DSP), a router, a proprietary device, an internal server, a switch, a gateway, or any other suitable element configured to exchange and\/or manage data in a vehicular environment. In example implementations, various components of OBU  may be installed in different physical areas of the vehicle or may be installed as single unit, with display  being positioned to allow driver access. Other displays may be provided in suitable locations for access by passengers in particular passenger seats. In one implementation, multimedia, networking, and communication components may be positioned at some distance from the vehicle engine (e.g., in or near the rear or trunk area if the engine is in the front area of the vehicle).","Communication system  may be configured to facilitate communication with machine devices (e.g., vehicle sensors, instruments, electronic control units (ECUs), embedded devices, actuators, etc.). OBU  may be implemented to provide one or more suitable communication interfaces (e.g., network interfaces ) to legacy systems in vehicles such as, for example, a controller area network (CAN) a low speed network (LIN), a flexray communications protocol network, media oriented systems transport (MOST), and the like. Typically, multiple ECUs, with different embedded software, may be found in a single automobile and may communicate via a CAN bus. Sensors -may represent, for example, wheel and headlight sensors, respectively. Controls -may be inclusive of any embedded system or ECU that controls one or more of the electrical systems or subsystems in vehicle . Actuator  represents a vehicle-setting device such as, for example, a seat positioning device for adjusting various seat positions (e.g., longitudinal position relative to the brake and gas pedals, tilt position, lumbar support, etc.). Actuator  and other similar vehicle setting devices (e.g., temperature controls, sunroof, door locks, power windows, etc.) may be configured for communications in a LIN bus, in one embodiment. Sensor represents a type of sensor or device that may be configured for communications via flexray communications protocol (e.g., a radar collision sensor). Control , representing one or more ECUs, may be suitably integrated for controlling the flexray network and sensors and other associated components. Additionally, OBU  may be implemented to provide one or more suitable communication interfaces (e.g., network interfaces ) to an Internet Protocol (IP) network, user datagram protocol (UDP) network, or any other suitable protocol or communication architecture provided to enable network communication with machine devices in vehicle .","In this particular example, vehicle  includes capabilities associated with navigation system  and vehicle diagnostics . Navigation system  may be provided in various embodiments including, for example, a portable navigation system or, alternatively, a fixed navigation system, each of which may be configured for wireless or wired communications to OBU . Other more specific machine devices, not shown in , may include display panel instruments, climate controls, interior lights, door locks, trunk open\/shut actuator, hood open\/shut actuator, seat heater and\/or cooler, sunroof open\/shut actuator, window heater\/defroster\/defogger, entertainment systems (e.g., speakers, radio, DVD, CD, etc.), and the like.","Turning to , communication system  is illustrated with OBU  shown coupled to agents  and networks . As previously discussed herein, agents  can include machine devices , humans , and mobile devices . In addition, agents can also include software agents  and authorized entities . Software agents  can include any executable file comprising instructions that can be understood and processed on a computer, and provisioned in a memory element accessible to OBU  (e.g., memory element ), and which may be initiated automatically in response to a particular set of criteria or conditions (e.g., every time network connectivity is detected on OBU , whenever OBU  is powered on and a particular time interval has passed, in response to another software agent, etc.).","Authorized entities  may include various entities having authorization to access a vehicle  such as, for example, a dealer of the vehicle, a manufacturer of the vehicle, OEMs associated with the vehicle, and public entities having an interest in the vehicle (e.g., State Departments of Transportation, local police departments, etc.). A network node of such authorized entities will typically be remotely located from OBU  and, therefore, accessible from OBU  through networks  such as the Internet or other WANs and any available communication link (e.g., 3G, 4G, LTE, local wireless, etc.) providing network access from OBU  to the Internet or other WAN. In some scenarios, however, OBU  may be locally accessible to an authorized entity such that Internet access is unnecessary. For example, when vehicle  is being manufactured and is located at one of the manufacturer's facilities, OBU  may be capable of directly accessing the manufacturer's network through a LAN or WLAN. Similarly, when a vehicle  is taken to a dealer for maintenance, the OBU  may connect to the dealer network through a communication link that does not include the Internet or any other wide area network.","Networks  may also facilitate communication between certain agents  (e.g., machine devices , humans , software agents , mobile devices ) and transaction systems . By way of example, transaction systems  may include services transaction systems , commercial transaction systems , roadside transaction systems , and transportation transaction systems  on network nodes or other electronic devices. Each of the transaction systems can be associated with many different types of entities and many different transaction scenarios. Services transaction systems  can encompass numerous entities providing services such as identity service providers, mobile wireless service providers, banks and other financial institutions, location-based services (LBS), travel agencies, vehicle rental and leasing agencies, Internet websites, etc. In some implementations, however, a vehicle rental and leasing entity may be provisioned as an agent of the OBU, such as when the vehicle itself is owned by the rental and leasing entity. In this particular scenario, the rental and leasing agency could be an authorized entity of vehicle , and any authorized employees could be human agents of the vehicle. Commercial transaction systems  may include entities facilitating commercial transactions through the Internet (e.g., video and music download sites, online retailers, etc.), etc. Roadside transaction systems  may include various entities providing roadside services such as gas and electric charging stations, kiosks (both roadside and drive-through), etc. Transportation transaction systems  may include entities or devices facilitating vehicle charging transactions related to toll payments, ferry charges, bridge toll payments, parking, Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT), and any other transportation costs incurred as a result of moving vehicle  from one location to another. The transaction systems , , , and , as categorized, are provided for purposes of illustration and ease of understanding, and it can be appreciated that certain entities may logically be included in multiple transaction systems (e.g., a bank could be described as both a services transaction system and a commercial transaction system) and that numerous types of transaction systems and entities other than those enumerated herein may also be possible.","Other commercial transactions may occur through OBU  by accessing other vehicles  (vehicle-to-vehicle commerce). An available network represented by networks , may provide a communicative pathway between vehicle  and other vehicles , where vehicle  includes OBU  and other vehicles  include a suitable communication device (e.g., mobile device, OBU or similar device). The communicative pathway between vehicle  and other vehicles  could be established as a single hop or multi-hop vehicle-to-vehicle network through DSRC, WiFi, WiMAX, or any other suitable wireless technologies allowing a sustained connection between vehicle  and other vehicles . Commercial transactions could occur between a mobile device in one vehicle (connected to an OBU) and an OBU in another vehicle, between mobile devices in separate vehicles with OBUs, or between OBUs of separate vehicles. Commercial transactions may also be conducted between OBU  and mobile devices  (vehicle-to-mobile device commerce), such as when a mobile device purchases content from OBU . Another type of commercial transaction can include in-vehicle commerce in which a user of a mobile device pays for the use of resources through OBU  (e.g., in the case of a passenger in a commercial vehicle such as a taxi cab) or when mobile devices within a vehicle use the network available through OBU  to conduct commercial transactions with each other. In addition to commercial transactions, these communicative pathways involving vehicles and mobile devices may also be established for any other suitable services or transactions, providing proper authentication and network credentials are obtained.","Turning to activities associated with resource sharing between a vehicle and mobile devices,  is a simplified block diagram that includes an example instance of communication system . This particular implementation illustrates a more detailed representation of certain elements of OBU , and of networks  providing a communication pathway to a particular service transaction system  (i.e., an identity service provider ). In addition, end user computer  and mobile devices  are also shown with network access to identity service provider .","In accordance with a certain embodiment of the present disclosure, an access control module , a vehicle resource brokering module , and a resource communication protocol may be provisioned in OBU . In addition, a number of hardware agents  are illustrated in . These may include a speaker, microphone, a vehicle display, a GPS receiver, vehicle sensors, or any other suitable hardware agents that may be applicable to certain end users. Additionally,  illustrates a home  in which a computer can be synchronized (or have its media coordinated) in accordance with the teachings of the present disclosure, as further discussed below.","In an example implementation, OBU  can be connected to available hardware (sensors, GPS, etc.) and user interfaces (display, speaker, microphone) in the vehicle. Mobile devices in the vehicle can communicate with OBU  via wireless links (e.g., WiFi, WiFi Direct, Bluetooth, wireless-HDMI), via a docking station, etc. In operation, a mobile device such as smartphone, tablet, etc. can have access to valuable information about its respective user. Information such as contacts, text messages, emails, locations of interest, frequently visited Internet pages, etc. are available to the mobile device. The computing platform of the vehicle (e.g., OBU ) can benefit from the information and the resources of mobile devices.","Similarly, a mobile device can benefit from the computing, communication, and sensory resources of the vehicle. The computing platform of the vehicle can have access to a host of information about the vehicle such as fuel level, location, speed, temperature, etc. Further, the platform may be connected to networks with significantly higher bandwidth, in comparison to the mobile device. In addition, the processing unit of the vehicle is not limited in computing power in contrast to the battery limitations of the mobile devices. The vehicle has other resources, where applications on the mobile device can use the speaker, onboard display, microphone, etc.","Note that different combinations of resources available on the mobile device and the vehicle can be used to offer new services to the user of the two devices. The exact usage of each resource can depend on the logic of the application. The present architecture can be configured to provide a systematic way to programmatically invoke resources of either the mobile device or the vehicle from an application running on the other device.","Consider an example use case in which a smartphone user is talking on her phone. As she enters her vehicle, she would like to continue her conversation using the vehicle speaker and microphone. Separately, she would also like to take advantage of the higher bandwidth interfaces available on the OBU, and subsequently migrate navigation directions on the phone to the vehicle display. Upon successful association and authentication, the smartphone can turn off its cellular interface and begin using the OBU as the default gateway to the Internet. It can also launch a special user interface that is suitable for the vehicle (i.e., switches to \u201cvehicle mode\u201d). When the vehicle mode is enabled during an ongoing voice call, if a headset is not engaged (e.g., plugged-in), the call can be played on the vehicle speakers and the vehicle microphone can be used to receive voice.","In the vehicle mode, the phone can listen for voice commands to invoke different functionalities. An example command could include launching the navigation application. When the navigation application is launched, the phone can receive location information from the vehicle platform over the WiFi connection. This can offer more accurate GPS readings (the GPS receiver of mobile devices is designed to be low power and, therefore, is not as accurate as the vehicle GPS receive can be). Upon leaving the vehicle, the phone can detect that the OBU is no longer available. At that point, calls and applications can be migrated back to the smartphone.","Similarly, the vehicle can take advantage of the resources and information on the mobile device. For example, the navigation system of the vehicle can load the mailing addresses of the contact directory of the user on her mobile device. This way the user can ask for directions to \u201cJohn's home address\u201d instead of having to input the address. As another example, a user can run an application available on a smartphone or tablet from the vehicle OBU user interfaces without having to download the application to the OBU. The application can take advantage of the more powerful user interfaces in the vehicle. When multiple mobile devices are present in the vehicle, the OBU can access different applications on the different devices.","Vehicular communications can occur over wireless pathways (e.g., WiFi AP, Bluetooth, wireless high-definition multimedia interface (WHDMI), or onboard dock1 sharing resources of the vehicle with a mobile device through the OBU. In operation, OBU  can perform access control, vehicle resource brokering, and execute the resource communication protocol. For the access control, either the OBU keeps a list of authorized users\/devices, or password protects the system to prevent unauthorized access to its resources. As an example, the OBU may provide a WEP-enabled WiFi access point (or any other local network access technology could be used such as Bluetooth, WHDMI, etc.). When the driver enters her vehicle, her mobile device detects the designated WiFi SSID (or local access network identifier) and associates to it. Upon successful association, the mobile device establishes a connection over a designated port to the software service running on the OBU. Using this connection, the mobile device authenticates with the OBU. This ensures that only authorized mobile devices can take advantage of the vehicle resources.","The mobile device may have similar access control measures to prevent unauthorized access to its resources. The authentication process can be further facilitated through RFID tags. Future mobile devices can include RFID tags as a way of automatic identification. The OBU can be connected to an RFID reader and use it to detect the presence of the mobile device (and readily authenticate with it).","In regards to resource brokering, some of the vehicle resources (e.g., speakers and displays) have limitations as to the number of applications that can simultaneously utilize the resource. However, multiple users and multiple mobile devices can connect to the OBU at the same time. To resolve conflicts and broker such resources, the resource can be allocated to the mobile device and\/or application in order of priority. Any suitable methodology can be used to address this priority metric.","In regards to the resource communication protocol, to enable efficient communication with several mobile device platforms (such as iPhone OS, Android, Symbian, Windows Mobile, etc.) a protocol should be capable of being implemented on all platforms. The exclusive local access connection inside the vehicle, and the possibility of spawning new connections for requests and commands, engenders a synchronous API to be implemented on the mobile device. Therefore, applications on the mobile device can be agnostic as to whether their requested resource is coming from the mobile device, or the OBU. Note that one example resource communication protocol flow is discussed below with reference to .","Turning to potential identity management protocols, one or more virtual subscriber identity modules  (referred to collectively herein as VSIMs ) may be provisioned in OBU  for each agent authenticated to the OBU and having a subscription with a mobile network operator providing cellular services (e.g., AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, Sprint, PCS, etc.). VSIMs  each include a unique identifier or key that identifies an agent on mobile telephony devices such as OBU . VSIMs  may also contain security authentication to authenticate the agent to the corresponding mobile network operator. In addition, one or more VSIMs  may be provisioned in OBU  for each agent of OBU , and multiple VSIMs for one or more agents can be stored in OBU  concurrently. Multiple VSIMs  provisioned in OBU  can enable flexible and opportunistic use of available mobile network operators to provide one or more network access links from OBU  to a remote node, and can also enable these network access links (i.e., communication pathways) on behalf of multiple agents using OBU  as a communication source.","In one embodiment, OBU  is equipped with a Universal Integrated Circuit Card (UICC) that allows for multiple universal subscriber identity module (USIM) applications to accommodate VSIMs . In this embodiment, one or more of VSIMs  having a desired mobile network operator may be opportunistically selected, if certain criteria are met, so that the desired one or more mobile network operators can be utilized for network access from OBU . In another implementation, multiple SIM cards may be connected to OBU  to accommodate a corresponding number of VSIMs. In this implementation involving multiple SIM cards, a software module could be configured to opportunistically select an appropriate one or more SIM cards corresponding to a desired one or more mobile network operators if certain criteria are met. In yet another implementation, VSIMs could be simply soft SIM information stored in a storage repository of OBU  such as part of an identity profile of a corresponding agent. Once downloaded, VSIMs  can reside in OBU  in accordance with whatever particular implementation is employed, until an expiration of the VSIM or until the VSIM is replaced, updated, or removed by an agent with appropriate authentication and authorization.","OBU  may also be provisioned with one or more identity profiles , , and (referred to collectively herein as identity profiles ), with each identity profile  corresponding to an agent that can authenticate to OBU . Identity profiles , as further detailed below, can include credentials and profile information for a particular agent. Credentials contain information that uniquely identifies an agent (e.g., a personal identifier (PID)) and that may be used for authentication purposes. Examples of credentials may include one or more of name, address, phone number, driver's license number, social security number, business license number, IP address, user ID\/password, biometrics, personal device identifier (e.g., authentication information corresponding to key fob, access card, credit card, mobile phone, etc.), security keys, and certificates (e.g., public key infrastructure (PKI) certificate, trusted third party (TTP) certificate, etc.).","Profile information aggregates agent attributes, account information, preferences, and\/or settings, which can enable appropriate transactions by authenticated agents. For example, profile information can include vehicle settings, dashboard preferences, wireless interface preferences (e.g., VSIM information, WiFi account information, etc.), web account information (e.g., multimedia, social networking, etc.), mobile device list (e.g., smartphones, mobile phones, tablets, laptops, etc.) including network configurations for mobile devices, network service provider membership account information, insurance information, credit card\/payment account information, manufacturer web account information, network interface account information, GPS favorite locations, and phone contact list.","The information included in a particular identity profile can be at least partially dependent upon the particular agent to which it corresponds. For example, an authorized entity (e.g., a manufacturer of the vehicle, etc.) would not need vehicle settings, GPS favorite locations, or multimedia information in its identity profile. In addition to agents, a profile identity may be provisioned for a vehicle itself including information to distinctly identity the vehicle (e.g., a vehicle identification number (VIN)). It will be apparent that the examples provided herein of credentials and profile information are not all-inclusive, and any other suitable information or data could be included as credentials or profile information.","Various implementations can accommodate identity profiles  in OBU . For example, in one embodiment identity profiles  are stored in dedicated hardware (e.g., physical SIM card, memory card, etc.). Software can be configured to virtually switch between different hardware or the hardware itself may be programmable to store different agent identity information over time. In another embodiment, identity profiles  are stored in a programmable storage module or virtual identity module that can store one or more identity profiles . Generally, identity profiles  may be kept in any suitable memory element, software, hardware, or in any other suitable component, device, element, or object where appropriate and based on particular needs. In addition, identity profiles  may be provided in any database, register, cache, queue, control list, or storage structure.","In example embodiments of the present disclosure, VSIMs  and identity profiles  may be provisioned and managed through one or more identity service providers, represented by identity service provider  in . In one embodiment, identity service provider  could be a third party provider (e.g., in the cloud) and could offer identity services to mobile network operators. In other embodiments, identity service provider  could be a mobile network operator, a vehicle manufacturer, a vehicle rental and leasing agency, a vehicle dealer, a government agency, or any other entity having an interest in managing identities associated with a vehicle over the life of the vehicle. Moreover, identity profiles  and\/or VSIMs  can be managed through the same or different identity service providers. By storing a VSIM and\/or an identity profile in a remote cloud, the VSIM and identity profile can be associated with an agent rather than to a particular vehicle. Consequently, a human agent (e.g., driver, passenger, owner, renter, etc.) can retrieve his VSIM and identity profile in any vehicle. Depending on the make\/model of the vehicle, the human agent can leverage relevant parts of the identity profile for available features in virtually any vehicle.","Provisioning and managing an identity profile or VSIM through identity service provider  can be accomplished in various ways. In one scenario, a user could access identity service provider  through the Internet or other available network from computer  (e.g., home computer, publicly accessible computer, business computer, etc.) or mobile devices . Additionally, end user  could access identity service provider  by bootstrapping a communication link through OBU  (e.g., accessing a home WLAN through WiFi, using a preprogrammed VSIM in OBU , using another agent's VSIM already provisioned in OBU , etc.) In other scenarios, the identity service provider  may be accessed through a local network (e.g., manufacturer who is an identity service provider locally accessing provisioning modules of OBU  prior to shipping the vehicle, etc.) or other wireless networks (e.g., user accessing mobile network operator through a cellular network if the mobile network operator is its own identity service provider, etc.).","Identity service provider  may provide modules allowing the creation of an account with authentication credentials  (which may be saved for future access of the account) for an agent. A VSIM module  may be provided by identity service provider  to allow a user to provision a VSIM for an agent, with the VSIM being associated with a desired mobile network operator and stored, for example, in VSIM database . An identity profile module  may also be provided by identity service provider  to allow the user to provision an identity profile for the agent and to store the identity profile in, for example, identity profile database . In some scenarios, a user is the agent and provisions a VSIM and\/or an identity profile for himself. In other scenarios, the user may provision a VSIM and\/or an identity profile for another agent (e.g., a vehicle dealer provisioning a VSIM and\/or an identity profile for a new vehicle owner, a vehicle rental agency provisioning a VSIM and\/or an identity profile for an agent renting a vehicle, a user at an OEM provisioning a VSIM and identity profile for a software agent configured in the OBU to make network connections to the OEM from the OBU, etc.).","VSIM  and identity profile  may be dynamically added, removed, and updated via local or remote network access. After provisioning a VSIM and\/or identity profile with identity service provider , the VSIM and\/or identity profile may be downloaded using control channels or otherwise provided to OBU  if the agent associated with the VSIM and\/or identity profile has been authenticated to OBU . In one example, to download VSIMs  and\/or identity profiles , the agent (e.g., end user ) may bootstrap a communication link in OBU  (e.g., WiFi, an available VSIM, etc.) to access identity service provider  using control channels through the Internet or other network. In another example, end user  may access a local network of an identity service provider if a vehicle is in close physical proximity to identity service provider . Once identity service provider  is accessed, the user can authenticate to identity service provider  via authentication credentials , access the desired account, and download one or more associated VSIMs  and\/or identity profiles . Similarly, if a new VSIM for the same agent is provisioned or the identity profile is updated in identity service provider , then the associated agent can use an available VSIM or other available communication link in OBU  to access identity service provider  to download the new VSIM and\/or updated identity profile. In another scenario, the VSIM and\/or identity profile may be stored on a transportable memory element (e.g., USB stick, CD, etc.), which may be provided locally to OBU  by a user, such as end user . The VSIM and\/or identity profile can then be downloaded to OBU  from the transportable memory element.","In other example scenarios, an identity profile may be dynamically created and managed (e.g., removed or updated) locally, directly through OBU . For example, OBU  may provide an identity profile creation tool through display  for a user to enter desired credentials and profile information and associate such information with an agent. In another embodiment, the identity profile creation tool may be accessible through a user's mobile device. In these scenarios, the identity profile would not be accessible through identity service provider  and could only be accessed in the particular vehicle containing the identity profile.","Turning to ,  is a simplified state diagram  illustrating one possible implementation of the aforementioned resource communication protocol. Semantically, after authentication, the mobile device requests a new data channel. The vehicle responds with a port number and waits for a new connection request on that port. The original connection (e.g., referred to as a control connection), remains open, and heartbeats can be sent by the mobile device to the vehicle at regular intervals. The control connection can also be used by both the mobile device and the vehicle computer to negotiate new connections (e.g., referred to as command connection), which can be as many as needed.","On each command channel, both the mobile device and the vehicle computer can send requests to the other end (and also respond to requests). The requests in either direction can follow the same syntax, where each request can be either a GET or a SET. For the GET requests, a GET command requests the value of any sensor on the other end. For example, \u201cGET FUEL LEVEL\u201d from the mobile device to the vehicle is a request to get the fuel level. Similarly, \u201cGET BATTERY TEMPERATURE\u201d is a request from the vehicle to the mobile device. If the \u201cGET\u201d keyword is followed by the keyword \u201cSTREAM\u201d, the requester is demanding a constant stream of the requested information. In this case, the other end would respond with a port number, and start sending UDP packets with the requested value every specified interval. Furthermore, the vehicle can send UDP packets with GPS information every 30 seconds on port number 8686. For example:","Smartphone: GET STREAM 30 GPS","Vehicle: PORT 8686","For the SET requests, such requests can be used to change parameters on the other end. For example, \u201cSET SPEAKER VOLUME 50%\u201d as a request from the mobile device to the vehicle commands the vehicle to set speaker volume to 50%. The set command, along with the defined protocol, allows the system to arrange for resources on both the mobile device and the vehicle. For example, the vehicle can set up network address translation (NAT) on the mobile device and, thus, use its network connection to the Internet. SET requests correspond to permission levels, where in order to be able to send a SET request, a mobile device should demonstrate its privilege during the authentication phase. Any SET request can be reversed with a matching UNSET command.","In terms of a resource-sharing example, using the proposed simple GET\/SET language, the mobile device and the OBU can share resources. Consider the following examples that demonstrate how different resources can be shared. For a network connection, after associating with the vehicle, the mobile device can automatically start using any network resource of the OBU. If the vehicle computer seeks to use the cellular connection of the mobile device, it can do so by sending a request to set up network address translation on the mobile device. For example:","Vehicle: SET NAT","Mobile device: DONE","If the mobile device is not capable of setting up network address translation, it can return the keyword \u201cERROR\u201d with further human readable information regarding the error. For example:","Vehicle: SET NAT","Mobile device: ERROR \u201cVerizon tethering service is not enabled.\u201d","When the service is not needed anymore, it can be stopped. For example:","Vehicle: UNSET NAT","Mobile device: DONE","For GPS, either the vehicle or the mobile device can retrieve a stream of GPS location information from the other device. The following is an example of a mobile device using the GPS of the vehicle computer:","Mobile device: GET STREAM 60 GPS","Vehicle: PORT 9595","The vehicle can broadcast UDP packets with GPS updates on port 9595. When the mobile device does not need the location update stream, it can quickly stop it. For example:","Mobile device: UNSET STREAM 60 GPS","Vehicle: DONE","In terms of the display, the vehicle can be equipped with one or more displays. The OBU can make the display available to a mobile device inside the vehicle. In this case, the mobile device can use virtual network computing (VNC) over WiFi to present its user interface inside the vehicle. If the mobile device is equipped with a WHDMI interface, it can be used to stream HDMI video to the display.","Mobile device: GET DISPLAY VNC","Vehicle: PORT 9595","In this example, 9595 is the port number for the VNC connection.","In terms of the speaker, both the vehicle and the mobile device can broadcast audio using the speaker on the other device. The following is an example of the vehicle using the speaker of a mobile device:","Vehicle: GET SPEAKER MP3","Mobile device: PORT 9090","The mobile device can be listening on port number 9090 for an MP3 stream. The vehicle can stop the lock on the speaker as follows:","Vehicle: UNSET SPEAKER MP3","Mobile device: DONE","The display can be shared between the two devices in a similar way.","With reference now to , a block diagram illustrating an embodiment of the overall identity management and secure transaction processing architecture is shown. OBU  includes a transaction security framework , a secure database\/storage layer , transaction applications , and a secure communication module . Transaction security framework  may include multiple software modules, VSIMs , and a trusted platform module (TPM) . The software modules can include agent provisioning module , authentication and secure transaction module , VSIM provisioning module , multi-factor authentication module , identity profile provisioning module , and payment association module .","Agent provisioning module  provides the overall flow for provisioning and authenticating an agent to OBU . Agent provisioning module  allows provisioning new agents, provisioning new and updated VSIMs , provisioning new and updated identity profiles , authenticating agents to OBU , and activating any applicable identity profiles . In addition, agent provisioning module may also invoke payment association module to determine whether to associate a payment method available through the agent (e.g., in the identity profile or through an associated VSIM) to certain transaction applications not typically initiated by an agent having a payment method (e.g., automatic toll payment transactions, automatic parking transactions, etc.)","Multi-factor authentication module  provides a flow for using one or more predefined authentication credentials to authenticate an agent to OBU  and to ascertain that the agent is authorized to conduct a particular transaction on OBU . In one embodiment, multi-factor authentication module  may be invoked upon initial authentication of an agent to gain access to OBU  and in addition, when particular transactions are initiated on OBU . Authentication credentials may include who, what, and where criteria related to the agent. By way of example, authentication requirements for machine devices and some mobile devices could include one or more of machine hardware signature, challenge-response, predefined certificate (e.g., PKI certificate, TTP certificate, etc.), and physical location relative to OBU . Authentication requirements for a human agent  (accessing OBU  through a mobile device or directly through a user interface such as display ) could include one or more of biometrics, (e.g., fingerprinting, etc.), challenge-response, key fob, access card, mobile phone, user ID and password, a one-time password (OTP), and physical location relative to OBU . Authentication requirements for authorized entities could include challenge-response, predefined certificate, and the like.","In one embodiment, the authentication requirements for each agent may be provided in an agents-to-multi-factor mapping database  of secure database\/storage layer . In some embodiments, the predefined authentication credentials that are required to authenticate to OBU  are specific to the particular agent being authenticated. For example, a key fob may allow an owner agent to authenticate to a vehicle, but only a simple user name and password may be required for a child of the owner to authenticate. In this case, a lesser amount of security may be required for the child to authenticate because the child may have limited access to transaction applications and resources of OBU . Furthermore, authentication requirements to gain access to OBU  may be different from authentication requirements for a particular transaction. By way of example, an owner of a vehicle may only need to use a key fob to gain access to OBU , but additional authentication may be required for the owner to access various transaction applications and resources of OBU . Security can be strengthened as the number and diversity of authentication requirements mapped to a particular agent is increased.","Implementation of the authentication requirements can be accomplished with any appropriate hardware and\/or software. For example, TPM  is a hardware approach that can authenticate an agent, once the agent has provided appropriate credentials. TPM  is a secure processor that performs cryptographic functions and can store cryptographic keys for protecting information. In another embodiment, a software container (e.g., a secure virtualized operating system container) could be provided with appropriate authentication logic to authenticate an agent once credentials are provided. Thus, any hardware, software, or suitable combination thereof can be implemented to accomplish the authentication requirements of multi-factor authentication module .","TPM  can also be used to protect data and transaction applications. For data, TPM  can be a safe store for an encryption key so that only an authorized agent who properly authenticates to TPM  can access the encryption key to decrypt protected data (e.g., data in secure database\/storage layer ). TPM  can also be used to ensure the integrity of transaction applications  executing on OBU , which can be achieved locally or remotely depending on the particular transaction application and associated agent. Locally, the OBU  can self-ensure that the operating system is on a trusted platform. Transaction applications  may each include a signature that can be verified prior to execution. Transaction applications  can also be verified remotely to third parties, such as authorized entities . For example, an authorized entity such as a manufacturer may access a transaction application that monitors the brakes and accelerator of vehicle . Before the transaction application executes, TPM  can be used to verify the integrity of the application to the manufacturer. Based on the information provided, the manufacturer can respond accordingly (e.g., process data received from the transaction application if the transaction application is verified, cease execution of the transaction application if the transaction application is not verified).","In one embodiment, TPM  has a permanent identity associated with vehicle  and does not change even if vehicle ownership changes. Similarly, a vehicle identity (vehicle ID) of vehicle , such as a vehicle identification number (VIN) is also a permanent identity associated with vehicle . A TPM endorsement key, which can be used to encrypt data, may have a public key part that can be used as a TPM identifier (TPM ID). Although vehicle ID and TPM ID do not ordinarily change, if TPM  or OBU  is replaced during the life of vehicle , then a new TPM ID would need to be associated to vehicle .","VSIM provisioning module  and identity profile provisioning module  allow the provisioning of new or updated VSIMs and or identity profiles on OBU . Such provisioning may include downloading new or updated VSIMs and identity profiles from an identity service provider either locally or remotely. Provisioning may also include downloading new or updated VSIMs and identity profiles from a transportable memory element or mobile device. In addition, identity profiles may also be manually created in OBU , without involving an identity service provider.","Authentication and secure transaction module  provides a flow for detecting an event for a transaction, determining whether the transaction is authorized, authenticating an associated agent if required, and obtaining network credentials and other profile information as needed. Network credentials may include one or more VSIMs' information, user ID and password, and\/or security certificates (e.g., asymmetric\/symmetric key pair, etc.), and any other information to facilitate vehicle internal network access or external network access via an available wired or wireless communication link. In order to perform authentication and evaluations to ensure secure transaction processing, this module may be configured to query secured storage such as transaction-to-agents mapping database , transaction-to-authentication-and-confidentiality-schemes mapping database , agents-to-multi-factor-authentication mapping database , and agent identity profiles database . As used in this Specification, a mapping of data, elements, objects, or components is intended to mean an electronic association, correspondence, relationship, or correlation between the data, elements, objects, or components, provided in electronic devices and\/or networks. In one embodiment, these databases, in addition to any other databases or memory elements in secure database\/storage layer , can be maintained in a secure manner using the default security credentials obtained from TPM . Moreover, various confidentiality schemes can be used to protect the data stored in the various memory elements of secure database\/storage layer  such as, for example, cryptographic algorithms including Data Encryption Standard (DES\/3DES), Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA-1\/2), Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), etc.","Transaction-to-agents mapping database  indicates which transactions are authorized for which agents. Mapping database  may include mappings of agent identities to user-level and system-level transaction applications corresponding to transactions and also to types of transactions (e.g., transactions requiring remote network credentials, transactions requiring payment information, etc.). Thus, once an agent has authenticated to OBU , only transaction applications that are mapped to the agent, or that correspond to a type of transaction that is mapped to the agent, are authorized and accessible to the agent. Example mappings that could be found in database  include: 1) a manufacturer mapped to transaction applications for accessing vehicle sensor data (e.g., in order to perform diagnostics), for performing software or firmware upgrades, and for accessing a \u201cblack box\u201d of the vehicle, 2) a dealer mapped to transaction applications for accessing sensor data (e.g., read only access in order to schedule maintenance services), 3) an emergency service provider mapped to transaction applications for controlling the vehicle (e.g., opening a vehicle door, disabling a vehicle engine, etc.), 4) a public entity mapped to transaction applications for accessing sensor data or other vehicle diagnostic data (e.g., for inspection, security, surveillance, etc.), 5) an owner of the vehicle mapped to all transaction applications except those allowing \u201cwrite\u201d or \u201cmodify\u201d access to vehicle software and\/or firmware, 6) a passenger mapped to a subset of transaction applications and features available to an owner of the vehicle, and 7) a sensor mapped to a transaction application compiling diagnostic data.","Additionally, different agents may have different levels of authorization. For example, a dealer may only need to read vehicle sensor data for maintenance scheduling purposes. Consequently, the dealer would be mapped to a transaction application that only allows read operations of vehicle sensors to be performed. On the other hand, a manufacturer may need to read and update vehicle sensors and controls for performing firmware and\/or software upgrades and fixes. Therefore, the transaction applications mapped to the manufacturer could allow read and update functions to be performed.","In one embodiment, a software agent may be a system-level transaction application that does not have a separate agent initiating its execution or otherwise associated with it. For example, the software agent could be a low-level application that automatically initiates processing based upon predefined criteria (e.g., specific time periods, whenever network connectivity is detected, etc.). Accordingly, authorization for the software agent to execute could be provided in any suitable way, including an appropriate indication in transaction-to-agents mapping database  (e.g., mapping the software agent to a type of transaction, mapping the software agent to itself).","Authentication and secure transaction module  may also determine which authentication and confidentiality schemes to use for particular transactions for exchanging data between OBU  and transaction systems in the network cloud. Examples of authentication protocols that can be used include secure socket layer (SSL), Internet Protocol Security (IP SEC), Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP-*), Hypertext Transfer Protocol Authentication (HTTP Auth), Kerberos, Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL), Web Service Security (WS-Security), etc. Examples of confidentiality schemes that can be used include encryption or cryptographic algorithms such as DES\/3DES, SHA-1\/2, AES, etc. Accordingly, transaction-to-authentication-and-confidentiality-schemes mapping database  may provide a mapping of which types of transactions and particular transaction applications require which authentication and confidentiality schemes. One example database mapping could be a banking application's related data and other sensitive information mapped to a desired encryption mechanism. Furthermore, in certain implementations, the criticality of the communication may dictate the applicable authentication method (e.g., different types of authentication may be required for highly sensitive transaction applications). In some embodiments, mapping database  may also indicate which types of transactions and particular transaction applications require multi-factor authentication to be performed for an associated agent.","In scenarios in which multi-factor authentication is required for an agent, authentication and secure transaction module  may also access agents-to-multi-factor-authentication mapping database . For example, a human agent  accessing benign features such as gaming, video, and the like may require a simple user name and password during the initial authentication to OBU . However, once the human agent  decides to access a banking transaction application, additional authentication (e.g., physical presence in the form of biometric authentication, etc.) may be required. In another example, highly critical functions such as software\/firmware changes by a manufacturer, or emergency services by an emergency service provider, may require multiple layers of authentication by the manufacturer or emergency services provider. These multiple layers of authentication could be satisfied by the agent in the initial authentication to OBU , or additional required layers may need to be satisfied when the agent initiates access to the particular transaction application requiring the additional authentication.","Secure database\/storage layer  may also provide an agent identity profiles database , for storing identity profiles  provisioned locally (e.g., using a transportable memory element to download an identity profile, creating an identity profile directly through OBU ) or remotely (e.g., downloading an identity profile from identity service provider ). In addition, agent identity profiles database  may also include security keys, certificates, and credentials corresponding to various transaction applications and agents.","Secure communication module  of OBU  may enable secure communication to various networks (e.g., networks  as shown in ). Secure communication module  selects secure and authenticated network access for an agent and associated transaction application. In addition, secure communication module  may also provide opportunistic selection of a VSIM available to the agent, when multiple VSIMs are available for use. VSIM selection rules database  may be configured to provide a pre-specified mapping of rules that represent preferences regarding which single VSIM, multiple VSIMs, and\/or other wireless communication option (e.g., WiFi) to select for network access. In one embodiment, rules may include combinations of an agent, a transaction application (or type of transaction), and\/or a geographical location of the vehicle mapped to a VSIM or other wireless communication. Examples of such rule combinations include agent and transaction application, agent and location, or agent, transaction application, and location. For illustration purposes, if an agent and transaction application combination is mapped to a VSIM, then the VSIM can be used when the agent and transaction application are associated with a network access request, regardless of where the vehicle is physically located. If an agent and location combination is mapped to a VSIM, then the VSIM can be used if the vehicle is physically located in the mapped location and if the agent is associated with the network access request, regardless of which particular transaction application is associated with the network access request.","Multiple VSIMs and\/or other wireless communication options can also be mapped to transaction applications or types of transactions, agents, and\/or geographical locations to allow a network connection to be split among the designated multiple VSIMs and\/or other wireless communication options. In one example scenario, a large file download may utilize multiple VSIMs (e.g., two different 3G mobile networks) in order to split the file to increase the speed of the download. To accomplish this, a transaction application and agent associated with the file download may be mapped to two or more VSIMs provisioned in OBU  for the agent.","In certain scenarios, one VSIM may be preferred over another VSIM due to the vehicle location because of the mobile network operator rate. To illustrate this case, assume Agent X and California are mapped to VSIM 1 and Agent X and New York are mapped to VSIM 2. If Agent X is traveling in California, then VSIM 1 can be used for any network access requested by Agent X. If Agent X is traveling in New York, then VSIM 2 can be used for any network access requested by Agent X. In another scenario, a human agent  may prefer to have particular types of transactions tied to different VSIMs or combinations of VSIMs (e.g., home transactions mapped to VSIM 1, work related transactions mapped to VSIM 2, child's transactions mapped to VSIM 1). Such mappings can be configured in VSIM selection rules mapping database  with appropriate authorization. The VSIM selection rules mapping could also be provided in any other suitable memory element including, for example, an identity profile associated with the agent. In this alternative implementation, only transaction application and\/or location may need to be mapped to available VSIMs and\/or other wireless communication options.","In addition to pre-specifying VSIM selection rules, VSIMs may also be opportunistically selected in real-time. A real-time VSIM selection may occur based on current network conditions\/demands, mobile network rate plan of an agent, remaining data\/minutes of a mobile network rate plan. In addition, network performance characteristics such as, for example, data rate, signal level, congestion, etc. may also be evaluated in real-time and used to opportunistically select a suitable one or more VSIMs, other wireless communication options, or any suitable combination thereof.","Transaction applications  represent a plethora of user-level and system-level transaction applications that may be configured on OBU . With proper authentication to OBU  and authorization through transaction-to-agents mapping database , however, numerous types of transactions using transaction applications  may be performed through OBU . Generally, types of transactions are inclusive of 1) accessing one or more wireless\/mobile\/cellular networks and using network bandwidth and services, 2) gaining access to various resources of the vehicle based on an identity profile and\/or associated databases, 3) gaining access to applications in the vehicle, and 4) engaging in commercial activities (e.g., paying for receiving goods or services, or receiving payment for selling goods or services). These general transactions may overlap in certain cases, for example, where an agent accesses a cellular network in order to connect to an online retailer (e.g., commercial transaction system ) in order to pay for purchased goods, and uses an Internet commerce transaction application to enable a secure transaction.","The user-level and system-level transaction applications of OBU  may be mapped to any appropriate agent  (e.g., machine devices , humans , software agents , mobile devices , and authorized entities ) in transaction-to-agents mapping database . Example transaction applications  can include applications facilitating external network access such as banking applications, LBS applications, travel agency applications, vehicle rental & leasing agency applications, Internet commerce applications, kiosk applications, gas & electric charging applications, transportation charging applications, vehicle-to-vehicle applications, vehicle-to-mobile applications, dealer transaction applications, OEM transaction applications, and the like. Other transaction applications  may include hardware and\/or software applications involving internal access of OBU  such as gaining access to various resources, vehicle subsystems, or software applications not involving remote network access. A unified identity management framework, as illustrated in , is capable of aggregation and association of all agents  and transaction scenarios into a unified system. In one embodiment, application programming interfaces (APIs) may be exported to integrate these agent identities with various transaction applications.","Authorized entities  may access appropriate transaction applications (e.g., dealer transaction application, OEM transaction application, etc.) after gaining access to OBU  through an authenticated software agent . The software agent  may first authenticate to OBU  and can then establish a network connection to the authorized entity using an appropriate VSIM (e.g., the manufacturer's VSIM). The authorized entity to which the software agent establishes a network connection may need to authenticate to OBU  before being able to access transaction applications on OBU , such as transactions applications related to vehicle sensor data, diagnostic data, firmware\/software upgrades, emissions data, etc. Thus, for example, an OEM software agent on OBU  may be configured to establish a network connection to the OEM whenever internal connectivity to a network is detected on OBU . OEM software agent may first authenticate to OBU  and, for example, VSIM 1 may be selected for network access. Once a network connection is established between OBU  and the OEM using VSIM 1, the OEM may update the VSIM 1 to VSIM 2 if, for example, the OEM has negotiated a new rate with a different mobile network provider and wishes to update its VSIM. In some embodiments, a VSIM being updated (e.g., VSIM 1) may need to remain active and available for use by the associated agent for a specified period of time, until the new VSIM (e.g., VSIM 2) has been successfully provisioned (and possibly tested) in OBU . Additionally, the OEM may need to be authenticated to OBU  and authorized in transaction-to-agents mapping database  in order to update the VSIM or to access an OEM transaction application (e.g., one of transaction applications ), which could be configured to access various vehicle components (e.g., vehicle sensors, vehicle firmware\/software, etc.).","Machine devices  may also authenticate to OBU  and then provide an automatic network connection to an external entity or transaction system . For example, a machine device agent (e.g., a detector) may sense a toll system and initiate a transportation charging application. After the detector is authenticated to OBU , transaction-to-agents mapping database  may be evaluated to determine whether the detector is mapped to the transportation charging application. Once the detector is determined to be authorized to access the transportation charging application, network credentials and payment information may be obtained so that transportation charging application can connect to the toll system and provide appropriate payment.","Turning to , an example selection of identity profiles that could be provided in an OBU is illustrated. Identity profiles are included for a parent\/owner , a child , a vehicle sensor , and a manufacturer . Common elements in each of the identity profiles include agent identification, VSIM, and security profile. Agent identification could include credentials information such as a key fob for the parent\/owner , a birth date for the child , a device identifier for the vehicle sensor , and a name for the manufacturer . The security profile information could also be credentials such as a user name and password for the parent\/owner  and child , a security key for the vehicle sensor , and a PKI certificate for the manufacturer .","Identity profiles for human agents, such as parent\/owner  and child  may also include vehicle settings, other wireless interfaces, device list, and web accounts. The vehicle settings may include items such as preferred seat positions as a driver and a passenger, temperature controls, music or radio settings, and the like. Other wireless interfaces and preferences may include, for example, a WiFi account established with a mobile network provider. Wireless interface information can be included in the identity profiles so that whenever the vehicle is near a hotspot of the mobile network operator, network connections by the parent\/owner or child can be made through the WiFi interface. Identity profiles for the parent\/owner  and child  may also include specific web accounts, such as those related to social networking and media.","Device lists may include any personal mobile devices of the parent\/owner or child. The device list could include network interface accounts, passwords, and network configurations. Thus, the device list is essentially an identity profile for mobile devices within identity profiles of the parent\/owner  and child . The device list information is provided to allow each of the identified mobile devices to be recognized and connected to the OBU  and to other networks in a desired manner. For example, if the child wants to download a movie from the Internet to a mobile device (e.g., a laptop, iPad, etc.) and the mobile device is included in the device list of the child's identity profile , then the mobile device could be connected to OBU  through a local wireless connection and OBU  could route traffic to the Internet through appropriate and available network connections from OBU  to the Internet (e.g., using a VSIM identified in the identity profile of the child ). Thus, OBU  may be used as a communication link to the Internet for mobile devices identified in a device list of an identity profile of another agent.","Identity profile of parent\/owner  may also include other profile information of a sensitive nature such as credit\/payment information. Credit\/payment information may be included in an identity profile to allow the agent of the identity profile to use his own credit\/payment information for various charges\/payments incurred during commercial transactions (e.g., transportation charging, gas and charging stations, kiosks, Internet commerce, rental and leasing, travel, etc.). The credit\/payment information may be associated with authorized transaction applications during provisioning of the identity profile or at other times. By way of example, during the provisioning of an identity profile of an owner of vehicle , the owner's credit\/payment information may be set as the default credit\/payment method for various transaction applications. In a further example, payment information associated with transaction applications for transportation and gas and charging systems could be changed during a trip in vehicle  when a passenger offers to use his own credit\/payment information to pay for such expenses. OBU  could provide an interface to allow modification to appropriate settings to effect such a change using proper authentication and authorization. In another example, each time a driver is authenticated to vehicle , the driver's credit\/payment information may be associated with the various transportation, gas, and charging transaction applications. However, if the driver is not the default payer\/creditor, then OBU  could provide confirmation screens to notify the driver that his credit\/payment information can be used and to receive confirmation and approval of this change.","Identity profile of parent\/owner  may also include machine device access. While a manufacturer or an OEM may have access to vehicle machine devices to read and update or modify firmware or software of such machine devices, an owner of a vehicle may only be allowed to retrieve data from vehicle sensors. Accordingly, machine device access can indicate which machine devices the owner is authorized to access and what type of access is allowed. In addition, other passengers may not be allowed any type of access to the vehicle sensors and actuators, for example, and therefore, machine device access information may be omitted from identity profiles associated with other human agents.","Identity profile of child  may also contain parental controls and may not contain certain information that allows use of particular resources or transactions. Parental controls may be included to allow a parent to set desired limits on a child's use of OBU  resources and the vehicle itself. For example, any type of common computer parental controls related to accessing networks such as the Internet could be provided in parental controls. In addition parental controls could relate to particular activities of the vehicle. For example, if the child is authenticated as a driver, parental controls could require a notification be sent to the parent (e.g., via an email account, a text message, to a messaging center of the OBU , etc.) if the vehicle is driven beyond a specified boundary or perimeter or if the vehicle is driven beyond a specified speed. Parental controls could also be configured to limit certain vehicle functions (e.g., vehicle speed, entertainment systems, etc.). In addition, identity profile of child  may not have credit\/payment information if the child is not allowed to engage in commercial transactions through OBU .","Identity profile of manufacturer  may also include machine device access information, which can indicate which machine devices the manufacturer is authorized to access and what type of access is allowed. In addition, the identify profile of manufacturer  may also include information related to diagnostics of vehicle  and a history of vehicle technical problems. Thus, when the manufacturer accesses vehicle , valuable historical information related specifically to vehicle  can be readily available for the manufacturer. Web accounts may also be provided in identity profile of manufacturer . Such information could allow the manufacturer to communicate with the driver\/owner and provide information including, for example, marketing information such as coupons or sales events.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0144","num":"0143"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["600","602","604","607","618","625","620","618","604","620","606","608","610","614","614","625"],"i":["a","c","a","c","a","c","a ","b "]},"Before turning to some of the capabilities of the architecture of , some preliminary contextual information is provided. Most home media content is being moved from a traditional storage format to a digital format. Moreover, the prices of mass digital storage devices (such as hard disk) have been consistently declining. Further, with the ubiquity of consumer wireless technologies, the consumer devices including mass storage devices and computing devices (e.g., laptop, smart devices) come with built-in wireless connectivity. To simplify access to (and interaction with) digital content, media hub technology can be used to gather, organize, and present the digital video, photos, and music that users have spread amongst various devices in the home. Today, using such technology, consumers can enjoy their media through an easy-to-use interface that is not only accessible in the home, but throughout the world via a web browser (or via smart devices such as iPhone\/iPad\/Android Phones etc.). Similarly, with the popularity of a network DVR at home, users can pause their favorite TV program at home TV, and move the program to other TVs or mobile devices.","Because the vehicle of the present disclosure is connected to the home and enterprise cloud, there is a need to extend this rich media access. This can eliminate the need for CD\/DVD players in the vehicle and, further, enable a media hub functionality for the vehicle media system. Similarly, a network DVR functionality can be added to the vehicle entertainment system.","In a particular example implementation, the architecture of  can be used for providing a vehicle entertainment system with media hub functionality. This would allow for the sharing media on multiple devices within the vehicle. For example, each passenger in the vehicle can play his\/her favorite content from the vehicle entertainment media hub. Devices in the vehicle can generate media and automatically back-up or sync-up with the vehicle entertainment media hub. For example, Flip Camera\/smartphone in the vehicle can automatically connect to the vehicle media hub and sync-up its streaming content, or upload a media file to a vehicle entertainment media hub. Similarly, local vehicle radio channels can be provisioned in the vehicle media hub, which can be played or shared locally on other devices.","In regards to synchronizing between the vehicle media hub and the home media hub, this can allow the vehicle and home media hub to exchange media content of choice. For example, before embarking on a trip, the vehicle media hub can be connected over a wireless link to the home media hub to download content of choice either by pushing a button, or via explicit selection, or via automatic sync setup. A similar operation can be used for synchronizing the vehicle media content to the home media hub. For example, when the user returns from a vacation trip (where the vehicle media hub synchronized up with lots of media), the platform would upload\/sync the content to the home media hub for backup and sharing purposes.","For synchronizing between the vehicle media hub and the cloud virtual media hub, it is valuable to synchronize media content of choice from vehicle to the cloud. For example, one can create a virtual media hub in the cloud and upload\/back-up\/sync-up required media content from the vehicle media hub for sharing and protection purposes. Similarly, a vehicle can select one or more virtual media hub(s) hosted in the cloud (e.g., to sync-up content to the vehicle media hub). For example, the user can select his or his\/her family\/friends media content, and sync-up\/download content to the vehicle media hub to play on the vehicle system (or share with the devices on the vehicle).","Consider the vehicle media hub client accessing the remote media hub in the cloud or at home. Given that vehicles can be connected, this can enable vehicle users to play media content directly streaming from home, or virtual media hub from cloud. This can also allow users to download and cache contents of interest locally. This can allow media to be played in the vehicle during times when there is no network connectivity for direct streaming. Additionally, the media hub can operate with a network DVR functionality for stored and live media. For example, to counter intermittent disconnections or facilitate delayed media play, the media hub at home\/cloud can be enabled with network DVR providing pause, replay functionality. In addition, using a universal plug-and-play (U-PnP) functionality, the home\/cloud media hub can also be connected with a live TV\/set-top box, so it can receive streams, and act as network DVR for live programs.","For a vehicle-to-vehicle media hub functionality, one or more of the above functionalities can be achieved between vehicle media hub servers or media hub client. Separately, for a media hub search from the connected vehicle, the user can search for content of interest from his\/her media hub server or client in the vehicle. If the content is available locally, it can be presented back to the user. If it is not local, the media hub server or client in the vehicle can redirect the search query to the permission-based accessible media hub (e.g., at a family\/friend\/own home), or in a cloud virtual media hub or other vehicle hub. Once accessed, the platform can start downloading\/streaming content that matches the criteria. For predictive content access from a location-based media hub search from the vehicle, one or more of the above can be based on location (e.g., home, garage, etc.), user profile, connection availability (enable DVR or Don't enable DVR), user preferences (e.g., automatic sync or manual sync, remote streaming versus local download and play, etc.), access rights, and security policies.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0152","num":"0151"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 7"],"b":["700","707","702","704","707","704","720","704"]},"Note that future vehicles equipped with advanced wireless routers (on-board unit) may be connected to the Internet via multiple interfaces (e.g., 3G\/4G, LTE, WiFi), while providing various voice and video services to in-vehicle clients (also referred to as in-vehicle devices). This can include built-in music, and movie players, laptops, smartphones, iPads, other handheld devices, sensors in vehicles, etc. The roadside device could be a user device or an infrastructure device such as base station, access point, satellite, etc. Additionally, network controller  is a generic term for network devices in the Internet that can perform any number of functions (e.g., ID\/location mapping, traffic shaping and processing, proxy, etc.).","Operationally, the architecture is configured to allow for video transcoding either at OBU , or at network-controller , so as to better match the received video quality with the highly dynamic available bandwidth in the vehicular environment. Note that video transcoding at the edge of cellular networks can match the different container formats (e.g., fly, avi, mpg, etc.) and form factors (e.g., display size, supported temporal resolutions) supported by different end user devices. The scheme of the architecture of  implements a proxy, which can operate for different types of access networks, (e.g., WiFi, WiMAX, LTE, etc.). Additionally, such an architecture can be functional for both downstream and upstream video.","It should also be noted that the design of the transcoding activities is targeted for the highly dynamic vehicular environment, where fast-changing bandwidth, highly variable latency, and persistent packet losses are common. In operation in downstream video instances, the architecture contains two stages of transcoding. One stage is provided at the network controller for matching the available bandwidth. Another stage at the on-board-unit focuses on a conversion of container format, spatial resolution, and frame rates, as appropriate for individual in-vehicle clients. Such a framework can help to reduce the computational burden at the network controller.","Turning to , these illustrations reflect downstream and upstream video activities, respectively. In a particular example implementation  depicted by , a network controller  is coupled to a server A and a server B (indicated generally at ), where the servers have a suitable network connection. An OBU  includes a processor , a memory element , a video transcoding module , and a resource discovery module . Turning to the example implementation  of , this particular architecture may include a server A and a server B (indicated generally at ), which may be coupled to a network controller . In a paradigm similar to that described in , an OBU  of  may include a bandwidth module , a video transcoding module , a processor , and a memory element .","For the downstream video scenario, in-vehicle clients can be streaming video from web servers, or can be receiving video feeds from a two-way conferencing session. In such instances, the network controller can be responsible for estimating the bottleneck wireless link bandwidth (or path bandwidth, possibly with help from the OBU). The network controller can also be responsible for allocating bandwidth among competing video streaming, and for transcoding each video stream on behalf of its server. In addition, a second video transcoding proxy at the on-board unit can also be used to further match the supported container formats and form factors of the in-vehicle devices.","In the case of upstream video, in-vehicle clients act as senders, for instance when uploading some user-generated contents, or feeding the camera capture from a two-way conferencing session. In this case, the on-board unit is in charge of bandwidth estimation (possibly with help from the network controller), bandwidth allocation, and video transcoding on behalf of the in-vehicle devices. Due to scalability considerations, it may be more advantageous for the majority of computation and decision making to occur at the OBUs.","For bandwidth estimation, multiple measurement methods can be applied to estimate the available bandwidth between the network controller and the on-board unit. Note that multiple modes of access (3G, WiFi, 4G-LTE\/WiMAX, etc.) may exist over this hop and, therefore, the aggregate bandwidth across all access links is of interest. Note that one important parameter in such scenarios is the update interval of the bandwidth measurement. While frequent updates are needed to track the dynamically changing wireless bandwidth, the frequency also needs to be limited to avoid excess overhead introduced by the measurement method (e.g., when using packet-train\/pair-based methods).","In certain implementations, this parameter should be dynamically tuned based on the latency requirement of the video application. For example, for applications with more relaxed latency requirements (e.g., watching YouTube), a lower update frequency is appropriate, and a larger buffer at the network controller can help to smooth out the instantaneous rate fluctuations over the wireless links. For applications with more stringent latency requirements (e.g., video conferencing), additional buffering is not a viable option. In this case, a more frequent update is needed to match the video rate and quality to the instantaneous rates of the wireless links.","For bandwidth allocation, given the total bandwidth estimate and the characteristics of competing video streams, the video transcoding proxy at either the network controller (in the downstream case) or the on-board-unit (in the upstream case) can make a centralized decision on how much rate to allocate to each of the video streams, so as to jointly optimize their overall quality. In general, it is favorable to allocate higher rates for streams bearing higher spatial\/temporal resolutions, containing more dynamic scenes, and\/or demanding a higher priority. The optimal rate can be calculated based on several alternative media-aware criteria to minimize the weighted sum of distortion of all participating streams, and to maintain equal quality of all participating streams. The quality metric can either be objective (e.g., commonly adopted measurements based on peak-signal-to-noise-ratio (PSNR)), or subjective, which can be based on extensive prior study of user preferences for various artifacts in the decoded video content.","For video transcoding, the objective of video transcoding at either the network controller or the on-board-unit is twofold. First, its aim is to dynamically match the stream source rate with its allocated bandwidth, so as to fully utilize the wireless link resource, while avoiding buffer overflows or frame freezes at the receiver. Second its aim is to match the container format, frame rate, and spatial resolution of the original stream to those of the receiving device.","Any number of suitable transcoding methods can be employed in the architecture discussed herein. These can range from fully decoding and re-encoding the traversing stream, to simply requantizing the transform parameters in the compressed streams. The latter approach incurs significantly lower latency and computational complexity, by reusing the motion estimation and compensation, mode selection, and transform results embedded in the original stream; however, such a paradigm typically incurs a penalty in terms of rate-quality efficiency. The architecture of  is general and flexible enough to adopt either approach. The tradeoff between computational complexity, latency, and efficiency can be chosen based on the demand of the video application, as well as the capability of the network device (i.e., the on-board-unit and the network controller).","Turning to ,  is a simplified quality of service (QoS) framework for vehicular networks. The example architecture of  includes an OBU , which includes a network condition aware classification element , a selective dropping\/selective packet header adaption element , a network condition aware class-based queuing\/scheduling element , a resource discovery model , a processor , a memory element , a class-based queuing\/scheduling module , a selectivity module , and a network condition classification module .","Before delving into some of the operational capacities of the architecture of , some contextual information is provided to help guide the descriptions. In a vehicular network, fast changing, and sometimes harsh, vehicular environments makes supporting QoS a challenging task: especially when there are multiple applications from different clients competing for the scarce, fast-varying, unpredictable bandwidth. The architecture of  provides a framework for multi-client, heterogeneous applications. Although vehicle networks could involve both on-board units and roadside devices, the method discussed herein can be applied at both locations.","In operation, there is an assumption that there are multiple clients running various applications that share a bottleneck link that has a varying capacity, bit error rate (BER), and varying link delay. The scheme of the architecture provides a best service available to the most important applications, while enabling weighted fair sharing of the remaining bandwidth for other less-critical applications. The scheme can also adapt smoothly with changing network conditions.","Certain key components of the vehicular QoS system are shown in . In one particular implementation, there are three components in the framework: network-condition-aware classification; selective dropping or selective packet header adaptation, and network-condition-aware class-based queuing and scheduling.","The first component in the QoS framework is network condition aware classification. Since there is a small number of clients and applications running within a vehicle (or even at a network controller, for example at a WiFi access point), the architecture can employ deep packet inspection as part of the classification protocol. Unlike more common methodologies, the classification rules of  are adaptive to mobile\/wireless channel conditions. For example, given enough bandwidth, safety-related messages and voice call traffic can be classified into the strict priority and their bandwidth requirement is assured. However, if the link capacity becomes low, the architecture can classify safety-related messages to have a strict priority, and also classify the voice traffic into different classes, which may incur drops packets.","User-specified rules can also be incorporated in the classification unit. Users can specify the relative importance among different clients and different applications. For example, parents' traffic can have a higher priority over children's traffic. Alternatively, and in more general terms, voice traffic can have higher priority than WebEx sessions, etc.","After a packet has been classified, it can propagate through a selective dropping or packet header modification unit, which may be referred to as the \u2018SEL\u2019 unit. Packets are selectively dropped in such a way that the class queue would not become congested. Additionally, the architecture can ensure that flows that are classified into the same queue can share the class bandwidth in a weighted fair manner. In the particular example, approximate fair dropping (AFD) methodologies are adopted to achieve this task. For applications that use TCP as the transport protocol, selective dropping may not be an ideal choice, as TCP may be sensitive to packet drops. In such scenarios, the architecture can choose to selectively alter the receive window in TCP's ACK packets to effectively control TCP throughputs for different flows.","For the network condition aware class-based queuing and scheduling, once a packet is queued into one of the class-based queues, it is ensured of being sent out. The delay it would incur and the bandwidth its class would receive depend on the network condition aware scheduler. Traditional schedulers send out packets from a different class according to preset rules. For example, a packet in a strict priority queue would universally be served regardless of other classes, where the remaining class queues would share the remaining bandwidth according to a preset ratio. In the system of , such ratio can be adaptive to network conditions. The enhanced layer traffic from a video application may receive 20% of the link capacity when the link is an excellent condition. Furthermore, it would receive less, as the network condition worsens (i.e., until complete starvation). This occurs because when the network condition is excellent, sending enhancement layer information would improve the users' experience. Conversely, when the link is poor, it is reasonable to remove the enhancement layer traffic.","In terms of advantages, one advantage of the design of  is that it is based on a cross-layered approach. Physical links' conditions can be sent back to the QoS framework to engender intelligent management decisions for handling service users' applications. This may be important in vehicular networks that are dynamic and error-prone. Typical architectures are not adaptive enough to be used directly in such an environment, whereas the architecture of  can adapt quickly to the varying link capacity, high BER, and\/or highly inconsistent delays.","Turning to , simplified flowcharts illustrating various aspects of embodiments of the present disclosure are shown.

After the payment association processing is completed in step , or if the agent does not have an associated payment method as determined in decision box , then flow passes back to step  to wait for another agent. Certain agents (e.g., vehicle machines such as a brake sensor or a seat actuator, a human agent without payment information in an identity profile, etc.) may not have associated payment methods because these agents may not engage in commercial transactions through OBU  and, therefore, may not interact with transaction applications requiring payments.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0178","num":"0177"},"figref":["FIG. 11","FIG. 10"],"b":["1100","1004","1100","1102","30","30"]},"In one embodiment, agent identity of a human can be inferred from a key fob used by the human agent to enter the vehicle. In certain embodiments, when a driver enters a vehicle, display  can prompt the driver to confirm that his identity matches the displayed owner identity (or provisioned default driver) of the vehicle. If other identities of human agents have been provisioned in the vehicle, then the display could also provide a list of provisioned identities from which the agent can choose to authenticate. Display  could also provide the option to select \u201cNew Driver\u201d, \u201cNew Passenger\u201d, or the like.","If the agent is determined to be a new agent in decision box , then flow may pass to decision box  where a query is made as to whether policies allow a new agent to be provisioned. In some embodiments, OBU  may include a policy module that allows various policy controls, including new agent provisioning. Thus, for example, for an added layer of security, an owner may set policies that by default block any new agents from being added to OBU . Thus, whenever a new agent needs to be added, the owner would have to reset or override the policy with credentials to allow the new agent to be provisioned. Such policy settings can be controlled through a policy settings interface by an appropriate agent (e.g., the owner or other superagent with a specified high level of authority for conducting transactions and configuring policies in OBU ). If the policies do not allow new agents as determined in decision box , then authentication to vehicle flow  ends and flow returns to agent provisioning flow  with the agent not authenticated.","If policies allow new agents to be provisioned as determined in decision box , however, then the flow passes to decision box  where a determination is made as to whether VSIM provisioning is requested. In the case of a human agent, a display screen may offer the choice to the agent to provision a VSIM. If VSIM provisioning is requested, then flow passes to step  to perform VSIM provisioning, which will be further described with reference to .

If identity profile provisioning is requested, then flow passes to step  to perform identity profile provisioning, which will be further described herein with reference to . Identity profile provisioning allows an agent to create or update an identity profile through an identity service provider (e.g., third party identity service provider accessible through the Internet) or directly onto OBU . If an identity profile is created or updated through an identity service provider, or if an identity profile is stored on transportable storage medium or mobile device, then the identity profile can be downloaded to OBU .","After the identity profile is provisioned in step , or if identity profile provisioning was not requested, flow passes to step , where one or more authentication factors or requirements may be provisioned for the new agent in agents-to-multi-factor-authentication mapping database . Such factors could include user ID and password, biometrics, key fob, access card, etc., and one or more of these factors could be obtained by accessing the agent's identity profile credentials. For example, if an identity was provisioned and if it included a user ID and password, the agent could be prompted to confirm that the user ID and password from the identity profile should be included as one of the authentication factors.

After the multi-factor authentication is performed, flow passes to decision box  to determine whether the detected agent passed the required multi-factor authentication. If the agent did not pass, then authentication to vehicle flow  flow ends and returns to agent provisioning flow  without the detected agent being authenticated.","If in decision box , it is determined that the detected agent passed the multi-factor authentication, however, then the flow passes to  through . These steps essentially perform the same function as steps  through  with regard to VSIM and identity profile provisioning.

Multi-factor authentication flow  may also be used to authenticate the agent when the agent is attempting to conduct particular transactions through OBU , which will be further described herein with reference to . The flow begins at step  where agents-to-multi-factor-authentication mapping database  is evaluated. In one embodiment, the agent can be mapped to one or more authentication requirements for authenticating to OBU . Moreover, each agent provisioned in OBU  could have various required authentication requirements and various numbers of such requirements. For example, an owner having significant privileges and access to OBU  and its resources may have several authentication requirements, whereas a passenger in the vehicle with limited access to OBU  and its resources may only need to provide a user ID and password. The flow moves to step  to get a first authentication requirement from mapping database . In one embodiment, a key fob used to open a door for a human agent could be the first authentication requirement for a driver or owner of the vehicle.","Flow then passes to decision box  where a determination is made as to whether the agent passes the authentication requirement (e.g., entering a correct user ID and password, providing a matching fingerprint, providing a valid PKI certificate, etc.).

If additional requirements are appropriate to authenticate the agent, flow passes to step  to identify the next requirement, and then passes back to decision box  to repeat the steps determining whether the agent passes the authentication requirement. This processing continues until the agent has passed all of the authentication requirements or until the agent fails one of the authentication requirements. If the agent passes all of the authentication requirements, then the agent is authenticated to the vehicle, as indicated in step , and multi-factor authentication flow  ends. If, however, the agent fails one of the authentication requirements, then the agent is not authenticated to the vehicle, as indicated in step , and the multi-factor authentication flow  ends.","Turning to , simplified flowcharts of a VSIM provisioning flow A and an identity service provider access flow B, respectively, are illustrated.

Therefore, multiple VSIM actions may occur during a single VSIM provisioning process.","Turning to , a simplified flowchart illustrates possible processing steps of identity service provider  providing identity services for managing VSIMs, including accessing and downloading VSIMs to connected vehicles.

Once the role and priority of the agent are determined, flow passes to step  to configure the vehicle settings based on the agent's role in the vehicle. Depending on the role of the agent, OBU  may communicate the agent's identity profile parameters corresponding to actuators and software applications of the particular seat occupied by the agent.

For purposes of illustration, it is assumed that a driver has highest priority and driver preferences can override any conflicting passenger preferences. It should be understood, however, that a passenger could be configured with a higher priority and override the driver's preferences for preferences not pertaining to the safety of the vehicle. Additionally, OBU  may also configure network interface accounts and network configurations for other mobile devices identified in the agent's identity profile (e.g., in a device list). Moreover, while examples have been provided for human agents, activating an identity profile of other types of agents authenticated to the OBU may also occur for any appropriate identity profile parameters in an authenticated agent's identity profile.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0206","num":"0205"},"figref":"FIG. 16","b":"79"},"Generally, payment association flow  of  represents both automatic and manual payment association to transaction applications. Flow  may be invoked when an agent is being provisioned, as indicated in step  of , or at any time during which an agent is authenticated to the vehicle. In the scenario in which the agent is being provisioned, flow  may occur automatically and, depending on the role and priority of the agent, may automatically associate the agent's payment methods to the identified one or more transactions. In another scenario in which the agent has already been provisioned and authenticated to the vehicle, then flow  may be invoked by the agent through an appropriate user interface of OBU  in which the agent may individually or collectively identify which transaction applications to associate with which payment methods.","Flow begins in step  where a transaction application is identified. The identified transaction application may be an application that is not associated with or initiated by an agent that has an associated payment method. Flow then passes to decision box  where a determination is made as to whether the agent attempting to make the payment association is authorized to change payment association for the identified transaction application (e.g., if the agent is being provisioned but is not the driver then the agent may not be authorized, if policies do not allow the agent to change payment associations then the agent will not be authorized, etc.). If the agent is not authorized as determined in decision box , then flow  ends and payment associations are not made.","If is determined in decision box  that the agent is authorized to change payment association for the identified transaction application, then flow passes to step . In step , a new payment method is identified from the agent's identity profile payment information or from the agent's corresponding VSIM. The agent's identity profile payment information may include information for a credit card, a debit card, a bank account, or other payment service providers. Alternatively, a VSIM associated with the agent could be used to provide payment. The VSIM could be used to connect to the associated mobile network operator, the payment could be received from the mobile network operator, and then the mobile network operator could bill the agent on the back end (e.g., with a set periodic or stand-alone bill to the agent). In a manual process of payment association, the agent can simply be provided with suitable options to select a desired payment method from options associated with the agent. In the automatic payment association, however, priority of available payment options can be pre-specified in any suitable way (e.g., an indication provided in the identity profile, etc.).","Once the payment method is determined in step , flow passes to step  to associate the selected payment method to the identified transaction application. In one embodiment, a separate mapping database may be provided to map identified transaction applications to selected payment methods. In another embodiment, an existing mapping database, such as transaction-to-agents mapping database , may be used and may include any suitable mechanism (e.g., pointer, link list, additional field, etc.) to indicate which agent to select to retrieve an associated payment method for the transaction application.","After the selected payment method is associated to the identified transaction application, flow passes to decision box  to determine whether another transaction application has been identified. If another transaction application has been identified (e.g., parking transaction application), then flow passes back to decision box  to process the newly identified transaction application. Steps  through  can be repeated until no more transaction applications are identified, and flow ends.","Turning to , simplified flowcharts with an authentication and secure transaction flow  and an identity profile access flow  are illustrated. Authentication and secure transaction flow  may be configured as a background process open and running whenever OBU  is booted up. Flow starts at step  where the process waits for an event for a transaction, which could have a trigger associated with an agent to initiate the transaction. Triggers could include, for example, a human agent attempting to initiate a transaction (e.g., by pressing a button or otherwise issuing commands through any suitable user interface on display , by using a mobile device to access OBU ), a machine device receiving or transmitting a signal (e.g., a detector receiving a signal from a toll system, a detector receiving a signal from a parking system, a sensor in the vehicle sending a signal to OBU , etc.), a software agent attempting to execute (e.g., requesting network credentials to automatically connect to an authorized entity, etc.), or an authorized entity attempting to access OBU  (e.g., authorized entity connected to the vehicle and attempting to access transaction applications on the vehicle, etc.).","When an event occurs, the event is detected in step  and then flow moves to step  to evaluate transaction-to-agents mapping database . In decision box , a determination is made as to whether the transaction is authorized. If the mapping database  does not indicate the transaction is authorized (e.g., the agent is not mapped to a transaction application corresponding to the transaction), then flow passes to  where the transaction is blocked. Flow then passes back to step  to wait for another event.","If transaction-to-agents mapping database  indicates the transaction is authorized (e.g., the agent is mapped to a transaction application corresponding to the transaction), as determined in decision box , then flow may pass to step  to identify authentication and confidentiality schemes by evaluating transaction-to-authentication\/confidentiality-schemes mapping database . Mapping database  may include which transactions require authentication of the associated agent. Although the agent should already be provisioned and authenticated to the vehicle when transaction processing occurs, some transactions may be of a sensitive nature, and authentication can be provided again. In addition, in one embodiment, initial authentication to the vehicle may be provided with a single authentication requirement, whereas authentication to conduct certain transactions may require multiple authentication requirements as indicated in agent-to-multi-factor-authentication mapping database  and transaction-to-authentication-and-confidentiality-schemes mapping database . For example, access to a banking transaction application that facilitates transactions to personal bank accounts of agents, may require re-authenticating the agent with multiple authentication requirements (e.g., biometrics in addition to a key fob used to initially authenticate to OBU ). In addition, mapping database  may also indicate other authentication and confidentiality schemes to be used by a transaction application such as, for example, a particular encryption mechanism for data associated with the transaction application. Additionally, any authentication protocols required for establishing network connections may also be provided in mapping database .","After authentication and confidentiality schemes are identified in step , flow passes to decision box  to determine whether agent authentication is required for the transaction. In one embodiment, if authentication is required, then multifactor authentication module  may be invoked in step , as previously discussed. If multi-factor authentication is required, the agent could be mapped to one or more of the same or different authentication requirements used during the initial authentication of the agent to OBU . Thus, multi-factor authentication flow could be configured to distinguish between initial authentication of an agent to OBU  and authentication of an agent for particular transactions. If the agent does not pass authentication as determined in decision box , then flow passes to step  where the transaction is blocked. Flow then passes back to step  to wait for another event.","If the agent passes authentication, as determined in decision box , or if authentication of the agent was not required, as determined in decision box , then flow passes to step  in which the identity profile may be accessed to obtain network credentials and any other needed profile information such as payment information for commercial transactions. Accessing the identity profile will be described in more detail herein with reference to . After the network credentials and any needed profile information are provided to the transaction application in step , flow passes to step  to allow the transaction. Flow then returns to step  to wait for another event. Although transactions can be processed by transaction processing flow  sequentially, it can be apparent that transaction processing flow  is intended to initiate each time an event is detected, which can occur simultaneously with other events. Thus, multiple transactions may be occurring on OBU  simultaneously.","Turning now to ,  illustrates a simplified flowchart of an access identity profile flow , which may occur in step  of . Flow  includes step  where application programming interfaces (APIs) are exposed to a transaction application corresponding to the transaction to enable the transaction application to securely access relevant parts of the identity profile. APIs may be provided to export parts of the identity profile to the transaction application to the extent that the transaction application is authorized to access the profile information. (e.g., credit\/payment information, social media web accounts, etc.)","Flow then moves to step  to determine the identity of the agent to be used to provide network credentials and\/or other profile information such as payment information. In a simple case, a human agent who initiates a commercial transaction by triggering an Internet commerce transaction application on OBU  may have an identity profile that can be used to obtain network credentials and payment information. In other transaction scenarios, however, the agent associated with the event may not have payment information and\/or network credentials. Therefore, the determination in step  accommodates certain transaction applications that need profile information from an agent other than the agent associated transaction. For example, a driver or other passenger may want to pay for toll transactions that occur automatically when a detector (agent) senses the toll system and initiates a toll transaction application. Therefore, the identity of the particular agent with the payment information needs to be determined. This can be accomplished in various ways including, for example, a display screen offering a human agent the option to pay the toll using identity profile information. Alternatively, a human agent could preconfigure the payment information through, for example, payment association module .","Once the determination is made in step , flow passes to decision box  to determine whether the identity profile of the agent is needed. In some transaction scenarios, network credentials for remote network access (e.g., VSIM, WiFi, etc.) may not be required for a transaction application. For example, a transaction application merely accessing in-vehicle networks and having no commercial component may not need any identity profile information. In this case, flow passes to step  to get network credentials for in-vehicle networks, if the transaction application accesses an in-vehicle network. Flow then passes to step  to provide the in-vehicle network credentials to the transaction application, if needed.","If the identity profile is needed for a transaction application requiring remote network access or a transaction application occurring internally (e.g., not requiring remote network access), as determined in decision box , then flow passes to step . In step , network credentials are obtained from identity profile, if needed. Flow may then pass to step  to perform opportunistic selection of VSIM, if needed, which will be further described herein with reference to . Opportunistic selection of VSIM may be needed if VSIM selection rules apply to the particular agent, the transaction application, and\/or vehicle geographical location. Steps  and  may not be necessary if the transaction application does not need remote network access.","After the VSIM is selected, then flow passes to decision box  to determine whether other profile information is needed from the agent's identity profile. Other information includes, for example, payment information, which could be appropriate if the transaction application has a commercial component. If other profile information is needed, then flow passes to step  to get the other profile information and provide such information to the transaction application.

Flow then passes to step  where one or more preferred VSIMs are identified from VSIM selection rules mapping database . In decision box , a determination is made as to whether the current VSIM(s), which could include one or more VSIMs, are equivalent to the preferred VSIM(s) identified from VSIM selection rules mapping database . When opportunistic VSIM selection flow  is processing to evaluate an established network connection associated with a transaction application, the current VSIM(s) could be one or more VSIMs currently being used for the established network connection. However, when opportunistic VSIM selection flow  is processing during identity profile access flow  at step , then the current VSIM(s) could be one or more VSIMs selected from an identity profile for a transaction application waiting to receive network credentials. If the preferred VSIM(s) are different from the current VSIM(s), then the flow passes to  where the current VSIM(s) are changed to the preferred VSIM(s). In the case of an established network connection, the network connection may be moved to network access links enabled by the preferred VSIM(s).","After the current VSIM(s) are changed to the preferred VSIM(s) in step , or if the current VSIM(s) are equivalent to the preferred VSIM(s) as determined in decision box , then flow passes to step  to evaluate network conditions. In the next decision box , a determination is made as to whether any policies override the current VSIM(s) because, in one embodiment, various network conditions and policies related to such network conditions may override a VSIM preference. For example, a VSIM preference based on a particular location, such as a preference for using mobile network operator X in New York because it is more cost effective than using mobile network operator Y, may be overridden if the network conditions of mobile network operator X are not suitable. Similarly, multiple VSIMs, or a VSIM associated with another agent may be selected, depending on network conditions and authorization to use the other agent's network credentials. Thus, if policies based on network conditions override the current VSIM(s), then flow passes to step  where the current VSIM(s) are changed to one or more VSIMs consistent with the policy. After the current VSIM(s) are changed in step , or if policies and network conditions did not require a change to the current VSIM(s) as determined in decision box , flow ends, and the associated transaction application may establish a network connection using the current VSIM(s) or may continue network access with the current VSIM(s), as appropriate.","By using the infrastructure described above, a connected vehicle can opportunistically switch between multiple VSIM identities to allow for multiple identity profiles to be used during the vehicle's lifecycle. Thus, the infrastructure enables multiple agents to source communication from the vehicle. To illustrate these features, an example scenario will now be described of a possible lifecycle of a connected vehicle and identities associated with the connected vehicle.","In the beginning of the life of a vehicle (e.g., vehicle ), a manufacturer of the vehicle may provision an OBU (e.g., OBU ) configured within vehicle  with a physical UICC card that is initialized with an identity associated with the vehicle manufacturer, which can be used for authentication to download soft SIM or VSIM identities issued by mobile network operators. A software agent may also be provisioned in OBU  to connect to a desired an identity service provider  (e.g., third party identity service provider, mobile network operator, manufacturer identity service provider, etc.) to obtain the VSIM. For example, if vehicle  is manufactured in Japan, then software agent may use the manufacturer VSIM to authenticate vehicle  to the identity service provider, and then download a VSIM to be used during quality assurance testing before vehicle  is exported from Japan to an automotive dealer in the United States (U.S.).","After vehicle  is shipped and crosses an international border such as the U.S., the software agent can use manufacturer VSIM identity to download a VSIM of a local mobile network operator (e.g., Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile, SPRINT, PCS, etc.), by accessing an identity service provider  through which the manufacturer has provisioned VSIMs. This may be desirable for the manufacturer to avoid expensive roaming charges. Thus, the manufacturer may be able to negotiate a better rate (e.g., for a particular area) with different mobile network operators at any time and simply update the associated VSIM on vehicle .","When a consumer purchases vehicle  from the automotive dealer and becomes an owner of vehicle , he may provision one or more different VSIMs on the OBU of vehicle  for his own network access. The owner may authenticate to a desired identity service provider  and download a desired one or more VSIMs to be used for connectivity (e.g., 3G, 4G, LTE) by the owner. The owner may also download an identity profile to allow personalization of contacts and various preferences provided in the identity profile, as previously described herein (e.g., personalized contacts, vehicle settings, payment methods, device lists, etc.). The owner may also configure authentication requirements to authenticate to vehicle  (e.g., set up as desired via key fob, user ID and password, biometrics, etc.).","If another member of the owner's family drives vehicle , another VSIM may be provisioned. The family member may authenticate to the same or different identity service provider and download his own one or more VSIMs, which could correspond to the same or different mobile network operators. In addition, a separate identity profile for the family member may also be downloaded to allow for personalization of preferences, subject to policies implemented by the owner or other superagent and subject to priorities related to the role of an agent at a particular time (e.g., driver vs. passenger). The family member may also configure authentication requirements, which could be provided in identity profile, in order to authenticate to vehicle  each time the family member is in the vehicle as a driver or a passenger.","Finally, if vehicle  is sold, the new owner can download his particular one or more VSIMs and\/or identity profile from an appropriate identity service provider, and can create authentication requirements for authenticating to the vehicle. The VSIMs and identity profiles associated with the previous owner, any human agent associated with the previous owner, and any mobile devices may be removed from OBU . However, other identity profiles and VSIMs associated with agents such as authorized entities, machine devices, and software agents may remain on OBU , if appropriate.","In certain implementations and numerous examples provided herein, vehicle  is described with reference to an automobile. Communication system , however, is not limited to automobiles, but can be applied to a myriad of other types of vehicles (e.g., airplanes, boats, trains, etc.). It can be appreciated that the broad teachings disclosed herein are intended to include any type of vehicle (e.g., motorcycles, scooters, trains, railways, boats, Segways, etc.) used to move from one location to another location, including vehicles that are not designed to transport humans.","In certain example implementations, at least some portions of enabling secure transactions and flexible identity management activities outlined herein may be implemented in software. This could be inclusive of software provided in transaction security framework  of OBU  and in other modules and elements such as secure communication module . These elements and\/or modules can cooperate with each other in order to perform the enabling secure transactions and flexible identity management activities as discussed herein. In other embodiments, one or more of these features may be implemented in hardware, provided external to these elements, or consolidated in any appropriate manner. For example, some of the processors associated with the various elements may be removed, or otherwise consolidated such that a single processor and a single memory location are responsible for certain activities. In a general sense, the arrangements depicted in the FIGURES may be more logical in their representations, whereas a physical architecture may include various permutations, combinations, and\/or hybrids of these elements.","Any of the memory items discussed herein should be construed as being encompassed within the broad term \u2018memory element.\u2019 Similarly, any of the potential processing elements, modules, and machines described in this Specification should be construed as being encompassed within the broad term \u2018processor.\u2019 Furthermore, OBU , and each separate component of OBU , may also include suitable interfaces for receiving, transmitting, and\/or otherwise communicating data or information in a network environment.","Note that with the numerous examples provided herein, interaction may be described in terms of two, three, four, or more network elements. However, this has been done for purposes of clarity and example only. It should be appreciated that the system can be consolidated in any suitable manner. Along similar design alternatives, any of the illustrated computers, modules, components, and elements of the FIGURES may be combined in various possible configurations, all of which are clearly within the broad scope of this Specification. In certain cases, it may be easier to describe one or more of the functionalities of a given set of flows by only referencing a limited number of network elements. It should be appreciated that teachings of the present disclosure are readily scalable and can accommodate a large number of components, as well as more complicated\/sophisticated arrangements and configurations. Accordingly, the examples provided should not limit the scope or inhibit the broad teachings of communication system  as potentially applied to a myriad of other architectures.","It is also important to note that the operations and steps described with reference to the preceding FIGURES illustrate only some of the possible scenarios that may be executed by, or within, the system. Some of these operations may be deleted or removed where appropriate, or these steps may be modified or changed considerably without departing from the scope of the discussed concepts. In addition, the timing of these operations may be altered considerably and still achieve the results taught in this disclosure. The preceding operational flows have been offered for purposes of example and discussion. Substantial flexibility is provided by the system in that any suitable arrangements, chronologies, configurations, and timing mechanisms may be provided without departing from the teachings of the discussed concepts.","Although the present disclosure has been described in detail with reference to particular arrangements and configurations, these example configurations and arrangements may be changed significantly without departing from the scope of the present disclosure. For example, although the present disclosure has been described with reference to particular communication exchanges involving certain network access and protocols, communication system  may be applicable to other exchanges or routing protocols in which packets are exchanged in order to provide mobility data, connectivity parameters, access management, etc. Moreover, although communication system  has been illustrated with reference to particular elements and operations that facilitate the communication process, these elements and operations may be replaced by any suitable architecture or process that achieves the intended functionality of communication system .","In order to assist the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and, additionally, any readers of any patent issued on this application in interpreting the claims appended hereto, Applicant wishes to note that the Applicant: (a) does not intend any of the appended claims to invoke paragraph six (6) of 35 U.S.C. section  as it exists on the date of the filing hereof unless the words \u201cmeans for\u201d or \u201cstep for\u201d are specifically used in the particular claims; and (b) does not intend, by any statement in the specification, to limit this disclosure in any way that is not otherwise reflected in the appended claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["To provide a more complete understanding of the present disclosure and features and advantages thereof, reference is made to the following description, taken in conjunction with the accompanying figures, wherein like reference numerals represent like parts, in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0006","num":"0005"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":"FIG. 3A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIG. 3B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIGS. 8A-8B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIGS. 10-19"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
