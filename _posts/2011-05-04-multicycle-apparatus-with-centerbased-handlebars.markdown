{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","Overview"],"p":["The subject disclosure generally relates to a multi-cycle apparatus, and more specifically to a multi-cycle apparatus having handlebars extending from a centralized position.","By way of background concerning conventional multi-cycle apparatuses (e.g., bicycles, tricycles, etc.), it is noted that such apparatuses often include various undesirable structural characteristics. For instance, conventional bicycles are structured to include a frame in which a steering column is attached to a front portion of the frame substantially away from a centralized seat. Conventional bicycles thus require riders to straddle a center portion of the frame, which makes mounting such bicycles particularly difficult for some riders. Straddling a bicycle may also undesirably result in injuries to a rider's groin in the event of an accident. Furthermore, by positioning the steering column substantially away from a centralized seat, conventional bicycles undesirably require riders to reach away from their body to steer such bicycles.","Accordingly, it would be desirable to design a multi-cycle apparatus which overcomes these limitations. To this end, it should be noted that the above-described deficiencies are merely intended to provide an overview of some of the problems of conventional systems, and are not intended to be exhaustive. Other problems with the state of the art and corresponding benefits of some of the various non-limiting embodiments may become further apparent upon review of the following detailed description.","A simplified summary is provided herein to help enable a basic or general understanding of various aspects of exemplary, non-limiting embodiments that follow in the more detailed description and the accompanying drawings. This summary is not intended, however, as an extensive or exhaustive overview. Instead, the sole purpose of this summary is to present some concepts related to some exemplary non-limiting embodiments in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description of the various embodiments that follow.","In accordance with one or more embodiments and corresponding disclosure, various non-limiting aspects are described in connection with a multi-cycle apparatus having center-based handlebars. In one such aspect, a multi-cycle apparatus is provided, which includes a seat, a steering column, and a handle bar. Within such embodiment, the steering column is substantially below the seat, and the handle bar is coupled to the steering column. Furthermore, for this particular embodiment, at least a portion of the handle bar extends behind a midpoint of the seat.","In another aspect, a bicycle apparatus is provided, which includes a rear bicycle frame, a steering column coupled to the rear bicycle frame, and a handle bar extending from the steering column. Here, it is contemplated that the steering column is positioned substantially under a seat attached to the rear bicycle frame. For this embodiment, it is also contemplated that the handle bar wraps around a rear portion of the seat.","In a further aspect, another bicycle apparatus is provided, which includes a rear bicycle frame, a steering column, and a handle bar. Within such embodiment, the steering column is coupled to the rear bicycle frame such that the steering column is substantially positioned directly below a seat attached to the rear bicycle frame. The handle bar is then coupled to the steering column so that at least a portion of the handle bar extends behind a midpoint of the seat.","Other embodiments and various non-limiting examples, scenarios and implementations are described in more detail below.","As discussed in the background, conventional multi-cycle apparatuses include various undesirable structural characteristics. The various embodiments disclosed herein are directed towards overcoming such limitations by providing a multi-cycle apparatus with a centralized steering mechanism. Namely, a multi-cycle apparatus is disclosed which desirably excludes a center portion of a frame. By excluding such center portion, the disclosed embodiments disclose a novel structure which facilitates steering from an area proximate to a rider, and which facilitates mounting\/riding without having to straddle the multi-cycle apparatus.","Referring first to , an exemplary multi-cycle apparatus is provided according to an embodiment. In an aspect, multi-cycle apparatus  includes seat , steering column , handle bar , and rear bicycle frame , which may be coupled as shown. Moreover, for this particular embodiment, steering column  is coupled to rear bicycle frame , wherein seat  is affixed atop a shaft that extends in a substantially vertical direction from within rear bicycle frame , and wherein handle bar  attaches to a top end of steering column . In various aspects, unlike conventional bicycles in which steering columns are positioned substantially in front of a rider, it is contemplated that steering column  is positioned directly below seat . Furthermore, rather than having handle bars extend from a steering column substantially in front of a rider, handle bar  extends from a centralized position below the rider which facilitates steering multi-cycle apparatus  from a region proximate to seat .","As illustrated, in addition to handle bar , steering column  may further include front wheel  coupled to shock absorber . In an aspect, it is contemplated that minimizing obstructions directly in front of a rider may be desirable. Accordingly, for some embodiments, a size of front wheel  may be chosen which is substantially smaller than wheels on conventional bicycles.","In a further aspect, it should be appreciated that rear bicycle frame  includes rear wheel  and pedals , which is substantially similar to the rear portion of conventional bicycles. Nevertheless, although multi-cycle apparatus  is illustrated within the context of a bicycle embodiment, it is contemplated that other multi-cycle embodiments may also be implemented without departing from the scope and spirit of the instant invention. For instance, rather than utilizing rear bicycle frame  it is contemplated that a rear portion of a tricycle frame can be utilized as well.","As illustrated, multi-cycle apparatus  may also include computing device . Within such embodiment, it is contemplated that computing device  can perform any of various computing operations including, for example, tracking any of a plurality of biometrics (e.g., calories burned, heart rate, etc.), as well as any of a plurality of other metrics (e.g., distance traveled, speed, GPS location, etc.). For some riders, it should be noted that determining which apparatus-specific parameters (e.g., handle bar position, wheelbase width, seat height, etc.) yield particularly optimal results (e.g., heart rate, speed, etc.) may be desirable. To facilitate such determination, it may be beneficial for computing device  to exchange data with external devices (e.g., personal digital assistant, server, personal computer, etc.) via a wireless network (e.g., Bluetooth, WiFi, etc.). Accordingly, it is contemplated that various types of data can be stored, received, and\/or transmitted via computing device . Furthermore, although computing device  is shown attached to steering column , it should be appreciated that computing device  can be attached to any portion of multi-cycle apparatus  (e.g., seat , handle bar , etc.).","Exemplary Handle Bar Embodiments","Various exemplary non-limiting handle bar embodiments are now disclosed. To this end, it is noted that the embodiments described herein are not intended to be exhaustive, and that one of ordinary skill will appreciate that various undisclosed embodiments also fall within the scope and spirit of the instant invention.","In an aspect, it is contemplated that differently configured handle bars may be desired for different people\/uses. To facilitate such desirability, the multi-cycle apparatus disclosed herein may include a mechanism for interchanging different handle bars. For example, handle bars may be interchanged by inserting a desired handle bar into the steering column.","Referring next to , an exemplary handle bar in a default position is provided according to an embodiment. As illustrated, default configuration  includes handle bar  coupled to steering column , wherein handle bar  is proximate to a rear portion of seat . For this particular embodiment, rather than having riders bend forward to steer, default configuration  thus allows riders to simply lean back for handle bar . Accordingly, for riders who may have difficulty bending forward, default configuration  provides a desirable alternative in which steering is achieved from a substantially upright position.","In another aspect, an embodiment is disclosed in which handle bars are configured to extend vertically from default configuration . In , for instance, an exemplary handle bar in a vertical position is provided according to an embodiment. As illustrated, vertical configuration  includes handle bar  coupled to steering column , wherein handle bar  wraps behind a rear portion of seat  to a vertical position substantially above the default position. Accordingly, rather than having riders steer by bending forward (as in conventional bicycles) or reach back (as in default configuration ), vertical configuration  enables riders to steer from a substantially upright position in which handle bar  is proximate to the rider's torso. In a particular embodiment, it should be appreciated that handle bar  may be further configured to include \u201cforearm rests\u201d (not shown) to facilitate a more comfortable steering of vertical configuration .","In yet another aspect, an embodiment is disclosed in which handle bars are configured to extend forward from vertical configuration . In , for instance, an exemplary handle bar in a forward position is provided according to an embodiment. As illustrated, forward configuration  includes handle bar  coupled to steering column , wherein handle bar  extends to a forward position substantially in front of the vertical position. Here, although some implementations of forward configuration  may require riders to steer by bending forward, as in conventional bicycles, riders may nevertheless prefer forward configuration  since straddling a bicycle frame is avoided. In an aspect, similar to handle bar  in vertical configuration , handle bar  may be configured to include \u201cforearm rests\u201d (not shown) to facilitate a more comfortable steering of forward configuration . In another aspect, handle bar  may be configured to wrap inward so as to provide a more stable steering mechanism.","It is further contemplated that, rather than interchanging multiple handle bars, a single adjustable handle bar can be utilized. Referring next to , an exemplary adjustable handle bar is provided according to an embodiment. As illustrated, adjustable configuration  includes extendable handle bar , which is extendable from steering column . Within such embodiment, handle bar  may comprise a locking mechanism, wherein the locking mechanism is configured to lock extendable handle bar  into any of a plurality of positions. For this particular example, extendable handle bar  is configured to lock into any of default lock position , vertical lock position , or forward lock position , as shown.","To this end, it should be noted that default lock position , vertical lock position , and forward lock position , are substantially analogous to default configuration , vertical configuration , and forward configuration , respectively. For instance, adjustable configuration  may be designed to facilitate locking extendable handle bar  into default lock position  behind a midpoint of seat , wherein extendable handle bar  is then configured to extend further from this default position proximate to seat .","In a particular embodiment, extendable handle bar  is configured to extend from a default position proximate to a rear portion of seat  into an extended position substantially above the default position, which may or may not extend in front of seat . For instance, as illustrated, adjustable configuration  may be designed to facilitate locking extendable handle bar  from default lock position  into vertical lock position . Adjustable configuration  may then be further designed to facilitate locking extendable handle bar  from vertical lock position  into forward lock position , wherein forward lock position  is substantially in front of a midpoint of seat , as shown.","Steering Column Coupling Embodiments","Various exemplary non-limiting embodiments are now disclosed for coupling a steering column to a frame. To this end, it is noted that the embodiments described herein are not intended to be exhaustive, and that one of ordinary skill will appreciate that various undisclosed embodiments also fall within the scope and spirit of the instant invention.","Referring next to  an exemplary welding of a steering column to a rear bicycle frame is illustrated according to an embodiment. Specifically, a coupling configuration  is shown, which includes steering column  and rear bicycle frame . Within such embodiment, steering column  is welded directly onto rear bicycle frame  via welding , which may provide a desirably stronger coupling of steering column  to rear bicycle frame . Indeed, welding  may be a particularly desirable coupling for specifications requiring a higher structural stress tolerance (e.g., specifications designed for rugged terrains).","In an aspect, it is contemplated that multi-cycle apparatuses having various steering column designs may be desired for different people\/uses. To facilitate such desirability, the multi-cycle apparatus disclosed herein may include a mechanism for interchanging different steering columns. Referring next to , an exemplary removable steering column is provided according to an embodiment. As illustrated, removable configuration  includes steering column  which is configured to detach from rear bicycle frame . For this particular embodiment, steering column  farther includes attachment clips , which attach to rear bicycle frame  via attachment points , as shown. For further stability, it should be appreciated that various aspects of removable configuration  can be modified. For instance, a slipping of attachment clips  away from attachment points  may be mitigated by including indentations at attachment points . Slipping may also be mitigated by modifying attachment clips  in any of a plurality of ways (e.g., including a tightening screw).","In other aspects, multi-cycle apparatus designs having various wheelbase widths are contemplated. To this end, it is noted that a desired wheelbase width may vary according to use and\/or personal preference. For instance, riders wanting to race their multi-cycle apparatus may prefer a wider wheelbase to increase stability.","In  an illustration comparing exemplary bicycles having different wheelbase widths according to a welded steering column embodiment is provided. As illustrated, multi-cycle apparatus  is configured to have a wheelbase  between front wheel  and rear wheel  of \u201cX\u201d units, whereas multi-cycle apparatus  is configured to have a wider wheelbase  between front wheel  and rear wheel  of \u201cX+Y\u201d units. Here, it should be noted that differences in wheelbase widths may be achieved via differently sized welding couplings. For this particular embodiment, the width difference between wheelbase  and wheelbase  is a direct result of welding  being wider than welding .","Variable wheelbase widths may also be implemented via embodiments having detachable steering columns In , for example, an illustration comparing exemplary bicycles having different wheelbase widths according to a removable steering column embodiment is provided. As illustrated, multi-cycle apparatus  is configured to have a wheelbase  between front wheel  and rear wheel  of \u201cX\u201d units, whereas multi-cycle apparatus  is configured to have a wider wheelbase  between front wheel  and rear wheel  of \u201cX+Y\u201d units. Here, it should be noted that differences between wheelbase widths may be achieved by interchanging attachment clips and\/or steering columns. For this particular embodiment, the width difference between wheelbase  and wheelbase  is a direct result of attachment clips  being wider than attachment clips .","In an aspect, rather than selecting from different \u201cwelded\u201d configurations and\/or interchanging attachment clips, a single multi-cycle apparatus having an adjustable wheelbase design is contemplated. Referring next to , an exemplary locking mechanism for facilitating an adjustable wheelbase design according to an embodiment is provided. As illustrated, locking mechanism  is configured to lock the wheel base into any of a plurality of positions. For this particular embodiment, rear bicycle frame  includes adjustment dowel , and steering column  includes adjustment sleeve , wherein adjustment dowel  is configured to mate with adjustment sleeve . Specifically, adjustment dowel  includes adjustment peg , which is configured to lock into any of adjustment holes  on adjustment sleeve , wherein each of adjustment holes  correspond to a different wheelbase width.","In yet another aspect, it is contemplated that wheelbase adjustments may be desired while the multi-cycle apparatus is in motion. In , for instance, an exemplary extendable wheelbase mechanism is shown according to an embodiment. As illustrated, non-extended multi-cycle apparatus  is configured to have a wheelbase  of \u201cX\u201d units, whereas extended multi-cycle apparatus  is configured to have a wider wheelbase  of \u201cX+Y\u201d units. Here, it should be noted that non-extended multi-cycle apparatus  is configured to vary wheelbase  by extending extendable wheelbase spacing  via any of a plurality of mechanisms. For this particular embodiment, a mechanism is disclosed whereby extendable wheelbase spacing  expands (i.e., wherein wheelbase  is increased) in response to a tilting of seat  and\/or a rotation of handle bars . Namely, as shown with respect to extended multi-cycle apparatus , a tilting of seat  and\/or a rotation of handle bars  can result in an expansion of extendable wheelbase spacing  being extended (i.e., yielding wheelbase ). Furthermore, although not shown here, it is contemplated that extendable wheelbase spacing  can be configured to contract back to its original un-extended state (i.e., the state shown for extendable wheelbase spacing ) via a tilting of seat  and\/or a rotation of handle bars  in an opposite direction.","Exemplary Electrical configurations","Various exemplary non-limiting embodiments are now disclosed for electrical components that may be included within the multi-cycle apparatus described herein. To this end, it is noted that the embodiments described herein are not intended to be exhaustive, and that one of ordinary skill will appreciate that various undisclosed embodiments also fall within the scope and spirit of the instant invention.","In an aspect, a novel frontal light configuration is contemplated, as shown in . As illustrated, configuration  includes light  attached beneath seat  and electrically coupled to power source . Here, it should be noted that attaching a light beneath the seat of conventional bicycles is not practical since the area directly in front of a conventional bicycle's seat is obstructed by the bicycle's steering mechanism. Lights in conventional bicycles are therefore usually attached to the steering column. Here, however, since an apparatus having a centralized steering mechanism is disclosed, the area directly in front of seat  is substantially unobstructed. Accordingly, the novel placing of light  beneath seat  is both practical and desirable.","With respect to power source , it should be noted that any of a plurality of known power sources can be used (e.g., a conventional battery) and that power source  can be affixed anywhere on the disclosed multi-cycle apparatus (e.g., steering column, seat, frame, etc.). It should be further noted that, although power source  is only shown connected to light , it is contemplated that power source  could provide power to any of a plurality of electrical components in addition to, or instead of, light  (e.g., a computing device, navigation device, radio, etc.).","In another aspect, power generating configurations are also contemplated. Referring next to , an exemplary coupling of a power source to a power generator is illustrated according to an embodiment. Here, similar to configuration , configuration  includes light  attached beneath seat  and electrically coupled to power source . However, for this particular embodiment, power source  is charged\/recharged by power generator . To this end, it is noted that any of a plurality of power generating mechanisms can be implemented. For instance, power generator  may include pedals  and\/or solar panels , wherein pedals  facilitate generating power from a rider's peddling, and wherein solar panels  facilitate generating power via photovoltaic cells.","In yet another aspect, rather than requiring riders to turn a switch to power electrical components, a motion-triggered apparatus is contemplated. In , for instance, an exemplary coupling of a power source to a motion sensor according to an embodiment is illustrated. Here, similar to configuration  and configuration , configuration  includes light  attached beneath seat  and electrically coupled to power source . For this particular embodiment, however, configuration  includes motion sensor  which is configured to sense a motion of rear wheel . Upon sensing a motion of rear wheel , motion sensor  may be configured to trigger a switch on power source , which provides power to the various electrical components of the multi-cycle apparatus. Furthermore, it should be noted that although motion sensor  is shown here as attached to rear wheel  and configured to monitor a motion of rear wheel , one of ordinary skill will appreciate that motion sensor  can be attached anywhere on the multi-cycle apparatus (e.g., a front wheel) and configured to monitor a motion of any component. It should also be noted that any of various non-motion sensors can be utilized to trigger power source  (e.g., a heat sensor configured to sense the presence of a rider, a pressure sensor configured to sense a pressure applied to a seat, etc.).","Exemplary Networked and Distributed Environments","One of ordinary skill in the art can appreciate that various embodiments for implementing the use of a computing device (e.g., computing device  in ) and related embodiments described herein can be implemented in connection with any computer or other client or server device, which can be deployed as part of a computer network or in a distributed computing environment, and can be connected to any kind of data store.
