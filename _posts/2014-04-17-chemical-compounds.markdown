{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7119(e) of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61\/917,532, filed on Dec. 18, 2013, and U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61\/813,809, filed on Apr. 19, 2013, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.","The invention relates to sulfonamide derivatives, to their use in medicine, to compositions containing them, to processes for their preparation and to intermediates used in such processes.","Uric acid is the final product of purine metabolism in humans. In humans, unlike many other animals, uric acid is not further broken down, but is predominantly (70%) excreted into the urine with the remaining 30% excreted in faeces. Hyperuricemia is defined as an excessive production or decreased excretion of uric acid and can occur as an overproduction or under excretion of serum uric acid (sUA), or a combination of the both. Renal under excretion of uric acid is the primary cause of hyperuricemia in about 90% of cases, while overproduction is the cause in less than 10%. Increased sUA concentration above 6.8 mg\/dL results in crystallisation of uric acid in the form of salts, such as monosodium urate, and to precipitation of these crystals in joints, on tendons and in the surrounding tissues. These crystals (known as tophi) trigger a local immune-mediated inflammatory reaction, leading to gout. The risk of gout increases with increased sUA levels.","Gout is a painful condition that can present in a number of ways, although the most usual is a recurrent attack of acute inflammatory arthritis (a red, tender, hot, swollen joint) often occurring in big toes, heels, knees, wrists and fingers.","Gout is treated by agents to both decrease the cause and effects of uric acid crystal inflammation and pain.","The pain associated with gout is commonly treated with pain and anti-inflammatory drugs such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), colchicine and steroids. Agents that decrease sUA levels may be used to treat the cause of gout. These include agents that: inhibit the enzymes that result in uric acid production, such as xanthine oxidase inhibitors (e.g. allopurinol, febuxostat or tisopurine), or purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) inhibitors (e.g. ulodesine); metabolise uric acid, such as urate oxidases\u2014also known as uricases (e.g. pegloticase); or increase the excretion of uric acid in the urine (uricosurics), Uricosurics include agents that inhibit the transporters responsible for renal reabsorption of uric acid back into the blood, such as benziodarone, isobromindione, probenecid and sulphinpyrazone, and URAT-1 inhibitors (e.g. benzbromarone).","URAT-1 is also known as solute carrier family 22 (organic anion\/cation transporter), member 12, and is encoded by the gene SLC22A12. Human genetic analysis has demonstrated that polymorphisms in the SLC22A12 gene are directly associated with changes in serum uric acid. Inhibitors of uric acid transport, such as URAT-1, are therefore effective in the treatment of gout.","There is a continuing need to provide new treatments for gout that are more effective and\/or are better tolerated.","Certain URAT-1 inhibitors for the treatment of gout are known. WO2011\/159840 discloses phenylthioacetate URAT-1 inhibitors. Additionally, WO2008\/118758, WO2009\/012242, WO2010\/079443, WO2012\/004706, WO2012\/004714 and WO2012\/004743 disclose sulphonamides.","There is, however, an ongoing need to provide new URAT-1 inhibitors that are good drug candidates.","Furthermore, preferred compounds should have one or more of the following properties: be well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract; be metabolically stable; have a good metabolic profile, in particular with respect to the toxicity or allergenicity of any metabolites formed; or possess favourable pharmacokinetic properties whilst still retaining their activity profile as URAT-1 inhibitors. They should be non-toxic and demonstrate few side-effects. Ideal drug candidates should exist in a physical form that is stable, non-hygroscopic and easily formulated.","We have now found new sulphonamide URAT-1 inhibitors.","According to a first aspect of the invention there is provided a compound of formula (I)",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0014"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"27.69mm","wi":"58.00mm","file":"US09067922-20150630-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":[{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{}],"sup":["1 ","1","1 ","2","3 ","5 ","4 ","6 ","2","2","2 ","7","8","7 ","8 "],"sub":["1","4","1","4","1","4","1","4","1","4","1","4","1","4","1","6","3","6","1","6","1","6","1","4"]},"Described below are a number of embodiments (E) of this first aspect of the invention, where for convenience E1 is identical thereto.\n\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0085"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00003","num":"00003"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00003","he":"27.69mm","wi":"58.00mm","file":"US09067922-20150630-C00003.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002","list-style":"none"},"li":[{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003","list-style":"none"},"li":["or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, wherein:","Ris a \u2018C-linked\u2019 6-membered heteroaryl containing one, two or three nitrogen atoms wherein said heteroaryl is optionally substituted by one, two or, valency permitting, three X;","each Xis independently selected from: F;

Examples include the acetate, adipate, aspartate, benzoate, besylate, bicarbonate\/carbonate, bisulphate\/sulphate, borate, camsylate, citrate, cyclamate, edisylate, esylate, formate, fumarate, gluceptate, gluconate, glucuronate, hexafluorophosphate, hibenzate, hydrochloride\/chloride, hydrobromide\/bromide, hydroiodide\/iodide, isethionate, lactate, malate, maleate, malonate, mesylate, methylsulphate, naphthylate, 2-napsylate, nicotinate, nitrate, orotate, oxalate, palmitate, pamoate, phosphate\/hydrogen phosphate\/dihydrogen phosphate, pyroglutamate, saccharate, stearate, succinate, tannate, tartrate, tosylate, trifluoroacetate and xinofoate salts.","Suitable base salts are formed from bases which form non-toxic salts. Examples include the aluminium, arginine, benzathine, calcium, choline, diethylamine, diolamine, glycine, lysine, magnesium, meglumine, olamine, potassium, sodium, tromethamine and zinc salts.","Hemisalts of acids and bases may also be formed, for example, hemisulphate and hemicalcium salts.","The skilled person will appreciate that the aforementioned salts include ones wherein the counterion is optically active, for example d-lactate or l-lysine, or racemic, for example dl-tartrate or dl-arginine.","For a review on suitable salts, see \u201cHandbook of Pharmaceutical Salts: Properties, Selection, and Use\u201d by Stahl and Wermuth (Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, Germany, 2002).","Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of compounds of formula (I) may be prepared by one or more of three methods:\n\n","All three reactions are typically carried out in solution. The resulting salt may precipitate out and be collected by filtration or may be recovered by evaporation of the solvent. The degree of ionisation in the resulting salt may vary from completely ionised to almost non-ionised.","The compounds of formula (I) or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof may exist in both unsolvated and solvated forms. The term \u2018solvate\u2019 is used herein to describe a molecular complex comprising a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable solvent molecules, for example, ethanol. The term \u2018hydrate\u2019 is employed when said solvent is water. Pharmaceutically acceptable solvates in accordance with the invention include those wherein the solvent of crystallization may be isotopically substituted, e.g. DO, d-acetone and d-DMSO.","A currently accepted classification system for organic hydrates is one that defines isolated site, channel, or metal-ion coordinated hydrates\u2014see by K. R. Morris (Ed. H. G. Brittain, Marcel Dekker, 1995), incorporated herein by reference. Isolated site hydrates are ones in which the water molecules are isolated from direct contact with each other by intervening organic molecules. In channel hydrates, the water molecules lie in lattice channels where they are next to other water molecules. In metal-ion coordinated hydrates, the water molecules are bonded to the metal ion.","When the solvent or water is tightly bound, the complex will have a well-defined stoichiometry independent of humidity. When, however, the solvent or water is weakly bound, as in channel solvates and hygroscopic compounds, the water\/solvent content will be dependent on humidity and drying conditions. In such cases, non-stoichiometry will be the norm.","The compounds of the invention may exist in a continuum of solid states ranging from fully amorphous to fully crystalline. The term \u2018amorphous\u2019 refers to a state in which the material lacks long range order at the molecular level and, depending upon temperature, may exhibit the physical properties of a solid or a liquid. Typically such materials do not give distinctive X-ray diffraction patterns and, while exhibiting the properties of a solid, are more formally described as a liquid. Upon heating, a change from solid to liquid properties occurs which is characterised by a change of state, typically second order (\u2018glass transition\u2019). The term \u2018crystalline\u2019 refers to a solid phase in which the material has a regular ordered internal structure at the molecular level and gives a distinctive X-ray diffraction pattern with defined peaks. Such materials when heated sufficiently will also exhibit the properties of a liquid, but the change from solid to liquid is characterised by a phase change, typically first order (\u2018melting point\u2019).","Also included within the scope of the invention are multi-component complexes (other than salts and solvates) of compounds of formula (I) or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof wherein the drug and at least one other component are present in stoichiometric or non-stoichiometric amounts. Complexes of this type include clathrates (drug-host inclusion complexes) and co-crystals. The latter are typically defined as crystalline complexes of neutral molecular constituents which are bound together through non-covalent interactions, but could also be a complex of a neutral molecule with a salt. Co-crystals may be prepared by melt crystallisation, by recrystallisation from solvents, or by physically grinding the components together\u2014see Chem Commun, 17, 1889-1896, by O. Almarsson and M. J. Zaworotko (2004), incorporated herein by reference. For a general review of multi-component complexes, see J Pharm Sci, 64 (8), 1269-1288, by Haleblian (August 1975), incorporated herein by reference.","The compounds of the invention may also exist in a mesomorphic state (mesophase or liquid crystal) when subjected to suitable conditions. The mesomorphic state is intermediate between the true crystalline state and the true liquid state (either melt or solution). Mesomorphism arising as the result of a change in temperature is described as \u2018thermotropic\u2019 and that resulting from the addition of a second component, such as water or another solvent, is described as \u2018lyotropic\u2019. Compounds that have the potential to form lyotropic mesophases are described as \u2018amphiphilic\u2019 and consist of molecules which possess an ionic (such as \u2014COONa, \u2014COOK, or \u2014SONa) or non-ionic (such as \u2014NN(CH)) polar head group. For more information, see by N. H. Hartshorne and A. Stuart, 4Edition (Edward Arnold, 1970), incorporated herein by reference.","The compounds of the invention may be administered as prodrugs. Thus certain derivatives of compounds of formula (I) which may have little or no pharmacological activity themselves can, when administered into or onto the body, be converted into compounds of formula (I) having the desired activity, for example, by hydrolytic cleavage. Such derivatives are referred to as \u2018prodrugs\u2019. Further information on the use of prodrugs may be found in \u2018Pro-drugs as Novel Delivery Systems, Vol. 14, ACS Symposium Series (T Higuchi and W Stella) and \u2018Bioreversible Carriers in Drug Design\u2019, Pergamon Press, 1987 (ed. E B Roche, American Pharmaceutical Association).","Prodrugs can, for example, be produced by replacing appropriate functionalities present in a compound of formula (I) with certain moieties known to those skilled in the art as \u2018pro-moieties\u2019 as described, for example, in \u201cDesign of Prodrugs\u201d by H Bundgaard (Elsevier, 1985).","Examples of prodrugs include phosphate prodrugs, such as dihydrogen or dialkyl (e.g. di-tert-butyl) phosphate prodrugs. Further examples of replacement groups in accordance with the foregoing examples and examples of other prodrug types may be found in the aforementioned references.","Also included within the scope of the invention are metabolites of compounds of formula (I), that is, compounds formed in vivo upon administration of the drug. Some examples of metabolites in accordance with the invention include, where the compound of formula (I) contains a phenyl (Ph) moiety, a phenol derivative thereof (-Ph>-PhOH);","Compounds of the invention containing one or more asymmetric carbon atoms can exist as two or more stereoisomers. Included within the scope of the invention are all stereoisomers of the compounds of the invention and mixtures of one or more thereof.","Conventional techniques for the preparation\/isolation of individual enantiomers include chiral synthesis from a suitable optically pure precursor or resolution of the racemate (or the racemate of a salt or derivative) using, for example, chiral high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC).","Alternatively, the racemate (or a racemic precursor) may be reacted with a suitable optically active compound, for example, an alcohol, or, in the case where the compound of formula (I) contains an acidic or basic moiety, a base or acid such as 1-phenylethylamine or tartaric acid. The resulting diastereomeric mixture may be separated by chromatography and\/or fractional crystallization and one or both of the diastereoisomers converted to the corresponding pure enantiomer(s) by means well known to a skilled person.","Chiral compounds of the invention (and chiral precursors thereof) may be obtained in enantiomerically-enriched form using chromatography, typically HPLC, on an asymmetric resin with a mobile phase consisting of a hydrocarbon, typically heptane or hexane, containing from 0 to 50% by volume of isopropanol, typically from 2% to 20%, and from 0 to 5% by volume of an alkylamine, typically 0.1% diethylamine. Concentration of the eluate affords the enriched mixture.","Mixtures of stereoisomers may be separated by conventional techniques known to those skilled in the art; see, for example, \u201cStereochemistry of Organic Compounds\u201d by E. L. Eliel and S. H. Wilen (Wiley, New York, 1994.","The scope of the invention includes all crystal forms of the compounds of the invention, including racemates and racemic mixtures (conglomerates) thereof. Stereoisomeric conglomerates may also be separated by the conventional techniques described herein just above.","The scope of the invention includes all pharmaceutically acceptable isotopically-labelled compounds of the invention wherein one or more atoms are replaced by atoms having the same atomic number, but an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number which predominates in nature.","Examples of isotopes suitable for inclusion in the compounds of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen, such as H and H, carbon, such as C, C and C, chlorine, such as Cl, fluorine, such as F, iodine, such as I and I, nitrogen, such as N and N, oxygen, such as O, O and O, phosphorus, such as P, and sulphur, such as S.","Certain isotopically-labelled compounds of the invention, for example, those incorporating a radioactive isotope, are useful in drug and\/or substrate tissue distribution studies. The radioactive isotopes tritium, i.e. H, and carbon-14, i.e. C, are particularly useful for this purpose in view of their ease of incorporation and ready means of detection. Substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium, i.e. H, may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example, increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements, and hence may be preferred in some circumstances. Substitution with positron emitting isotopes, such as C, F, O and N, can be useful in Positron Emission Topography (PET) studies for examining substrate receptor occupancy.","Isotopically-labeled compounds of formula (I) can generally be prepared by conventional techniques known to those skilled in the art or by processes analogous to those described in the accompanying Examples and Preparations using an appropriate isotopically-labeled reagent in place of the non-labeled reagent previously employed.","Also within the scope of the invention are intermediate compounds as hereinafter defined, all salts, solvates and complexes thereof and all solvates and complexes of salts thereof as defined hereinbefore for compounds of formula (I). The invention includes all polymorphs of the aforementioned species and crystal habits thereof.","When preparing a compound of formula (I) in accordance with the invention, a person skilled in the art may routinely select the form of intermediate which provides the best combination of features for this purpose. Such features include the melting point, solubility, processability and yield of the intermediate form and the resulting ease with which the product may be purified on isolation.","The compounds of the invention may be prepared by any method known in the art for the preparation of compounds of analogous structure. In particular, the compounds of the invention can be prepared by the procedures described by reference to the Schemes that follow, or by the specific methods described in the Examples, or by similar processes to either.","The skilled person will appreciate that the experimental conditions set forth in the schemes that follow are illustrative of suitable conditions for effecting the transformations shown, and that it may be necessary or desirable to vary the precise conditions employed for the preparation of compounds of formula (I). It will be further appreciated that it may be necessary or desirable to carry out the transformations in a different order from that described in the schemes, or to modify one or more of the transformations, to provide the desired compound of the invention.","In addition, the skilled person will appreciate that it may be necessary or desirable at any stage in the synthesis of compounds of the invention to protect one or more sensitive groups, so as to prevent undesirable side reactions. In particular, it may be necessary or desirable to protect amino or carboxylic acid groups. The protecting groups used in the preparation of the compounds of the invention may be used in conventional manner. See, for example, those described in \u2018Greene's Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis\u2019 by Theodora W Greene and Peter G M Wuts, fourth edition, (John Wiley and Sons, 2006), in particular chapters 7 (\u201cProtection for the Amino Group\u201d) and 5 (\u201cProtection for the Carboxyl Group\u201d), incorporated herein by reference, which also describes methods for the removal of such groups.","In the following general processes R, R, R, R, Rand Rare as previously defined for a compound of formula (I) unless otherwise stated. PG is a suitable amino protecting group, such as methoxymethyl or dimethoxybenzyl. Hal is a suitable halogen, such as F or Cl.

The formulation of tablets is discussed in \u201cPharmaceutical Dosage Forms: Tablets\u201d, Vol. 1, by H. Lieberman and L. Lachman (Marcel Dekker, New York, 1980).","Suitable modified release formulations for the purposes of the invention are described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,106,864. Details of other suitable release technologies such as high energy dispersions and osmotic and coated particles are to be found in \u201cPharmaceutical Technology On-line\u201d, 25(2), 1-14, by Verma et al (2001).

Suitable means for parenteral administration include intravenous, intraarterial, intraperitoneal, intrathecal, intraventricular, intraurethral, intrasternal, intracranial, intramuscular and subcutaneous. Suitable devices for parenteral administration include needle (including microneedle) injectors, needle-free injectors and infusion techniques.","Parenteral formulations are typically aqueous solutions which may contain excipients such as salts, carbohydrates and buffering agents (preferably to a pH of from 3 to 9), but, for some applications, they may be more suitably formulated as a sterile non-aqueous solution or as a dried form to be used in conjunction with a suitable vehicle such as sterile, pyrogen-free water.","The preparation of parenteral formulations under sterile conditions, for example, by lyophilisation, may readily be accomplished using standard pharmaceutical techniques well known to those skilled in the art.","The solubility of compounds of formula (I) used in the preparation of parenteral solutions may be increased by the use of appropriate formulation techniques, such as the incorporation of solubility-enhancing agents. Formulations for parenteral administration may be formulated to be immediate and\/or modified release. Modified release formulations include delayed-, sustained-, pulsed-, controlled-, targeted and programmed release. Thus compounds of the invention may be formulated as a solid, semi-solid, or thixotropic liquid for administration as an implanted depot providing modified release of the active compound.

For intranasal use, the powder may comprise a bioadhesive agent, for example, chitosan or cyclodextrin.","The pressurised container, pump, spray, atomizer, or nebuliser contains a solution or suspension of the compound(s) of the invention comprising, for example, ethanol, aqueous ethanol, or a suitable alternative agent for dispersing, solubilising, or extending release of the active, a propellant(s) as solvent and an optional surfactant, such as sorbitan trioleate, oleic acid, or an oligolactic acid.","Prior to use in a dry powder or suspension formulation, the drug product is micronised to a size suitable for delivery by inhalation (typically less than 5 microns). This may be achieved by any appropriate comminuting method, such as spiral jet milling, fluid bed jet milling, supercritical fluid processing to form nanoparticles, high pressure homogenisation, or spray drying.","Capsules (made, for example, from gelatin or hydroxypropylmethylcellulose), blisters and cartridges for use in an inhaler or insufflator may be formulated to contain a powder mix of the compound of the invention, a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch and a performance modifier such as l-leucine, mannitol, or magnesium stearate. The lactose may be anhydrous or in the form of the monohydrate, preferably the latter. Other suitable excipients include dextran, glucose, maltose, sorbitol, xylitol, fructose, sucrose and trehalose.","A suitable solution formulation for use in an atomiser using electrohydrodynamics to produce a fine mist may contain from 1 \u03bcg to 20 mg of the compound of the invention per actuation and the actuation volume may vary from 1 \u03bcl to 100 \u03bcl. A typical formulation may comprise a compound of formula (I), propylene glycol, sterile water, ethanol and sodium chloride. Alternative solvents which may be used instead of propylene glycol include glycerol and polyethylene glycol.","Suitable flavours, such as menthol and levomenthol, or sweeteners, such as saccharin or saccharin sodium, may be added to those formulations of the invention intended for inhaled\/intranasal administration.","In the case of dry powder inhalers and aerosols, the dosage unit is determined by means of a valve which delivers a metered amount. Units in accordance with the invention are typically arranged to administer a metered dose or \u201cpuff\u201d containing from 1 \u03bcg to 100 mg of the compound of formula (I). The overall daily dose will typically be in the range 1 \u03bcg to 200 mg which may be administered in a single dose or, more usually, as divided doses throughout the day.","The compounds of the invention may be administered rectally or vaginally, for example, in the form of a suppository, pessary, microbicide, vaginal ring or enema. Cocoa butter is a traditional suppository base, but various alternatives may be used as appropriate.","The compounds of the invention may also be administered directly to the eye or ear, typically in the form of drops of a micronised suspension or solution in isotonic, pH-adjusted, sterile saline. Other formulations suitable for ocular and aural administration include ointments, biodegradable (e.g. absorbable gel sponges, collagen) and non-biodegradable (e.g. silicone) implants, wafers, lenses and particulate or vesicular systems, such as niosomes or liposomes. A polymer such as crossed-linked polyacrylic acid, polyvinylalcohol, hyaluronic acid, a cellulosic polymer, for example, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, hydroxyethylcellulose, or methyl cellulose, or a heteropolysaccharide polymer, for example, gelan gum, may be incorporated together with a preservative, such as benzalkonium chloride. Such formulations may also be delivered by iontophoresis.","The compounds of the invention may be combined with soluble macromolecular entities, such as cyclodextrin and suitable derivatives thereof or polyethylene glycol-containing polymers, in order to improve their solubility, dissolution rate, taste-masking, bioavailability and\/or stability for use in any of the aforementioned modes of administration.","Drug-cyclodextrin complexes, for example, are found to be generally useful for most dosage forms and administration routes. Both inclusion and non-inclusion complexes may be used. As an alternative to direct complexation with the drug, the cyclodextrin may be used as an auxiliary additive, i.e. as a carrier, diluent, or solubiliser. Most commonly used for these purposes are alpha-, beta- and gamma-cyclodextrins, examples of which may be found in International Patent Applications Nos. WO 91\/11172, WO 94\/02518 and WO 98\/55148.","For administration to human patients, the total daily dose of the compounds of the invention is typically in the range 1 mg to 10 g, such as 10 mg to 1 g, for example 25 mg to 500 mg depending, of course, on the mode of administration and efficacy. For example, oral administration may require a total daily dose of from 50 mg to 100 mg. The total daily dose may be administered in single or divided doses and may, at the physician's discretion, fall outside of the typical range given herein. These dosages are based on an average human subject having a weight of about 60 kg to 70 kg. The physician will readily be able to determine doses for subjects whose weight falls outside this range, such as infants and the elderly.","As noted above, the compounds of the invention are useful because they exhibit pharmacological activity in animals, i.e., URAT-1 inhibition. More particularly, the compounds of the invention are of use in the treatment of disorders for which a URAT-1 inhibitor is indicated. Preferably the animal is a mammal, more preferably a human.","In a further aspect of the invention there is provided a compound of the invention for use as a medicament.","In a further aspect of the invention there is provided a compound of the invention for the treatment of a disorder for which a URAT-1 inhibitor is indicated.","In a further aspect of the invention there is provided use of a compound of the invention for the preparation of a medicament for the treatment of a disorder for which a URAT-1 inhibitor is indicated.","In a further aspect of the invention there is provided a method of treating a disorder in an animal (preferably a mammal, more preferably a human) for which a URAT-1 inhibitor is indicated, comprising administering to said animal a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention.","Disorders for which a URAT-1 inhibitor is indicated include diseases associated with high levels of uric acid in humans and other mammals including (but not limited to) hyperuricemia, asymptomatic hyperuricemia, gout (including juvenile forms), gouty arthritis, inflammatory arthritis, joint inflammation, deposition of urate crystals in the joint, tophaceous gout, chronic kidney disease, nephrolithiasis (kidney stones), Lesch-Nyhan syndrome and Kelley-Seegmiller syndrome.","Hyperuricemia may be defined by blood uric acid levels over 6.8 mg\/dL. Guidelines for the management of hyperuricemia recommend that therapies aimed at lowering blood uric acid levels should be maintained until such blood uric acid levels are lowered to below 6.0 mg\/dL, such as below 5.0 mg\/dL.","The skilled person will appreciate that while by definition without symptoms, asymptomatic hyperuricemia may nevertheless lead to the onset of diseases associated with high levels of uric acid.","The skilled person will also appreciate that the compounds of formula (I) may be used in the treatment of hyperuricemia where this is present together with one or more other diseases, such as kidney failure, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease (e.g. hypertension, myocardial infarction, heart failure, coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, atherosclerosis, angina, aneurism, hyperlipidemia and stroke), obesity, metabolic syndrome, myeloproliferative disorders, lymphoproliferative disorders and disorders associated with certain medications, such as a diuretic (e.g. a thiazide), an immunosuppressant (e.g. a cyclosporine therapy), a chemotherapeutic agent (e.g. cisplatin) or aspirin.","The skilled person will also appreciate that the compounds of formula (I) may be used in the treatment of hyperuricemia where this is present following organ transplant.","A URAT-1 inhibitor may be usefully combined with another pharmacologically active compound, or with two or more other pharmacologically active compounds, particularly in the treatment of a disease associated with elevated blood uric acid levels. Such combinations offer the possibility of significant advantages, including patient compliance, ease of dosing and synergistic activity.","In the combinations that follow the compound of the invention may be administered simultaneously, sequentially or separately in combination with the other therapeutic agent or agents.","The compounds of formula (I) may be administered in combination with one or more additional therapeutic agents. Agents of interest include those that also lower blood uric acid levels. Other agents of interest include those that reduce inflammation or pain. The one or more additional therapeutic agents may be selected from any of the agents or types of agent that follow:\n\n","There is also included within the scope the present invention combinations of a compound of the invention together with one or more additional therapeutic agents which slow down the rate of metabolism of the compound of the invention, thereby leading to increased exposure in patients. Increasing the exposure in such a manner is known as boosting. This has the benefit of increasing the efficacy of the compound of the invention or reducing the dose required to achieve the same efficacy as an unboosted dose. The metabolism of the compounds of the invention includes oxidative processes carried out by P450 (CYP450) enzymes, particularly CYP 3A4 and conjugation by UDP glucuronosyl transferase and sulphating enzymes. Thus, among the agents that may be used to increase the exposure of a patient to a compound of the present invention are those that can act as inhibitors of at least one isoform of the cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes. The isoforms of CYP450 that may be beneficially inhibited include, but are not limited to, CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. Suitable agents that may be used to inhibit CYP 3A4 include ritonavir, saquinavir, ketoconazole, N-(3,4-difluorobenzyl)-N-methyl-2-{[(4-methoxypyridin-3-yl)amino]sulfonyl}benzamide and N-(1-(2-(5-(4-fluorobenzyl)-3-(pyridin-4-yl)-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)acetyl)piperidin-4-yl)methanesulfonamide.","It is within the scope of the invention that two or more pharmaceutical compositions, at least one of which contains a compound of the invention, may conveniently be combined in the form of a kit suitable for coadministration of the compositions. Thus the kit of the invention comprises two or more separate pharmaceutical compositions, at least one of which contains a compound of the invention, and means for separately retaining said compositions, such as a container, divided bottle, or divided foil packet. An example of such a kit is the familiar blister pack used for the packaging of tablets, capsules and the like. The kit of the invention is particularly suitable for administering different dosage forms, for example, oral and parenteral, for administering the separate compositions at different dosage intervals, or for titrating the separate compositions against one another. To assist compliance, the kit typically comprises directions for administration and may be provided with a so-called memory aid.","In another aspect the invention provides a pharmaceutical product (such as in the form of a kit) comprising a compound of the invention together with one or more additional therapeutically active agents as a combined preparation for simultaneous, separate or sequential use in the treatment of a disorder for which a URAT-1 inhibitor is indicated.","It is to be appreciated that all references herein to treatment include curative, palliative and prophylactic treatment.","The invention is further illustrated by the non-limiting Examples and Preparations that follow (for the avoidance of doubt, those compounds marked as Reference Examples do not fall within formula (I)).","In these non-limiting Examples and Preparations, and in the aforementioned Schemes, the following abbreviations, definitions and analytical procedures may be referred to:","AcOH is acetic acid;","nBuOH is n-butanol","Cu(acac)is copper (II) acetylacetonate;","Cu(OAc)is copper (II) acetate;","DABCO is 1,4-diazabicyclo[2,2,2]octane","DAD is diode array detector;","DCM is dichloromethane; methylene chloride;","DEA is diethylamine","DIP-Cl is chlorodiisopinocampheylborane;","DIPEA is N-ethyldiisopropylamine, N,N-diisopropylethylamine;","DMAP is 4-dimethylaminopyridine;","DMF is N,N-dimethylformamide;","DMSO is dimethyl sulphoxide;","EDCI is 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride;","EDTA is ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid;","ELSD is evaporative light scattering detection;","EtO is diethyl ether;","EtOAc is ethyl acetate;","EtOH is ethanol;","HPLC is high-performance liquid chromatography","IPA is isopropanol;","Ir(OMe)CODis bis(1,5-cyclooctadiene)di-\u03bc-methoxydiiridium (I);","KOAc is potassium acetate;","KPOis potassium phosphate tribasic;","LCMS is liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (R=retention time)","Me is methyl","MeOH is methanol;","MS is mass spectrometry","NMM is N-methylmorpholine","NMP is N-Methyl-2-pyrrolidone;","Pd\/C is palladium on carbon;","Pd(PPh)is palladium tetrakis;","Pd(dppf)Clis [1,1\u2032-bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene]dichloropalladium(II), complex with dichloromethane;","TBAF is tetra-n-butylammonium fluoride","TBME is tert-butyl methyl ether;","TFA is trifluoroacetate;","THF is tetrahydrofuran;","THP is tetrahydropyran;","TLC is thin layer chromatography;","UV is ultraviolet; and","WSCDI is 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0135","num":"0249"},"sup":["1","19","1","19"],"sub":["3","6","3"]},"Mass spectra, MS (m\/z), were recorded using either electrospray ionisation (ESI) or atmospheric pressure chemical ionisation (APCI).
