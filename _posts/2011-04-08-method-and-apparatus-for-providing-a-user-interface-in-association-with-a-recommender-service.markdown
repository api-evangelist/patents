{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNOLOGICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","BRIEF SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["An example embodiment of the present invention relates generally to techniques for recommending content and, more particularly, relates to an apparatus, a method and a computer program product for providing a user interface in association with a service engaged in recommending content.","In order to provide easier or faster information transfer and convenience, telecommunication industry service providers are continually developing improvements to existing communication networks. As a result, wireless communication has become increasingly more reliable in recent years. Along with the expansion and improvement of wireless communication networks, mobile terminals used for wireless communication have also been continually improving. In this regard, due at least in part to reductions in size and cost, along with improvements in battery life and computing capacity, mobile terminals have become more capable, easier to use, and cheaper to obtain. Due to the now ubiquitous nature of mobile terminals, people of all ages and education levels may utilize mobile terminals to communicate with other individuals or contacts, receive services and\/or share information, media and other content.","Some of the technologies which are becoming more popular are those of location based services and other personalized services. In this regard, some technologies may provide users of properly equipped mobile terminals with content that is specific to the present location of the user. Thus, for example, the user may be provided with weather information relating to the user's present location. Thereby, content may be provided to the user which may be relevant to the user's interests and current context. However, it may still be possible to improve the provision of content to users.","A method, apparatus and computer program product are therefore provided that may provide a user interface for use in connection with a service that recommends content to users based on, for example, the user's context.","In an example embodiment, an apparatus for providing a user interface in connection with a content recommendation service may include at least one processor and at least one memory including computer program code, the at least one memory and the computer program code configured to, with the processor, cause the apparatus to perform at least causing communication of a request for content where the request includes context information and preference information associated with a user of a device causing communication of the request, receiving a response to the request in response to the request being serviceable where the response includes a series of recommendations serialized in protocol-specific data structure, and causing rendering of content associated with the recommendations as graphical tiles according to the protocol-specific data structure such that a plurality of recommendations associated with a same primary context are associated with each other in a common channel. The protocol-specific data structure may provide at least data indicative of a primary context or a combination of one or more primary contexts associated with selected ones of the recommendations, data indicative of a secondary context or a combination of one or more secondary contexts, meta-content information related to data that has been recommended, and meta content related to functional activities related to content that is connectable to specific functions of the device.","In another example embodiment, a method for providing a user interface in connection with a content recommendation service may include causing communication of a request for content where the request includes context information and preference information associated with a user of a device causing communication of the request, receiving a response to the request in response to the request being serviceable where the response includes a series of recommendations serialized in protocol-specific data structure, and causing rendering of content associated with the recommendations as graphical tiles according to the protocol-specific data structure such that a plurality of recommendations associated with a same primary context are associated with each other in a common channel. The protocol-specific data structure may provide at least data indicative of a primary context or a combination of one or more primary contexts associated with selected ones of the recommendations, data indicative of a secondary context or a combination of one or more secondary contexts, meta-content information related to data that has been recommended, and meta content related to functional activities related to content that is connectable to specific functions of the device.","In a further example embodiment, a computer program product for providing a user interface in connection with a content recommendation service may include at least one computer-readable storage medium having computer-executable program code portions stored therein, the computer-executable program code portions comprising program code instructions for causing communication of a request for content where the request includes context information and preference information associated with a user of a device causing communication of the request, receiving a response to the request in response to the request being serviceable where the response includes a series of recommendations serialized in protocol-specific data structure, and causing rendering of content associated with the recommendations as graphical tiles according to the protocol-specific data structure such that a plurality of recommendations associated with a same primary context are associated with each other in a common channel. The protocol-specific data structure may provide at least data indicative of a primary context or a combination of one or more primary contexts associated with selected ones of the recommendations, data indicative of a secondary context or a combination of one or more secondary contexts, meta-content information related to data that has been recommended, and meta content related to functional activities related to content that is connectable to specific functions of the device.","In a further example embodiment, an apparatus for providing a user interface in connection with a content recommendation service may include means for causing communication of a request for content where the request includes context information and preference information associated with a user of a device causing communication of the request, means for receiving a response to the request in response to the request being serviceable where the response includes a series of recommendations serialized in protocol-specific data structure, and means for causing rendering of content associated with the recommendations as graphical tiles according to the protocol-specific data structure such that a plurality of recommendations associated with a same primary context are associated with each other in a common channel. The protocol-specific data structure may provide at least data indicative of a primary context or a combination of one or more primary contexts associated with selected ones of the recommendations, data indicative of a secondary context or a combination of one or more secondary contexts, meta-content information related to data that has been recommended, and meta content related to functional activities related to content that is connectable to specific functions of the device.","Some embodiments of the present invention will now be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which some, but not all embodiments of the invention are shown. Indeed, various embodiments of the invention may be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein. Like reference numerals refer to like elements throughout. As used herein, the terms \u201cdata,\u201d \u201ccontent,\u201d \u201cinformation\u201d and similar terms may be used interchangeably to refer to data capable of being transmitted, received and\/or stored in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. Moreover, the term \u201cexemplary\u201d, as may be used herein, is not provided to convey any qualitative assessment, but instead merely to convey an illustration of an example. Thus, use of any such terms should not be taken to limit the spirit and scope of embodiments of the present invention.","As used herein, the term \u2018circuitry\u2019 refers to (a) hardware-only circuit implementations (for example, implementations in analog circuitry and\/or digital circuitry); (b) combinations of circuits and computer program product(s) comprising software and\/or firmware instructions stored on one or more computer readable memories that work together to cause an apparatus to perform one or more functions described herein; and (c) circuits, such as, for example, a microprocessor(s) or a portion of a microprocessor(s), that require software or firmware for operation even if the software or firmware is not physically present. This definition of \u2018circuitry\u2019 applies to all uses of this term herein, including in any claims. As a further example, as used herein, the term \u2018circuitry\u2019 also includes an implementation comprising one or more processors and\/or portion(s) thereof and accompanying software and\/or firmware. As another example, the term \u2018circuitry\u2019 as used herein also includes, for example, a baseband integrated circuit or applications processor integrated circuit for a mobile phone or a similar integrated circuit in a server, a cellular network device, other network device, and\/or other computing device.","As defined herein a computer-readable storage medium, which refers to a non-transitory, physical storage medium (e.g., volatile or non-volatile memory device), can be differentiated from a computer-readable transmission medium, which refers to an electromagnetic signal.","As indicated above, some embodiments of the present invention may be employed in methods, apparatuses and computer program products configured to recommend content to users based on context information. A service associated with recommending content may, for example, recommend URLs (uniform resource locators) directly to a display or home screen of a user device. The recommendations may be based on determinations regarding context for the device and\/or the user. In some cases, the recommendations may further consider user preferences that have been previously provided by the user or that have been determined based on user behavior. In some examples, a server device may process requests that arrive from a client device so that the server device is enabled to send a response to the request, where the response includes the recommended content, for example recommended URLs. The user may then click on one or more of those URLs to open them using, for example, a browser.","In the future, large amounts of context data and preference data may be used when recommending content to users. Users will want to feel both informed and safe when employing such recommendation services, and thus the users should not receive content that creates confusion. To avoid confusing users in relation to the provision of recommended content, some example embodiments enable recommended content to be provided with description information to describe the situations under which a recommendation is made (context), why that recommendation was made (indicating user preference) and the recommended content is provided using an appropriate user interface (UI). Accordingly, some example embodiments may expand the capabilities of a recommendation service with respect to the provision of a user interface that includes intuitive cues to the user (e.g., both in terms of context and semantic meta-content of the content itself) via application programming interface (API) extensions. As such, a new paradigm is provided that may be suitable for multiple types of content associated with external services or local frameworks. In this regard, for example,  illustrates a block diagram of a system that may benefit from embodiments of the present invention. It should be understood, however, that the system as illustrated and hereinafter described is merely illustrative of one system that may benefit from an example embodiment of the present invention and, therefore, should not be taken to limit the scope of embodiments of the present invention.","As shown in , a system in accordance with an example embodiment of the present invention may include a user terminal . The user terminal  may be any of multiple types of fixed or mobile communication and\/or computing devices such as, for example, personal digital assistants (PDAs), pagers, mobile televisions, mobile telephones, gaming devices, laptop computers, personal computers (PCs), cameras, camera phones, video recorders, audio\/video players, radios, global positioning system (GPS) devices, or any combination of the aforementioned, which employ an embodiment of the present invention.","In some embodiments the user terminal  may be capable of communicating with other devices, either directly, or via a network . The network  may include a collection of various different nodes, devices or functions that may be in communication with each other via corresponding wired and\/or wireless interfaces. As such, the illustration of  should be understood to be an example of a broad view of certain elements of the system and not an all inclusive or detailed view of the system or the network . Although not necessary, in some embodiments, the network  may be capable of supporting communication in accordance with any one or more of a number of first-generation (1G), second-generation (2G), 2.5G, third-generation (3G), 3.5G, 3.9G, fourth-generation (4G) mobile communication protocols, Long Term Evolution (LTE), and\/or the like. Thus, the network  may be a cellular network, a mobile network and\/or a data network, such as a local area network (LAN), a metropolitan area network (MAN), and\/or a wide area network (WAN), for example, the Internet. In turn, other devices such as processing elements (for example, personal computers, server computers or the like) may be included in or coupled to the network . By directly or indirectly connecting the user terminal  and the other devices to the network , the user terminal and\/or the other devices may be enabled to communicate with each other, for example, according to numerous communication protocols including Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and\/or the like, to thereby carry out various communication or other functions of the user terminal and the other devices, respectively. As such, the user terminal  and the other devices may be enabled to communicate with the network  and\/or each other by any of numerous different access mechanisms. For example, mobile access mechanisms such as wideband code division multiple access (W-CDMA), CDMA2000, global system for mobile communications (GSM), general packet radio service (GPRS) and\/or the like may be supported as well as wireless access mechanisms such as wireless LAN (WLAN), Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX), WiFi, ultra-wide band (UWB), Wibree techniques and\/or the like and fixed access mechanisms such as digital subscriber line (DSL), cable modems, Ethernet and\/or the like. Thus, for example, the network  may be a home network or other network providing local connectivity.","The user terminal  may be configured to request, receive, and output Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), text, pictures, data, audio, video, and\/or various other embodiments and media formats of content segments. In some embodiments the content may be recommended for, and\/or provided to, the user terminal  by one or more of a plurality of service providers  that may employ respective content provision models to select the content segments. One or more of the service providers  may be embodied as a server, server bank or other computer or other computing device or node configured to recommend and provide content segments to the user terminal . Each of the service providers  may have any number of functions or associations with various services. As such, for example, one or more of the service providers  may be a platform such as a dedicated server (or server bank), or one or more of the service providers may be a backend server associated with one or more other functions or services. Thus, the service providers  may employ respective content provision models to recommend and\/or provide content to the user terminal  for use by a user thereof. Accordingly, the service providers  may embody a content provider and\/or a content recommender in some embodiments.","In some embodiments the service providers  may be configured to recommend and\/or provide content to the user terminal  only within the bounds of respective spatial regions. For example, each of the service providers  may have a spatial region associated therewith. By way of further example, each of the service providers may have a mutually exclusive spatial region associated therewith. Thereby, each of the service providers  may be configured to recommend and\/or provide content to the user terminal  only when the user terminal is located within the respective spatial regions. In some embodiments each service provider  may have its own business model and content provision models associated therewith. For example, one service provider  may provide advertisements along with recommendations, whereas other service providers might charge for the content recommendation service while another service provider may charge data providers for recommending their content.","In some embodiments the system may further comprise a manager entity . The manager entity  may be configured to coordinate the provision and\/or recommendation of the content segments by the service providers . For example, the manager entity  may register user terminals  and\/or service providers  and\/or provide for transfer between the various content provision models of the service providers  based on a change in the recipient region (e.g. the spatial region in which the user terminal is positioned). The manager entity  may be embodied as a server, server bank or other computer or other computing device or node configured to coordinate the provision and\/or recommendation of the content segments by the various service providers , as discussed above. The manager entity  may have any number of functions or associations with various services. As such, for example, the manager entity  may be a platform such as a dedicated server (or server bank), or one or more of the service providers may be a backend server associated with one or more other functions or services.","In example embodiments illustrated in , an apparatus  is provided that may be employed by devices performing example embodiments of the present invention. The apparatus  may be embodied, for example, as any device hosting, including, controlling, comprising, or otherwise forming a portion of the user terminal , the service providers , and\/or the manager entity . However, embodiments may also be embodied on a plurality of other devices such as for example where instances of the apparatus  may be embodied on the network . As such, embodiments of the apparatus  illustrated in  are merely examples and may include more, or in some cases, less than the components shown in .","With further regard to , the apparatus  may be configured to provide for recommendation of content based on content provision models associated with spatial regions by itself forming the recommendation or, conversely, receiving the embodiment depending on whether the apparatus is embodied as the manager entity  or the user terminal , for example. As depicted in , the apparatus  may include or otherwise be in communication with a processor , a user interface , a communication interface  and a memory device . The memory device  may include, for example, one or more volatile and\/or non-volatile memories. In other words, for example, the memory device  may be an electronic storage device (e.g., a computer readable storage medium) comprising gates configured to store data (e.g., bits) that may be retrievable by a machine (e.g., a computing device like the processor ). The memory device  may be configured to store information, data, applications, instructions or the like for enabling the apparatus to carry out various functions in accordance with example embodiments of the present invention. For example, the memory device  could be configured to buffer input data for processing by the processor . Additionally or alternatively, the memory device  could be configured to store instructions for execution by the processor .","The apparatus  may, in some embodiments, be a network device (e.g., service provider  or manager entity ) or other devices (e.g., the user terminal ) that may operate independent of or in connection with a network. However, in some embodiments, the apparatus  may be instantiated at one or more of the service provider , manager entity , or the user terminal . Thus, the apparatus  may be any computing device configured to employ an example embodiment of the present invention. However, in some embodiments, the apparatus  may be embodied as a chip or chip set (which may in turn be employed at one of the devices mentioned above). In other words, the apparatus  may comprise one or more physical packages (e.g., chips) including materials, components and\/or wires on a structural assembly (e.g., a baseboard). The structural assembly may provide physical strength, conservation of size, and\/or limitation of electrical interaction for component circuitry included thereon. The apparatus  may therefore, in some cases, be configured to implement an embodiment of the present invention on a single chip or as a single \u201csystem on a chip.\u201d As such, in some cases, a chip or chipset may constitute means for performing one or more operations for providing the functionalities described herein.","The processor  may be embodied in a number of different ways. For example, the processor  may be embodied as one or more of various hardware processing means such as a coprocessor, a microprocessor, a controller, a digital signal processor (DSP), a processing element with or without an accompanying DSP, or various other processing circuitry including integrated circuits such as, for example, an ASIC (application specific integrated circuit), an FPGA (field programmable gate array), a microcontroller unit (MCU), a hardware accelerator, a special-purpose computer chip, or the like. As such, in some embodiments, the processor  may include one or more processing cores configured to perform independently. A multi-core processor may enable multiprocessing within a single physical package. Additionally or alternatively, the processor  may include one or more processors configured in tandem via the bus to enable independent execution of instructions, pipelining and\/or multithreading.","In an example embodiment, the processor  may be configured to execute instructions stored in the memory device  or otherwise accessible to the processor . Alternatively or additionally, the processor  may be configured to execute hard coded functionality. As such, whether configured by hardware or software methods, or by a combination thereof, the processor  may represent an entity (e.g., physically embodied in circuitry) capable of performing operations according to an embodiment of the present invention while configured accordingly. Thus, for example, when the processor  is embodied as an ASIC, FPGA or the like, the processor  may be specifically configured hardware for conducting the operations described herein. Alternatively, as another example, when the processor  is embodied as an executor of software instructions, the instructions may specifically configure the processor  to perform the algorithms and\/or operations described herein when the instructions are executed. However, in some cases, the processor  may be a processor of a specific device (e.g., a mobile terminal or network device) adapted for employing an embodiment of the present invention by further configuration of the processor  by instructions for performing the algorithms and\/or operations described herein. The processor  may include, among other things, a clock, an arithmetic logic unit (ALU) and logic gates configured to support operation of the processor .","Meanwhile, the communication interface  may be any means such as a device or circuitry embodied in either hardware or a combination of hardware and software that is configured to receive and\/or transmit data from\/to a network and\/or any other device or module in communication with the apparatus . In this regard, the communication interface  may include, for example, an antenna (or multiple antennas) and supporting hardware and\/or software for enabling communications with a wireless communication network. In some environments, the communication interface  may alternatively or also support wired communication. As such, for example, the communication interface  may include a communication modem and\/or other hardware\/software for supporting communication via cable, digital subscriber line (DSL), universal serial bus (USB), Ethernet, High-Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI) or other mechanisms. Furthermore, the communication interface  may include hardware and\/or software for supporting communication mechanisms such as BLUETOOTH\u00ae, Infrared, UWB, WiFi, and\/or the like, which are being increasingly employed in connection with providing home connectivity solutions.","The user interface  may be in communication with the processor  to receive an indication of a user input at the user interface  and\/or to provide an audible, visual, mechanical or other output to the user. As such, the user interface  may include, for example, a keyboard, a mouse, a joystick, a display, a touch screen(s), touch areas, soft keys, a microphone, a speaker, or other input\/output mechanisms. In an example embodiment in which the apparatus  is embodied as a server or some other network devices, the user interface  may be limited, or eliminated. However, in an embodiment in which the apparatus  is embodied as a communication device (e.g., the user terminal ), the user interface  may include, among other devices or elements, any or all of a speaker, a microphone, a display, and a keyboard or the like. In this regard, for example, the processor  may comprise user interface circuitry configured to control at least some functions of one or more elements of the user interface, such as, for example, a speaker, ringer, microphone, display, and\/or the like. The processor  and\/or user interface circuitry comprising the processor  may be configured to control one or more functions of one or more elements of the user interface through computer program instructions (e.g., software and\/or firmware) stored on a memory accessible to the processor  (e.g., memory device , and\/or the like).","In an example embodiment, the processor  may be embodied as, include or otherwise control a UI manager . As such, in some embodiments, the processor  may be said to cause, direct or control the execution or occurrence of the various functions attributed to the UI manager  as described herein. The UI manager  may be any means such as a device or circuitry operating in accordance with software or otherwise embodied in hardware or a combination of hardware and software (e.g., processor  operating under software control, the processor  embodied as an ASIC or FPGA specifically configured to perform the operations described herein, or a combination thereof) thereby configuring the device or circuitry to perform the corresponding functions of the UI manager  as described herein. Thus, in examples in which software is employed, a device or circuitry (e.g., the processor  in one example) executing the software forms the structure associated with such means.","The UI manager  may be configured to provide a service API extension in order to modify the UI to be presented to the user of a client device, based on the context information and\/or preference information that is associated with a specific request (or response). As such, it can be assumed that the UI manager  is used in connection with a service (e.g., provided by the service providers ) for providing recommended content. Then, when the recommended content is received, the UI manager  may extract information (e.g., context and\/or preference information) in order to generate an appropriate user interface as described herein. As such, for example, the UI manager  may be configured to cause communication of a request for content where the request includes context information and preference information associated with a user of a device causing communication of the request. The UI manager  may also be configured to receive a response to the request in response to the request being serviceable. The response may include a series of recommendations serialized in an XML data structure. The XML data structure may provide at least data indicative of a primary context or a combination of one or more primary contexts associated with selected ones of the recommendations, data indicative of a secondary context or a combination of one or more secondary contexts, meta-content information related to data that has been recommended, and\/or meta content related to functional activities related to content that is connectable to specific functions of the device. The UI manager  may be further configured to cause rendering of content associated with the recommendations as graphical tiles according to the protocol-specific data structure such that a plurality of recommendations associated with a same primary context are associated with each other in a common channel.","In an example embodiment, while the UI manager  may have a function associated with user interface generation, the UI manager  may also be configured to provide additional services (or interact with other modules or entities that provide such services in order to provide functionalities according to an example embodiment). As such, for example, the UI manager  may configured to provide services (or interact with another module providing services) relating to handling settings (e.g., manual and automatic settings) related to client device operation (e.g., for UI rendering). The UI manager  may also be configured to handle context sourcing and interaction as well as message parsing. The UI manager  may also be configured to handle interaction monitoring and responses along with directing rendering of content (e.g., via the user interface ) and logging of events. As such, in some cases, the UI manager  may act as, control or interact with a rendering engine and\/or a log engine. The UI manager  may also be configured to handle profile monitoring and management as well as implicit and explicit user login management. In some cases, the UI manager  may further include or interact with a device profile manager and handle recommendation caching and memory management.","In relation to the function of the UI manager  for providing a service API extension to modify the UI to be presented to a user of a client device, based on the context information and\/or preference information that is associated with a specific request (or response), each HTTP GET request that is received from a client device to request content may include embedded context information and preference information. In an example embodiment, the service providers  and\/or the manager entity  may process the request. A 200 OK response may also be provided if the request can be serviced.

In an example embodiment, generally speaking, the UI manager  (e.g., via the API extension provided thereby) may be configured to provide data on primary context or a combination of one or more primary contexts under which a recommendation is made. Data may also be provided as to a secondary context or a combination of secondary contexts (e.g., having less significance with respect to determining an outcome of a recommendation than a primary context). Meta-content information related to data that has been recommended may also contain meta-content related to functional activities related to recommended content that can be connected to specific functions (e.g., a phone number to a restaurant, email address) on a device. Functionalities may therefore be provided through the user interface by activating functional calls to specific platform APIs referred within the meta-content segments.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["100","110","100","110","100"]},"In another embodiment, there may be a static list of channels that may be shown by a client device and the channels may be vertically scrolled. Meanwhile, as shown in , items  within the channel may be horizontally scrolled. In embodiments where there are less number of content channels that are recommended than can be accommodated on the screen, space may be evenly shared by those recommendations that are provided. Furthermore, in some cases, historical recommendations may be shown as lower priority items in free space. In some embodiments, a size of the channel  may be increased by dragging the channel  down or expanding boundaries defining the channel . In an example embodiment, dragging the channel  to consume at least a specified portion of the display size (e.g., a quarter or half of a display screen) may cause a snap fit operation so that the channel  snaps to fit a corresponding portion of the display (e.g., snap to fit a quarter or half of the display). In some cases, the portion to which the channel  snaps to fit, may be a function of the number of channels displayed.","In an example embodiment, the user may be enabled to remove a channel by a press and hold operation. In some cases, however, the press and hold operation may cause display of a menu option and one of the selectable options in the menu may include discarding of the channel. Other menu options may also be provided, such as an option for saving the contents of a channel. A user can browse the content of a channel (e.g., channel ) by clicking on an individual recommendation within the channel or by moving right to left or left to right. When content is selected (e.g., by clicking on the content), a detailed view of the content may be opened.","In some embodiments, the user may be enabled to provide settings (e.g., via the UI manager ) to identify a maximum host for each channel, a maximum number of channels to display, and\/or other details regarding how the channels are to be displayed. In some cases, the user may be enabled to prioritize a particular context type as a priority context type. By specifying a priority context type, higher priority context types may be presented in a more prominent fashion (e.g., high priority items displayed on top, with other items displayed in descending order of priority as defined by the user). In some embodiments, the user may also define certain channels via a settings menu where a combination of context types and values can be defined. As such, standard recommendations (e.g., from the service providers ) may be bypassed so that the client device (e.g., user terminal ) may send this when those context values match the server (to be expanded and more clearly defined).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["200","35","210","210","210","200"]},"In some cases, content may be provided such that the content is provided in rows as shown in . In , a single content row is displayed within a display view. The content includes a plurality of recommendations  where each recommendation includes a corresponding indication of the primary context and multiple secondary contexts associated with the recommendation. In the example of , a primary context indicator  is provided on the left side of the recommendation . However, the primary context indicator  could be provided at some other position in the recommendation as well. Similarly, the positions at which secondary context indicators  (or meta-content indicators) are provided may also be varied in different examples. In , the secondary context indicators  are positioned at the bottom of the recommendation , while the secondary context indicators  are positioned at the top in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 8"],"b":["1","2","3","4","400","402","404","404","400","406","408","410"]},"By performing a drag operation (e.g., drag left) another recommendation may be drawn from a track buffer (e.g., recommendation buffer) to push a currently displayed item or track to the discard stack and scroll the track left as shown at operation . In some cases, discarding a track may not result in permanent deletion, but just placement of the track in a discard stack (at least for a predetermined period of time). By performing a different drag operation (e.g., drag right) a recommendation may be withdrawn from the discard stack and returned to a track buffer while the track is scrolled to the right at shown at operation .","In an example embodiment, if a channel is refreshed or a different channel is selected, a list of recommendations for each track may be provided. The list may be generated based on the track context, selected channel, user context, user profile and learned data that may be mapped against a recommendation database as indicated at operation . Cached feedback may also be provided, with context, to the server as indicated at operation . In this regard, for discards, an association of the recommendation to a corresponding profile may be weakened along with any related recommendations and the relationship between the recommendation and the corresponding channel. For opened items, an association of the recommendation to a corresponding profile may be strengthened along with any related recommendations and the relationship between the recommendation and the corresponding channel.","Example embodiments may therefore enable multiple content types to be provided on one UI screen while also providing an intuitive interaction with the UI screen via such operations as dragging and\/or scrolling. Horizontal and vertical scrolling may be adapted to a matrix-like UI in a multi-content framework to provide a highly configurable interface employing both manual and automatic configuration options. Example embodiments may also provide a relatively limitless ability to host content with no ambiguity on content segregation. Clear information may therefore be provided to the user including usage of primary context information and semantic meta-content. Some example embodiments may be used with an evolved and\/or powerful server that may be configured as a recommendation platform and may be flexible to the point that they may be extended to use with a three dimensional (3D) user interface.

In an example embodiment, causing rendering of the content may include causing presentation of secondary context categories in connection with each of the graphical tiles. In some embodiments, causing rendering of the content comprises enabling employment of a scrolling function to move between graphical tiles having corresponding different secondary contexts. In an example embodiment, causing rendering of the content may include causing rendering of the common channel such that horizontal scrolling alters the graphical tiles associated with the same primary context and vertical scrolling alters the primary context.","In an example embodiment, an apparatus for performing the method of  above may comprise a processor (e.g., the processor ) configured to perform some or each of the operations (-) described above.
