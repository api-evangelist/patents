{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS"],"p":["1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates in general to computers, and more particularly to apparatus, method and computer program product embodiments for fibre channel analysis, configuration, and troubleshooting in a computing environment using an inexpensive, portable device.","2. Description of the Related Art","Network adapter devices are hardware units that connect computer devices to a communication network. Adapters may be found in virtually every computing environment having network connectivity. Most adapters are not labeled with their attributes, such as link speed and network topology capabilities. Instead, adapters generally are given a model number and a serial number that must be looked up in the manufacturer's database to obtain their speed and topology capability.","Cross referencing manufacturer information with network attributes has limited effectiveness, in that the model number and\/or serial number must be physically associated with the adapter, and the adapter must be accessible. An additional known solution has been to attach an analyzer and obtain a trace. However, conventional analyzers are expensive and are not portable. In addition, only users with a high degree of knowledge may evaluate the results of such a trace. An additional conventional solution has been to examine the configuration console provided by the manufacturer. This solution is only possible, however, if a communication link can be established.","When an adapter is installed in a system, in many cases the system must be powered down for a user to gain access to the adapter to obtain information or to perform varying configuration functionality. Such a scenario may be disruptive and time consuming to the user. For example, if a node port (FX, NX, U\/G) is set to auto topology negotiation and auto speed negotiation, as is usually the default setting, then the topology and speed negotiation will occur initially at the same time. It is difficult to determine which of these negotiations is at fault when a link fails to initialize. End users frequently use a trial and error method of changing settings until they get the link established. This methodology may result in the link operating at a less than optimal position.","In light of the foregoing, a need exists for a simple, inexpensive device that can be used to obtain the capabilities of fibre channel devices such as adapters and display the results in some manner to a user. In addition, it is useful for such a device to include additional troubleshooting functionality to assist in negotiation scenarios as described above.","Accordingly, apparatus, method, and computer program product embodiments for analyzing and configuring a fibre channel link and topology using a portable device are provided. A network microchip is programmed to select at least one of an available plurality of operating modes based on a first user input. The plurality of operating modes include a manual speed selection mode for manually selecting a link speed based on a second user input, an auto speed selection mode for automatically negotiating a highest supported link speed, an auto topology negotiation mode for discovering and reporting all possible port configurations, and a manual topology selection mode for selecting a fibre channel topology based on a third user input.","In another embodiment, by way of example only, a method for analyzing and configuring a fibre channel link and topology in a computing environment using a portable device is provided. At least one of an available plurality of operating modes is selected based on a first user input. The at least one operating mode is executed. Executing the at least one operating mode includes at least one of manually selecting a link speed based on a second user input, automatically negotiating a highest supported link speed, discovering and reporting all possible port configurations, and manually selecting a fibre channel topology based on a third user input.","In still another embodiment, again by way of example only, a computer program product for analyzing and configuring a fibre channel link and topology in a computing environment using a portable device is provided, the computer program product comprising a computer-readable storage medium having computer-readable program code portions stored therein. The computer-readable program code portions comprise a first executable portion for selecting at least one of an available plurality of operating modes based on a first user input, and a second executable portion for executing the at least one operating mode. Executing the at least one operating mode includes at least one of manually selecting a link speed based on a second user input, automatically negotiating a highest supported link speed, discovering and reporting all possible port configurations, and manually selecting a fibre channel topology based on a third user input.","The following description and claimed subject matter feature exemplary embodiments of mechanisms to provide fibre channel link\/topology analysis and configuration using a low-cost, portable device. The device may be adapted to allow a user the ability to select differing link speeds, differing network topologies. The device may be further adapted to troubleshoot network configurations. The device may be further adapted to display negotiated speeds, configurations, or errors to a user. Finally, the device (or components of the device) may be compatible with a Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) communication protocol.","The mechanisms described and claimed may assist the user in a variety of ways. They may allow the user to determine if a network device, such as an adapter, is performing correctly. They may facilitate the discovery of capabilities of an unknown network device. They may isolate a problem from a general network issue to a more specific speed negotiation problem or a topology negotiations problem. The mechanisms provide simplicity, portability, low-cost, ease of use, the ability to separate speed negotiations (and accompanying problems) from topology negotiations (and accompanying problems), and the ability to quickly and easily determine the capabilities of a network device.","The portable device as will be described, following may include a programmable network microchip, such as a fibre channel chip. In one embodiment, the network microchip may be programmed using an associated Application Programming Interface (API) to the microchip. The network microchip may be adapted to allow a user to select at least one of an available number of operating modes.","The operating modes may include the following: (1) a manual speed select mode, (2) an auto speed selection mode, (3) an auto topology negotiation mode, and (4) a manual topology selection mode. The manual speed select mode may allow the selection of different link speeds, such as a 1, 2, 4, or 8 gigabits per second (gb\/sec), or any future speed that may be defined in the case of fibre channel network topologies.","The auto speed selection mode may utilize a speed list built using speeds supported by the network microchip. In this mode, the chip may be adapted to expect to negotiate to the maximum speed the microchip supports. If the device fails to negotiate the maximum speed, then a failure may be reported to the user, as well as a reporting of any other speeds that were successfully negotiated.","The auto topology negotiation mode allows for the portable device to discover and report all possible port configurations. For example, in fibre channel network topologies, a port configured as a generic (Gx) port is capable of becoming a F, E, or B port. In an exemplary auto topology negotiation operation in a fibre channel fabric, the device would report to the user that the connected port is a Gx port and is not loop capable.","In an exemplary manual topology selection in a fibre channel fabric, the user may configure the fibre port to be an FL port. If the device fails to configure to the port type specified, then again, a failure may be reported to the user. If a successful port configuration is made, the successful configuration may also be reported.","The network microchip may be adapted for a user to have the ability to select differing combination of speed and topology. The speed and topology analysis\/configuration may be selected to occur simultaneously and concurrently or consecutively. For example, a user may select automatic speed negotiation mode, and then select manual topology negotiation mode. In another example, a user could select a manual speed negotiation mode with automatic topology negotiation (automatic topology negotiation mode).","Referring now to , an exemplary portable device  for analyzing and configuring a fibre channel link and topology is illustrated in two views. Device  is a housing including a variety of additional components. The housing may be composed of a lightweight material to add to portability. Device  incorporates a microprocessor , a network microchip  (while shown here as fibre channel, a variety of other communications protocols chips may be used for a particular implementation), a communications channel  therebetween, and a memory . Microprocessor may function to execute computer instructions relating to the network analysis and configuration functionality further described. Similarly, memory  may function to store the computer instructions, network and\/or device information, and similar data. A male plug  and female plug  are incorporated into the device  housing in communication with the channel  to provide input\/output (I\/O).","Referring specifically to , a variety of human interface mechanisms may be integrated into the device  housing, such as an on button , an off button , a reset button , and a test button . One skilled in the art will appreciate that the human interface mechanisms may be implemented in a variety of means, including switches, buttons, touchscreens, and the like. An status indicator  is adapted to display a status of the device , for example, a status of the execution of a selected operation mode. The indicator  shown is a light emitting diode (LED), yet again other indicator means may be employed.","Additional human interface mechanisms are shown below, such as graphical user interface (GUI) . GUI  includes a variety of selectable display data, such as an auto negotiate speed\/topology selection , and a manual mode functions display selection . In the depicted example, a user may manually select one of an enumerated list of speeds  and fibre channel topologies , such as an 8 gb\/sec speed and a Point-to-Point protocol (PPP).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIGS. 2-7C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 3","FIG. 4"],"b":["300","300","302","304"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 5","FIG. 6","FIG. 7"],"b":["400","400","402","400","404"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIG. 7","FIG. 7","FIG. 6"],"b":["500","500","502","504","508","510","512"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["600","600","602","604","606","600","600","616"]},"If the LIP is received, the method  completes loop initialization (step ).
