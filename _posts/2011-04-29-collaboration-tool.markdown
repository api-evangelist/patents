{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application claims the benefit under 35 USC \u00a7119(e) of U.S. provisional patent application Ser. No. 61\/329,890 filed Apr. 30, 2010. The contents of the above-mentioned patent application are incorporated herein by reference.","The invention generally relates to a network based collaboration tool used to enable communication and collaboration between people working on industrial, commercial or residential construction projects.","Residential, commercial and industrial construction and building projects can involve many different people and organizations, such as architects, contractors, electricians, accountancy firms, plumbers, painters, and material supply firms, among others. Although each person or group of people may not be known to each other beforehand, they may all collaborate at some time in order to design, construct and maintain the intended building.","Unfortunately, it is rare to achieve the level of collaboration needed in order to facilitate the design, construction and maintenance operations. This can lead to time delays and\/or cost overruns, which are fairly commonplace in the construction industry. Substandard workmanship and\/or materials may sometimes be used to make up for these delays and overruns, which may not be discovered until years afterwards and require expensive and\/or lengthy corrective action.","While other industries have improved collaboration between people and organizations through use of electronic communications and computer software, these gains have not yet been fully realized by the construction industry. Therefore, there is a need in the construction industry for an improved collaboration tool.","As embodied and broadly described herein, the present invention provides a method for enabling collaboration between individuals to design, construct and maintain a building. The method comprises providing a network based computer system including at least one server and multiple clients. The multiple clients allow respective individuals to interact with the server. The server includes a machine-readable storage, which is encoded with software for execution by a CPU for allowing individuals at the respective clients to create, execute and manage projects associated with at least one of a design phase, construction phase and maintenance phase of the building. Each project comprises one or more events that are related to time. The method also comprises storing in the machine-readable storage events as they occur during execution of each project to create a building project database spanning at least the design phase and the construction phase and optionally the maintenance phase of the building.","In the drawings, embodiments of the invention are illustrated by way of example. It is to be expressly understood that the description and drawings are only for purposes of illustration and as an aid to understanding, and are not intended to be a definition of the limits of the invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","12","14","12"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIG. 2A","FIG. 2A"],"b":["10","10","16","18","100","16","18","16","16","10"]},"Each of the clients  may be in the form of a computing device , of which an example is provided in . The computing device  may be equipped with a processor , a memory  and an input\/output (I\/O) interface . The aforementioned components of each computing device  may be connected via an interconnection system such as copper or optical connection.","The processor  within each of the computing devices  allow it to execute program code that may be available from the memory , which is in the form of machine-readable storage. Executing the program code provides certain software services, some of which will be described in more detail below. The memory  stores the program code, input and\/or output to\/from the processor , as well as the I\/O interface .","The I\/O interface  provides each of the clients  with the ability to communicate with the network , among others. Where one or more of the clients  are non-mobile devices (e.g. computer workstations), their ability to communicate with the network  can be provided using a wired connection, such as through the public telephone network. Where one or more of the clients  are mobile devices, their ability to communicate with the network  can be provided using a wireless connection, such as via a WiFi, WiMAX or cellular connections. For example, a mobile laptop computer with a WiFi connection or an iPhone\u2122 or iPad\u2122 with a cellular connection to the network  may be instances of the clients . Other modes of connection between the clients  and the network  (e.g., satellite links) are possible and would fall within the scope of the present invention.","Because the clients  and their potential configurations are believed to be well-known in the art, further details regarding them will not be provided here.","The central node  is a computing device (or set of computing devices) that is in communication with the clients  via the network . The central node  is itself comprised of a server  and a series of databases .","Each server  in the central node  may itself be another instance of the computing device  comprised of the processor , the memory  in the form of machine-readable storage and the I\/O interface  that are interconnected via connections. Since the architecture of the computing device  for the server is otherwise substantially similar to each of the clients  (which has been described with respect to ), further details about central node  will not be provided here.","However, it is worth noting that the I\/O interface  associated with the central node  allows the server  (and therefore the central node ) to communicate with the network , and subsequently with each of the clients  that are also connected to the network . In particular, the I\/O interface  in the server  may provide it (and\/or the node ) with the ability to communicate with the network  via a wired or wireless connection similar to those described with regards to the clients .","The resulting relationship between the clients  and the one or more servers  within the node  is generally similar to that of a client-server relationship that is well-known in the art. As a result, no further details regarding the connection and\/or relationship between the clients  and the server(s)  will be provided here.","It is worth noting that the central node  may comprise one or more servers . Each server  may run program code to provide the functionality of the software, or provide certain specialized services, such as authentication services for clients . When the servers  within the node  are configured this way, it is worth noting that the general functionality of the software provided by the node  to the clients  is generally determined by the program code when it is collectively executed by each of the servers . As a result, the functionality provided by the node  is not limited to (or by) the number of servers  comprised within it.","In the case where the central node  contains more than one server , each of the servers  may be located at the same geographic location or distributed geographically. Therefore, although  shows the central node  as a single entity, it is possible that the structure of the node is more distributed, such that the servers  within this central node  may in fact closely resemble that of the clients . In such a case, the servers  comprising the central node  may be interconnected via a public network (such as the network ) or a private network (not shown) such as a dedicated local- or wide-area network.","The central node  also comprises at least one database . Although only one database  is shown in , it is likely that the central node  comprises multiple databases . The databases  are provided for data storage and are in communication with the servers  within the node . The contents of and functionality provided by the databases  will be described in more detail later.","The databases  may be stored on machine-readable storage that is accessible to the processor and\/or memory within the servers . In certain cases, the databases  may be stored in the local memory of the servers , while in other cases, the databases  may be stored remotely to the servers , such as on machine-readable storage of a hard disk or similar device.","Like the servers , the set of databases  within the central node  may be co-located at the same geographic location, which may be the same location as the one or more servers . Alternatively, the databases  may be located at different geographic locations. Therefore, although  shows the central node  as a single entity, it is possible that the structure of databases  within this entity may in fact closely resemble that of the clients . In such a case, the databases  comprised in the central node  may be interconnected via a public network (such as the network ) or a private network (not shown), such as a dedicated local- or wide-area network.","The network  that serves to interconnect the clients  and the central node  in a client-server relationship may be any suitable network including, but not limited to a global public network, such as the Internet, a private network and a wireless network. In certain circumstances the network  may comprise certain elements of all three aforementioned networks, but the network  may be thought of as the Internet or any other equivalent network.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["10","22","18","302","304","312","314","302","304"]},"The projects module  provides certain functionality typically related to managing individual projects, which may be related to building or construction projects, among others. The functionality provided by the projects module  may include among others:\n\n","The community management module  provides certain functionality related to the user community , and more particularly to assisting one or more individual users within this community to work on a building or construction project. More specifically, the community management module  can assist individual users to communicate with other users and obtain information relating to a construction or building project. The functionality provided by the community management module  may include among others:\n\n","It will be appreciated that the functionality listed for the projects module  and the community management module  is non-exhaustive as other possibilities exist and would fall within the scope of the present invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0066"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["302","304","302","304","302","304","304","302","302","14","304"]},"Alternatively, the projects module  may support the community management module  by allowing certain project-related information about projects that involved a particular user community member to be viewed by other members of the user community  who were not involved with such projects. For example, it may allow individuals of the community  to identify other individuals within the community  who have certain valuable expertise.","During execution, the projects module  and the community management module , communicate with and process data that is stored in the databases . In particular, the project module  communicates with the (building) projects database  that stores project-related data. Likewise, the community management module  communicates with the user profile database  that stores user profiles for the user community .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0069"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["14","314","304"]},"In particular, the user profile database  may be seen as being comprised of user profiles , wherein the database  at any point in time contains a set of user profiles to . Each profile in the set of user profiles to is typically unique and encodes information related to a corresponding user of the user community . This set of user profiles can be organized within the collaboration system  in certain ways that will be described shortly.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0071"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["340","340","510","520","530"],"sub":["1 ","N-1"]},"The contact and profile data  includes personal and biographic information related to the user that is not necessarily related to a particular project. For example, the data  may include a particular user's:\n\n","The contact and profile data  may also include a \u2018profile\u2019 section that includes, among others:\n\n","The set of links  and  provide additional information related to the contact and profile data , and namely the work experience within the user profile section. In particular, the set of links to active building projects  and the set of links to completed building projects  serve to show projects in which the user is either currently involved, or has been involved in the past, both of which are also likely listed in that user's work experience.","The term \u2018links\u2019 in the set of links to active building projects  and a set of links to completed building projects  should be interpreted in a broad functional sense, rather than a hyperlink to a particular URL. For example, a particular link to a completed building project within the set of links  may be a link to the contact details for a certain person involved with that project, rather than to information related to that project.","Because each profile of the set of user profiles to likely contains the same or similar type of information, the user profile database  can be queried to identify and\/or organize users in the user community  according to certain relationships. In the context of a building project for example, certain users in the community may be members of professional associations, such as users who are architects or civil engineers.","Optionally, the collaboration system  may not attempt to organize the user community  beyond providing certain facilities to search the community . For example, the system  may provide a search tool that allows a first user to find user profiles for other members of the community  that meet certain criteria, such as belonging to the same professional association or being located at a somewhat proximate distance to each other. Such search tools will be described in more detail below.","However, members of the user community  may organize themselves into groups, which may be named or remain unnamed. For example, all of the users who are collaboratively working on a project form a group, although this is more generally referred to as a \u201cteam\u201d or as a \u201cproject team\u201d. In such cases, the group itself typically remains unnamed but its members are known to each other through their involvement in the project.","Alternatively, members of the user community  may organize themselves into so-called \u2018named\u2019 groups that may represent formal affiliations of users within the community. The affiliations represented by named groups may represent certain personal and non-personal affiliations, including:\n\n","It will be appreciated that the above list of affiliation types that can be used to form named groups in the user community  is non-exhaustive. Other types of affiliations may exist and would fall within the scope of the present invention.","It may be appreciated that users within the community may simultaneously be affiliated with one or several named and\/or unnamed groups, such as members of multiple project teams, corporate organizations and\/or professional associations, among others.","For example and with respect to , it may be seen that an instance of the user community  (as embodied within the user profile database ) contains a plurality of user profiles , some of which are affiliated through the following named and unnamed groups:\n\n","Based on the above, it will be appreciated that the user represented by user profile is affiliated with three (3) groups in the user community : the named group A  (as an employee of his or her company), the named group C  (as a member of a professional association) and the named group D  (as a member of the project team). Similar affiliations exist for certain other users in the community , as is shown by .","In addition to professional associations and\/or business organization, profiles in the set of user profiles to may be grouped such as to be searchable by other types of relationships between members of the user community  including, among others:\n\n","In addition to the user profiles being searchable according to the above relationships, the community management module  may create (or facilitate the creation of) sub-groups or sub-communities that are based on the above relationships. For example, the user profiles of a group of users that have experience with a particular HVAC system may be automatically grouped by the module  to form a particular sub-group. The sub-group may then be provided with certain communications means (e.g., a forum) that allow members to communicate in order to share information and\/or store relevant information for future use. Advantageously, provision of such forums may allow useful, yet \u2018tacit\u2019 information that resides with a single person to be shared among the larger sub-group.","Alternatively, a group of users in the user community  could use the community management module  to form a sub-group that would be based on their own custom criteria. For example, users within the community  who are alumni of a particular school (e.g., architects who graduated from the McGill University Faculty of Architecture) could form their own sub-group in order to stay in touch, network and\/or arrange social functions, among others.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0078","num":"0113"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["304","304","610","620","630","640","650"]},"The registration\/authentication sub-module  is invoked when a member of the user community  wishes to create, manage or delete their user profile within the set of user profiles to . For example, in the case where a user wishes to create a new profile, the registration\/authentication sub-module  presents a user interface (UI) to request that the user provide some basic information about himself or herself (e.g., name, email address) as well as a password in order that the new user profile can be created.","Once a user profile exists within a set of user profiles to , the registration\/authentication sub-module  may also be invoked in cases where the user may want to change the information within his or her particular profile. For example, the sub-module  may prompt the user to enter his or her password in order to confirm any substantive changes to the user profile. The same sub-module may also be invoked when a user decides to remove their user profile from the set of profiles to , such as in the case where they retire or change industries.","The email management sub-module  is invoked when a user wishes to see email communications sent to him or her by other members of the user community  via the collaboration system . The sub-module  may provide the user with a UI (to be described below) that allows them to browse, read, reply and\/or forward individual emails, among other functionality.","The email management sub-module  may also allow the user to organize his or her email communications, such as by organizing certain emails into related folders or establishing rules that automatically categorize incoming emails. In such a case, the sub-module  may also enable communications between the user and any communities to which the user belongs, such as allowing the user to send an email to a community and\/or organizing replies from the community into a particular folder.","In certain cases, communications between members of the user community  enabled by the collaboration system  may include types of communications other than emails, such as online chats, voicemails or recordings of VoIP calls. In such cases, the email management sub-module  may also provide the user with the ability to review and\/or organize such communications in addition to email.","The community\/forum sub-module  is invoked when a user chooses to participate in a sub-group forum. The sub-module  may present a UI to the user that is likely similar to that provided by the email management module  but is tailored for forum communications. For example, the community\/forum module  may provide a separate interface so that a user can more easily search and\/or follow threaded email discussions that have occurred within a particular sub-group forum.","The community\/forum sub-module  may also be used in the case where a particular sub-group maintains a website or knowledgebase for the user community  in general. For example, a particular sub-group related to an open-source building maintenance system may operate a Wiki that lists useful commands, tips and tricks that are not provided in the system's user manual. In a case, the sub-module  may provide functionality for a member of the sub-group to update the Wiki in case of new material and\/or corrections to existing Wiki content.","The search sub-module  may be invoked when a user performs a search of the set of user profiles to in order to locate members of the user community  that meet certain criteria.","The search sub-module  provides a UI (to be described later) that allows a user of the collaboration system  to identify and further define certain attributes of the user profile upon which the set of profiles to is to be searched. For example, a user may wish to identify other members of the user community  that belong to a professional organization and have experience with a certain type of elevating device, such as an elevator, escalator or moving sidewalk.","The search sub-module  may provide certain so-called \u2018default\u2019 searches that allow a user to search based on pre-determined criteria, such as proximity to the user's recorded (or current) location. For example, the sub-module  may allow a user to locate other user community members  that are within 5, 10, 15, 25, 50, or 100 km of his or her current location.","The search sub-module  may also provide a user with the ability to create more advanced searches that search multiple, customized criteria. For example, the sub-module  may allow a particular user to identify all other users who are within 15 km of his or her location that have between 5 and 10 years of experience installing and maintaining storm water maintenance systems manufactured by a particular company who have also been involved in the design phase of a construction project.","In a non-limiting embodiment, the tagging sub-module  may be used to perform certain functions that relate to two or more entities within the projects database  and\/or the user profile database , as well as between these databases. In another non-limiting embodiment, the tagging sub-module  may also be used by a first user to \u2018tag\u2019 or assign a certain rating that indicates his or her satisfaction with the work of a second user. Both embodiments of this module will be described below.","In one non-limiting embodiment, the tagging sub-module  can be used to assign a \u2018tag\u2019 to one or more items in the projects and\/or user profile databases  and . This tag typically is used to remind a user of a relationship between a first item and a second item that is somehow related to the first item but is otherwise separate from it.","For example, assume that a building project for an office building on which the user is collaborating includes a three-dimensional (3D) mockup of the building that will be available on the building's website. It is expected that users will travel in (i.e., walk or fly through) the building represented by avatars so that they can simulate what visiting and\/or working in the building may be like.","Further assume that production of the 3D mockup may involve several different members and\/or groups within the user community , such as the architect working on the project, a group of draftsmen working under the architect who are responsible for creating the 3D mockup, an interface designer who is working to create the interface that will allow the users to manipulate their avatars, a web designer who is creating the necessary code to run the simulation, and a systems administrator who will install and maintain the servers used to run the simulation.","Each of these users may create a tag (which may be in the form of a text string or icon) that when applied to some element in the projects database  and\/or the user profiles database , relates that item to the tag. A tag can be viewed at a later time so as to allow the user to review one or more of its associated elements.","For example, the architect may create a tag titled \u201c3D-Simulation\u201d for this particular aspect of his office building project. The architect may then apply this tag to the following in the system :\n\n","It will be appreciated that the above list is non-exhaustive as other elements in the system  could be tagged by the author that would fall in the scope of the present invention.","Once an item is tagged with the 3D-Simulation tag, certain of its information (such as metadata) is updated to indicate that this particular tag has been applied to it. At a later time, the system , and more specifically the tagging sub-module  (or alternatively, the search sub-module ) may search for and display these items based on its tag.","For example, assume that a dispute arises between the architect and the web designer about the background image(s) that should appear when an avatar looks out of a window in the office building. Rather than search through the entirety of items in the projects database  and\/or user profile database , the architect can review the items that were tagged with the 3D-Simulation tag. Assuming that the architect was diligent in his tagging, viewing these tagged items may allow him to identify the particular item (such as an email exchange or an uploaded set of images) that identify the correct images that an avatar should \u2018see\u2019 when looking out of a window.","A set of tags relating to a project that is stored in and\/or used by the tagging sub-module  may exist at an individual user level, at a project level and\/or at a system level. In general, each user has the ability to create tags that are particular to his or her own projects. This allows the user to create and organize his or her own tags based on whatever organization scheme is most useful to them. For example, the architect who is working on the 3D mockup may call his tag \u201c3D-Simulation\u201d whereas the web designer working on the same project may use a \u201c100 Bank St. Building flythrough\u201d as her tag.","If the project team members wish to collaborate, however, a set of project tags may be implemented through the tagging sub-module . This set of project tags may be available to all project team members and used to tag items for others on the project team to view. For example, the project tags may include the names of all companies (i.e., named groups) as tags.","For example, assume that a particular building project involves two major contractors, namely ABC Corp. and XYZ Ltd. who each are responsible for different aspects of the construction. Further assume that each contractor is supplying 5 people to the project and that each person's profile is tagged with that contractor's tag. If the project team displays a simple list of the project team, each user from each contractor can be further tagged to identify his or her company. Therefore a person viewing the tags for each contractor will be able to identify the 5 particular users from that company.","Although the above example is simplistic, it shows the value that a common set of tags implemented for a project may have to enhance collaboration. For example, if a third contractor was brought in to work on yet another aspect of the project, he or she could quickly identify which person on the project team was from each contractor via their tags. This may allow the third contractor to identify the person on the project team who may be responsible for a certain contractor's tasks or activities that relate to or interface with his or her activities on the project.","A set of system-level tags may also be provided by the tagging sub-module in addition to those at the individual user and\/or project levels. Such system-level tags may include common terminology or acronyms that are used throughout the industry. For example, a set of system-level tags that may be used in the building construction industry may include:\n\n","Of course, it will be appreciated that the above list of prospective tags is non-exhaustive as other entries exist and would fall within the scope of the present invention.","It will be appreciated that although all users may be able to access and add content to a set of tags provided by the tagging sub-module , the management of such tag sets may differ depending on the level at which the tags are provided. More particularly, management tags other than those at the individual user level may be restricted from individual users. For example, a certain project team member may be responsible for all project tags, and only he or she can create or remove tags from this set.","System-level tags may be further restricted in that only certain members of the user community  can effect management of these tags. For example, members of the user community  may need to request additions, modifications to, or deletions from the set of system-level tags from certain other members of the community ; no modifications could be done by the user himself or herself. Furthermore, the requested additions or modifications may need to be considered, debated and approved by a group of members (e.g., a tag editorial board) before additions, modifications and\/or deletions to the system-level tags are effected. In this way, sets of tags designed for use by a plurality of users can be managed in a way that ensures that these users will be able to recall and\/or collaborate using these tags.","It may be recalled that the concept of a \u2018tag\u2019 in the tagging sub-module  was two-fold in that a tag could be used to identify content for later recall and\/or collaboration, as well as using a tag to rate the work of members in the user community . The above description of the tagging sub-module  has described a non-limiting embodiment that provided for the recall and\/or collaborative aspect of a tag. The description below presents a non-limiting embodiment of the tag that provides for a \u2018tag\u2019 to be applied in order to rate the work of a user for the user community .","In particular, the tagging sub-module  may allow the work of a first member in the user community  (and more specifically, his or her user profile stored in the community database ) to be rated by and\/or have comments from other members of the community  be seen. For example, if a particular engineer or technician is known to do very good work, this user's clients, colleagues and\/or co-workers may \u2018tag\u2019 this user's profile to indicate this to other users in the community  that have not worked with this engineer or technician.","It will be appreciated that a \u201ctag\u201d may include any indication or rating of a particular user's past or current work by other users, including:\n\n","The tagging module  provides a UI that allows one or more members of the user community  to apply such tags to the user profile of another member. These tags may allow the community  as a whole to identify particularly good members and therefore reward them for their efforts through recognition. (Alternatively, the tags may also allow the community  to identify particularly bad people who should be avoided.)","For example, assume that a freelance landscape architect named Bob Smith is a member of the user community  and performs work on a project with other users in the community. During his work on this project, Bob is seen by his fellow co-workers as both easy to work with, as well as someone who shares his knowledge freely with other architects and engineers. When Bob's work on the project is finished, his fellow co-workers use the UI provided by the tagging module  to indicate their satisfaction with his work, such as by using visual indicia (e.g., gold stars), by leaving comments (e.g., \u201cBob was outstanding in our project! We would love to work with him again . . . \u201d, and\/or by providing input to a scoring system that improves Bob's overall \u2018satisfaction score\u2019 within the community.","It will be appreciated that the formula used by the tagging sub-module  to calculate a numeric score that provide a proxy for the level of satisfaction with a user's work may be based on one or more inputs. In a simple example, the sub-module  may simply compare the number of positive satisfaction indicators (e.g., thumbs-up icons) against the number of negative dissatisfaction indicators (e.g., thumbs-down icons) to calculate a general satisfaction index.","Alternatively, the sub-module  may provide a UI that allows other members of the user community  to rate a particular user's work along several different dimensions, such as his or her punctuality, efficiency and\/or quality. Such rating may be based on a scale, such as a 5-point scale where 1 represents total dissatisfaction and 5 represents total satisfaction (or vice-versa). The values for each dimension contributed by one user may then be averaged with similar values contributed by other users to generate an average value for each dimension individually, as well as to generate a total satisfaction value for the user as a whole. Such an approach can allow the work of a certain user to be viewed by other users along a range of different dimensions, such as punctuality, efficiency, quality, general perceived value and\/or a desire to work with again.","Besides the ability to register the user community's  satisfaction (or dissatisfaction) with the work of a particular user, the tagging sub-module  may also provide so-called \u2018social networking\u2019 functionality for the collaboration system . In a non-limiting embodiment, the sub-module  may provide indications of which users in the community  have worked together in the past. Such indications can be shown as a social-network map that indicates the relationships between any two (2) users via a visual connection (e.g., a line or arc). In addition, the connection in the social-network map could indicate the frequency in which the two users have worked together, such as by showing a frequency calculation along the connection between two users. This could indicate a preference between certain users in the community  to work together on projects, which may assist in the formation of teams.","It will be appreciated that certain outputs generated by the tagging sub-module  may be used with other sub-modules, such as the search sub-module . For example, a general architect may need to find a landscape architect for her upcoming commercial office building project. Because this office building is intended to be a showcase project, she wants to select from the best landscape architects possible. To do this, the general architect uses the UI provided by the search sub-module  to identify landscape architects within the user community  that are highly rated and\/or recommended by others. In certain case, she may search according to a general satisfaction rating (e.g., show those landscape architects with a general score of at least 4 out of 5), or in cases where a user's work is rated according to several dimensions, she may search based on a particular dimension (e.g., show those landscape architects whose work quality is rated at least 4 out of 5). By using the search sub-module  in this way, the general architect can quickly create a short-list of possible landscape architects for her showcase project.","Output(s) from the tagging sub-module  may also be used by the email management sub-module  to alert other users and collaborate work in general. For example, assume that the system  is configured in such a way that the completion of a task by a first user in a project (e.g., a worker or junior employee) must be satisfactorily rated by a second user (e.g., a supervisor or senior employee) before the task may be considered complete and\/or \u2018signed-off\u2019. The tagging sub-module  may be used by the second user to rate the work of the first user and determine whether the task is indeed complete and may be therefore considered signed-off. When the tagging sub-module  indicates that the task has been signed-off by the second user, the email management sub-module  may send a certain indication (e.g., an email, an update to an RSS feed or a \u2018tweet\u2019) to other members of the project team that a particular task has been completed and that any dependent tasks may now commence. In this way, the sub-modules  and  may be used to co-ordinate work between team members.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0117","num":"0162"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["312","302","312","710","710","750"],"sub":["1 ","N"]},"The set of projects to within the building projects database  includes all projects that have been added to the collaboration system  by members of the user community . As a result, the set of projects to includes completed projects, ongoing projects that are not completed and future projects on which work has not yet begun.","In one specific example of implementation, a project may be conceptually viewed as a combination of activities (referred to here as events), as well as a general group of people and specialized sub-groups of people (teams) that carry out these events. As a result, each project in the set of projects to include a project identifier , a group of events  (also referred to as an \u2018events group\u2019) and a set of team parameters . Therefore, a project would contain a project identifier , an events group , and a set of team parameters that may be distinct from other projects in the set of projects to .","The project identifier  allows the project to be uniquely identified within the building projects database , as well as be identified by potential users who may become involved with the project. This allows the system , as well as its users, to find different projects within the building project database .","The project identifier  is typically a numeric or alphanumeric value generated by the collaboration system  (and more specifically, the projects module ) at the time when the project is created in the building projects database . For example, the module  may create a generated unique ID string or GUID (e.g., GUID125S729fD546dF4587d15) to ensure that the project identifier  for newly created project will be unique in the database .","The identifier  may also include an alphanumeric value that can be defined by the user who creates the project. For example, a user may assign a common name, such as:\n\n","In such cases, the project identifier  may be separate from the commonly-known name of the project, or the commonly-known name may be included in the identifier . In the former case, the building projects database  may provide a field or other placeholder that associates the project identifier  with its commonly-known name.","The events group  defines a set of events that are associated with each project in the set of projects to . As used here, the generic term \u201cevent\u201d refers to an occurrence related to the project that happens in time and has time values associated with it as a result. Depending on the current time, certain events in the event group , may have already occurred, other events in the group may be presently occurring, while yet other events in the same group may have yet to occur in the future.","Events in the event group , typically also have an \u2018action\u2019 component that defines a general goal or objective towards which the event is aimed. For example, a particular event may aim to enable or encourage communications between one or more persons or groups on a particular topic, either in a synchronous manner (i.e., an event relating to a meeting) or asynchronous manner (i.e., an email thread or discussion relating to a topic).","It may be noted that the action embodied by an event may be itself dependent on one or more activities related to one or more other events that have their own time periods and objectives. For example, the event described above to encourage communications between persons may depend on certain other events occurring, such as travel arrangements being made and met for a face-to-face meeting, or telephone or videoconference connections being established in the case of a teleconference or video conference.","The events group  may comprise several different types of events that can include, among others:\n\n","Although further details for these events will be provided below, it may be seen from the above that the inclusion and completion of certain events within a project are likely to cause a cascade of resulting actions. For example, the completion of a document event by one user may cause a messaging event to occur, which indicates to other users that the document related to the document event is ready for their perusal or review. Additionally, the completion of a document event may close the time window assigned for a task, milestone or To-do event related to the document event.","It will be appreciated that other project-management systems and applications may also include events similar to those described above for the event group . However, the events in these systems typically include either an action component or a time component, but not both. For example, typical project management systems may provide a documentation-related event that defines the time during which a document should be created (i.e., an event time component). However, the event does not provide for the storage, circulation and\/or archiving of the document that is the subject of the event, which is provided through the system .","Similarly, content management systems typically provide events for the storing, circulating and archiving of a document (i.e., an event action component). However, these systems do not provide a time window within which these activities may be scheduled and\/or monitored, which is provided through the system .","It may be recalled that the events group , includes an explicit message event. However, it will be appreciated that other types of events may have communications related to them. For example, a document event may have communications related to the content, format and audience for the document associated with the event.","In another non-limiting embodiment of the system , communications related to an event will be stored and associated with the event so that a user can view this information along with details for the event and its status. This allows a user to review related communications for the event in order to understand why the event is in its current state.","For example, assume that a first user creates a task event representing the development of an initial grant proposal for a social housing construction project. The first user may send a message to other project participants in order to generate discussion related to the grant proposal. The resulting discussion may yield many useful ideas relating to the grant proposal itself (e.g., what the proposal should include, how it should be formatted) and\/or offers of help for writing, editing and presenting the proposal.","Because both the task event related to the grant proposal and the communication related to this event reside within the system , the communications described above can be associated with the grant proposal task event. For example, the representation of the task event in the system  may have a \u2018communications\u2019 or \u2018discussion\u2019 control (i.e., a button, tab or icon) that appears when communication related to the event exists. When a user activates this control, a threaded view of all communication relating to the task is displayed, which can be grouped by the user according to subject, author or the time at which the communications was added to the system .","Because all of this information is associated with the event, when the time comes to write the grant proposal related to the task, the authors will have a body of information and an ad-hoc team of expertise to draw upon.","By associating communications with an event, the context of the communications becomes immediately apparent to any user who views the event. For example, by associating communications relating to the grant proposal with its associated task event, any user who views the event can infer the context surrounding the associated communication.","This approach may be compared with existing project-management and\/or content management systems which are provided here as non-limiting examples and typically do not have a means to associate event-related communications with an event. As a result, events are typically managed in a first application (e.g., a project-management application like Microsoft Project) while communications about the event is typically managed in a second, separate application (e.g., an email application like Microsoft Outlook). Because these two applications are separate, the receiver of an email message with a somewhat cryptic subject line of \u201cHow are we doing with the proposal?\u201d must attempt to deduce or infer the sender's intentions, especially in cases where some information relating to the communications is either omitted or is unclear to the receiver. (e.g., in the case of multiple proposals, what particular project that is being referred to by the sender)","According to an embodiment of the present invention, an email message with the subject line of \u201cHow are we doing with the proposal?\u201d would be associated by the system  with the grant proposal task event. In this case, the receiver need not try to infer what proposal the sender is referring to as it will be obvious from its associated task. Knowing this information may enhance the efficiency of the receiver in responding to the communicated intentions of the sender.","Certain of the events listed above may also comprise one or more so-called \u2018sub-events\u2019, which as used here, may refer to child events related to a parent event. For example, a task event that represents a broad activity may have task sub-events associated with it that describe the steps or processes involved in this activity.","For example, assume that a junior architect who is working on a project is asked by the senior architect to prepare a presentation for the client next week regarding some aspect of the project. To record her work for this activity, the junior architect may create a task event (e.g., a \u201cPrepare Client Presentation\u201d task) in the system  with a starting date (e.g., the current date) and the ending date (i.e., the date of the presentation). By creating this event, the junior architect may be able to identify the impact of this event on other tasks for the same project (or other projects) that she may also be responsible for.","Further assume that in order to prepare the presentation represented by the task event, the junior architect must perform certain related activities beforehand, including (among others):\n\n","To remind herself to perform each of these activities, the junior architect may create a set of sub-events for the presentation task event. In particular, she may create a To-do sub-event that is associated with the presentation task event that contains the above list of activities. As the junior architect completes each related activity, she may remove it from the To-Do sub-event until this list is empty, which also indicates that the presentation is ready to be presented to the client and the task may be deemed finished.","It will be appreciated that events and sub-events are typically visible to everyone working on a project, unless the event is otherwise explicitly designated as private. For example, the aforementioned To-do sub-event generated by the junior architect would be visible to other project participants, such as the senior architect, so that they could assess the status and\/or workload of the junior architect.","The visibility of each person's tasks within the system  can help break down informational \u2018silos\u2019 that otherwise obscure each user's roles, tasks and workload from others working on the same project. Removing these silos may help improve the efficiency of the overall project since certain participants (such as senior management) can identify potential bottlenecks caused by a particular person's excessive workload assignments. For example, if the senior architect saw that the aforementioned To-do event was the 101event assigned to the junior architect that needed to be completed within the next two (2) days, the senior architect may decide to assign this event to someone else.","It should be appreciated that while events created by a user in the system are typically visible to everyone, events can also be made private to only the user who created them, or to a group designated by the event's originator. Such privacy may be advantageous in that it provides the user with a certain degree of freedom and independence in handling activities that are associated with an event.","For example, the visibility of the To-do sub-event created by the junior architect in the previous example may be restricted only to her; it would not be visible to the senior architect or to other members of the project team. This allows the junior architect to return, revise, amend and reorganize the items in the To-do sub-event, as well as associate other types of sub-events (such as task sub-events) with the parent presentation task as necessary.","In this case, the senior architect and the rest of the project team only see the parent \u201cPrepare Client Presentation\u201d in the system . When the parent task is marked as complete (which can be done independently from its associated sub-events), the senior architect and\/or project team will know that the junior architect's presentation is ready.","Further information regarding events will be provided below, but it is worth noting that each type of event within the events group  may also have a status associated with it. In one non-limiting embodiment, the status of an event may simply indicate whether it is completed or not (e.g., tasks shown as either \u201cDone\u201d or \u201cNot Done\u201d). Alternatively, the status of an event may further indicate to what degree it is complete either numerically (e.g., 47%) or alphanumerically (e.g., \u201cStarted\u201d, \u201cOngoing\u201d or \u201cAlmost Finished\u201d).","In another non-limiting embodiment, the status of an event in the events group  may also indicate the reason(s) why an event is incomplete, such as its dependence on an earlier event or on a decision that has yet to be made. For example, a task representing the selection of an HVAC system for an office building may be listed as incomplete because a short-list of HVAC system candidates has not yet been compiled.","In addition to providing an indication as to the general status of an event, in another non-limiting embodiment of the collaboration system , users may be provided with the ability to receive notifications when certain activities related to an event occur.","One example of such notifications involve the ability to \u2018check-in\u2019 (or add) documents and to \u2018check-out\u2019 (or remove) documents that are associated with a documentation event in the system . The term \u201cdocument\u201d is used here in a non-limiting sense of any container that is capable of storing information. Therefore, a \u2018document\u2019 may refer to a file generated by a word-processor such as Microsoft Word (e.g., correspondence, reports or memos); emails, SMS text messages or other electronic correspondence; pictures or other images (e.g., JPEG files or TIFs generated by an incoming fax); spreadsheets (e.g., Microsoft\u2122 Excel\u2122 files); audio, video or three-dimensional (3D) files; and any other type of information container that is provided in an electronic format.","When a user views an event in the system  that has a document associated with it, he or she will be advised of the general status of this document (e.g., \u201cnot started\u201d, \u201cin progress\u201d or \u201ccomplete\u201d), as well as whether the document is checked-in or checked-out of the system. For example, a user viewing a document event associated with a status report may see a message similar to the following: \u201cCurrently checked out by Elmo David; checked out on 21 Apr. 2011 at 16:45 GMT.\u201d","Although a document may be currently checked out by another user, it can be viewed and\/or managed in particular ways. In one non-limiting embodiment, a user can view a read-only version of the document as it was last checked into the system .","For example, assume that a document event is associated with a weekly status report for the construction of an office building that identifies potential bottlenecks in the building's construction. Further assume that the latest version of the status report is being generated and is therefore currently checked out. In addition, assume that the general project manager has returned from three weeks vacation and wants to see if the bottlenecks identified in the report she last saw before leaving on vacation are still there. To do this, the project manager would access the document event for the latest status report and then view the version of the status report as it was when it was last checked-in. Although this copy of the status report is obviously incomplete, it may be enough to provide the project manager with information as to whether the bottlenecks before she left on vacation are still affecting the project.","In addition, notification for a document event can be configured such that when a particular action related to the associated document occurs, the user (or other users) would be notified. For example, a user can configure a document event such that the event is \u201creserved\u201d by a user when the associated document is next checked in. In this case, when the associated document is checked-in and becomes available again, the system  sends a notification to indicate to this user that the document has been checked in and reserved for them.","The ability to configure notification upon a particular action related to an event may assist the users of the system  because they need not manually check the status of the event to see whether or not a particular action has occurred. In the previous example where a user is notified that their \u2018reserved\u2019 document has been checked in, it will be noted that this user is relieved of: a) having to manually check on the event's status in order to check it out once it becomes available, and b) locating and\/or contacting the person who has checked-out the document so that the document can be re-checked in.","Another example of how user notification related to events may occur can be seen when a document is \u2018pushed\u2019 by one user to another. In this non-limiting embodiment, a first user designates a second user as the target for a document associated with an event, which may be currently checked-in or checked-out. If the document associated with the event is currently checked-in, the document event is assigned to the designated second user and the system  notifies this user of the new event. Otherwise, the document event is assigned to the designated second user once its associated document is checked-in and notification related to this action is provided to the second user at this point.","It will be appreciated that an event can be pushed to more than one person, either simultaneously or in a particular sequence or chain. The system  can be configured to notify users when the document moves between each person in the chain in order that its progress can be monitored.","For example, a document associated with an event can be \u2018pushed\u2019 to a group of reviewers in sequence so that a first reviewer may review the associated document, add his or her comments or edits, and then pass along the document to the second reviewer, and so on. Setting up such a sequence ensures that a) the document is reviewed by each reviewer in the group and b) the document is forwarded from one reviewer to the next without any undue effort on the part of the first reviewer.","When the document moves from one reviewer to another, the system  generates a notification to one or more reviewers along the chain. For example, when the document moves from the second to the third reviewer, the system  may notify the fourth reviewer so that this reviewer can prepare to review the document (e.g., reserve time in his or her schedule, make sure he or she is in communication with the system to receive the document, and so on). Alternatively, each time the document moves from one reviewer to another, all the reviewers in the chain of reviewers are notified, such that each reviewer is aware of the progress being made by the reviewers.","Although the prior examples regarding event notification have involved document events, it will be appreciated that such notification can be configured for any event, and is not restricted to document events.","Furthermore, initiation of a task event may be dependent on one or more other events in a project. For example, a task involving the electrical wiring of the 7floor of an office building may be dependent on the following three (3) events: a) a document event associated with a purchase order (P\/O) for the various materials, such as electrical wire, junction boxes and switches; b) a messaging event that transmits the P\/O to a electrical materials supplier; and c) one or more messaging events acknowledging receipt by the supplier of the P\/O and an indication as to when these materials will be delivered to the site, which marks the point at which the electrical writing task may begin.","The user creating the task event may configure it such that the completion of each dependency triggers a notification to one or more users who may be directly or tangentially related to the task. For example, the completion of the document event (i.e., the check-in of the purchase order) may trigger a notification to a user who handles procurement that he or she must send the completed P\/O to the material supplier. Likewise, the messaging event that sends the P\/O to the supplier may trigger a notification to one or more users in the accounting department that a new P\/O has been filed with a particular supplier and that they should be expecting an invoice for this P\/O from the supplier. The messaging events acknowledging that the P\/O has been received and the electrical supply materials are being shipped to the job site may trigger a notification to certain users who are doing the electrical wiring (e.g., electricians and their apprentices) advising them that they will need to start working on the 7floor of the building soon.","It will be appreciated that the use of notifications to indicate actions related to an event may help those involved with the event to identify potential issues or bottlenecks beforehand. For example, assume that notification has been sent to the electricians related to the wiring on the 7floor, but that the status of the task event related to the wiring of the 5floor is marked as \u201cin progress\u201d and the status of the task event for wiring the 6floor is marked as \u201clate\u201d. As a result, a user may deduce from these facts that while the task event for the 7floor can be started, it is unlikely to remain on schedule unless additional resources (i.e., electricians) are brought on-board to perform this task.","It is worth noting that particular events in the above non-limiting embodiment are related within a hierarchy, namely timelines, tasks and sub-tasks. When such promotions (or demotions) occur, certain characteristics of the event change but the specific information related to the event (such as its status) remains the same.","Examples of such event promotions and\/or demotions, include:\n\n","For example, assume that a task event titled \u201cDevelop project budget\u201d is included with a project for a shopping mall. It will be appreciated that activities related to developing a project budget (especially for a complex development project such as this) may, in fact, be quite a complex and\/or protracted procedure and involve more than one person.","Because the activity associated with this event are too broad, protracted and\/or complex, the \u201cDevelop project budget\u201d task can be promoted to a timeline event. This promotion allows a set of task events to be created that are associated with the timeline event and which may include (among others):\n\n","In addition, the user who was originally responsible for the promoted \u201cDevelop Project Budget\u201d timeline (and likely created the above associated task events) may invite a person who has certain specialized knowledge to assume the responsibility for each different sub-event.","For example, assume that a commercial development project in the above example is using a design-bid-build approach. In this case, the architect responsible for the project's design may be invited to do task 1 (i.e., determine a budget for the pre-design and design phases), the project's general contractor may be invited to do task 2 (i.e., determine a budget for the construction phase) and an accountant may be invited to do task 3 (i.e., determine an annual operating budget). By associating each task event with someone who is best suited to do the task, the possibility that actual budget for the project may more closely resemble that estimated by these individuals can be enhanced.","Each project within the set of projects to has a team associated with it. As used here, the term \u201cteam\u201d refers to a particular group of people (who are likely members of the user community ) that are involved with the particular project.","The team parameters  for a project may define one or more roles for each member of the team. A \u2018role\u2019 generally refers to the descriptor for one or more project responsibilities and describes the set of functions that the person assigned the role will contribute towards the completion of the project. For example, in the context of a construction project the \u201clandscape architect\u201d role may be responsible for certain aspects of a building project, including (among others):\n\n","Advantageously, the use of roles within the team parameters  allow the responsibilities for events (and in particular tasks) within a project to be assigned long before it is know who the particular user within the user community  will be. For example, and with reference to , assume that Company B  represents a group of landscape architects, and the user profiles , and represent three (3) of the landscape architects within this company. Further assume that the scope of a newly created project  indicates that a landscape architect will likely be required in the future.","To allow events for the landscape architect to be created in an event group , a role for \u2018landscape architect\u2019 can be created in team parameters . In this way, tasks related to the landscape architect can be assigned to this role in the event group , even though which of the three landscape architects (i.e., those represented by the user profiles , and ) will undertake the project has not yet been determined.","In addition to roles, the team parameters  also allow the identification of those users (via their user profile) to whom roles and\/or events have been assigned. For example, assume it is decided that the landscape architect role will be assigned to the architect represented by user profile . The team parameters will be updated to indicate that user profile has been given landscape architect role and therefore is assigned responsibility for those events and tasks associated with this role.","The building projects database  can include a set of project templates . Each template in the templates  represents a project whose event group  and set of team parameters  are pre-populated based on prior knowledge and\/or experience. When a new project is created based on a template , the new project's event group and set of team parameters will contain the pre-populated set of events and roles from the template.","Using templates, such as the templates , can save a user considerable time and effort during project setup, especially if it is known that certain projects closely resemble each other in terms of their events and team parameters. Using the context of construction projects as an example, assume that the construction of shopping malls with an area of between 5,000 and 7,000 square feet that are built in the south-western part of the U.S. state of Arizona has been seen to include on average 1,278 separate events and 128 different roles within the set of team parameters. By using a template to set up a project for a new shopping mall of this type, the user is relieved of having to create all of these events and roles. In addition, the user could be sure that certain events and\/or roles related to the new project were not inadvertently omitted due to oversight or ignorance of their importance.","In addition, the use of the template  may allow certain specialized knowledge or techniques to be implemented within a project that would not have occurred otherwise. For example, assume that the group of landscape architects from company B  has identified an improved method for estimating rainwater runoff amounts for buildings with exterior asphalt parking lots so that this rainwater can be captured and reused for landscape irrigation. By implementing this method within a template, other landscape architects at the company B  (and possibly those not employed by this company) can benefit from this improved method in their projects.","It may be recalled that an event comprised within the event group  represents an occurrence or an activity in time.  shows how the events within the event group  can be generally classified as belonging to one of three (3) project phases, namely:\n\n","In the context of construction projects, the design phase events  comprise both pre-design and design-related events related to all aspects of the design of a building up to the point at which the ground is broken and construction begins. Such events may include, among others:\n\n","The construction phase events  in an event group  comprise events related to the construction of the building for which the project was created. Such events may include, among others:\n\n","The maintenance phase events  in an event group  comprise events related to the general operation of the building over its expected lifetime, which may be expressed in decades. Such events may include, among others:\n\n","It is worth noting that the maintenance phase events  are likely to constitute a large portion of the total events within the event group  for a given project. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that although the events comprising the design and construction phase events  and  may be measured in years, the events comprising the maintenance phase events  are likely to be measured in decades.","Furthermore, it will be appreciated that the maintenance phase events  allow regular maintenance for certain systems to be planned far (i.e., years or decades) in advance of their execution. By creating these tasks ahead of time, knowledge regarding the most effective methods for maintaining such systems can be transmitted between someone with certain specialized knowledge about that system to someone in the future who will be charged with maintaining the efficiency of that system.","For example, assume that during the design of an office building, a civil engineer chooses a particularly high-efficiency air-conditioning system in order to qualify the building for an environment certification such as the LEED certification. However, in order to keep the selected air-conditioning system operating at peak efficiency, the filters within the system must be cleaned out on a weekly basis, rather than on a monthly or bi-monthly basis as is the case with other air-conditioning systems.","To ensure that this maintenance is performed on a weekly basis, the engineer sets up a recurring filter-cleaning event in the maintenance phase events  to ensure that the filters are cleaned on a weekly basis. Otherwise, the technician responsible for cleaning out the system's filters may only perform this task on a monthly or bi-monthly basis, as is the case with other systems he or she may be familiar with. In such a case, the prospective gains in energy efficiency would not be realized, which could put the future LEED certification of the building in jeopardy.","It may be recalled that events within the event group  are initially assigned to roles within the team parameters . Typically, such roles are used as placeholders until members of the user community  can be assigned to fill them.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0188","num":"0283"},"figref":["FIG. 12","FIG. 13"],"b":["14","10","14","710","312"],"sub":"N "},"At step , the person who wishes to join the user community  (defined here as a \u2018prospective user\u2019) accesses the system , and more specifically the community management module , in order to create a user profile.

Once the architect agrees to this role (the process of which is described below), he or she may be assigned responsibility for certain events, such as generating blueprints or creating a virtual fly-through of public spaces. The architect may also create events for himself or herself in addition to those that were assigned previously.","As indicated above, when a user agrees to assume a role on a project, they may be assigned certain events within an event group for a particular project .  shows a flowchart illustrating a process in which a project is created and an invitation to one or more users to assume responsibility for such events may occur.","At step , a first user selects or defines the type of project to be created. The first user makes his or her selection\/definition via a user interface (UI), examples of which appear at ,  and . The UI herein described in these figures may be accessible only once a user has logged into (i.e., had his or her user name and password verified by) the system .","In particular, the first user may access a user interface sub-module  that is shown in . This sub-module may interface, or otherwise co-ordinate, with a projects management sub-module  that may be a part of the projects module . Alternatively, the UI sub-module  may remain independent of the module  (and ), and only interface with one of these modules when called by that module or sub-module. Regardless of the particular architecture of the sub-modules  and , it will be appreciated that the UI sub-module  can process both the display of interfaces (i.e., displaying them on a screen), as well as any concomitant input resulting from the display of the UI, such as a mouse click, input from a keyboard or the tap of a stylus and\/or a swipe of one or more fingers on a touch-sensitive screen.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0203","num":"0307"},"figref":"FIG. 10","b":["910","10","10","910"]},"It will be appreciated that the user-manipulatable controls within a user interface for the system  may be manipulated by a user in a variety of ways, including via:\n\n","It will be appreciated that the manipulation methods described above comprise a non-exhaustive list as other methods exist and would fall within the scope of the present invention.","In particular, the sub-module  can display interfaces, such as:\n\n","Returning now to step , the first user would access the project type selection interface  via the UI sub-module  and then select one or more type(s) of project from those listed in this UI.","In one non-limiting embodiment, the project type selection interface  may list a variety of project types, including:\n\n","It will be appreciated that the above list is non-exhaustive as other project types may exist that fall within the scope of the present invention.","Alternatively, the selection interface  may use techniques other than a list to allow the first user to define or select the project type. For example, the interface  could identify certain project criteria by \u201cinterviewing\u201d the first user by asking him or her project-related questions, including:\n\n","Based on the first user's responses to these questions (among others), the project type selection interface may be able to make suggestions or recommendations as to the best type(s) of project for what the first user seems to be indicating. For example, a project for a residential development with an expected 10- to 15-year lifespan would likely require different project parameters than a project for a commercial office tower with a 60- to 75-year lifespan.","At step , one or more instances of the project template  are loaded for the project type selected by the first user in the previous step. It may be recalled that each template in the project templates  represents a project whose event group  and set of team parameters  are pre-populated based on prior knowledge and\/or experience.","Based on this definition, it may be possible that one or more templates from the project templates  may be associated with a particular project type. For example, assume that the first user selects a project type for the construction of a 30 to 45 story commercial office tower within the downtown area of a major U.S. city from the project type selection interface . Further assume that the office tower project is intended to achieve a particular level of LEED certification (e.g., silver).","Once this selection has been made, the system , and in particular the projects module  may identify one or more templates from the project templates  that correspond to the project's criteria. For example, the criteria that the building must achieve a particular level of LEED certification may result in the selection of a project template that contains LEED-related events and roles in for the project's event group  and team parameters .","It will be appreciated that certain templates comprised within the project templates  may provide events and team parameters (i.e., roles) for a complete project, while other templates contain events and\/or roles for a portion of a project. For example, the events and roles related to achieving LEED certification mentioned in the above example may be contained in a separate template from those used to build projects. In such cases, when the first user indicates that the project for the office building requires LEED certification, the events and roles from the LEED certification template may be applied once the default project has been created.","By allowing templates within the project templates  to contain a portion of events and roles in the overall events group  and\/or team parameters , it is possible to create a project dynamically by combining a number of different specialized project templates. Such specialized project templates within the templates  may represent different approaches that could be taken to a particular project and\/or different aspects therein.","For example, assume that the first user intends to create a project in the system  representing a new academic library that is to be built using an integrated design process (IDP). Further assume that the project templates  includes a template that contains events and team parameters for IDP construction projects, as well as a template that contains events for applicable to construction of a library.","For example, the template for IDP construction projects may comprise team parameters that provide for the primary stakeholders including the architect, the building owner\/operator and the main contractor(s). The template for library construction may include such events as:\n\n","When the project for the academic library is created in the building projects database , the team parameters from the IDP template and the events from the library-specific template within the project templates  may be combined to generate the event group  and\/or team parameters  for the particular project. In this way, the specialized information and knowledge that is contained in each template may be combined to ensure that a project can benefit from the application of such knowledge.","It will be appreciated that the above example showed how two (2) templates from the project templates  could be combined during the creation of a project. The number of templates used in this example was provided for the sake of simplicity and projects could be generated by combining two (2), three (3) or more templates from the project templates .","It will also be appreciated that the event group  created as a result of a combination of one or more templates from the project templates  may still be modified by the first user (and\/or by subsequent users) so that the resulting events in the event group  accurately reflects the expected events in the various project phases, such as the design phase events . In this way, the users retain ultimate control over the events in the events group  so that these events can be modified to adjust for prior experience and\/or changing circumstances.","In a non-limiting embodiment, one or more of the templates within the project templates  may be selected automatically by the system  based on the first user's responses to questions posed to him or her via the project type selection interface . In this way, the user would not need to know the various templates within the project templates  in order to use them within his or her projects.","For example, assume that the interface  included a question relating to the construction management approach for the new project, such as: \u201cWhat type of construction project management approach do you intend to use?\n\n","Depending on the first user's response to the above question, the template for the appropriate management approach can be selected from the project templates . Furthermore, if the project templates  contain many such templates to choose from, the system  can shield first user from being overwhelmed, confused and\/or making an inappropriate choice of template.","In an alternative embodiment, the first user may be provided with a UI that would allow him or her to select templates from the project templates  directly. For example, the project type selection interface  could provide a user with a template UI that would list all of the templates within the project templates , such as in a collapsible list organized according to type of project, among others. Alternatively, the template UI may provide certain controls (e.g., drop-down lists) to allow the user to identify certain criteria that a prospective template must meet in order to be considered. Criteria that could be represented in such a way include (among others):\n\n","It may also be possible that the first user (and\/or other users within the user community ) can be provided with the ability to contribute and share templates within the project templates  with other users of the system . This ability may be provided by allowing members of the community  to apply and\/or modify certain restrictions relating to their templates' privacy. In these cases, removing such restrictions from (or conversely, by enabling the ability to share) one or more of their project templates, the entire community  may be provided with access to such templates.","Advantageously, the ability to contribute and share templates may enhance the transfer and sharing of knowledge within the user community . For example, assume that a user in the community  has knowledge about the operation of a certain type of high-efficiency commercial boiler, and in particular, detailed knowledge of when the heating elements of the boiler need to be changed beyond that available in the documentation and\/or training provided by the boiler's manufacturer. Furthermore, assume that this user created a series of maintenance phase events  for a particular project that used this boiler within a project template that was found to be particularly helpful.","If this user has the permission to contribute their boiler-related template to the user community , he or she could share it by removing any privacy restrictions placed upon it. In this way, other users in the community  who are using the same boiler in their projects could adjust their maintenance phase events for this component based on the knowledge contained in the user-contributed template.","In the above described embodiment, a template within the project templates  was contributed to and shared freely within the user community . Alternatively, user-contributed templates in the project templates  may also be offered for sale by their creator(s). In this alternative embodiment, a user within the community  may create a template within his or her project templates and then offer it for sale to other users. Users who wish to purchase this template could contact the seller (e.g., via the messaging features in the system ) and arrange for payment, which may be handled internally within the system  itself (e.g., via a shopping cart mechanism) or by an external provider (e.g., via PayPal\u2122). Once the transaction is complete (i.e., the payment has been made to the seller of the template), the system  could make the project template available to the buyer immediately.","Those skilled in the art will appreciate that a marketplace for project templates could be developed within the system  under such an embodiment. Furthermore, such a development could inspire users in the user community  to continue to develop and refine their templates after their initial development so that other users would continue buying them long after the original project for which they were developed was completed.","In the aforementioned alternative embodiment(s), a template within the project templates  is either freely offered or sold to the user community  by an individual member of this community. However, it is conceivable that a template within the project templates  could also be offered freely and\/or provided for sale by a named group within the community , such as by an equipment manufacturer.","In such a case, the template within the project templates  that is provided or sold through the marketplace may contain events (such as tasks and\/or document events) that relate to the installation, operation and\/or maintenance of one or more models of equipment provided by the named group. For example, the manufacturer of the aforementioned high-efficiency boiler could produce a template within the project templates  that comprised tasks in a maintenance schedule needed to keep the boiler working at a high efficiency. This template could be provided freely by the manufacturer to the user community  to generate goodwill towards its products and\/or to reduce support costs associated with the particular piece of equipment. Alternatively, the template could be sold by the equipment manufacturer through the marketplace in order to generate additional post-sale income for the manufacturer.","Alternatively, the marketplace for project templates may develop partially outside of the system . More specifically, a marketplace for project templates  may be developed in project templates between suppliers of equipment typically included in a project and the purchasers (or renters or leasers) of such equipment.","In this alternative embodiment, the purchase or lease of a certain piece of equipment from a first party (e.g., an equipment manufacturing company or maintenance company) by a second party (e.g., a contractor or building owner) for a project may include the provision of one or more project templates for that piece of equipment. For example, assume that a project in the project database  for a commercial shopping mall development requires the purchase of several large-scale heating\/air-conditioning units. These units typically have certain pre-defined maintenance periods, such as during the spring (or fall) when a unit is typically switched from heating air to cooling air (or vice-versa).","During the negotiations to purchase such units with the contractor or building owner, the HVAC equipment manufacturer may offer to provide one or more project templates for these units that include predefined events covering the installation, testing and maintenance of these units over their expected operational life. For example, the project template provided by the manufacturer could include:\n\n","Should the contractor or building owner agree to the sale, the manufacturer (who likely has a presence in the user community  as a named group) can immediately make available the project templates for the models of heating\/air-conditioning units sold to the contractor or building owner. The contractor or building owner can then import these templates to his or her project in order to add the heating\/air-conditioning unit-related events to the project, without having requested or paid for the sale via the system .","Bundling one or more equipment-related templates within the project templates  with the purchase of the associated piece of equipment may provide certain benefits, including:\n\n","It will be further appreciated that the templates provided by equipment manufacturers in this way may be identical to those already on sale in the system  or may be customized to the specifications and\/or location of the project. For example, if the shopping mall in the previous example is located particularly far north (or south) of the equator (i.e., near or within 60\u00b0 latitude N or S), the manufacturer may adjust the timing of certain events and tasks in the maintenance phase events  to account for the relatively longer winter period.","The above alternative embodiments have described possible scenarios involving the provision of templates by different means (e.g., via purchase from an individual or company, as well as bundled with a particular piece of equipment). However, it may also be possible that the system  could provide the ability for a user to choose from various versions of the same template that differ in terms of their comprehensiveness and\/or level of support. As a result, a user could select a version of a template that best suits his or her needs and\/or budget.","For example, assume that a world-renowned energy efficiency expert for large office buildings has created a system that can help improve the energy efficiency in other office building projects. Although the system  may provide a basic energy-efficiency template, the expert has decided to offer the following three (3) versions of a template that implements his system:\n\n","Depending on how the efficiency expert chooses to price the above versions of his template, a prospective user could choose the version of this template that best suits their needs. For example, if the user knows that providing better energy efficiency is going to be a major factor in the overall success of his or her office building, he or she might choose the \u2018professional expert\u2019 or \u2018enterprise expert\u2019 versions in order to take full advantage of the leading expert in this field. On the other hand, if the user cannot afford the cost of these versions, he or she may choose to go with the \u2018professional\u2019 version in order to realize at least some of the improved energy efficiencies in their project.","In the above example, the main price differentiator between the included version of a template and the expert's various template versions was a) the implementation of the expert's system in the project and b) the level of support provided by the expert to users of the template. It is conceivable that templates could be differentiated based on other factors, such as the number and type of roles or events in a project (e.g., an expert template provides certain roles not included in the basic template), the sequence of events in a project (i.e., events being sequenced in a particular way to realize certain efficiencies) and\/or help content relating to events and roles, among others.","It may be recalled that the system  can be used as a marketplace that facilitates both the storage of templates (and\/or template versions), as well as their discovery and purchase by users. This allows the seller of a template to realize some remuneration for their time and effort in creating the template. In addition, the system  may charge a fee (which may be a flat fee or a percentage of the transaction amount) to the buyer and\/or seller for each purchase made. In this way, the cost of providing a fully-featured marketplace can be subsidized and\/or recovered from the system's  users.","Although the use of templates within the system  is intended to assist and simplify the act of creating events and managing projects, it is likely that users (and in particular, new users) will require some assistance as they learn how to use the system . In order to provide such assistance, another non-limiting embodiment of the system  includes a help system that provides integrated, on-demand help in response to a user request (i.e., by clicking a help button or icon, clicking of a particular tab or use of a particular key such as F1).","The integrated help system may provide access to help content that can originate from different sources and may have very different objectives. For example, the system  itself may provide its own help content that aims to help users navigate the UI, identify different UI elements and learn the basic workflow involved with setting up projects and working with events. In addition, each template with which a user interacts may provide its own help content that aims to assist the user with the particular workflow and events included with the template.","For example, assume that a new user has joined the system  and has accepted a role working on a project to expand a university dormitory building. This project uses several templates, including an energy-efficiency template, a LEED certification template, and an IDP template used for general construction management. Further assume that the system  provides generic help content related to the UI and that each template provides its own help content that is specific to its template (e.g., the IDP template provides help content related to construction projects managed via the IDP approach).","Because the user is new, he or she needs assistance in navigating the UI of the system  (which is described below), and so activates the integrated help system via a control (e.g., button, icon or keystroke) to get information related to the purpose and usage of a particular UI element. In this case, the help system retrieves the relevant content from the generic help system for the system  and displays it to the user.","With this information in mind, the user then turns his or her attention to a particular event in the energy-efficiency template associated with the project. Since the user is not familiar with the way the template is set up and how this particular event falls into the general workflow, the user again consults the integrated help system. In this case, however, the help system retrieves the relevant content from the help content associated with the template rather than that for the system .","Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the system  may display help content in various ways, including within a web page (so-called \u201cHTML Help\u201d), in a pop-up window, through tips added to the UI or by playing a video or audio file, among other possibilities. The user may also indicate to the system  in what format he or she would like to view help content, which allows the system  to deliver help content in a manner which is more effectively retained by the user.","Therefore, it will be understood that no matter how many help content sources are available to a user, the integrated help system provides a single point of access to all of them within the system . As a result, the user does not need to be aware of the origin of the particular help content, as the help system handles the retrieval and display of the content to the user.","In another non-limiting embodiment, the integrated help system may provide an expert locator system to help a user access both help content (as described above), as well as to locate and contact one or more external experts who can assist the user should they need further help. For example, assume that the user described above who is working on an energy-efficiency template has reviewed the help content related to a particular event in the template, but still does not understand how this event fits into their project. If the user has access to the expert locator system (which may be provided upon payment of an additional fee or as a licensing option separate from the template itself), he or she could use the integrated help system to contact an expert to answer their question regarding the template. Such contact may be asynchronous (e.g., via an email message) between the user and the expert or synchronous (e.g., a VoIP call) between these two parties.","In the expert locator system described above, the user requiring assistance may locate and contact an external expert. However, it is also possible that the expert locator system may allow the user to search the existing user community , and more specifically, the user profile database  to locate the desired expertise. This approach may help to connect a user who is seeking assistance more quickly with a user within the user community  who is available to provide that assistance.","It should be appreciated that although the expert presented in the example of the expert locator system described above is human, this should not be seen as an absolute requirement. In an alternate embodiment, the \u201cexpert\u201d provided by the system may in fact be a software agent that utilizes knowledge based on aggregated usage data generated by the users of the system  in order to provide assistance. In this case, the software \u201cexpert\u201d may have identified that many prior users of the same energy-efficiency template were confused by this particular event and that a particular workaround helped them overcome their confusion. In this case, the \u201cexpert\u201d would suggest implementing the workaround to the user via the integrated help system. A method by which a software agent can generate knowledge based on user interaction with the system  will be presented later.","The result of the prior steps  and  is the creation of a new project within the projects database , including the generation of an events group and a set of team parameters for the project .","At step , roles for the events within the events group  may be selected based on the type of event and\/or prior experience, among other factors. During this step, therefore, each event within the events group , is provided with a role to indicate the person(s) who will be responsible for executing the activities associated with the event.","Certain types of events may include default roles for the team member(s) expected to complete those events. These default roles for events may be derived from a set of default roles that is maintained for all projects within the projects database  and assigned by the projects module . For example, events related to maintenance of an air conditioning system within the maintenance phase events  for the project may indicate a role for an \u201cHVAC Technician\u201d or \u201cAir Conditioning Maintenance Engineer\u201d, among other generic terms that could be used for such a role.","It will be appreciated that the association made between a particular event in the events group  and its default role from the set of default roles by the projects module  may be based on known history or prior experience. For example, certain events in the design phase events  (e.g., responsibility for the building's overall external aesthetic design) are typically associated with an architect. As a result, such events would typically be associated with the default \u201carchitect\u201d role by the module .","Alternatively, certain events in the events group  may be associated with roles based on prior history or experience. For example, assume that events within the design phase events  that relate to the creation of the physical or virtual model of a building are assigned by default to the role of \u201carchitect\u201d. However, assume that for past projects, these events were actually assigned to and\/or completed by a person with the role of \u201carchitectural model maker\u201d who was employed by the architect. Therefore, it is similar events for current and\/or future projects should likely be assigned to the \u201cmodel maker\u201d rather than to the \u201carchitect\u201d role.","There are several ways that such role reassignment could take place. In one non-limiting embodiment, a user could manually request that the projects module  reassign such roles by extracting them from past projects created by and\/or worked on by the current user. In this situation, the modeling events in the design phase events  would be initially assigned by the module  to the architect role. When the user requests role reassignment to take place (which may include identifying the project from which the module  should use as a base for such reassignment), the modeling events would then be reassigned to the \u2018model maker\u2019 role.","In an alternative embodiment, the projects module  might learn such role reassignments by extrapolating from an analysis of past projects. For example, certain logic built into the module  may review project roles reassigned for each completed project for a particular user. Such logic may determine that in each project, the modeling events within the design phase events  were assigned to a \u2018model maker\u2019 role. Based on such history, the module  may extrapolate that for future projects created by the same user, such events should be automatically assigned to a default \u2018model maker\u2019 role.","During this step, a list of all of the default roles assigned to the events group  for the project may also be compiled for a user's review. The compilation of this list may allow a user to identify and\/or manually reassign roles for certain events, such as the reassignment of physical or virtual modeling events in the design phase events  from \u201carchitect\u201d to \u201cmodel maker\u201d roles described above.","It may also be possible for the first user to create new roles for certain events in the events group  during this step. For example, if the \u201cmodel maker\u201d role was not part of the default set of roles included in the projects database , the user could add it manually and then reassign roles for events to this new role.","The user may be provided with the ability to add new roles (and\/or manage existing roles) via the roles selection interface  described earlier. For example, the interface  may include an \u201cAdd New Role\u201d control (e.g., clickable button or link) that would display a user interface that would allow a user to define a new role for the project. Criteria that could be defined via such a UI may include (among others):\n\n","Once a new role is created, it appears in the compiled list of roles. Typically, role reassignment occurs during the development of the project team, and more specifically, by the acceptance of responsibility for an event by a user whose role is different from the role originally associated to the event. While this process will be described below, it is worth noting that role reassignment may also be performed during this step to ensure that all of events in the new project (as displayed in the compiled list) are covered adequately by a default role.","At step , the project team is assembled from users in the user community . The process by which the project team is assembled will be described in more detail below, but in brief, the first user invites people (who may be within the user community  or people who are currently outside of the collaboration system  entirely) to participate in the project by taking responsibility for a role and its commensurate tasks. The system  monitors the acceptance of the invitations until all roles on the project team are filled and the project team is considered assembled.","While further details of the above process will be described shortly, it may be appreciated that the approach towards assembling the project team is unlike those commonly found in similar systems. In particular, prospective members of a project team are invited to join the project and take responsibility for a role, rather than simply being assigned tasks as a so-called \u201cresource\u201d residing within a spreadsheet or Gantt chart.","By approaching the assembly of a project team as a community-building exercise (e.g., through invitations and role-related responsibility), the collaboration system  may help develop more open communications between project team members than might otherwise occur. Advantageously, such open communication within the project-related community may serve help to solve problems more efficiently as they arise.","The result of step  is the assemblage of the project team. In the case where a project team member has a user profile within the user profile database , the acceptance of the invitation may cause several actions to occur, including:\n\n","In the case where a project team member is not a member of the user community , their acceptance of a role within the project typically results in the member joining the user community  and creating a user profile within the user profile database . This process was described previously with respect to  and so need not be explained here. Once the team member has obtained a user profile , however, his or her profile is updated in a similar manner to that described above.","At step , the permissions for certain project team members may be adjusted where necessary. This step is optional and may occur when a role in the project is changed and\/or the original first user fulfilling that role is replaced by a new second user.","Typically, permissions within a project are assigned to roles rather than to individual users in order to simplify the security model and allow turnover in the project. For example, assigning a default set of permissions (e.g., read, write, create, update, administer, execute and delete, among others) to a generic \u201carchitect\u201d role allows anyone who assumes this role to also inherit those permissions assigned to the role. Therefore, should Bob Smith (the user originally assigned to the \u201carchitect\u201d role) turn over responsibility for this role to Jane Brown (another architect and user in the system ), Bob does not have to ensure that Jane has the same set of permission that he does before this transfer of role title (and commensurate event responsibilities) takes place. Advantageously, this approach simplifies the transfer of roles between users while continuing to ensure that the permission set restricts what any particular user can do.","In some cases, however, the assigned role does not carry with it all of the needed permissions. For example, assume that team parameters for a project contains an \u201cHVAC trainer\u201d role to indicate the person that will train other users in the operation and maintenance of the HVAC system. Further assume that this role is assigned read permission by default, as it is not expected that the trainer will need to access more than the documentation already stored in an event group (i.e., the documentation tasks within this group).","However, assume that the user who assumes the trainer role realizes his or her tasks include an event for \u201cDeveloping training videos\u201d and\/or \u201cDistribute training documentation for review\u201d. Because these permissions entail a wider set of permissions than is currently assigned, the permissions for the trainer are adjusted at this step to include write, create, update and delete permissions as well.","It will be appreciated that once a first user has accepted responsibility for a role in a project, any change to his or her permission set changes the permissions for both the role and user. This is because the user and his or her role are considered identical once responsibility has been assumed. Should the first user be replaced by a second user (i.e., the original person shifts the responsibility for the role to another), the second user will inherit the same set of permissions, while the first user will lose his or her original set of permissions.","At step , information regarding the new project and its assembled project team are stored in the projects database . It will be appreciated that this step, and more generally the entire process described above, occurs within the context of changes made to the projects module , the project database , as well as the user profile database  (which is likely accessed via the community management module ).","Those skilled in the art will realize that although this step states that a project is stored within the databases  and  at this point, this action is likely occurring continuously during all of the steps in the process outlined above. Therefore, the \u201cstorage\u201d action indicated in step  may include:\n\n","The creation of a project, its events and their associated roles as described above has been described as being based on a template within the project templates  that is associated with the project type(s) selected at step . For example, assume the first user selected the following project types at step :\n\n","As the process has been described above, the project module  would likely choose and\/or combine one or more templates from the project templates  corresponding to each of the project types identified above in order to develop the events and roles for this project.","It is conceivable, however, that the first user may not want to start a project with a set of events and\/or roles from a predefined project template. Instead, the user may wish to start with a project that is completely empty of events and\/or roles so that he or she could build these up himself or herself.","For example, this user may be interested in building a template containing the maintenance phase events  for a particular piece of equipment, such as a wastewater or stormwater run-off treatment unit. In this case, the user may not need or want to have any events and\/or roles generated since these may not exist and\/or the project templates  may only include this unit as a component of much larger projects for commercial or industrial property development(s).","To provide the first user with the ability to build such a project, the project templates  may include a blank project template that is devoid of predefined or preconfigured events and\/or roles beyond those needed to establish the project within the project database . When this blank template is applied to a project, the user becomes responsible for entering events and developing roles in the process defined in , rather than adjusting or customizing these pre-defined events and\/or roles. In this way, a user can create a project (or project template) from scratch, without having any preset restrictions and\/or preconceived notions about what events and\/or roles are necessary.","In the above embodiment, a user is likely to use the controls within the system  to manually populate the blank project template with events and roles. However, in certain circumstances, the user may already have a file similar to the project template he or she wishes to create. For example, the user may have a file that was created in Microsoft\u00ae Excel\u00ae, Microsoft\u00ae Project or Google\u2122 docs that contains a list of events and\/or roles for the project, or portion thereof. Although the user could re-enter information from these files manually to the system , it would obviously be preferable that the user could \u2018import\u2019 (i.e., transfer) these events and roles to the blank template.","In a non-limiting embodiment, the system  (and more specifically, the projects module ) may allow the user to import the content of files created with certain applications to a project in the projects database . In one specific example of implementation, the user may be allowed to import the contents of such a file to a blank project template in order to populate it with the events, tasks and roles developed in the other software application.","For example, assume that prior to using the collaboration system , the user was managing his or her projects based on an Excel spreadsheet. In the spreadsheet, assume that:\n\n","Therefore, a person viewing the spreadsheet would find the row with his or her name and follow it across to find the task(s) that he or she was responsible for that time period.","Now assume that the user wishes to build a project in the system  based on the template he or she already has in the Excel spreadsheet. When the user is creating the project, he or she may select or indicate (e.g., via a control provided by the user interface sub-module ) that there is a file (namely, the Excel spreadsheet) that contains a template for or example of the project he or she would like to create. The user may also use the controls to indicate where this file is located and\/or its type (e.g., Microsoft Excel or Project file).","Upon receiving such an indication, the projects module  may create a blank project template and then attempt to load the contents of the file into this template. More specifically, the module  may review the contents of the spreadsheet and try to determine certain information about this template, including:\n\n","Should the projects module  complete this determination process successfully, it will either transfer the information from the file to the project template and\/or recreate these events and roles in the blank template. For example, the module  may be able to create events and roles in the blank project template based on the entries in the cells, rows and columns of the Excel spreadsheet. The module  may also review the names of the people associated with the roles to see if they are members of the user community  and offer to invite those who aren't in the community .","However, if the projects module  is unsuccessful at this determination process, it may request that the user assist it, such as by identifying certain sample events and\/or roles in the spreadsheet. Such an iterative process may repeat until the module  is able to complete the determination process successfully and import the events and\/or roles from the file.","For example, the system  may request that the user identify certain events and\/or roles in the Excel spreadsheet with particular colors (e.g., red for timeline event, blue for a task, green for a role title). By identifying the colored cells in the Excel spreadsheet and matching it with the event and\/or role type, the module  may be more successful at importing the events and\/or roles from the spreadsheet.","When the projects module  performs this importing process, it does so to the best of its ability, which may result in certain mistakes (e.g., missed or incorrect events, roles, and\/or incorrectly assigned event types) occurring in the resulting project or template. The user may then review each event and\/or role imported and correct it, if necessary.","It will be appreciated that by providing a means by which a user can create a project or project template from an existing file, he or she may save a considerable amount of both time and effort related to this activity. Such savings may allow the user to be more productive in his or her project, thus realizing certain cost-savings and\/or efficiencies for the project.","Although a blank template is likely used to create templates for the project templates , the blank template could also be used to create a training project for training a new user. For example, the new user could be provided with an empty training project that is based on the blank template. The new user would then be coached (either by the system  or by a human trainer) in creating events, inviting and assuming responsibility roles and\/or creating and adjusting different types of tasks in preparation for performing the same activities in a \u201creal\u201d project. However, the invocation of the blank project template used to create the training project may be done by the system  (in the case where the training is automated) or by a human trainer who is different than the new user, rather than by the new user himself or herself.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0294","num":"0456"},"figref":["FIG. 13B","FIG. 13A","FIG. 13B","FIG. 13A"],"b":["1340","1340"]},"At step A, a decision is made regarding the type of invitation to be extended for the role. More specifically, the invitation extended may be a so-called \u2018open invitation\u2019 or a so-called \u2018targeted invitation\u2019. Depending on which type of invitation is seen as being intended, certain differences in the team assemblage process may occur, as shown by the branches in .","An open invitation is extended to all members of a named group (e.g., a company) and\/or the user community  who satisfy certain minimum qualification criteria and remains available until a first member accepts (or is selected from a group of applicants to accept) responsibility for the role. When such an invitation is issued, the projects module  and the community management module  may search the user profile database  to identify all users in the community  whose profile includes these criteria and alert them that such a role is available for a project. Should only a single member from this subset of the user community  accept the invitation, he or she assumes responsibility for this role in the project. Alternatively, if more than one member accepts the invitation, the first user may be provided with the opportunity to choose from these applicants as to who will assume responsibility for the role.","In contrast, a targeted invitation is typically extended to only a single member of the user community , to a non-member known to the inviter, or to a named group (whose administrator then functions as the inviter and selects a group member to be invited to accept the role). In this case, the first user is generally responsible for selecting the member of the user community  to whom the invitation is issued, although he or she may use certain features of the system  that will be described below to help identify potential candidates. When a targeted invitation to assume responsibility for a role is issued to a member, the user receiving the invitation has the option to accept or decline the role. If he or she declines the role, the first user must then extend the invitation to another member (who may also accept or decline the role), and continue repeating such iterations until a member chooses to accept responsibility for the role.","To illustrate the difference between the types of invitations, assume that a project in the projects database  represents an environmentally friendly residential condominium development. Furthermore, assume that one of the roles in the project is for a \u2018Green Roof Consultant\u2019 who will be responsible for all events associated with the design, construction and maintenance of the green roof for this project. In addition, the consultant will document activities related the design and maintenance of this roof so that the development project may achieve some environmental certification, such as LEED.","If first user who created the project may not have experience with green roofs (and\/or consultants in this field), he or she may decide to issue an open invitation to all members in the user community  who satisfy the following criteria:\n\n","Once the invitation is issued, the projects module  and community management module  review the user profiles to in the user profile database  to identify all members of the user community  who satisfy these criteria. Assume that such a search by the modules  and  reveal five (5) prospective candidates for this role. Each of these five members is alerted (e.g., via a message) that an opportunity to take responsibility for a role as a Green Roof Consultant exists and provide them with the ability (such as via a clickable button, hyperlink or other option) to accept the role. In addition, the modules  and\/or  may provide each of the five prospective candidates with information regarding the project and the ability to contact the first user to find out more information about the role (e.g., location of the development, specifications for the green roof and\/or what payment can be offered for the candidate's expertise and services).","Determining who accepts responsibility for the role may depend on how many of the five prospective candidates choose to accept the invitation. If only one of these candidates accepts the invitation, responsibility for the role will typically be assumed by this member. However, if a plurality of candidates accepts the invitation, the first user may be provided with the ability to choose from among these candidates as to who he or she wants to assume responsibility for the role. Once the first user makes this choice, the selected candidate typically assumes responsibility for the role.","Alternatively, consider the case where the first user either has experience with green roofs or knows one or more members who could fulfill the responsibilities of the Green Roof Consultant on this project. In this case, the first user will extend a targeted invitation for this project role directly to his or her preferred candidate rather than issue an open invitation. As with the open invitation, the modules  and\/or  may provide the candidate with information regarding the project, as well as the ability to contact the first user to find out more information about the role (e.g., location of the development, specifications for the green roof and\/or what payment can be offered for the candidate's expertise and services).","Once the targeted invitation has been issued, the preferred candidate can choose to accept or decline the proffered role. Should this candidate decline the role (e.g., because the candidate is too busy with other green roofs), the first user may select his next preferred candidate and issue the targeted invitation to this member, who may also accept or decline the role. This process continues until one candidate accepts the role as the Green Roof Consultant.","With this in mind, it will be understood that once a decision has been made regarding the type of invitation(s) to be issued for each role on the project team, the steps involved in assembling the team differ slightly depending on the type of invitation. In particular, using a targeted invitation to fill one or more project role(s) is described in the process branch defined by steps B, C and D. In contrast, using an open invitation to fill one or more project role(s) is described in the process branch defined by steps E, F and G. The two branches of the process merge at step H. All steps in each branch will be described in further detail below.","The steps B, C and D define a process branch whereby a targeted invitation is issued to a member (or named group) in the user community . At step B, prospective candidates for each role on the project team may be identified by a first user (or users). Typically, the prospective candidates may already be members of the user community  and may also be known to the first user. For example, a user who is a general contractor will likely know other more specialized sub-contractors and may already have an idea of which of these specialized sub-contractors he or she wants participating in his or her project.","In other cases, however, the prospective candidates may not be known to the first user and\/or may not be members of the user community . For example, a user who is a general architect for a project may want a particular landscape architect he or she is familiar with to take on the landscape architect role for this project, but this person is not currently a member of the user community . Alternatively, the general architect may not know any landscape architects and therefore may need to identify prospective candidates in order to decide which one he or she would like to participate in the project.","It may be recalled that the User Interface sub-module  described previously can display the roles selection interface , which may be used to identify prospective candidates for roles in a project during this step.  shows one non-limiting embodiment of this interface, presented in the context of a team viewer interface (shown in ) for a project .","With respect to this figure, the team viewer interface may be comprised from the team parameters for the project, and more specifically, from the role for which each team member is responsible. For example, the interface includes such roles as a General Architect , landscape architect to the role of the last team member , which in this denotes an architectural modeler.","Each instance of the team parameters displayed in the interface includes the role title, a brief description of its responsibilities and indicates whether the role is currently assigned (i.e., a person is listed for the role) or unassigned (i.e., no person is listed for the role. In the case of a role that is unassigned, the team viewer interface provides an Invite option (indicated in italics in ) that allows the first user to identify the person(s) who could be invited to assume the role.","Selecting the Invite option typically causes the roles selection interface  to be displayed, of which a non-limiting embodiment (i.e., the interface ) is shown in . The interface includes a set of selection options C to C that may allows the first user to search for, identify and invite prospective candidates from within the user community  (as well as those outside of the community) to take responsibility for this role. The roles selection interface also includes controls C and C that allow the first user to either invite the selected user (or external person) to accept the role or to cancel the selection, respectively. It will be understood that although the interface displays four (4) options and two (2) controls, these are provided only as an example, and the roles selection interface  may include more or less options and\/or controls than are displayed here.","The selection options (e.g., the options C to C) within the roles selection interface typically allow the first user to identify a prospective candidate for the intended role in a number of ways, including:\n\n","In addition, the selection options may also allow the first user to assign the role to himself or herself. It will be appreciated that the above list of selection options constitutes a non-exhaustive list as other options may exist and would fall within the scope of the present invention.","Should the first user choose the selection option to search the user community, the roles selection interface may display an associated search interface C that allows the user to view and interact with a list of the user profiles to that are stored in the user profile database .","In a non-limiting embodiment, the associated search interface C displayed by the roles selection interface may appear in a so-called \u2018foldout\u2019 menu that appears to emerge from and becomes attached one of the sides of the interface .  displays the associated search menu C within such a foldout menu that appears to emerge from the right side of the team member viewer interface .","The associated search interface C includes various search controls that allow the first user to search the user profiles stored within the user profile database  via various criteria or facets. The search controls C may allow search for user(s) of interest based on criteria that may include, among others:\n\n","It will be understood that the above list of search controls is non-exhaustive and that other controls and criteria may exist, which would fall within the scope of the present invention.","Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the search controls C may be provided in a form that is most appropriate to the type of criteria searched. For example, a control to search by user profiles by user name might be provided as a text field and\/or drop-down menu, among other options. In contrast, a control to search by level of experience may provide a set of checkboxes or radio buttons that allow a user to filter according to a single experience criteria or by a plurality of such criteria.","In a first non-limiting example, the first user could input the name (or part thereof) of the user(s) of interest in the search controls C, and in particular the User Name control. Should the portion of a name entered in this control match that stored for a user profile in the user profile database , the name of the user may be completed in the control. This allows the first user to designate a user of interest immediately from the search controls C rather than having to search through the entire list of user profiles to in the user profile database .","Alternatively, if the name entered in the search controls C does not match that stored for a user profile in the user profile database , a prompt may appear to indicate that no matches were found and\/or alternative spellings (which may be identified from the closest possible matches in the database ) may be provided to allow users with homonymic spellings of their names (e.g., Larry Flynn and Barry Flin) to be considered.","In another non-limiting example, the first user could enter or indicate particular qualifications for the user(s) of interest via the search controls C, and particularly, the Skills Required control, the Experience Required control and\/or the Professional Certification control, among others. In this case, the first user enters or indicates one or more qualifications in one of the control(s) and uses the other controls to refine his or her initial selection. As the first user is refining his or her selection (or alternatively, when he or she is done), a database search key or string is generated that is submitted to the user profile database , likely by the community management module . The search key or string converts the first user's indicated qualifications into a form suitable for processing by the database , such as a search query in the SQL language.","The search key or string is then submitted to the user profile database  in order to identify those user(s) of interest who possess the required qualifications, which may be expressed as some combination of skills, experience and\/or accreditation. The resulting list of user(s) of interest may be displayed to the user in the same interface (i.e., the search interface C) or in another interface provided for this purpose.","In the above example, the first user was responsible for entering and specifying the qualifications required for the role. In an alternative embodiment, the system  may handle this function based on known information about the unfilled role. For example, based on prior projects, the system  (and more particularly, the projects management sub-module ) may become aware or are otherwise informed that users who take responsibility for certain roles require certain qualifications. For example, the qualifications for general architect for a project may require, among others:\n\n","Based on this information, the sub-module  may consult the user profile database  to identify prospective candidates and generate a potential short-list for the role based on these criteria even before the associated search interface C is accessed by the first user. In this way, the system  can anticipate the need to fill the unassigned roles and assist the first user in identifying prospective candidates. Of course, it will be understood that the first user can still refine this list of prospective candidates further using the other search controls C.","Advantageously, such a manner of identifying prospective candidates for roles may allow certain specialized knowledge encoded within the system to be used to identify candidates for a role. For example assume that the first user indicates that an architect with 3 to 5 years of experience is suitable for a project. However, the system  is aware of prior knowledge indicates that an architect with 5-7 years of experience would be a better choice for a project of the type and scale indicated, the first user may be alerted to such knowledge, such as via a prompt or message. A process by which such knowledge can be extracted from user contributions to the system  will be described later.","In the above embodiment, the search performed by the first user via the roles selection interface  and the associated search interface C was undertaken based on all user profiles to stored in the user profile database , which represents all users in the user community . However, it may also be possible the first user may want to restrict his or her search for one or more user(s) of interest to a particular subset of this population, such as a named group that represents the employees of his or her company.","In such cases, the first user may use the roles selection interface  to invoke a logic that would otherwise restrict his or her search to a particular group within or subset of the population of the user community . For example, this user may choose the \u201cChoose from a group\u201d option in the selection controls C to C. Selecting this option would cause the associated search interface C to display a somewhat different set of the search controls C within this interface.","In particular, the search controls C would allow the first user to select one or more particular named groups from which user(s) of interest are to be searched. For example, the first user may select the named group corresponding to the company or business that he or she works for, and\/or the named group defining a particular department in this organization. For example, assume that the first user is a civil engineer in a large engineering firm who is looking for an environmental engineer to work on a project in such a role. Rather than search the entirety of the user community  (which may contain user profiles for hundreds or thousands of environmental engineers), the civil engineer chooses to restrict the search to a named group using the option described above.","As before, the associated search interface C appears as a foldout beside the team parameters viewer , displaying the search controls C. In this case, however, the search controls C may provide the option to select by named group(s) rather than by user name(s). To generate the search key or string, the civil engineer first selects the named group for his or her company and\/or the named group for the environmental engineering department within this organization. This restricts the search to only those user profiles within the named group(s). As before, the civil engineer can use the other search controls C in this interface to continue refining the search criteria in order to more closely define the characteristics for environmental engineer that is his or her ideal user(s) of interest for this role.","It will be appreciated that other subsets of the user community  may be selected for a search in a manner which is generally similar to that described above. For example, a search could be conducted by the first user on a subset of the user community based on a certain level of experience and\/or a particular recommendation level.","In a non-limiting example of the former case, assume that the role selection interface  includes an option based on experience, such as a \u201cChoose based on experience\u201d option. Upon selecting this option, the following may occur:\n\n","For example, assume that the first user is a general architect who is trying to fill a landscape architect role for his project. The project that the general architect is bidding on is intended as a showcase office tower headquarters for a large multinational organization. Based on this knowledge, the general architect knows that he must choose a landscape architect with considerable experience and so chooses the \u201cChoose based on experience\u201d option in the roles selection interface .","When the architect makes this selection in the roles selection interface for the landscape architect role, the projects management sub-module , the projects module  and\/or the community management module  may submit a preset search string to the user community database  in order to identify the subset of the user community  that likely fits the general requirements known for this role (i.e., the user profile indicates that the user is presently a landscape architect and\/or is currently accredited as such). Furthermore, the sub-module  and\/or the modules  and  may sort the users identified by this preset search by their stated (or inferred) experience, such as by listing the most experienced landscape architects at the top.","It will be appreciated that this preset search is likely executed at the same time that the associated search interface C is displayed to the general architect. The landscape architects found by the preset search are also likely displayed within this interface, and the set of search controls C is customized to allow the architect to refine his search of this population further. For example, the general architect may specify via the controls C that the landscape architect(s) of interest must also have at least 10 years of experience with commercial development projects and\/or office buildings, as well as be located within 100 miles\/kilometers of the site location in order to facilitate communication and co-ordination during construction.","A similar process may be used to identify user(s) of interest based on a user community-generated general recommendation (or satisfaction) level or rating that can be associated with a user profile . In this case, a first user may choose an option in the roles selection interface  similar to \u201cChoose from the most recommended users\u201d, rather than options based on groups or experience as have been described previously. However, the general selection logic used by the projects management sub-module  and\/or the modules  and  to identify a subset of users from the user community  who generally fulfill the role requirements, as well as customizations to the associated search interface C to allow further refinements of the search, would otherwise be identical.","In certain cases, the user(s) of interest for a particular role in a project may not currently be members of the user community . For example, new employees of a company that is using the collaboration system  are unlikely to have a user profile unless they previously participated in a project using the system .","In such cases, the role selection interface  can provide the first user with the ability to invite the user(s) of interest to join the user community  and subsequently assume the project role envisioned for him or her. For example, the role selection interface provides the \u201cInvite a person to join\u201d option.","When this option is selected, the user is provided with controls to enter the email address of the person being invited to join the community . For example, the associated search interface C may display one or more fields that allows entry of the email address of the intended user of interest, as well as other fields to allow related information (such as a brief message or the name of the inviting user) to be entered.","By providing such options, the role selection interface  allows the first user a variety of search and selection means to identify the best person to fill the available role in the project.","At step C, the system  sends the user(s) of interest a message alerting them that they have been selected for a role in the present project and inviting them to accept responsibility for this role. The message may be sent using the projects module  or the community management module  and may take one of several forms, depending on whether the user is determined to be currently connected with the system  or not.","Should the user of interest be determined to be currently connected to (i.e., logged into) the system  may issue a message to the user of interest, alerting them that he or she has been selected as a prospective candidate for a role in the project. The user may be alerted to this via a message via an interface provided in a media\/messaging viewer  that will be described later.","Alternatively, if the user is determined to be currently disconnected from (i.e., logged out of) the system , the message may take one of several forms, including:\n\n","It is believed that methods for determining whether a particular user (such as the user of interest) is currently connected or disconnected to a computer system and\/or network, such as the system , are known in the art. As a result, further discussion regarding such determination methods need not be provided here.","It will be further appreciated that in the case where the user profile contains multiple messaging means of contacting the user, it is possible that the user may establish a priority for these means. In particular, the user may identify certain messaging devices as being preferred over other devices. For example, in the case where a user lists his or her work phone number, cellular telephone number, work email address and mobile email address (among others), the user may indicate that a mobile communications device (e.g., his or her cellphone) may be his or her preferred means of receiving a message.","In such cases, the message sent to the user of interest during this step may follow the priority set by the user. For example, if the user profile indicates that the user would prefer to be contacted by SMS first and then by email, the modules  and\/or  may try initially sending the invitation via SMS and then wait to see if the user responds via this messaging means. Should the user not respond to the invitation within a certain predetermined time period (e.g., within 24 hours), the next preferred messaging means (e.g., an email message) will then be used to send the invitation.","It may be appreciated that an invitation to assume responsibility for a role is sent to a named group (e.g., a company or department), the invitation may be intended for a particular person in that group. Furthermore it is possible that when the invitation is sent, the person who will fulfill the role from that group may be unknown.","For example, assume that an invitation for the role of \u201cHVAC system technician\u201d is sent during the initial setup of a project to a named group that represents a heating and air conditioning maintenance company. Since the maintenance phase events for this technician are likely set far into the future, the actual technician who will be handling the maintenance of the HVAC system may not be known at the time when the invitation is issued. (In fact, it is possible that the technician who will actually service this equipment in the future may not have been hired yet.)","To handle such situations, a member of each named group may be deemed the \u2018administrator\u2019 of the group. In certain cases, the group administrator may be the user who initially created or set up the group within the user community . In other cases, the group administrator's role may be transferred among several users.","Regardless of which user in the group acts as its administrator, he or she may receive messages (such as invitations) on behalf of the entire group and then forward such messages onto other group members as appropriate. In the case of invitations to assume responsibility for a role, the group administrator may forward such messages onto one or more users in the group for consideration.","Continuing the example above, the group administrator for the maintenance company would receive the initial invitation to assume the HVAC technician role for the project. Depending on how far in the future the events related to this role are set, the group administrator could either accept the role himself or herself and transfer it later to another group member (i.e., HVAC technician) who will actually perform the work, or wait until a later time and forward it to the group member who will actually perform the work.","At step D, the prospective user(s) of interest respond to the invitation that was issued in the previous step C. In particular, the user(s) of interest can either accept or decline the invitation.","It will be noted that the ability to accept or decline the invitation may be integrated directly into the message. For example, an invitation sent via email or SMS message may include controls (such as graphic buttons or text instructions) to indicate whether the invitation is accepted or declined. Invitations sent as voice messages via an IVR system may include prompts that allow the user to indicate his or her acceptance or refusal of the invitation via the touchpad of the telephone (e.g., \u201cPress the star key to accept the invitation. Press the pound key to decline the invitation\u201d).","As indicated above, an invitation issued to a group is typically received by the group's administrator, who may not be the intended user for the invitation. Therefore, the group administrator may forward the invitation onto one or more group members without needing to accept or decline the invitation himself or herself.","The steps B, C and D define a process branch whereby an open invitation is issued to a member (or a named group) in the user community . At step E, the first user defines one or more criteria that a prospective candidate must satisfy in order to be considered for the role on the project. The project module  and\/or community management module  will use these criteria at a later step to identify and invite prospective candidates to accept the role.","It will be appreciated that in order to define the criteria for prospective candidates, the first user may use an interface similar to that which has already been presented in . In particular, the user may choose the appropriate option from the team member viewer interface , such as \u201cSend an Open Invitation to the Community\u201d. Upon choosing such an option, the associated search interface C may appear in a so-called \u2018foldout\u2019 that is laterally arranged aside the interface . In this way, the first user is presented with a set of similar interfaces for issuing open and\/or targeted invitations, which allows a user to use these controls more efficiently regardless of the type of invitation being issued.","To reiterate, a significant difference between the open and targeted invitation types is that in the former type the one or more specific users of interest who are prospective candidates are not known to the first user apriori. In fact, the prospective candidates may not be known to the first user until the member of the user community  accepts the role. This may be advantageous in cases where potential confidentiality and\/or conflict-of-interest issues on the part of the first user make issuing a targeted invitation difficult.","For example, a first user who is a government or military employee or contractor may be restricted by certain conflict-of-interest laws that prevent him or her issuing a targeted invitation to certain preferred prospective candidates. In such a case, the first user can issue an open invitation that would likely include these preferred candidates among others.","Because the first user may not need to know (or, in fact, be prohibited by law from knowing) the identity of prospective candidates for a particular role, the associated search interface C may display a somewhat modified set of search controls C. In particular, the search controls C may allow the user to define certain criteria for the prospective candidates but not show the name(s) of the members of the user community  who would be included considered users of interest.","For example, the controls that would allow identification of one or more specific users of interest in the search controls C (e.g., the User Name and\/or Member of Group controls) may be absent or unavailable when the first user chooses to issue an open invitation. However, the controls related to qualifications, such as location, skills required, experience required and\/or professional certification, may be available.","For example, for the role of a landscape architect, the first user may identify that prospective candidates must possess qualifications including:\n\n","As the first user uses the search controls C, in this way, he or she is defining the required qualifications needed by a member of the user community  in order to assume responsibility for the role. In the context of a targeted invitation, this would have resulted in the creation of a search string or query submitted to the user profile database  that resulted in the display of a list of one or more members in the subset of the community  who fulfilled these criteria. However, in the context of an open invitation, the use of these controls does not display such a list, although a search string or query may be similarly generated and submitted to the database .","Although the names of prospective candidates are not communicated to the first user in an open invitation, the system  may provide some indication of the number of candidates found to this user. For example, assume that a first user uses the search controls to issue an open invitation for the role as a landscape architect and has entered the three criteria above in the search controls C. The community management module  submits the search query to the user profile database  and determines that over 2,000 users in the community  fulfill the first user's criteria. This value may cause a prompt to appear that informs the user that the number of prospective candidates is very high. In turn, this may cause the first user to add or otherwise modify his criteria in the search controls C to reduce the set of prospective candidates to a more manageable number.","In the above description, the first user is responsible for defining the set of qualifications used to select prospective candidates for the open invitation. However, it is conceivable that the associated tasks related to the unfilled role may themselves define a set of qualifications and\/or requirements for prospective candidates. In such a case, the first user may simply review and approve the set of qualification for the open invitation rather than be directly involved in the construction of the set of qualifications.","For example, assume that an unfilled role on a project for an office building development is for a project accountant. Assume also that the current project was created by the first user based on a template from a prior office building development that also included a project accountant role. Further assume that the project accountant role in the previous development project required a certain set of qualifications, including:\n\n","Because the project accountant role in the current project is based on a substantially similar (if not identical) role in a prior project, the set of qualification for the current role may already be defined. In this case, the first user need only review the set of qualifications to ensure that they conform to his or her role expectations before issuing the invitation to the user community .","It will be appreciated that even when a role includes a predefined set of qualifications, the first user has the opportunity to adjust this set of qualifications accordingly. For example, if the first user in the above project prefers to have the project team located closer to the building site, he or she could adjust the location-related qualification so that prospective candidates would need to live within 30 miles of the building site instead of 50 miles. This ability to adjust the set of qualifications for an open invitation ensures that the first user has flexibility to adjust the role to match his or her current project's requirements and\/or expectations rather than those of the past.","In an alternative embodiment, the first user may use the search controls C to define a first set of qualifications (such as a level of experience) that is necessary, as well as a second set of qualifications that would be preferable but are not as necessary as those defined in the first set. (These two sets of qualifications are typically referred to as \u2018must have\u2019 and \u2018nice-to-have\u2019, respectively.) By defining these two sets of requirements, the first user may provide the project module  and\/or the community management module  with a method of sorting and ranking prospective candidates. This may allow the modules  and\/or  to indicate to the first user how many prospective candidates meet all of his or her criteria (i.e., necessary and nice-to-have) versus those that meet only some of the criteria (i.e., all must-have and some nice-to-have). This indication may cause the first user to consider whether his or her search conditions are too restrictive or broad.","The result of step E is the generation of a set of qualifications identified by the first user via the search controls C that prospective users must meet. As in the case of the targeted invitation, the modules  and\/or  convert this set into a search string or query that can be submitted to the user profile database . It is worth noting that this conversion (and the submission of the search string to the database ) may occur simultaneously with the user's interaction with the search controls C or shortly thereafter. Thus, once the first user indicates that he or she is satisfied with the set of qualifications (i.e., by clicking an \u2018Invite\u2019 button), the modules  and\/or  may already have identified the subset of prospective candidates from the user profiles to in the user profile database .","At step F, the open invitation is issued to the set of prospective candidates (or users of interest) based on the result set generated by the search string or query submitted to the user profile database  in the previous step. The open invitation may be issued using a number of forms that are substantially similar to those used for the targeted invitation (e.g., message, email or SMS text), and therefore, the explanation of these forms is omitted here for brevity.","It is worth noting that, regardless of the form of the invitation, it would typically contain a control (such as a clickable button or checkbox in the case of a message or email) that allows the prospective candidate to indicate his or her interest in assuming responsibility for the project role, or for declining the role. For example, the invitation may include an \u201cAccept\u201d button and a \u201cDecline\u201d button (or icons representing similar indications) to allow the prospective candidate to indicate whether he or she wishes to assume responsibility for the role in the project.","Like targeted invitations, an open invitation can be issued to named groups as well as individual users. As described above, such an invitation will be received by the group's administrator, who can accept the role on behalf of the group. Alternatively, the administrator may forward or pass along the open invitation to one or more group members without accepting it himself or herself.","It is expected that when an open invitation to accept responsibility for a role is issued, acceptance of the invitation will not be instantaneous. In the context of many industries, prospective users may need time to review their current and future workloads and communicate with the first user to obtain more information about the project, review the expected workload and\/or negotiate compensation, all of which may be facilitated by the media\/messaging viewer .","To account for such a period, the first user may be provided through the search controls C a control to establish an \u2018acceptance period\u2019 for the open invitation. For example, the open invitation could be issued to prospective candidates on a Monday but such candidates would be prevented until Wednesday (i.e., 2 days later) to reply in order to give a candidate time to learn about the project and decide whether or not he or she would like to participate. On Wednesday, the acceptance period for the role is opened and the first prospective candidate to signal his or her acceptance can accept responsibility for it.","By providing an acceptance period, the first user can prevent prospective candidates who receive an open invitation from feeling pressured to immediately choose whether to accept or decline the offer without further information about the project, lest they lose it to another candidate. In this way, responsibility for an available role can be filled by a user who is likely genuinely interested in working on the project, rather than someone who jumps at an opportunity and then decides whether or not to participate.","At step G, one or more of the prospective candidates respond to the open invitation issued during the previous step. Responding to the open invitation may be performed by in various ways, which may include:\n\n","Those skilled in the art will appreciated that other ways of replying to an open invitation may exist that would fall within the scope of the present invention.","At step H, replies to invitations from the previous step are monitored by the system  to determine acceptance or refusal of project roles by their prospective team members. In particular, the projects module  and\/or the community management module  receive:\n\n","In the case where the user accepts responsibility for the project role in a targeted invitation, the projects module  can update the projects database  to indicate that the user accepted the project role and so has become a project team member. This may cause the team member viewer  to be updated to indicate that the role was accepted and list the user's name associated with the role.","In a similar manner, the community management module  may update the user's profile within the user profile database  to indicate that the user has accepted responsibility for the invited role and has thus become a member of that particular project. This may cause an interface shown to the user to include the new project on which the user is now going to be working.","In the case where a user accepts responsibility for the project role in an open invitation, the projects module  may react differently depending on the number of candidates who accept the role. If only one candidate accepts responsibility for the role, the module  is likely to act in a similar way to that described for a targeted invitation. In this case, the projects module  and\/or community management module  would update the databases  and\/or  (and or the team member viewer ) to indicate that the prospective candidate accepted the project role and so has become a project team member.","On the other hand, if an open invitation results in a plurality of prospective candidates who indicate that they would like to accept the role, the projects module  may use a determination process to decide which of these candidates will assume responsibility for the role.","For example, a list of the candidates who indicated their acceptance of the role may be provided to the first user in a message to allow him or her to make the final choice as to who should be allowed to accept responsibility for the role. When the first user indicates his or her choice for the role (e.g., by clicking a checkbox or radio button), the projects module  may communicate this choice to the winning candidate (and\/or losing candidates), as well as updates the projects database  (and or the team member viewer ) to indicate that the winning candidate has become a project team member in the indicated role.","Alternatively, the projects module  (or the projects management sub-module ) could use an automated selection process that compares the prospective candidates based on certain criteria and decides which of these candidates would be the best choice for the role. Criteria that could be used for such a selection process may include (among others):\n\n","It will be appreciated that the above list of criteria is non-exhaustive as other possibilities exist and would fall within the scope of the present invention.","One possible result of the automated selection process described above may be the identification of a prospective candidate that the projects module  (or the sub-module ) finds is the \u2018best fit\u2019 for the available role. In certain cases, this determination may allow the module  to decide on the winning candidate for the role and update the projects database  (and team member viewer ) accordingly without any further human involvement.","Another possible result of the automated selection process described above may be the development of a so-called \u2018short-list\u2019 of possible winning candidates for review by the first user. For example, the projects module  may identify the three (3) best candidates using the selection process and then provide the first user with the ability to choose the winning candidate from among these three. Allowing the automated selection process to review the set of prospective candidates who indicated their interest in the role may improve the efficiency and productivity of the first user in cases where the set of prospective candidates may be large. For example, if an open invitation results in 62 candidates indicating their interest in the role, it may be more efficient for the first user to allow the projects module to identify the three or five best candidates. Otherwise, the first user would have to review all 62 candidate user profiles, which may be an inefficient use of his or her time.","Yet another possible result of the automated selection process described above may involve a run-off process, whereby each prospective candidate who indicated their interest in the role may be invited to demonstrate their level of interest and\/or qualifications. For example, the projects module  could ask each candidate to indicate their expected level of compensation for his or her involvement in the project. Alternatively, the module  could provide each candidate with a sample problem that the candidate must solve. The result of this run-off process may be either the selection of the winning candidate or the development of a short-list of potential winning candidates to be provided to the first user.","Regardless of the type of invitation issued (and\/or the way that the prospective candidate was selected), the result of the selection process described above is that the projects module  may update the projects database  to indicate that the user accepted the project role and so has become a project team member. In a similar manner, the community management module  may update the user's profile within the user profile database  to indicate that the user accepted responsibility for the invited role and has become a member of that particular project. This may cause the team member viewer  to be updated to indicate that the role was accepted and list the user's name associated with the role.","On the other hand, if the user(s) of interest decline the invitation to accept responsibility for the role offered in a targeted invitation, another user may be invited by the system  to accept responsibility for the role. In particular, when the projects module  and\/or community management module  receive a user's refusal to take responsibility for the project role, one or both of these modules may alert the first user (who had initially selected the invited user) of this development. As a result, a new iteration of the process outlined by  commences with the first user commencing a search to identify another user(s) of interest to accept responsibility for the project role.","The refusal of a role by a prospective candidate for an open invitation may also be noted by the projects module  and\/or community management module . In this case, however, the modules  and\/or  are more likely to deal with conditions of acceptance, and more specifically the situation whereby a plurality of users indicate interest in a role. Should all prospective candidates for an open invitation refuse to accept responsibility for a role, the projects module  and\/or community management module  may indicate this result to the first user. This action may result in a new iteration of the process outlined by  with the first user possibly responding in a variety of ways, including:\n\n","It will also be appreciated that the issuance of an invitation to fulfill a role regardless of whether the invitation was targeted or open (and the subsequent receipt of a reply to this invitation) comprises a task event related to the project, not just a message sent between users. In particular, when an invitation is issued by the first user, a related task event is created for him or her that must be completed. More specifically, a task relating to the invitation is created within the event group  of the project and remains uncompleted until someone (i.e., the first user or a user of interest) accepts responsibility for the role. Once the invitation is accepted by a user (regardless of how many iterations of the process outlined in  are required to do so), the task is considered completed.","Because the invitation is perceived by the system  (and more particularly the projects module ) as a task event rather than simply as a message, identifying which roles are currently unfilled is considerably simplified, since an unfilled role is seen by the system  as the equivalent of an uncompleted task event. This approach helps reduce the possibility that unfilled project roles will remain unfilled due to oversight (e.g., the first user forgets to check that all of the roles are filled) or communication problems between the first user and the user(s) of interest (e.g., email issues prevent the invitation from being received).","It will be appreciated that the above messages relating to the invitation of a member of the user community  to assume responsibility for a role, as well as the member's subsequent response indicating his or her acceptance or refusal, are examples of task-related communications. As used here, the term \u201ctask-related communications\u201d refers to communications (which may comprise both synchronous and asynchronous forms of communications such as internal messages and\/or email) that are associated with a particular activity.","In a non-limiting embodiment, each event comprised in a project in the projects database  may have one or more instances of such task-related communication associated with it. For example, a targeted invitation to accept responsibility for a particular role on a project is an event that may be associated with the following task-related communications:\n\n","It will be appreciated that since all task-related communications are typically associated with an event, a user of the system  can organize his or her communications according to its associated event. By providing an explicit link between a work activity and the communications associated with that activity, the user may review his or her work related to an event by looking at its related communications. Such an ability to view a work activity as a communications thread between the user and other members of the project team (among others) may realize certain cost- and\/or productivity efficiencies.","The result of , B and C is the preparation of a project within the system  and the assembly of its associated team from the user community . It will be appreciated that growth of the user community  may occur from users joining the system  by being invited to assume responsibility for roles by existing users within the community . It will also be appreciated that once a user is participating in the user community  through a role in a certain project, it is becomes more likely that the user will find other like-minded users in the community  who will invite him or her to participate in other projects. As a result, the benefits to each user of participating in the user community  are advantageously reinforced, as is the interest in inviting other prospective users to join.","Once a user has joined the user community  (i.e., they have a user profile in the user profile database ) he or she can access the system  in order to work one or more projects in his or her accepted role. Since there typically is a plurality of projects stored in the projects database , each of which having a generally different project team, there is a need to authenticate users of the system  in order that each user may see his or her projects (and its associated events and tasks).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0397","num":"0605"},"figref":"FIG. 14A","b":["1410","10","1410","1412","1414","1416","1418","1420"]},"The user name\/email address field  and password field  are intended for an existing user to enter his or her authentication details, such as his or her email address (or user name, if different) and password, respectively. The login control  (which can be represented by a clickable button) allows the entered authentication details for a user to be verified by the system , and more specifically to be compared by the community management module  against such details stored in the user's profile . Since such authentication are believed to be well known in the art, further details regarding this process need not be provided here.","The new user indicator  (which may also be represented by a clickable button or checkbox, among other possibilities), allows the user to indicate to the system  that he or she is a new user without a user profile. Providing such an indication from the authentication UI  allows the system  to immediately follow the process outlined previously in  to create a user profile in the user profile database  for the new user.","The option to store user settings  is provided to retain certain entered authentication details within the authentication UI  (such as the content of the user name\/email address field  and\/or the password field ) for future access attempts. For example, enabling this option (e.g., by clicking the checkbox) allows the user to store his or her user name or email address within the field , so that in future login attempts, this information will appear automatically within the authentication UI . Such details may be stored locally with the client  (e.g., within a so-called \u2018cookie\u2019 on the user's system) or on the central node . Since it is believed that the storage of such authentication details as user names and\/or passwords is known in the art, further details regarding this need not be provided here.","Once authentication details entered in the authentication UI  are authenticated by the system against his or her user profile within the user profile database , the user may be provided access to a user interface  that provides access to his or her projects and related tasks, gives details about the team assembled for each project, allows the user to contact other users that may be working on the same project(s), as well as provides access to the user community  beyond the members of the one or more project team(s).","In particular, the UI  is comprised of a set of UI elements, including:\n\n","Further details about each of these UI elements will be provided below. It will be appreciated that the UI elements displayed above constitute a non-exhaustive list as other elements may exist and would fall within the scope of the present invention.","In addition, the UI  includes a set of navigation controls  that allow the user to navigate between the various UI elements  to . In particular, the navigation controls  (which may be represented as clickable buttons with associated keyboard shortcuts) may allow a user to navigate more quickly and efficiently throughout the various UI elements in the UI .","It will be appreciated that the display device used to display the UI  may be incapable of showing the UI  in its entirety in certain cases. For example, a user viewing the UI  on the smaller screen of a cellular phone may only be able to see a portion of this UI at any time. To assist the user in navigating the UI , the navigation controls  may be rendered in such a way that the user's current location within this UI is indicated.","One example of such an indication may be visual indicators, and in particular, the use of particular shades or colorings to indicate the currently visible portion of the UI . For example, the controls  may show the currently visible portion of the UI  in a darker shade of a particular color, while the non-visible portions of the UI  would be represented by a lighter shade. The use of such visual indicators may allow the user to better identify how much of the UI  they are seeing.","Those skilled in the art will appreciate that alternative types of indicators may be used in a similar fashion. For example, audible indicators could be used to generate a particular sound whenever the user displays a UI element  to . Similarly, tactile indicators could generate a vibration at the boundaries of any of one of the UI elements  to  and\/or for the boundaries of the UI  itself. Use of these various types of indicators in combination could allow a user who is visually- or audibly-challenged to utilize the system .","The UI  also comprises a set of controls  that provide certain functionality to a user that are independent of the UI elements  to , which will be discussed in more detail below.","The UI  further comprises a logout control  that serves to logout the user when activated, thereby ending the session between the system  and the user. When this control is used, it is likely that the login screen  may be re-displayed to the user.","It will be appreciated that the UI elements  to  within the UI  are presented laterally (i.e., beside each other) within the same screen area. Therefore, the navigation controls  can allow a user to switch between the elements in the UI , by making one of the UI elements  to  the primary element on the screen, while making the remaining UI elements secondary. Arranging UI elements laterally in the UI  reduces the need to display each of the elements  to  within a separate frame or window, which may be confusing and inefficient, for the user. Instead, the user may use the navigation controls  to view and quickly navigate between all elements  to  within the single UI .","In addition, interfaces related to or associated with the elements  to  (e.g., foldouts similar to the associated search interface C described previously) may also be presented in the UI . Typically, associated interfaces are located in lateral proximity to the UI element from which they were called. For example, a foldout for the time UI  that describes one or more events or tasks for a project may be displayed in the UI  beside (i.e., to the left or right of) the UI element .","Furthermore, it will be appreciated that the UI  represents a display with a generally fixed amount of space. Although the navigation controls  allow movement through this space, certain restrictions on the display of associated interfaces (such as foldouts similar to the associated search interface C) may be applied to ensure that the UI  does not become overly cluttered.","For example, the number of associated interfaces displayed at any one time for each of the UI elements  to  may be limited to a particular value, such as three (3) foldouts. For example, the time UI element  could be limited to displaying three (3) foldouts that provide details for, or ancillary information about, a maximum of three events. Should a user attempt to open a fourth foldout, the display of one of the three original foldouts may become hidden and the user may be prompted that he or she is limited to viewing three (3) foldouts at a time for each UI element.","Alternatively, the total number of associated interfaces may be limited for all of the UI elements  to  in the UI . For example, all elements  to  may be limited to a total of three (3) associated interfaces, regardless of which UI element generated the foldout. For example, if two (2) associated interfaces were generated from projects in the project UI element  and the user attempts to generate another two (2) foldouts from events in the time UI element , one of the following results may occur:\n\n","In the above examples, the numeric value defining the upper limit on the number of associated interfaces (or foldouts) for the UI  and\/or the UI elements  to  was set at three (3). However, this value is provided as an example only and the actual value defining this upper limit on foldouts may, in fact, be set lower or higher than this value.","When a user displays a plurality of foldouts in the UI , it is conceivable that he or she may be more interested in one particular foldout within this set. In this case, the user may be provided with a particular control, such as but not limited to a button, icon (e.g., a \u2018pin\u2019) or key-combination, that establishes a hierarchy within the set of foldouts for each UI element. More specifically, when the user activates the hierarchy-related control within the UI of a particular foldout, the selected foldout is elevated in the hierarchy and is moved closer to its relative UI element to indicate its new position.","For example, consider the case where a user has opened three foldouts for the UI element  that appear as follows: a first foldout located closest to the element , a third foldout located farthest away from the element  and a second foldout, which is located between the first and third foldouts. Because the user considers the content in the second foldout as more useful or relevant to their work than that of the first and\/or third foldouts, the user activates the hierarchy-related control for this foldout (e.g., clicks a \u2018pin\u2019 icon).","When the user activates this control, the relative visual positions of the first and second foldouts are switched (i.e., the first foldout becomes the second and vice-versa), while the position of the third foldout remains unchanged. This allows the user to more easily find, consult and utilize the content of the formerly second foldout for their task(s), while keeping the content in the other two foldouts available for consultation if necessary.","In addition, should the user open another (i.e., fourth) foldout from the UI element  that exceeds the maximum number of foldouts, the system  may choose to close one of the foldouts that is lower in the foldout hierarchy. In this case, the system  may close the third foldout and make the newly-opened foldout the third foldout.","It will be appreciated that certain restrictions may be placed on the use of the foldout hierarchy control described above. For example, the user may only be allowed to elevate one (1) foldout per UI element in the hierarchy. If the user has already elevated a first foldout and then proceeds to elevate another, second foldout, the previously elevated foldout will be depreciated in the hierarchy and may be hidden or closed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0421","num":"0637"},"figref":"FIG. 14B","b":["1430","1440","1480","1430","1440","1480","1430","1440","1480","1490","1440","1480","1430"]},"Furthermore, it will be appreciated that certain interfaces associated with the UI elements  to  (such as the foldout for the associated interface C described previously with regard to ) may be displayed in a similar fashion as these UI elements.

For example, assume that a particular event represents a documentation task to develop a PowerPoint\u2122 presentation explaining how the building to be constructed will qualify for a particular environmental certification, such as LEED.","The user creates an initial version of the presentation and associates it with the task, such as by uploading a file entitled \u201cLEED_Presentation_V1_Draft\u201d to the system . Through this association, the system  may come to realize that the user is currently working on this documentation task, and therefore assign it the \u201cTask Started\u201d status accordingly.","In certain cases, the user may decide that a current or an upcoming event in the events to needs to be adjusted in some respect. For example, assume that a certain event represents a timeline during which the user is expected to travel to London, England to oversee initial construction on a new building. However, unforeseen events (such as a family emergency or natural disaster) cause the user to miss his or her flight. In such a case, the user may be able to adjust the expected start date of the task based on when he or she is able to rebook a flight to London.","In particular, a user may be provided with a set of adjustment controls  related to a particular event in the events to . Such controls may be displayed when the user performs a certain action (e.g., clicking the title of the task) or may be displayed using a keyboard shortcut or the like.","In one embodiment, the adjustment controls  may provide the user with the ability to adjust when an event occurs. For example, the controls  that are illustrated for the task titled \u201cGather Intents and Requirements\u201d in  may allow the user to move (or \u2018jog\u2019) the event backwards or forwards in time. Returning to the previous example, if the timeline event representing the user's travel to London is due to be start in the near future, use of the adjustment controls  may allow the task to be postponed accordingly to when he or she can rebook a flight.","Alternatively, if an event is scheduled to have begun (or already be completed) and is running late, a user can use the adjustment controls  to jog the event to a time when the event can be performed. For example, assume that a set of tasks are identified as late due to a dependency on another person who has been off sick for a week. To adjust the time when these tasks will be performed, the adjustment controls  can be used by the user to postpone the start times of these events by a week to account for the other person's absence.","The adjustment controls  may also be used to change the status of a task. For example, the controls  may be provided with a button or other graphical element representing different statuses to which the task may belong. For example, the controls  may provide a \u201cTask Started\u201d button so that a user can indicate to other project team members (as well as to the system  in general) that he or she has started the task. Once the user has finished the task, he or she may then use the \u201cDone\u201d button in the adjustment controls  to update the task's status to indicate it is complete (i.e., assign the \u201cTask Done\u201d status to the event).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0452","num":"0686"},"figref":"FIG. 15C","b":["1460","1430","1460","1550","1560","1562","1564","1566","1566"],"sub":["1 ","N "]},"By default, the team UI  displays all users for all project teams in which the current user is also a participant.

For example, a user may wish to provide the user community  at large with a first communication method of communicating with him or her (e.g., his or her a publicly available email address), while project team members may be provided with a second set of communication methods for communicating with the user, such as work or cellular telephone numbers. By restricting the second set of communication methods to those who are working with the user directly on his or her projects, the user can maintain a degree of privacy from the user community .","In a similar manner, the user may wish to provide the user community  with certain first set of information regarding the projects that he or she is working on, while those working on the project may be provided with a second set of information that is more detailed than the first. For example, the first set of information provided by the user may include the project's name, type (i.e., whether it is a commercial, industrial or residential development) and his or her role in the project. However, the second set of information may include much more detailed (and likely confidential) information about the project, such as its exact location, the overall budget, the list of project team members (which may include suppliers) and the detailed timeline for the project. By restricting the second set of information to only those people who are working with the user on his or her projects, the user can ensure that sensitive and\/or confidential information can be restricted from potential competitors.","The set of community activities to may also provide a user with the ability to find an expert in the community. In a non-limiting embodiment, this activity may provide many of the same search controls C discussed previously in the context of the targeted invitation. However, these controls would allow the user to identify other members in the user community  who possess certain expertise without necessarily inviting them to accept a role in a project.","One use for the search controls in the set of community activities to may be to find people who are interested in participating in sharing their knowledge about a particular domain of knowledge. Such members may form a \u2018community of practice\u2019 whereby knowledge and experience is pooled among its members to assist those with questions and problems regarding a particular domain. For example, assume that a community of practice emerges regarding a certain LEED credit regarding public-transportation.

For example, the menu  in the media\/messaging UI element  may provide a user with the ability to view messages corresponding to a certain event type, such as tasks versus document events. In this case, the type of content that subsequently appears in the associated area (i.e., the messages areas ) depends on the menu selection made by the user.","Because this type of functionality is typically used to view different type of content, each control in this regard may be termed a \u2018view\u2019. For example, the menu  in the time UI  may provide controls to view a \u201cTasks view\u201d, a \u201cDocuments view\u201d, a \u201cTo-Do view\u201d, and a \u201cMilestone view\u201d (among others) that would display task events, document events, to-do events and milestone events respectively in the events area . By providing the ability to switch between such views, the menu  allows the user to quickly filter his or her events in the events area  to correspond to a particular type of event. This may save time for the user who may otherwise be forced to review all of his or her events to identify a particular one.","In a second non-limiting example, the set of menus , , ,  and  may provide one or more controls that allow a user to control the layout of content within the associated area of its respective UI element. Such controls may allow the user to see the content in a different format and\/or adjust the amount of content displayed.","For example, the menu  in the projects UI  could allow a user to view projects in the time pod  in different layouts, including:\n\n","It will be appreciated that type of layouts provided by controls in the menus , , ,  and\/or  are typically determined by the type of information in each menu's respective associated area.

Further assume that by default, the time pod  in the projects UI  can only show five (5) of these projects at a time in a list view but that it can show 12 projects in a table view. By allowing a user to switch the layout of the time pod  from the list to the table layout, the user may be able to view a summary of 12 of his or her projects at a time, which may allow him or her to identify those projects that need attention more quickly.","In a third non-limiting example, the set of menus , , ,  and  may provide one or more controls that allow a user to adjust the amount of information displayed in the within the associated area of its respective UI element. This may allow a user to show more or less content for each entry in the associated area.","For example, the menu  in the media\/messaging UI  may allow a user to show or hide certain information associated with each message (e.g., an email or text message), such as:\n\n","Like the second non-limiting example above, adjusting the amount of content displayed in the associated area allows the menus , , ,  and  to be used to realize certain efficiencies. For example, a user may choose to hide the time\/date stamps, header information and\/or summary of the message to view more email messages within the messages area . This may allow the user to scan the entirety of his or her emails to more quickly identify a certain email from the list.","In a fourth non-limiting example, the set of menus , , ,  and  may provide one or more controls that allow a user to group information displayed within the associated area of its respective UI element. This may allow a user to view relationships between content in the associated area based on certain criteria. For example, the relationships between certain projects that constitute a portfolio in the time pod  may be identified through the menu  that displays projects in this area in groups indicating that there is a relationship between them. A control in the menu  may allow the user to view the projects within a (previously described) tree-branch format that would indicate at a glance which projects were, and were not, members of a portfolio, for instance.","Similar grouping strategies could be applied to the content in each associated area for the UI elements  to . For example, messages in the messages area  may be grouped by their date\/time stamp (default) as well as by their respective sender, receiver, subject or related project and\/or event (e.g., task or document). Events in the events area  could be grouped by their related project (default), as well as by their type (e.g., task, document or milestone), status (e.g., starting soon, in progress, completed) and\/or related role (e.g., landscape architect, public-transportation evangelist or bike rack consultant).","The ability to group content using the menus , , ,  and  may allow a user to organize content according to a certain type, as well as help him or her identify certain relationships that may not have been evident before. In this way, the menus , , ,  and  may allow a user to improve their efficiency, as well as explore options suggested by newly discovered relationships between entities in the UI elements  to .","While the above description of the menus , , ,  and  described several informational aspects that could be adjusted using a menu's constituent controls in detail, it will be appreciated that not every menu in this set provides all of these abilities.

The clickable element may also provide an indication of the amount of associated content (e.g., a numeric value) as well as an indication of when this content has changed (e.g., a \u201cNEW\u201d icon). This indication may be used by the user to confirm that his or her suspicions regarding relevant content in a topic (i.e., higher numbers being associated with broad topics versus lower numbers being associated specific topics) and\/or to identify tags with new content.","When a user clicks on a tag title in the interface , it expands to show content associated with the tag, which is typically provided by the tagging sub-module . This content may be grouped or organized by the sub-module  for the user's convenience. For example, a tag  titled \u2018Board of Advisors\u2019 was clicked and is showing that its tagged content is grouped into projects, people and companies categories, each of which are a clickable link.","Although the tags shown in the interface  appear to apply to be generally business-related subjects, it will be appreciated that any item deemed relevant and subsequently by the user (and\/or by others in the system) could appear in this list. For example, the user could tag certain building supply items, such as various types of windows that were used in his or her projects. These may be tagged with a generic term, (e.g., \u2018windows\u2019) or a term with certain technical specifications, such as \u201cwindows, double-pane glazed\u201d or \u201cwindows, \u00be-inch, triple-pane glazed, Energy-Star compliant\u201d. By tagging these building materials so that references to them are stored as tag titles in the interface , a user can refer to them in later projects where information regarding such building materials may be needed.","The use of such information may be augmented if the tag-building exercise described above is extended beyond a single user to the system  and\/or the user community  in general. For example, the system  may review and collect user-contributed information contained in projects and events relating to a particular defined set of terms in a knowledge domain, such as building materials for the construction industry in general. Alternatively, the system  may be able to discern and tag more specific building materials, such as \u00be-inch, triple-glazed Energy-Star certified windows.","In one non-limiting embodiment, the system  may identify and tag this information based on user input using a knowledge-building process that will be described below. In another non-limiting embodiment, the user community  may identify and tag this information based on a set of terms and\/or taxonomy that is provided to and\/or defined by members in the community . In yet another non-limiting embodiment, certain tagging activities may be performed automatically by the system  while other activities (or alternatively, review of the automated tagging activities to correct mistakes and ensure quality) may be performed by members of the user community .","By grouping this information into categories, the mental load placed on the user to identify relevant information associated with the tag is advantageously reduced. Such a reduction may allow a user to select the category that she or he feels is most representative of the type of tagged content that is needed at the time.","For example, assume that instead of three (3) items being associated with the tag , there were 300 items, including 25 projects, 119 people, 98 building components\/supplies and 58 companies. By breaking the tagged items into these three categories, the user has a chance to decide whether the associated information that he or she is looking for is related to a project, a person, a particular building component\/supply or a company. Otherwise, the user may be forced to navigate through all 300 items in the attempt to find the information of interest, which may be impractical for the user.","As presented above, the S\/T\/S control A is used to find content associated with a particular tag, such as the tag  in . Alternatively, the control , and more specifically elements in the interface  could also be used to apply a tag to content in the UI . For example, if a new message in the messaging area  relates to the Board of Advisors tag , the tag (or a representative icon thereof) could be dragged onto the relevant message in this area in order to create an association between the tag and the message. Thus, when the Board of Advisors tag  is subsequently opened, it may show four (4) items, including a project, a person, a company and the new message that was tagged in the media\/messaging UI element .","In another non-limiting embodiment, the S\/T\/S control A may also provide search functionality that allows the user to search the system  based on certain user-supplied keywords or criteria. For example, a user could use the S\/T\/S control A to search for all messages, events, projects, rankings and\/or community-related postings related to a particular member of the user community . Such a search may be done to identify whether the member is an active participant in the user community  and\/or what projects he or she has worked on in the past.","In another non-limiting example, the search functionality provided in the S\/T\/S control A may allow a user to search for project templates, rather than for projects themselves. For example, assume a user is developing a project whose approach will be based on the integrated design process (IDP) rather than a design-bid-build (or design-tender) process. In addition, assume that the user is unfamiliar with the IDP process as she has only worked previously on design-bid-build and design-build approach projects. As a result, the user would likely prefer to build her project based on an existing template for IDP-based projects but has no such past projects to base her design upon.","In order to find an IDP-related template, the user may use the search functionality provided through the S\/T\/S control A. In particular, she may choose to search for a term or keyword such as \u201cIDP\u201d or \u201cIntegrated Design Process\u201d among the project templates  using this control. The user's search request may be passed by the control A to the projects module , which may then search through the project templates  to identify those that have the related search term or characteristic. For example, the module  may find four (4) project templates, two of which are for commercial developments using the IDP process, an IDP template for an residential development project and an unrelated template that used IDP as an acronym for \u201cIndiana Department of Probation\u201d. The user may then review the three relevant IDP-related project templates to see which best suits her development project, purchase the template if necessary and then create her project using this template.","In another non-limiting example, the search functionality may allow a user to filter events based on criteria supplied by himself or herself. For example, assume a first user is responsible for submitting all documentation needed to initiate a process whereby a project may be reviewed and certified by a reviewing body, such as the International Standards Organization (ISO) (e.g., documentation for an ISO 9000 quality certification process). Further assume that the first user has set up the project in the system  such that the drafting of each piece of documentation required for the certification process by another project team member is a documentation event.","As team members file their documentation and thus complete their documentation events, the first user needs to identify how close (or far) he or she is from having a complete documentation set. To do this, the first user uses the search functionality provided by the control A to filter the events related the project to see how many of the documentation are completed and how many remain outstanding.","It will be appreciated that the ability to filter events in this way may save a user time in reviewing the status of the required documentation set. Otherwise, the first user would have been forced to review all events in the project to manually identify those that are documentation events, and then view the status of these events to see if they are still outstanding. The time required for such a manual review (especially if repeated several times over the life of the project, as is typical for ISO 9000 certification and re-certification processes) may delay the submission of the documentation set to the certifying body and increase the resulting cost of the certification process.","The S\/T\/S control A may also provide functionality that allows the user to build a search query based on multiple criteria rather than on single criteria or simple keywords. As a result, a user could build a complex query to answer very particular questions regarding their project, such as the status of particular portions of the project (e.g., the progress of the electricians in wiring the 7floor of a building with CAT-5E network cables) or particular people\/project roles.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0520","num":"0792"},"figref":"FIG. 15H","b":["1599","1599","1440"]},"It is worth noting that the user options provided by certain controls in this area of the search query builder  may be dynamically populated based on user selections in other controls. For example, the UI element selected by the user for the Target control may cause particular event types to be populated in the \u201cWhat\u201d (i.e., UI element) control. Alternatively, a user's choice to build a search tailored for only certain project type (such as LEED certification projects) may result in other controls in the query builder  being pre-populated with timelines, roles and\/or events relating only to the user's selected project type. In this way, the query builder  can interact with the user to help him or her build a better query.","Another set of controls that allow the user to build a query using more specialized criteria is provided along the right side. In particular, the user is provided with the ability to create individual conditions for a query based on particular terms, values and\/or keywords. For example, the first condition of the query illustrated in  requires the project label contain the phrase \u201cUniversity Library Addition\u201d, while the second condition requires the name of the project owner be \u201cLarry Smith\u201d.","Those skilled in the art will see that the two query conditions described above are connected by a Boolean operator (AND) that requires that events found by the query must match both conditions (i.e., the event's project label includes \u201cUniversity Library Addition\u201d and the owner is Larry Smith), although other Boolean operators (such as OR and\/or NOT) could also be used. As Boolean operators are believed to be known in the art, no further description regarding them need be provided here.","As the user builds and adds conditions for her or her query, a textual representation of the resulting query appears in search query builder , which may be seen in  as the area marked \u2018Filters\u2019. Providing a textual representation of the query may allow a user to troubleshoot a query that is not working as expected. For example, if a query is supposed to include certain events that are in fact being excluded from the set of results, the user can review the text of the query in the Filter area to see if the query is being interpreted by the system  differently than expected.","In addition, each of the conditions described above require that a prospective event found by the query includes keywords, values or terms specified by the user. However, it is also possible that a user could specify keywords, values or terms to be excluded from search results, such as finding all events that do not include the terms \u201cUniversity Library Addition\u201d and \u201cLarry Smith\u201d.","Furthermore, it is possible that a user could create a query with the query builder  that includes more than one specialized criteria for each condition. For example, a user could add a second line to the second condition in the query builder  illustrated in  to identify a second project owner (i.e., someone other than Larry Smith) whose events should be included in the search results. When this query is executed, events for Larry Smith and this specified individual that belong to the University Library Addition project will be included in the search results.","Although the main function of the search query builder  is to allow a user to build relevant queries for his or her own work, the builder  also provides the user with the ability to save and retrieve queries in order to re-run them later. For example, once the user creates the query, he or she would use a Save control within the builder  (which may be represented by a button or a hyperlink) to save the query within the system  with a particular name or designation. The saved query could then be retrieved by the user at a future date, which would reload that query's particular criteria and\/or conditions into the builder .","The save functionality of the search query builder  described above may allow a user to save the query for his or her own use. However, it will be appreciated that this is not an absolute requirement for saved queries. More specifically, a query created within the builder  may be saved at several different levels within the system, including at an individual level, at a group level (i.e., a query for a specified group of users within the user community ), at a project level (i.e., a query for all users working on a project) and at the community level (i.e., a query that is made available to the entire user community ).","Furthermore, the search query builder  may also allow queries to be saved (i.e., associated) with certain events in the system . As a non-limiting example, an individual may use the query builder  to generate a query to extract information from a standard timeline event that he or she uses in each project. The user could then \u2018save\u2019 the query with the timeline so that when he or she uses this timeline for the next project, the query will be automatically available for use.","The search query builder  also allows saved queries to be transferred between and\/or reassigned to particular users of the system . For example, assume that a first user (e.g., a senior project manager) creates the query illustrated in  in order to collect and review the tasks and events associated with Larry Smith's contribution on the University Library Addition project. This first user saves the query as \u201cL Smith\u2014Status Query\u201d and assigns it to a second user (e.g., a junior project manager) who is responsible for Larry Smith's work. As a result, the second user can recall and re-execute the query designed by the first user in order to monitor the status of Larry Smith's tasks on the project, even if this user's knowledge of query creation the query builder  is either limited or non-existent.","In addition, the query assignee can use the assigned query as a template for creating more specialized queries that may not have occurred to the query assigner. For example, the project manager responsible for Larry Smith's work on the University Library Addition project may adjust the query in order to see certain types of tasks assigned to Larry Smith so that he or she can ascertain whether this employee\/contractor\/sub-contractor is being overworked.","The result set generated by a query (such as one developed using the aforementioned search query builder ) displays a list of events that can be used for the basis of a report. For example, a user can quickly create a report showing his or her project-related tasks for the next day, week and month in order to keep himself or her-self on track with regards to the project. Alternatively, the user can generate a report showing completed events to submit with an invoice to be paid for their work.","The flexibility of the search query builder  allows a user considerable latitude in the information that can be extracted from the system  for a report. However, the generation of reports from the system , and more specifically from the Project database  and the User Profile database , is not altogether dissimilar from the reporting functionality provided by other database systems. Because it is believed that such reporting functionality is well-known in the art, further description and\/or examples need not be provided here.","In addition, reports that are generated by a single person may be shared with and reviewed by a group of people, not all of whom may be users of the system . For example, the project manager for an office building may generate a weekly status report showing completed events for the general contractor and the bank executive responsible for the project's financing. Although the general contractor may be a user of the system , the bank executive might not be.","To allow the distribution of reports to users outside of the system , reports generated via query results can be exported in other file formats, such as Microsoft Word or Excel files. In this case, the project manager and\/or general contractor could generate the weekly status report as an Excel spreadsheet that is sent to the bank executive.","The S\/T\/S control A may also provide a history feature that records all searches performed by a user, as well as provides the user with the ability to save and re-submit searches to the system . For example, assume that a user create a search using the search functionality in the S\/T\/S control A that shows him only a certain type of event (e.g., tasks) which will be due in the coming week (7 days). Rather than having to recreate this search in the S\/T\/S control A every week, the user may save the search in the history feature with a descriptive title (e.g., \u201cMy coming week tasks\u201d) that allow him to simply resubmit the search on a weekly basis. Being able to save searches in this way allows a user to save time as he or she does not need to recreate the search criteria each time.","Alternatively, the history feature in the S\/T\/S control A may also be used in an auditing context. For example, certain events performed by the user in the system , such as the acceptance of a role, completion of a task, sending of a message or accessing of a file for a document event may be recorded by the system . In certain cases, this information may be provided by the S\/T\/S control A to allow a first user to review the activities performed by the same user, or more likely, by another user who reports to the first user.","During normal use of the system, a user may perform a variety of activities via the UI elements  to  described above. For example, the user may review his or her projects in the projects UI element , identify and\/or update certain tasks or events in the Time UI element , create and\/or respond to messages in the media\/messaging UI element , and contribute his or her knowledge to a community of practice in the Community UI element .","Although the user may perform a plurality of activities, it is possible that work on certain of these activities may be interrupted or postponed as a result of a planned or unplanned interruption. For example, a user may be working on creating sub-tasks for a task when he or she is interrupted by a telephone call. Alternatively, the user may begin work drafting an email to a project team member when he or she is called away to a meeting or site visit. In such cases, there is a likelihood that the user will forget that he or she started on such an task or activity before being interrupted or called away.","To protect the user against such interruptions to his or her work, the system  provides the so-called \u2018Unfinished Messages, Tasks and Documents\u2019 (UM\/T\/D) control B in the control . In general, the UM\/T\/D control B displays the number of unfinished tasks messages or documents that the user has started in the system  but has not completed, such as marking a task as being \u2018DONE\u2019 via the adjustment controls .","Like the S\/T\/S control A, the UM\/T\/D control B is a clickable element (such a button or hyperlink) that displays an interface when used.  shows a non-limiting example of an interface displayed by use of this control.","In particular when the UM\/T\/D control B is used, an interface is displayed that shows a set of expandable event indicators . Each indicator in this set represents one task, event or message that the user begun or opened that has not yet closed or sent. The indicators in the set  may be presented as icons, as shown in the . Clicking one such icon displays an interface  that is broadly similar to the interface used in the UI element for the task, event or message. For example, the unfinished message represented in the interface  includes a subject heading, a field for the recipient (i.e., the \u201cTo:\u201d field), a field for the entry of text and a Send button to send the message (and subsequently remove it from the number of unfinished tasks, events and\/or messages represented by the value associated with the UM\/T\/D control B)","In the non-limiting example shown in , each unfinished task, event and\/or message in the interface  was represented by a clickable icon. However, alternative ways of representing these items may be associated with the UM\/T\/D control B, including text entries in a so-called \u2018crawl\u2019 that would appear along the top, bottom or side of the UI .","The New Events (NE) control C may be used to indicate to the user any newly arrived messages, which may include recently assigned tasks and\/or events. As with the UM\/T\/D control B, the NE control C is a clickable element (such a button or hyperlink) that displays an interface when used. In particular, the use of this control may display an interface that is broadly similar to the interface  illustrated in . However, this interface would display new events, such as unread messages, timelines and\/or tasks, rather than those which are currently considered unfinished or not completed. Since the interface  has already been described in the context of the UM\/T\/D control B, no further discussion of this interface need be provided here.","As described above, use of the controls A, B and C each control the display of a particular interface, non-limiting examples of which are respectively illustrated in . It will be appreciated that the interfaces displayed through the use of these controls are relatively independent of the other UI elements in the UI , namely the projects UI element  through the community UI element .","In one non-limiting embodiment of the controls  (and more specifically the three controls comprised within the above), the use of this control may dictate the placement of the associated interface relative to the UI  in addition to displaying the interface. For example, clicking the S\/T\/S control A may display the interface  described previously, as well as identify where relative to the UI  this interface appears.","In a non-limiting example, the first click of the S\/T\/S control A may display the interface  at or around the left-side of the UI , a second click of this control may display the interface  at or around the right-side of the UI , while a third click of the same control may hide the interface  altogether. Controlling the display of the associated interface in this way allows the user to quickly learn and control the display and placement of the interface associated with any of the controls A, B and\/or C.","For example, the user may choose to display the interface  associated with the S\/T\/S control A along the left-hand side of the UI  while displaying the interface  for the UM\/T\/D control B along the right-hand side of the UI . Furthermore, the user could choose to keep the interface (not shown) associated with the NE control C hidden until such time that he or she is ready to review these new events.","Those skilled in the art will also appreciate that the cycling action described above could apply to any associated interface that is displayed relative to the UI , including alternative embodiments. For example, if the unfinished messages were initially displayed in a crawl, clicking the UM\/T\/D control B a first time may cause the crawl to appear along the top of the UI  (such as between the controls  and ), while a second click of the same control may cause the crawl to appear along the bottom, below the UI elements. A third click of the same control may cause the crawl to disappear entirely from the UI . By combining the display of the interface associated with the control with the ability to place this interface on the UI, the user is relieved of having to perform these actions separately (i.e., display the control and then place the resulting interface on the UI), which may improve the overall efficiency and productivity of the user.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0550","num":"0822"},"figref":"FIG. 16","b":["10","14"]},"At step , the user logs into the system  via the authentication UI . In particular, the user enters his or her authentication credentials (e.g., email address and password) in the fields  and  described previously and then clicks the login control .","The system , and more specifically, the community management module  compares the user's supplied authentication credentials against those stored in the user profile for the user. If these match, the user is logged into the system . Otherwise, the user is prompted to re-enter his or her credentials in the fields  and .","Once the user is logged into the system , the user interface  is typically displayed with the previously described UI elements  to  available to the user within this interface. The UI  generally remains available until the user chooses to log out of the system at step , which is described below.","Although the intermediate steps between these two terminal points are presented in sequential order, it will be appreciated that this sequence only represents one non-limiting process showing how the system  may be used by a user. In other possible processes, the actions represented by these steps may occur in a different sequence and\/or occur simultaneously, and certain steps may be omitted altogether.","At step , the user reviews his or her projects, scheduled events and\/or messages using the relevant UI elements in the user interface . In particular, the user's review may include (among others):\n\n","Since use of the UI elements ,  and  has been discussed previously, further details of how a user may perform this step using these elements need not be provided here.","Based on this review, the user can assess what work identified by the system  (which may include tasks, meetings, communications, travel or other events) he or she can and\/or should work on. In addition, the user may also determine what work identified by the system  that can and\/or should be postponed or reassigned to another user.","At step , the user organizes his or her work using the elements in the user interface . For example, the user may choose to jog the date for certain tasks ahead by a week to allow certain other (potentially inter-dependent) tasks to be completed. For example, if a task for a user includes producing a three-dimensional animated walkthrough of a building but the computer-assisted design (CAD) files are not completed, the user may choose to jog the date for this task to after the estimated completion date for the CAD files.","During this step, the organization of events by the user may impact the schedule of other users in the system  thus affecting their ability to collaborate on shared work. For example, the jogging of the date to produce the animated 3D walkthrough may affect other users that may not be immediately known to the user. Examples of such users may include the video producer who is scheduled to use the animation in a TV commercial for the building project, as well as the voiceover talent who is scheduled to record the narration for the commercial.","As a result, the user can consider alternative possibilities for doing the work represented by the events and\/or make the necessary arrangements with other users to allow the events to be moved. For example, the user may simply contact (i.e., send a message via the message UI ) to the video producer and voiceover talent asking them if it would be OK to delay their work for a few days.","At step , the user performs the work that was identified by the system  and which the user organized in the previous step. It will be appreciated that the execution of this work may occur through the functionality the system  (such as by composing and\/or replying to a message via the message UI element ) or may occur outside of the system  altogether (e.g., an HVAC technician travelling to a client site to maintain the filters in an air conditioning unit).","Regardless of whether the user's work is performed through the system  or outside of it, it will nonetheless be appreciated that the system  allows the user to identify his or her work to be performed (and\/or work which can be postponed), as well as provide a platform to allow the work to be performed collaboratively with other users of the user community .","At step , the user reports on the work that he or she performed through the system . For example, the user may update the status of certain tasks in the time messaging UI to \u2018Task Complete\u2019 by using the Done button in the adjustment controls  described previously. By reporting to the system  on the work that he or she performed, the user may produce results that include:\n\n","It will be appreciated that use of the system  by the user to record the performance of his or her work frees the user from having to record this work himself or herself with a second- or third-party (although such recording may still be necessary). In addition, any work scheduled for other users that is dependent on the current user can be allowed to proceed by the system  instead of having to wait for the user to alert the other users of this fact.","Moreover, the recording of work performed by all of the users working on a project team allows the generation of a general audit trail for the project itself. The provision of such an audit trail may be necessary for a project to achieve and\/or maintain a particular certification or certification level.","For example, the maintenance of LEED certification for a building may require the maintenance company to submit documentation showing the performance of certain work tasks to a third-party certification body on a regular basis (e.g., annually or semi-annually). By recording the performance of this work with the system , the needed documentation can be generated from the system  in order to maintain the LEED certification of the building with the third-party certification body.","At step , the user logs out of the system. In one non-limiting embodiment, the user may use a clickable control such as the logout control  that indicates to the system  when the user is finished.","Alternatively, the system  may log the user out after a defined period of inactivity, such as after 15 minutes of inactivity. In such an alternate embodiment, the user may simply close the user interface  (or the associated application used to display this interface, such as a web browser or smartphone application) without having to indicate to the system  that he or she is finished beforehand.","The collaboration system  may also be provided with certain functionality that allows it to review and\/or learn from user actions taken and\/or contributions made during a project. More specifically, the system  may be provided with a learning facility that analyzes and identifies certain best practices (or certain lessons to avoid) based upon contributions made by user in the user community  as they work on projects and\/or perform tasks. In certain cases, this facility may allow the system  to refine its existing workflow with such best practices to benefit the users in the user community  who might otherwise not be aware of and\/or implement such practices.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0570","num":"0848"},"figref":"FIG. 17","b":["1710","1720","1730"]},"The set of user input  may represent data generated by users in the user community  as they use the system . In this regard, the input  may include data generated by users of the community  during:\n\n","The knowledge builder module  may be invoked by the projects module  to analyze the set of user input  and generate the set of adaptation data . Typically, this module comprises certain logic that allows the input  to review and analyze the data comprised within this dataset to identify certain relevant or noteworthy events that may indicate a best practice (or lesson learned) that can be captured and\/or integrated within a workflow to improve the development and\/or management of future projects within the system . The composition and operation of the knowledge builder module  will be described in more detail below.","The set of adaptation data  represents the output of the knowledge builder module  after it has reviewed and analyzed the data from the set of user input . The adaptation data  may include best practices and\/or lessons learned that were identified and\/or extracted by the module  during its analysis. The set of adaptation data  may be used by the system  (and more specifically, by the building project module ) to refine and improve future projects initiated by members of the user community .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0574","num":"0856"},"figref":"FIG. 18","b":["1720","1720","1722","1724","1726","1720"]},"The event analysis sub-module  can be used to review and sort through the set of user input  in order to identify certain known events or occurrences from this incoming dataset. In a non-limiting embodiment, the sub-module  may be configured with a predefined \u2018watch list\u2019 of certain events that need to be identified within the input , such as that indicating the completion of a particular task. For example, the sub-module may be instructed via its watch list to identify the completion of a milestone (task) signifying the end of the design phase events  in the projects database . As a result, when the milestone identifying the completion of all design phase events , for the project is reached, the event analysis sub-module  can identify this task from the set of user input  that may include other information.","Alternatively, the event analysis sub-module  may be provided with certain functionality to filter and\/or classify events in the set of user input  based on a hierarchy or taxonomy that allows their relative importance to be judged. For example, assume that the sub-module  is configured to identify the completion of following events from the input  and rank them based on the following hierarchy:\n\n","Based on the above classification system, the event analysis sub-module  is able to classify events comprised within the set of user input  to identify only those events included in the hierarchy. In addition, the sub-module  is able to rank identified events according to their hierarchy level in order to determine their relative importance. Having the ability to perform such a ranking operation may allow the knowledge builder module  to more efficiently process events in the set of user input , since the event analysis sub-module  will know which events in the incoming dataset are of relatively higher and lower priority.","The statistical analysis sub-module  can be used to perform statistical analyses upon particular events in the set of user input  identified by (and\/or extracted from) by the event analysis sub-module . The sub-module  may perform certain mathematical and statistical calculations on the values represented in the identified events to compare them against known values for similar events in the projects database  in order to determine whether they may represent a best practice (or a lesson learned).","For example, assume that the event analysis sub-module  identifies and extracts tasks relating to the completion of construction phase events , for a particular project in the projects database  from the set of user input . These extracted events are then provided to the statistical analysis sub-module  for analysis and comparison to known completed construction phase events in the projects database  for similar projects. The sub-module  may then perform statistical analysis upon the values in these tasks, such as determining the variation between each event in the construction phase events , and similar instances of the construction phase events  for other projects. Analysis performed by the sub-module  upon the events may include calculations of standard deviation, analysis of variance (ANOVA) and\/or determination of confidence levels, among others.","For example, assume that the statistical analysis sub-module  analyzes the construction phase events against those events in the existing projects database  via an ANOVA variance analysis. The results of the ANOVA analysis indicate that the actual duration of the tasks in the construction phase events are significantly less than those for similar events  known in the database . Assume that further analysis of the events by the sub-module  indicate that the source of the efficiency gain is the reordering of certain tasks in the events that remove a key dependency and therefore mitigate a particular bottleneck that is known to affect projects of this type.","Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the statistical analysis sub-module  could perform any calculation (statistical or not) that allows the determination of whether one or more extracted events represent a significant variance or deviation from those already known to the knowledge builder module  and to the system  in general. It will be further appreciated that the analysis performed by this sub-module can allow the determination of whether the significant variance or deviation is positive in nature (i.e., represents a realized improvement in efficiency and\/or cost-savings) or is negative in nature (i.e., represents a mistake, an inefficiency and\/or a cost overrun).","Typically, events analyzed by the statistical analysis sub-module  whose deviation or variance from the established norm in the project database  are positive in nature may represent a \u2018best practice\u2019 that could be adopted in other projects to realize similar efficiencies and\/or cost-savings. Likewise, events analyzed by the sub-module  that are negative in nature may represent a \u2018lesson learned\u2019 that should be avoided in other projects to prevent similar mistakes, inefficiencies and\/or cost-overruns from occurring. In the example mentioned above, the analysis of the events by the sub-module  indicated that a reordering of certain tasks in the construction phase events  may mitigate a bottleneck and result in improved efficiency (i.e., a best practice).","While the identification of best practices and\/or lessons learned by the event analysis and statistical analysis sub-modules  and  may be of interest, the information gleaned from such events need to be integrated as within the workflow provided by the system  in order to be of use to the user community . Through such integration, users in the community  may be provided with so-called \u2018actionable intelligence\u2019 that allows a user to make better decisions regarding his or her project(s).","In this regard, the adaptation data generator sub-module  can be used to convert the results from the statistical analysis sub-module  into data that can be integrated into the system , and more specifically into the events, tasks and workflows of the projects module . As an example, assume the analysis of the statistical analysis sub-module  that reordering certain tasks in the construction phase events  results in the realization of improved efficiencies is determined to be a useful enough best practice that it should be incorporated in all future projects of a similar type.","Once such a determination is made (which may be automatic or manually performed), the adaptation data generator sub-module  may generate data that will cause the projects module  to reorder the sequence of the construction phase events  for all future projects of a similar type. This data is output from the knowledge builder module  as adaptation data .","It may be appreciated that the output adaptation data generator sub-module  (and of the knowledge builder module  in general) may not cause the best practice(s) and\/or lesson(s) learned to be immediately adopted by the system . For example, it is possible that certain best practices and\/or lessons learned generated by the module  may apply to situations that are very specific to particular rare projects. For example, the analysis by the knowledge builder module  of events relating to the construction, operation and\/or maintenance of a heavily customized geothermal heating and cooling system used to maintain volcanology equipment in a observation center that is located close to an active Icelandic volcano may be so specialized that it could not be applied to or used by other projects.","In the above embodiment, the adaptation data  generated by the adaptation data sub-module  may be used by the system , and more specifically by the projects module . In particular, the data  may be used to improve certain features related to the project templates , such as the composition and\/or ordering of events in one or more templates within the project templates .","However, it is conceivable that the adaptation data  generated by the knowledge builder module  is not used by the system , but rather by a user in order to make a decision regarding a project in the system . In this case, the implementation of the adaptation data  is likely left up to the user's discretion.","For example, assume that several projects in the projects database  included green roofs that were constructed on top of commercial and office developments in hot, semi-arid environments in the American southwest region. In addition, assume the knowledge builder module  analyzed the user input  from events related to the green roof construction for these projects. The analysis (which was encoded as the adaptation data ) suggested that events in the construction phase events  related to installation of the green roof in this environment took an average of 4 days to complete, which may be 25-33% longer than the average for green roofs elsewhere in the United States.","Further assume that a user who has assumed the role of \u2018Green Roof Consultant\u2019 for an office development project located in a suburb of Santa Fe, N. Mex. is adjusting the duration of events related the construction of the green roof for this project in the time UI element . Because the user may be more familiar with constructing green roofs in other, more temperate parts of the United States, she sets the duration of the timeline for the construction of the green roof in this project to 2 days, which conforms to average amount of time needed for the construction of such a roof in her experience.","When the user enters this duration for the construction phase events  related to the green roof, the projects module  may identify that this duration is actually 50% lower than the average amount of time needed to construct a green roof in this area of the U.S. (One non-limiting process that the project module  could use to determine this discrepancy may be to compare the overall duration of the \u2018green roof\u2019 timeline event in the construction phase events for this project to the aforementioned adaptation data, which may be stored in the module  or within the projects database , among other storage options.) When the module  identifies this discrepancy, it may prompt the user to revisit her original construction estimate by providing the adaptation data  in a user-friendly format. For example, the projects module may send the user a message containing a suggestion that might be similar to the following:\n\n","Based on the above suggestion, the user may decide to extend the duration of the timeline based on the information related to the adaptation data  or she may decide to leave her estimate as-is. Regardless of her decision, it will be appreciated that by providing the adaptation data  to the user in this format, the system  allows her to make the final decision regarding the duration of events related to the construction of the green roof in this project.","This use of the adaptation data  may cause the system  (and\/or the projects module ) to appear to function similarly to a decision-support system. However, it will be appreciated that the collaborative features of the system  (such as functionality provided by the community UI element ) allow the Green Roof consultant to verify and validate the system's suggestion with other members of the user community . The ability to draw on collective knowledge of others in the user community  via the system  may be of considerable benefit to this user in deciding how she interprets and\/or implements the adaptation data in her project.","Regardless of the estimated relevance and impact of the best practices and\/or lessons learned generated by the knowledge builder module , it may be useful to store such findings for later review.  shows a knowledge database  that may be accessed by the knowledge builder module  and\/or used to store information by this module.","The knowledge database  may be comprised within the building projects database .

This allows the system  to store all of the best practices and\/or lessons learned generated through the contributions of its users, rather than only those which have been converted into actionable intelligence and integrated into the tasks, timelines and other events provided by the projects module .","Although the objective of the knowledge building module  is to identify best practices and\/or lessons learned from the set of user input  that can be converted to actionable intelligence and implemented via the adaptation data , the storage of less relevant and implementable knowledge in the knowledge database  may provide certain ancillary benefits to the system , and in particular, the user community .","For example, each of the knowledge blocks within the knowledge database  could include a summary of the best practice and\/or lesson learned in a user-friendly format (e.g., text comprising a brief description). In this way, users within the community  could consult the database  in order to learn from past experiences of other users and projects via their best practices and\/or lessons learned. This may allow a user who has not yet participated in a project to learn from the collective experience of those in the community .","Of course, it will be understood that consultation of the knowledge database  by the members of the user community  at large may require that certain operations be applied to the contents of each knowledge block to ensure that the privacy of the participants is respected. For example, the inclusion of user names may be replaced with their generic role, such that any mention of \u201cBob Smith, landscape architect\u201d is replaced with \u201cLandscape architect\u201d.

As before, this step would typically be performed by the knowledge builder module , and in particular, the adaptation data generator sub-module . Since the operation of this sub-module has already been described, further details regarding this step need not be provided here.","The adaptation data generated during step  may result in the integration of this data (i.e., implementation of the adaptation data ) within the system , and in particular, the projects module . In addition, the performance of this step may also result in the generation of a new instance of the knowledge block that is subsequently stored within the knowledge database . In this regard, the results of the process can be stored for later review, consultation and use by either the system  or by members of the user community .","The non-limiting embodiment(s) described above in relation to the collaboration system  and its components have so far been presented from the perspective of a human user of the system who is accessing the system  from a client . However, it will be appreciated that the user of the system  need not be human and in fact, clients of the system  may be other computer systems similar to the computing device  described above.","For example, a company who uses the collaboration system  may use their own software application to access and interact with this system programmatically, rather than through the UI  and its elements. To provide such programmatic access to the system  to other external computer systems, an Application Programming Interface (or API) may be provided to external organizations. The API includes certain programmatic commands that may be passed from an external computing system to the collaboration system  via the network  that allow the system  to respond as if a human user was performing certain actions via the UI . For example, the API may allow an external computing system to access the projects module  and create a new project within the projects database  based on commands rather than through the various interfaces provided through user interface sub-module .","The provision of such an API may allow the organization to use their own in-house applications for certain activities while also deriving advantages provided through use of the collaboration system . For example, assume a particular architectural firm has developed a comprehensive energy calculator application based on their experience. Further assume that this calculator application may use certain inputs that are available for a project in the projects database  to perform its calculations. By using the API for the system , the company may continue to use its in-house energy calculator application while using the collaboration system  to manage its building projects and participate in the user community .","In the above non-limiting example of the API, the API was used by a client  in order to retrieve information from the system  for an in-house application. However, it is conceivable that the same API may also be used to send information from the system  to a client  that is non-human and is similar to computing device  described previously. More specifically, the API may allow the system  to establish a communications link with a client  that could provide a means of sharing information (which may include messages, computer files (such as documents) and\/or computing processes between these two computing devices.","In one non-limiting implementation, the API could provide an external computer system with authentication information or data that would allow a user in the system  to access information stored within that external system. For example, assume that through an agreement, the system  is able to provide the members of the user community  with access to certain resources of a library of a private association, such as scanned or electronic copies of relevant books and conference materials relating to the construction industry, as well as electronic databases containing news and journal articles on construction-related topics.","The library belongs to the private association and likely has legal agreements with other organizations against the general redistribution of its materials. As a result, the library content system responsible for the provision of these resources must somehow verify that each user requesting access is a user who is in fact allowed to access these resources. To provide such validation for a user of the system  who is trying to access these resources, the system  (and more specifically, the registration\/authentication sub-module  of the community management module ) may provide certain authentication data to the library content system via the API.","Such authentication data could be in the form of an encrypted general username and password provided for users of the system , such that a single username and password would work for the entire user community . Alternatively, the authentication data could be provided in the form of an encrypted \u2018handshake\u2019 based on a mathematical formula that allows the user of the system  to appear to the library content system as an authenticated user. Since it is believed that the methods for deriving, transferring and validating authentication data are well known in the art, further details need not be provided here.","It is worth noting in the above example, the entirety of the user community  was assumed to have access to the external resources. However, it is possible that only certain users in the community  may have access to these resources, such as by purchasing a package that allows such access. Alternatively, a user may achieve access to these resources by freely contributing their knowledge to the community  in such a way that they achieve a particular ranking or rating in the opinion of other users (e.g., a \u2018Guru\u2019 or \u2018MVP\u2019 status).","If a member of the user community  who does access to these external resources attempts to access them (e.g., via the library content server), the system  provides authentication data as described above via the API. However, if a member of the community  who does not have access to these external resources attempts to access them, the system  (via the API) may either not provide any authentication data at all, or may provide certain data to the external system that indicates where the user originated. In the latter case, the receiving system (e.g., the library content server) may provide the member with a certain restricted level of access or provide the member with an opportunity to purchase access at a certain price.","Although the above non-limiting implementation described how the system  could authenticate a user to an external resource via the API, it will be appreciated that other methods could also be used to provide such authentication. For example, at the time the user indicates that he or she wishes to access the external resource, the system  could send a message (such as an email message) to a pre-defined address for the external resource. The contents of this message may provide the external resource with the authentication details for the user (such as the username and password indicated above). Upon receipt of such an email, the external resource will be made aware of the user's connection to it, and will thus be ready to allow the user access even though such authentication was not performed via the API.","In another non-limiting implementation of the API, the API could be used to link a project of a first user of the system  with some project-related resource provided for use by a second user of the system . For example, assume that a user who is a software developer has developed a software application that opens the files representing the architectural design of a building (e.g., Autodesk\u00ae Revit\u00ae gbXML files), reviews and determines the building's energy efficiency and makes certain suggestions as to how its efficiency could be increased. Further assume that the application is being offered to users in the user community  via the system . Because the application is proprietary, however, it is maintained on a server (much like the server ) that is external to the system  (and more specifically, the central node ) but is accessible via the network .","Next, assume that a user who is an architect wishes to submit her building designs to this energy-efficiency application to see if the latest iteration of the building is more energy-efficient that the last. Further assume that the user has saved the gbXML files representing her building with a document event, and these files are likely available from the projects database . When the user indicates that she wishes to use the energy-efficiency application via the system  (i.e., from an interface provided by the user interface sub-module  and\/or in the UI ), the projects module  retrieves the gbXML files for the project from the database . The module  may then package these files according to some file format dictated by the API, such as in a compressed file (i.e. Zip or Stuff-It file) with an XML header that describes the file contents.","The system  may then send the compressed file containing the user's building gbXML files to the external software application server via the API. Because the external software application was likely coded with the system's  API in mind, it is able to retrieve and confirm that the file was received correctly. (This action may also result in a message being sent by the system  to the user to inform her that her latest design iteration was submitted successfully.) The software application extracts the user's gbXML files, reviews and determines this iteration's energy efficiency and makes certain suggestions (e.g., in a Word or Excel file) as to how its efficiency could be increased. The resulting files are recompressed into a single compressed file and sent back to the system  by the external server via its API.","When the system  receives the compressed file from the external server, it may alert the user (e.g., via a message) that her energy efficiency results have returned and are available for her review. In addition, the system  may also charge the user a certain amount of money for the service of using the external energy-efficiency application, as well as for preparing, sending and receiving the files associated with this review.","In the example above, the API of the system  allows the user to send his or her gbXML files to the external software application server and receive results from the energy-efficiency application. It will be appreciated that if the developer of the energy-efficiency application charged a fee for use of this application, the system  would likely assess the associated fee and charge the user accordingly on behalf of the developer. At the same time, the system  may reserve a portion of this fee for facilitating the connection between the user and the energy-efficiency application.","In an alternative embodiment, the API may also allow external access to certain data within the system , and more specifically, data within the projects database  and the user profiles database . The use of this data may be provided to aid external developers in developing or refining their templates and\/or applications.","For example, assume that many users of the system  submit their building gbXML files to the energy-efficiency application on the external server via the API. Further assume that the developer of the application has knowledge of the type of buildings being submitted to the application, the results generated for each user by the application as well as the recommendations provided to the user as to how to adjust their building design to improve its energy-efficiency.","However, the developer likely has no knowledge regarding any adjustments to a particular building's design after the results and recommendations from the application were returned to the user. In particular, the developer may want to know if the user ended up adjusting his or her building's design to implement any of the recommendations, and if so, in what way.","This information is stored within the system , likely within the project database . In particular, the database  would contain events (and associated communications) related to the design of each evaluated building that would show adjustments or changes caused by the results\/recommendations delivered by the energy-efficiency application. Having this knowledge could help the developer of the energy-efficiency application improve the application and make it more useful.","To facilitate a flow of this information back to external template and\/or application developers, the API may be provided to allow access to certain data within the projects database  and user profile database . It is likely that data to which an external user would have access would be a) anonymized to protect user privacy and b) aggregated to indicate general trends.","As a non-limiting example, assume that the API allows the developer of the external energy-efficiency application access to data in the projects database , and more specifically, data related to each building project for which gbXML files were sent to the developer's server. The data that may be provided to the developer would likely be aggregate data, such as the average number of events representing design-related changes made to the project before the building design was submitted and the number of design-related changes made after the design was submitted.","Having such an aggregate before-and-after view of projects would allow the developer to see if the number of design changes after the building design was submitted was generally greater than those before submission. If the average number of design changes after submission is greater than those beforehand, the developer may infer that the results and\/or recommendations of the energy-efficiency application indeed caused some changes to generally be made to a building's design.","In yet another non-limiting embodiment, the collaboration system  may be used to help certify the results of a project (e.g., houses in a residential development, an industrial factory, an office building, or a suburban strip mall among others) with a particular certification by a certifying body. In certain cases, the system  may not be used help certify a project's results, but rather may be used to initiate and support the certification process. Certifying bodies include the aforementioned ISO, the Underwriter's Laboratory (UL), the Green Building Certification Institute (GBCI) and the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), among others.","In many cases, being certified by a certifying body for a particular certification (e.g., a building being LEED certified or a quality-assurance process being certified as ISO 9000 compliant) is only a first step in a larger process involving the retention (and\/or improvement) of the recognized certification. For example, once a building becomes LEED-certified, its certification may be reviewed on a regular basis. During such a review, the building may maintain its current certification level, improve on its previous level or even lose its certification altogether.","Since the work required to achieve certification by a certifying body (such as being LEED-certified or achieving ISO 9001 status) typically represents a considerable investment of time, money and other resources, users who are responsible for an accredited project would generally like to ensure that the result (i.e., a building) at least retains its current level of certification, if not improve upon it to move to the next level up.","Certain functionality of the collaboration system  may be used to help the project, and more specifically, the result of the project (which may include a building or other physical construction) achieve certification from a certifying body. In addition, certain functionality of the system  may also help the project retain its certification if the certification process includes periodic reviews.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0634","num":"0934"},"figref":"FIG. 21","b":["302","10","2120","2130"]},"The certification module  may be invoked by the projects module  to analyze the certain information in a project to collect and\/or determine certain information related to certification by a certifying body, such as those described above. Typically this module comprises certain logic that allows input from the projects module  to review and analyze information stored in the projects database  related to certification and certification.","Information that may be reviewed and analyzed for a given project in the database  by the certification module  may include, among others:\n\n","Although the certification module  and the building projects module  have been presented as separate entities, this division was done for illustrative purposes. The functionality of the certification module  described above may be provided through the projects module .","As a result, users who are involved with the certifying body (such as the Green Building Council (GBE) for LEED certification or International Standards Organization (ISO) for ISO 9000\/14000 certification) can use the same system  that is being used by those who are managing and working on the project that is being certified. Centralization around the system  in this way may allow certain efficiencies to be realized, further details about which are provided below.","The certification UI  is a graphical user interface that may be generated by the user interface sub-module  and may appear similar to certain of the interfaces previously discussed, such as the UI . For example, when displayed the certification UI  may appear similar to the UI elements  to  in that it may have a menu (e.g., similar to the menu ) and\/or an associated area (e.g., similar to the projects area ). Alternatively, the certification UI  may appear as a foldout associated with one of the UI elements  to  in a manner to similar to the associated interface C discussed respectively in .","The certification UI  may provide a user with a means of interacting with the certification module . This UI may be comprised of a set of clickable controls including buttons, drop-down lists, checkboxes, radio buttons and\/or text fields, among others. By using these controls, the user can interact with the certification module . For example, assume that the certification module  requires a form containing a notarized copy of the certificate of incorporation for a company so that that a request for a certification review can be submitted to the certifying body. Further assume that due to certain legislation, the system  was only allowed to hold a so-called placeholder (or \u2018dummy\u2019) version of this form while the final version of this form was stored elsewhere. Now, however, the final version of the form has been prepared and certified by a notary public and may therefore be submitted with the request.","Because the system  only holds the dummy copy in the projects database , the certification module  cannot use this copy of the form. Instead, the user configures the certification UI  to direct the module  to the location of the final version of this form containing the notarized copy of the company's certificate of incorporation. In this way, the user can interact with and verify the activity of the certification module  during its certification-related activities.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0642","num":"0946"},"figref":"FIG. 22","b":["2210","10","2210","2220","2220"],"sub":["1","N "]},"Each parameter in the set of certification parameters -likely corresponds to a certain aspect or component of the certification process. For example, in the process wherein a home, building or other construction is accredited as being LEED-certified, this set of parameters may represent the various environmental and other \u2018credits\u2019 that the project must earn in order to achieve this certification. In this case, the set of certification parameters -may include the information provided by the certification body related to each credit.","For example, assume that a LEED credit for a commercial or industrial construction project may be earned by installing secure bicycle storage and changing rooms in a facility for at least 5% of the building's expected occupants. Therefore, one or more parameters in the set of certification parameters -may represent information related to this credit, such as the LEED credit value (i.e., 1 credit) and\/or the documentation required by the certifying body to allow this credit, such as site drawings indicating the location of the secure bicycle storage area and changing facilities.","In certain cases, the certification database  and the set of certification parameters -may comprise information for one or a plurality of available certification programs that may be available for a project in the system . For example, the database  may contain certain parameters in the set of certification parameters -related to the LEED-certification program that is managed by the GBCI, while other parameters may relate to various ISO certification programs (e.g., ISO 9000 or ISO 14001) that are managed by the International Standards Association. In this way, the certification database  may support and assist the project in achieving multiple certification objectives, which otherwise would likely occur independently of each other and possibly require extra time and resources.","It will be appreciated that the set of certification parameters -may also include other information related to each credit in the certification process that is not supplied by the certifying body. In particular, these parameters may include certain information derived from user-generated or contributed information (such as from the user input  described earlier) that relates to the credit. Using the example of the secure LEED credit from bicycle storage and changing rooms mentioned previously, it may be possible that one of more of the parameters -may provide user-contributed information regarding this credit, including but not limited to:\n\n","It will be appreciated that user-contributed information in the set of certification parameters -, such as that described in the non-exhaustive list described above, may or may not be provided by the certification module . In one non-limiting implementation, the knowledge builder module  during its analysis of the user input  may identify user-contributed information relating to one or more parameters in the set of certification parameters -and subsequently update (or cause the update of) these parameters with this information. In this way, the system  may be able to review, update and maintain the certification database .","Alternatively, this information may be contributed by the user community  via the tagging interface  that was described previously with regards to the S\/T\/S control A. For example, a user may tag certain content in the UI interface elements  to  with a tag such as \u201cLEED bicycle storage\/changeroom credit\u201d.

For example, a user may initiate the retrieval of these parameters by the certification module  via controls in the certification UI . Alternatively, the certification module  may retrieve these parameters independently of the user in response to certain information or commands being received from the projects module , such as the indication that a certain event in a project has been completed.","The certification parameters retrieved from the set of certification parameters -at this step generally relate to the certification or certification that the project is trying to achieve, which may be defined by the project's type stored in the projects database . For example, if a project represents a new office building development that is intended to be LEED-certified, the certification parameters retrieved would typically be related to achieving LEED certification for a new commercial development, rather than for a residential development or for modifications to an existing commercial structure.","An indication of what parameters are retrieved from the certification database  may also be provided by the inclusion of certain templates from the project templates  in the project. For example, if the events in a project for a residential development were built using a project template that indicates that it is compliant with a certain LEED certification level (e.g., the LEED Canada for Homes Green Building Rating System), the parameters from the set of certification parameters -retrieved at this step will be related to this certification level.","At step , the certification parameters retrieved from the certification database  during the last step are compared to existing events in the project. This may allow the certification module  to identify whether the project is at a state where the certifying body can review it to determine whether certification can be granted (or re-granted in the case of recertification).","In a non-limiting embodiment, the certification module  may compare the status of project events with those indicated in the retrieved certification parameters. For example, assume that certain tasks are indicated by the parameters as needing to be completed before the certification review may begin. However, assume that upon review of the project events by the module , these tasks are identified as incomplete. In this way, the module  may become aware that the project is not at a state where the certification process can begin.","Alternatively, the certification module  may compare the files (or the state of the files) associated with project events against those identified as being required by the certification parameters to see if the project would qualify for certification. For example, assume that a commercial project is attempting to obtain the LEED credit for the secure bicycle storage and changing facilities identified earlier. Further assume that in order to obtain this credit, the certification parameter indicates that project team must include the architectural drawings (which may be scanned blueprints or Autodesk gbXML files) that indicate the location of the bicycle storage and changing facilities.","As a result, the certification module  looks for files associated with the documentation event(s) related to the site design to identify if these files exist, and if so, what state they are in. Assume that the module  finds that these files are associated with a documentation event but are not listed as being \u2018final\u2019 (i.e., they may still be changed) and that he location of the bicycle storage and changing facilities are not indicated. This comparison may allow the certification module  to determine that the project would not yet qualify for this LEED credit.","It will be appreciated that the above comparison may be performed by the certification module  on a subset of related project events (e.g., only those related to a certain LEED credit) or on all related project events (e.g., those related to the entire certification process). Based on such a comparison, the module  may be able to infer certain conclusions, including:\n\n","This information may help the project team decide whether to contact the certifying body and initiate a review of the project. For example, if the certification module  identifies certain documentation events that are still outstanding (such as the architectural design files that were not finalized), the team may reorganize its work to complete these events. As a result, the step  may incorporate several iterations of the comparison process described above.","It will be appreciated that at a certain iteration of the comparison process described in the previous step, the certification module  may indicate (e.g., via the certification UI ) that the events in the project seem to indicate that the project is ready for review by the certifying body. At this time, the project team may alert the certifying body that it may commence a review of the project (and more specifically, the results of the project).","It will be appreciated that the review process may be communicated through the transfer of certain information between the project team and the certifying body, including:\n\n","The information listed above is referred to here as \u2018compliance data\u2019, in that it generally allows the certifying body (and more specifically, the reviewers to be involved in the review process) to ensure that the project is indeed ready to be reviewed. It will be appreciated that the compliance data listed above constitutes a non-exhaustive list as other information may exist that falls within the scope of the present invention.","At step , compliance data for the project is generated. In a non-limiting embodiment, the certification module  may generate this data based on information associated with the project events compared at the previous step. For example, assume that the compliance data includes a set of required documentation. In this case, the module  may collect (i.e., make copies of) all required documentation files from the documentation events involved at step  and store them in a certain location. Alternatively, the module  may confirm from the event that the documentation exists and compile a checklist of documentation to be generated.","During this step, members of the project team may use the certification UI  to help direct the module  in certain aspects of the preparation of the compliance data. For example, if certain required forms are not stored with documentation events in the system  but are available elsewhere (such as the notarized copy of the company's certificate of incorporation mentioned previously), the certification UI  can be used to identify the location of these forms.","At step , the compliance data is submitted to the certifying body in order that the review of the project by the body may begin. It will be appreciated that in most instances, such compliance data is generally electronic in nature and thus may be transmitted electronically by the system , such as via its API. In this case, generation and submission of the compliance data described in steps  and  may occur roughly concurrently.","In an alternative embodiment, the certifying body may have access to the collaboration system , such as via the previously described API. In such a case, the electronic compliance data that is generated and submitted during the steps  and  may comprise programmatic messages or commands that adjusts certain permissions applied to certain events in the system , which in turn make them available to the certifying body.","For example, assume that the compliance data typically includes a PDF copy of a report that may be hundreds of pages long, which is typically stored with a document event in the system. Rather than sending a copy of the PDF file to the certifying body, the system  may (via the compliance data transferred using API) simply provide members of the certifying body with permissions to the document event that is associated with the report. In this way, the size of the compliance data submitted to the certifying body may be reduced considerably, as only the code required to provide the certifying body with the necessary permission(s) to access the report need be transmitted.","In other embodiments, the compliance data is partially electronic and partially physical in nature (e.g., so-called \u2018hard copies\u2019 of forms, statements, invoices and\/or equipment manuals). In such cases, the data that is electronic is prepared by the certification module  and transmitted by the system, while a list of physical compliance data required may be provided to the project team such that hard-copies of the needed forms and other documentation can be prepared and shipped to the certifying body. In this case, the generation and submission of the compliance data described in steps  and  may occur sequentially.","It will be appreciated that the certifying body may itself be using a collaboration system similar to the system  to organize its work. In such a case, the compliance data submitted during this step may be sent using the API associated with the system  such that when the collaboration system of the certifying body receives this data, its API (which may know of, if not be coded in a similar way to the API of the system ) may cause certain activities to be performed automatically. Such activities may mirror those performed in the system , including:\n\n","It will be appreciated that the above list of mirrored activities is non-exhaustive, as other activities could be included and would fall within the scope of the present invention.","In another non-limiting embodiment, the collaboration system of the project team and of the certifying body may be one and the same (i.e., both groups use the collaboration system  described above). In this case, the performance of step  may simply trigger a new set of events related to the certification review of the existing project in the projects database , rather than involve the performance of the mirrored activities described above.","In such a case, processes similar to those processes previously described with respect to  may occur, albeit for the certification review process. A brief synopsis of such a review process may involve the creation of a review project that may be based on one or more review templates that involve reviewer roles. The review team may be assembled (i.e., the reviewer roles are filled) via issuing open or targeted invitations and the project file may be stored in the projects database .","Furthermore, the process by which the reviewer conducts the certification review of the project may itself be substantially similar to the process described with respect to . More specifically, the review may log into the system  (using an authentication interface substantially similar, if not identical, to the interface ), review his or her review projects, events and messages to be completed and then organize his or her review events and tasks. The reviewer may then perform the review tasks and update the related events using a user interface that may be substantially similar to that described in . Once the reviewer has completed his or her work, he or she may log out of the system  using a logout control that may be substantially similar, if not identical to, the logout control  described previously.","It will be appreciated that because the project team and the reviewers are using the same components of the collaboration system  (namely, the projects module and database  and , as well as the community management module  and the user profile database , among others) the reviewer only needs to be granted permission to access the project in order to begin his or her review process. Once such permission is granted, the reviewer may be seen as becoming a de-facto member of the project team, with similar rights to access the events associated with the project as other team members.","It may be recalled that in a previous non-limiting example, such permission(s) were provided via the generation and\/or submission of compliance data between the system  and the system of the certifying body. In this case, however, the compliance data represents the granting of certain permissions for accessing project events to the reviewers from the certifying body. Therefore, simply generating the compliance data may be sufficient for the reviewers to begin the review process and submission of such data to the certifying body becomes moot.","It is possible that the non-limiting scenario discussed above may allow the reviewer to collaborate with the one or more members of project team during the review process. For example, if the reviewer did not understand a how a certain task event was performed or validated, he or she could send a message (e.g., via the media\/messaging UI ) to the project team member who was responsible for this event. In this way, the time of the reviewer (who is likely responsible for a plurality of projects) may be better used and the certification process may be made more efficient overall.","The above non-limiting embodiments show how both the project team and review team may use the system  in substantially similar ways and to achieve similar objectives. In this way, the process by which a project is designed, organized and maintained, as well as by which it is reviewed and receives certification, may be simplified and made more efficient. Since the amount of time, money and other resources devoted to such processes are not inconsequential, the realization of such efficiencies will likely produce cost reductions in these projects.","For example, use of the system  by both the project team and the certifying body may help the latter information may assist the project team in identifying tasks or events that require additional attention and\/or resources before the certification process may begin. At the same time, this information may also assist the certification body in predicting which of the projects in the projects database  are close to entering the certification process. By allowing the certification body to identify projects that are close to entering the certification process, a more accurately prediction when certain resources (such as project reviewers in general, or certain specialized reviewers in particular) may be needed, as well as when and where certain bottlenecks may appear, can be made.","In a non-limiting example, assume that a certification process requires the activities of a civil engineer with certain specialized knowledge, such as that regarding the efficient and environmentally-friendly disposal of wastewater and storm water from a development. Further assume that the certifying body has only two (2) such civil engineers as reviewers on its permanent staff but may be able to hire another two (2) such engineers on contract as the need arises. If the certification body can identify from the system  those project that are close to entering the certification process, then the workload of the existing civil engineers can be estimated beforehand. Such information may also allow the certifying body to determine whether the services of the two (2) additional contract engineers will be needed to deal with the expected increased workload, and if so, for how long.","Although various embodiments have been illustrated, this was for the purpose of describing, but not limiting, the invention.
