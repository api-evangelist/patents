{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATIONS","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 60\/100,452, filed Sep. 15, 1998, entitled \u201cAnnotations for Streaming Video on the Web: System Design and Usage\u201d, to Anoop Gupta and David M. Bargeron.","This invention relates to networked client\/server systems and to methods of annotating multimedia content in such systems. More particularly, the invention relates to creation and notification of new annotations via electronic mail.","The advent of computers and their continued technological advancement has revolutionized the manner in which people work and live. One such advancement is that of multimedia presentations, where presentations that used to be made in person (e.g., college lectures, workplace training sessions, etc.) can be provided to a computer user as multimedia data (e.g., video, audio, text, and\/or animation data). Today, such presentations are primarily video and audio, but a richer, broader digital media era is emerging. Multimedia presentations provide many benefits, such as allowing the presentation data to be created at a single time yet be presented to different users at different times and in different locations throughout the world.","These multimedia presentations are provided to a user as synchronized media. Synchronized media refers to multiple media objects that share a common timeline. Video and audio are examples of synchronized media\u2014each is a separate data stream with its own data structure, but the two data streams are played back in synchronization with each other. Virtually any media type can have a timeline. For example, an image object can change like an animated .gif file, text can change and move, and animation and digital effects can happen over time. This concept of synchronizing multiple media types is gaining greater meaning and currency with the emergence of more sophisticated media composition frameworks implied by MPEG-4, Dynamic HTML, and other media playback environments.","The term \u201cstreaming\u201d is used to indicate that the data representing the various media types is provided over a network to a client computer on a real-time, as-needed basis, rather than being pre-delivered in its entirety before playback. Thus, the client computer renders streaming data as it is received from a network server, rather than waiting for an entire \u201cfile\u201d to be delivered.","Multimedia presentations may also include \u201cannotations\u201d relating to the multimedia presentation. An annotation is data (e.g., audio, text, video, etc.) that corresponds to a multimedia presentation. Annotations can be added by anyone with appropriate access rights to the annotation system. These annotations typically correspond to a particular temporal location in the multimedia presentation and can provide a replacement for much of the \u201cin-person\u201d interaction or \u201cclassroom discussion\u201d that is lost when the presentation is not made \u201cin-person\u201d or \u201clive\u201d. As part of an annotation, a user can comment on a particular point, to which another user (or lecturer\/presenter) can respond in a subsequent annotation. This process can continue, allowing a \u201cclassroom discussion\u201d to occur via these annotations.","However, in order to gain wide range acceptance of multimedia presentations and the use of annotations with such presentations, a user-friendly manner for interacting with the presentations should be available.","Additionally, it would be useful to be able to notify individuals when new annotations are added. In some systems, the author or other \u201cowner\u201d of a multimedia presentation can be notified by electronic mail (email) whenever someone adds a new annotation to the presentation. However, there are several problems with such systems. One such problem is that the author or creator of the annotation has no control over (or perhaps even knowledge of) who is being notified of the new annotation. Another problem is that in order for the author\/owner of the presentation to view the annotation or to access the multimedia presentation, the author\/owner must manually access the multimedia presentation and manually locate the portion corresponding to the new annotation.","The invention described below addresses these and other disadvantages of current annotations systems, facilitating annotation creation and notification via email.","A network system includes a client computer that can present multimedia content to a user and an annotation server that can transmit, to the client computer, annotations for the multimedia content. Users are presented with annotations generated by other users and can create their own annotations that can be presented to others. Users can be notified of new annotations by electronic mail (email), and can also create new annotations by email.","According to one aspect of the invention, a user creating a new annotation can identify one or more other users that are to be notified, by email, of the new annotation. Users to be notified by email can be identified manually by the annotation author, or alternatively a default user(s) to be notified by email can be associated with the media content. Additionally, group identifiers can be used to identify groups of users to be notified of the new annotation by email.","According to another aspect of the invention, an email message notifying a recipient of a new annotation also includes a user-selectable link for the temporal segment of multimedia content corresponding to the annotation. Upon receipt of the email message, the recipient can select the link and have the media server present, to the user, the temporal segment of multimedia content that corresponds to the annotation.","According to another aspect of the invention, a recipient of an email message notifying the recipient of a new annotation can create another new annotation by replying to the email message. The recipient can enter the new annotation content and select the \u201creply\u201d option from his or her electronic mail application. Selection of the \u201creply\u201d option sends the reply email message to the annotation server, which creates another new annotation using the content entered by the recipient.","According to another aspect of the invention, a new email message can be generated that includes the content for a new annotation but that is not in response to an email notification of a new annotation. This new email message includes the content for the new annotation as well as information that can be used by the annotation server to create a new annotation. Examples of such information include the multimedia content to which the new annotation corresponds, and the temporal range of the media content to which the new annotation corresponds.","According to another aspect of the invention, one or more annotations can be created by forwarding an email thread to the annotation server. Upon receiving an email thread, including multiple email messages that were forwarded or replied to by various users, the annotation server creates a new annotation including all of these email messages. Alternatively, a separate annotation for each email message in the thread may be created.","General Network Structure",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["10","11","12","13","15","16"]},"Streaming media server computer  has access to streaming media content in the form of different media streams. These media streams can be individual media streams (e.g., audio, video, graphical, etc.), or alternatively can be composite media streams including two or more of such individual streams. Some media streams might be stored as files in a database or other file storage system, while other media streams might be supplied to the server on a \u201clive\u201d basis from other data source components through dedicated communications channels or through the Internet itself.","There are various standards for streaming media content and composite media streams. The \u201cAdvanced Streaming Format\u201d (ASF) is an example of such a standard, including both accepted versions of the standard and proposed standards for future adoption. ASF specifies the way in which multimedia content is stored, streamed, and presented by the tools, servers, and clients of various multimedia vendors. Further details about ASF are available from Microsoft Corporation of Redmond, Wash.","Annotation server  controls the storage of annotations and their provision to client computers . The annotation server  manages the annotation meta data store  and the annotation content store . The annotation server  communicates with the client computers  via any of a wide variety of known protocols, such as the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). The annotation server  can receive and provide annotations via direct contact with a client computer , or alternatively via electronic mail (email) via email server . The annotation server  similarly communicates with the email server  via any of a wide variety of known protocols, such as the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP).","The annotations managed by annotation server  correspond to the streaming media available from media server computer . In the discussions to follow, the annotations are discussed as corresponding to streaming media. However, it should be noted that the annotations can similarly correspond to \u201cpre-delivered\u201d rather than streaming media, such as media previously stored at the client computers  via the network , via removable magnetic or optical disks, etc.","When a user of a client computer  accesses a web page containing streaming media, a conventional web browser of the client computer  contacts the web server  to request a Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) page. The client-based browser also submits requests to the media server  for streaming data, and the annotation server  for any annotations associated with the streaming data. When a user of a client computer  desires to add or retrieve annotations, the client computer  contacts the annotation server  to perform the desired addition\/retrieval.","Exemplary Computer Environment","In the discussion below, the invention will be described in the general context of computer-executable instructions, such as program modules, being executed by one or more conventional personal computers. Generally, program modules include routines, programs, objects, components, data structures, etc. that perform particular tasks or implement particular abstract data types. Moreover, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the invention may be practiced with other computer system configurations, including hand-held devices, multiprocessor systems, microprocessor-based or programmable consumer electronics, network PCs, minicomputers, mainframe computers, and the like. In a distributed computer environment, program modules may be located in both local and remote memory storage devices.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["20","20","10","13","15","1"]},"Computer  includes one or more processors or processing units , a system memory , and a bus  that couples various system components including the system memory  to processors .","The bus  represents one or more of any of several types of bus structures, including a memory bus or memory controller, a peripheral bus, an accelerated graphics port, and a processor or local bus using any of a variety of bus architectures. The system memory includes read only memory (ROM)  and random access memory (RAM) . A basic input\/output system (BIOS) , containing the basic routines that help to transfer information between elements within computer , such as during start-up, is stored in ROM . Computer  further includes a hard disk drive  for reading from and writing to a hard disk, not shown, a magnetic disk drive  for reading from and writing to a removable magnetic disk , and an optical disk drive  for reading from or writing to a removable optical disk  such as a CD ROM or other optical media. The hard disk drive , magnetic disk drive , and optical disk drive  are connected to the system bus  by an SCSI interface  or some other appropriate interface. The drives and their associated computer-readable media provide nonvolatile storage of computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules and other data for computer . Although the exemplary environment described herein employs a hard disk, a removable magnetic disk  and a removable optical disk , it should be appreciated by those skilled in the art that other types of computer readable media which can store data that is accessible by a computer, such as magnetic cassettes, flash memory cards, digital video disks, random access memories (RAMs) read only memories (ROM), and the like, may also be used in the exemplary operating environment.","A number of program modules may be stored on the hard disk, magnetic disk , optical disk , ROM , or RAM , including an operating system , one or more application programs , other program modules , and program data . A user may enter commands and information into computer  through input devices such as keyboard  and pointing device . Other input devices (not shown) may include a microphone, joystick, game pad, satellite dish, scanner, or the like. These and other input devices are connected to the processing unit  through an interface  that is coupled to the system bus. A monitor  or other type of display device is also connected to the system bus  via an interface, such as a video adapter . In addition to the monitor, personal computers typically include other peripheral output devices (not shown) such as speakers and printers.","Computer  operates in a networked environment using logical connections to one or more remote computers, such as a remote computer . The remote computer  may be another personal computer, a server, a router, a network PC, a peer device or other common network node, and typically includes many or all of the elements described above relative to computer , although only a memory storage device  has been illustrated in FIG. . The logical connections depicted in  include a local area network (LAN)  and a wide area network (WAN) . Such networking environments are commonplace in offices, enterprise-wide computer networks, intranets, and the Internet. In the described embodiment of the invention, remote computer  executes an Internet Web browser program such as the \u201cInternet Explorer\u201d Web browser manufactured and distributed by Microsoft Corporation of Redmond, Wash.","When used in a LAN networking environment, computer  is connected to the local network  through a network interface or adapter . When used in a WAN networking environment, computer  typically includes a modem  or other means for establishing communications over the wide area network , such as the Internet. The modem , which may be internal or external, is connected to the system bus  via a serial port interface . In a networked environment, program modules depicted relative to the personal computer , or portions thereof, may be stored in the remote memory storage device. It will be appreciated that the network connections shown are exemplary and other means of establishing a communications link between the computers may be used.","Generally, the data processors of computer  are programmed by means of instructions stored at different times in the various computer-readable storage media of the computer. Programs and operating systems are typically distributed, for example, on floppy disks or CD-ROMs. From there, they are installed or loaded into the secondary memory of a computer. At execution, they are loaded at least partially into the computer's primary electronic memory. The invention described herein includes these and other various types of computer-readable storage media when such media contain instructions or programs for implementing the steps described below in conjunction with a microprocessor or other data processor. The invention also includes the computer itself when programmed according to the methods and techniques described below. Furthermore, certain sub-components of the computer may be programmed to perform the functions and steps described below. The invention includes such sub-components when they are programmed as described. In addition, the invention described herein includes data structures, described below, as embodied on various types of memory media.","For purposes of illustration, programs and other executable program components such as the operating system are illustrated herein as discrete blocks, although it is recognized that such programs and components reside at various times in different storage components of the computer, and are executed by the data processor(s) of the computer.","Client\/Server Relationship",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["15","10","15","10"]},"Client  includes an HTTP services (HttpSvcs) module , which manages communication with server , and an annotation back end (ABE) module , which translates user actions into commands destined for server . A user interface (MMA) module  provides the user interface (UI) for a user to add and select different annotations and be presented with the annotations. According to one implementation, the user interface module  supports ActiveX controls that display an annotation interface for streaming video on the Web.","Client  also includes a web browser module , which provides a conventional web browsing interface and capabilities for the user to access various servers via network  of FIG. . Web browser  also provides the interface for a user to select particular media streams for presentation. The user can select which one of different versions of multimedia content he or she wishes to receive from media server  of FIG. . This selection can be direct (e.g., entry of a particular URL or selection of a \u201clow resolution\u201d option), or indirect (e.g., entry of a particular desired playback duration or an indication of system capabilities, such as \u201cslow system\u201d or \u201cfast system\u201d). Alternatively, other media presentation interfaces could be used.","Client  further includes an electronic mail (email) agent  and an email interface . Email agent  manages the generation, transmission, receipt, and storage of email messages at client . Email interface  provides the interface for a user to make use of the email services of email agent , including creating, modifying, deleting, responding to, etc. email messages. Email messages can be received by client  from other client computers or servers either directly or indirectly via an email server (e.g., email server  of FIG. ). Additionally, new email messages, including replies to received email messages, can be forwarded to other client computers or servers on network  either directly or indirectly via an email server (e.g., email server ). Any of a wide variety of conventional electronic mail protocols can be used by email agent  to send and receive email messages, such as SMTP.","Annotation server  includes the Multimedia Annotation Web Server (MAWS) module , which is an Internet Services Application Programming Interface (ISAPI) plug-in for Internet Information Server (IIS) module . Together, these two modules provide the web server functionality of annotation server . Annotation server  also includes an HTTP Services module  which manages communication with client . In addition, annotation server  utilizes the Windows Messaging Subsystem  to facilitate communication with email server  of , and an email reply server  for processing incoming email received from email server .","Annotation server  further includes an annotation back end (ABE) module , which contains functionality for accessing annotation stores  and , for composing outgoing email based on annotation data, and for processing incoming email. Incoming email to annotation server  is received and passed to the ABE module  by the Email Reply Server . If the incoming email includes the necessary information to generate an annotation, email reply server  converts the email into an annotation and forwards the annotation to ABE  for adding to annotation stores  and . Annotation content authored at client , using user interface , is received by ABE  and maintained in annotation content store . Received meta data (control information) corresponding to the annotation content is maintained in annotation meta data store .","The annotation content and meta data can be stored in any of a variety of conventional manners, such as in SQL relational databases (e.g., using Microsoft \u201cSQL Server\u201d version 7.0, available from Microsoft Corporation). Annotation server  is illustrated in  as maintaining the annotation content and associated control information (meta data) separately in two different stores. Alternatively, all of the annotation data (content and meta information) can be stored together in a single store, or content may be stored by another distinct storage system on the network  in , such as a file system, media server, email server, or other data store.","Annotation Storage Structure",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3"],"b":["180","10","18","3","180","182","184","186","188","190","192","194","196","198","200","202","182","202","180","180","10","18","192","17"]},"Author field  contains data identifying the user who created annotation entry  and who is therefore the author of the annotation's content. The author is identified by ABE  of  based on the user logged into client  at the time the annotation is created, or alternatively by ABE  based on the sender of an email message.","Time range field  contains data representing \u201cbegin\u201d and \u201cend\u201d times defining a segment of media timeline with which annotation entry  is associated. Time units field  contains data representing the units of time represented in time range field . Together, time range field  and time units field  identify the relative time range of the annotation represented by annotation entry . This relative time range corresponds to a particular segment of the media stream to which annotation entry  is associated. The begin and end times for the annotation are provided by the user via interface  of , or alternatively can be automatically or implicitly derived using a variety of audio and video signal processing techniques, such as sentence detection in audio streams or video object tracking.","It should be noted that the time ranges for different annotations can overlap. Thus, for example, a first annotation may correspond to a segment ranging between the first and fourth minutes of a media stream, a second annotation may correspond to a segment ranging between the second and seventh minutes of the media stream, and a third annotation may correspond to a segment ranging between the second and third minutes of the media stream.","Alternatively, rather than using the presentation timeline of the media content, different media characteristics can be used to associate the annotation with a particular segment(s) of the media content. For example, annotations could be associated with (or \u201canchored\u201d on) specific objects in the video content, or specific events in the audio content.","Creation time field  contains data specifying the date and time at which annotation entry  is created. It should be noted that the time of creation of annotation entry  is absolute and is not relative to the video or audio content of the media stream to which annotation entry  is associated. Accordingly, a user can specify that annotations which are particularly old, e.g., created more than two weeks earlier, are not to be displayed. ABE  of  stores the creation time and date when the annotation is created.","Title field  contains data representing a title by which the annotation represented by annotation entry  is identified. The title is generally determined by the user and the user enters the data representing the title using conventional and well known user interface techniques. The data can be as simple as ASCII text or as complex as HTML code which can include text having different fonts and type styles, graphics including wallpaper, motion video images, audio, and links to other multimedia documents.","Content field  contains data representing the substantive content of the annotation as authored by the user. The actual data can be stored in content field , or alternatively content field  may store a pointer to (or other indicator of) the content that is stored separately from the entry  itself. The user enters the data representing the content using conventional and well known user interface techniques. The content added by the user in creating annotation entry  can include any one or more of text, graphics, video, audio, etc. or links thereto. In essence, content field  contains data representing the substantive content the user wishes to include with the presentation of the corresponding media stream at the relative time range represented by time range field  and time units field .","Annotation identifier field  stores data that uniquely identifies annotation entry , while related annotation identifier field  stores data that uniquely identifies a related annotation. Annotation identifier field  can be used by other annotation entries to associate such other annotation entries with annotation entry . In this way, threads of discussion can develop in which a second annotation responds to a first annotation, a third annotation responds to the second annotation and so on. By way of example, an identifier of the first annotation would be stored in related annotation identifier field  of the second annotation, an identifier of the second annotation would be stored in related annotation identifier field  of the third annotation, and so on.","Set identifier(s) field  stores data that identifies a particular one or more sets to which annotation entry  belongs. A media stream can have multiple sets of annotations, sets can span multiple media content, and a particular annotation can correspond to one or more of these sets. Which set(s) an annotation belongs to is identified by the author of the annotation. By way of example, a media stream corresponding to a lecture may include the following sets: \u201cinstructor's comments\u201d, \u201cassistant's comments\u201d, \u201caudio comments\u201d, \u201ctext comments\u201d, \u201cstudent questions\u201d, and each student's personal comments.","Media content identifier field  contains data that uniquely identifies particular multimedia content as the content to which annotation entry  corresponds. Media content identifier  can identify a single media stream (either an individual stream or a composite stream), or alternatively identify multiple different streams that are different versions of the same media content. Media content identifier  can identify media versions in a variety of different manners. According to one embodiment, the data represents a real-time transport protocol (RTP) address of the different media streams. An RTP address is a type of uniform resource locator (URL) by which multimedia documents can be identified in a network. According to an alternate embodiment, a unique identifier is assigned to the content rather than to the individual media streams. According to another alternate embodiment, a different unique identifier of the media streams could be created by annotation server  of FIG.  and assigned to the media streams. Such a unique identifier would also be used by streaming media server  of  to identify the media streams. According to another alternate embodiment, a uniform resource name (URN) such as those described by K. Sollins and L. Mosinter in \u201cFunctional Requirements for Uniform Resource Names,\u201d IETF RFC 1733 (December 1994) could be used to identify the media stream.","User-defined property fields  are one or more user-definable fields that allow users to customize the annotation system. Examples of such additional property fields include a \u201creference URL\u201d property which contains the URL of a web page used as reference material for the content of the annotation; a \u201chelp URL\u201d property containing the URL of a help page which can be accessed concerning the content of the annotation; a \u201cview script\u201d property containing JavaScript which is to be executed whenever the annotation is viewed; a \u201cdisplay type\u201d property, which gives the client user interface information about how the annotation is to be displayed; etc.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0064"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 3.

Annotation server  dynamically adds, deletes, and modifies annotation entries in annotation database  based on commands from client . Annotation entries can be created and added to annotation database  at any time a user cares to comment upon the content of the stream (or another annotation) in the form of an annotation. Annotation server  forms an annotation entry from identification data, content data, title data, and author data of an \u201cadd annotation\u201d request received from the client's ABE  (FIG. ), and adds the annotation entry to annotation database .","Annotation database  includes a fields , , and  that specify common characteristics of all annotation entries of database  or an annotation collection  or . Alternatively, fields - can be included redundantly in each annotation entry .","Creator field  contains data identifying the user who was responsible for creating annotation database .","RTP address fields  and  contains data representing an RTP address of the media content (e.g., the RTP addresses of each of the different streams contained in version table ) for the annotation collection. An RTP address provides an alternative mechanism, in addition to the data in identifier field  of , for associating the media content with annotation entries . In alternative embodiments, RTP address fields  and  need not be included.","Annotation Notification and Creation","An annotation can be created by a user of any of the client computers  of FIG. . As discussed above with reference to , client  includes an interface module  that presents an interface to a user (e.g., a graphical user interface), allowing a user to make requests of annotation server .

A server identifier  identifies the annotation server with which client  is currently configured to communicate (annotation server  of FIG. . in the illustrated embodiment).","Selection of a connection button  causes ABE  of  to establish a connection with the annotation server identified by identifier . Selection of a query button  causes interface module  to open a \u201cquery\u201d dialog box, from which a user can search for particular annotations. Selection of an add button  causes interface module  to open an \u201cadd new annotation\u201d dialog box, from which a user can create a new annotation.","Selection of a show annotations button  causes interface module  to open a \u201cview annotations\u201d dialog box, from which a user can select particular annotations for presentation.","Selection of a preferences button  causes interface  of  to open a \u201cpreferences\u201d dialog box, from which a user can specify various UI preferences, such as an automatic server query refresh interval, or default query criteria values to be persisted between sessions.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0076","num":"0075"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["260","260","250","6"]},"Dialog box  includes an annotation set identifier , a subject line , and an email field . Annotation set identifier  allows the user to identify a named set to which the new annotation will belong. This set can be a previously defined set, or a new set being created by the user. Selection of the particular set can be made from a drop-down menu activated by selection of icon , or alternatively can be directly input by the user (e.g., typed in using an alphanumeric keyboard). According to one embodiment of the invention, annotation server  of  supports read and write access controls, allowing the creator of the set to identify which users are able to read and\/or write to the annotation set. In this embodiment, only those sets for which the user has write access can be entered as set identifier . Alternatively, rather than (or in addition to) user selection of an annotation set, one or more annotation sets may be inherently associated with dialog box  (or toolbar  of ) and thus implicitly selected for each new annotation.","Subject line  allows the user to provide a short summary or title of the annotation content. Although the subject line is illustrated as being text, it could include any of a wide variety of characters, alphanumerics, graphics, etc. In the illustrated embodiment, subject line  is stored in the title field  of the annotation entry of FIG. .","Email field  allows the user to input the email address of a recipient of the annotation. The email addresses indicated in field  are provided to ABE  of annotation server , which in turn generates an email message including the newly created annotation and sends the email message to the recipient(s) indicated in field  in addition to adding the annotation to the annotation databases. Alternatively, the email message can be sent directly by client  of , or by an intermediary server (such as email server  of FIG. ).","Entries into email field  can be made on an individual or a \u201cgroup\u201d basis. Individual email addresses can be entered directly by the user, or can be selected from a pre-defined list. A list of available email addresses can be made available in any of a variety of conventional manners, such as via a pull-down or drop-down menu, a menu bar option, etc. A pre-defined list of email addresses can be obtained from a variety of different sources. For example, email agent  of  may have an \u201caddress book\u201d or similar listing of email addresses programmed in by the user or other individuals.","In one implementation, user interface  of  can have a list of email addresses associated with it, and\/or the annotation set identified by set identifier  may have a list of email addresses associated with it. These email addresses associated with either the user interface or the annotation set can be automatically entered as \u201cdefault\u201d email addresses, or alternatively can be individually selected by the user (e.g., via a pull-down or drop-down menu).","Additionally, a group identifier can be entered into email field  to identify a group of email addresses. When the user adds an annotation with a group identifier in email field , annotation backend  of  (or alternatively another component, such as email server  of  or annotation backend  of ) forwards an email message of the new annotation to each email address that corresponds to the group identifier. Group identifiers can be defined to correspond to email addresses in any of a variety of manners. For example, user interface  or the annotation set identified by set identifier  may have pre-defined groups associated with them, email agent  of  may have pre-defined groups associated with it, etc.","Dialog box  further includes an annotation type selector in the form of radio buttons , , and , selection of which creates text annotation, an audio annotation, or a uniform resource locator (URL) annotation, respectively. Although not shown, other types of annotations could also be accommodated, such as graphics, video, etc. The content of the annotation is input to annotation field , which is text in the illustrated example of FIG. . Additional input controls (not shown) may also be included depending on the type of annotation being created. For example, conventional audio control buttons (such as fast forward, rewind, play, pause, stop, and record) may be included for audio annotations.","Dialog box  also includes a checkbox  that allows the user to create an anonymous annotation. When checkbox  is selected (as illustrated in FIG. ), the author of the annotation is not stored in author field  of FIG. . Annotation backend  can simply not forward the author information to annotation server  of , or alternatively annotation server  may simply ignore the author information.","Interface  assumes that the current media stream being presented to the user is the media stream to which the new annotation will be associated. The media stream to which an annotation is associated is referred to as the \u201ctarget\u201d of the annotation. An identifier of this stream is displayed in a target specification area  of dialog box . Alternatively, a user could change the target of the annotation, such as by typing in a new identifier in target area , or by selection of a \u201cbrowse\u201d button (not shown) that allows the user to browse through different directories of media streams.","A time strip  is also provided as part of dialog box . Time strip  represents the entire presentation time of the corresponding media stream. A \u201cthumb\u201d  that moves within time strip  indicates a particular temporal position within the media stream. The annotation being created via dialog box  has a begin time and an end time, which together define a particular segment of the media stream. This segment is illustrated as darkened portion  of time strip . When \u201cfrom\u201d button  is selected, thumb  represents the begin time for the segment relative to the media stream. When \u201cto\u201d button  is selected, thumb  represents the end time for the segment relative to the media stream. Alternatively, two different time bars could be displayed, one for the begin time and one for the end time. The begin and end times are also displayed in an hours\/minutes\/seconds format in boxes  and , respectively.","Thumb  can be moved along time strip  in any of a variety of conventional manners. For example, a user can depress a button of a mouse (or other cursor control device) while a pointer is \u201con top\u201d of thumb  and move the pointer along time strip , causing thumb  to move along with the pointer. The appropriate begin or end time is then set when the mouse button is released. Alternatively, the begin and end times can be set by entering (e.g., via an alphanumeric keyboard) particular times in boxes  and .","Dialog box  also includes a \u201cplay\u201d button . Selection of play button  causes interface module  of  to forward a segment specification to web browser  of client . The segment specification includes the target identifier from target display  and the begin and end times from boxes  and , respectively. Upon receipt of the segment specification from interface module , the browser communicates with media server  and requests the identified media segment using conventional HTTP requests. In response, media server  streams the media segment to client  for presentation to the user. This presentation allows, for example, the user to verify the portion of the media stream to which his or her annotation will correspond.","Dialog box  also includes a cancel button , an OK button , and an advanced button . Selection of cancel button  causes interface  to close the dialog box , canceling out of the add new annotation process. Selection of OK button  causes interface  to forward the information entered in dialog box  to annotation backend , which sends the new annotation information to annotation server  of FIG. . Interface  then closes dialog box , the new annotation being entered.","Selection of \u201cadvanced\u201d button  reduces the number of options available to the user, simplifying dialog box . For example, the simplified dialog box may not include fields and buttons -.","As discussed above, when a new annotation is created, an email message is created and sent to each email address identified in email field . The email message is a notification to each of the email recipients (as identified by the email addresses\/groups in field ) of the new annotation.

Host identifier  is an identifier of the host of the media content (e.g., a URL of a web page that displays the media content) concatenated with time range information, and is presented as a user-selectable link to the media content (e.g., a text or graphic hyperlink). The identifier displayed to the user can be the URL of the media content, or alternatively some other text, graphic, video, etc. identifier of the media content. If the user selects the identifier, email agent  of  forwards host identifier  to annotation back end . Annotation back end  forwards host identifier  to web browser  which in turn accesses streaming media server  of  to request the media content and begin playback of the media content to the user. Annotation back end can also access annotation server , using host identifier , to obtain additional annotations corresponding to the media content. Alternatively, email agent  may forward host identifier  directly to web browser .","Host identifier  also identifies the temporal range or segment of the media content with which the new annotation is associated.

The user can then enter in a new annotation via the email interface  (which can be text, audio, video, or any media format supported by the email interface  and agent ). When the user finishes entering the additional annotation, the user selects the \u201csend\u201d option which forwards the reply message to annotation server .

Such email messages can be forwarded from user to user, creating a string of email messages often referred to as an \u201cemail thread\u201d. Such forwarding can be found in numerous settings, such as system designers that carry on \u201cconversations\u201d or discuss various options with one another via such email messages. Thus, an original annotation notification email message can be forwarded around to multiple additional users.
