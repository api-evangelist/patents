{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF INTEREST","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The present inventive concepts relate to the field of systems and methods for sensing wind speed and direction, and more particularly to the field of wind sensors.","Wind sensors have a wide range of practical applications. For example, wind sensors are common at weather stations, airports, and other locations for sensing wind speed and direction. At an airport, as an example, this information is particularly useful in guiding aircraft with respect to take-offs and landings.","An anemometer is one device that is used for measuring wind speed. There are many types of anemometers, such as cup, windmill, and hot-wire anemometers.","In a hot-wire anemometer, a very thin element (having a cross-section on the order of several micrometers) is heated up to a temperature above the ambient. Air flowing past the element has a cooling effect on the element. Since the electrical resistance of most metals is dependent upon the temperature of the metal (tungsten is a popular choice for elements), a mathematical relationship can be obtained between the resistance of the element and the flow velocity. This relationship is well known.","Several ways of implementing a hot-wire anemometer exist, and hot-wire anemometers can be further classified as CCA (Constant-Current Anemometer), CVA (Constant-Voltage Anemometer) and CTA (Constant-Temperature Anemometer). The voltage output from these anemometers is, thus, the result of a circuit within the device trying to maintain constant the specific variable (current, voltage or temperature).","The advantages of thermal anemometry include high accuracy, an easily-automated collection procedure, and a high frequency response allowing measurement of turbulent flows. The use of electrically self-heated resistors, hot wires, and hot films as thermal anemometer transducers is well known in the prior art. These elements, when maintained at constant temperature rise above the ambient, can indicate with precision the direction and magnitude of airflow. This is accomplished electrically by using a servo loop, which senses the error between the voltage divider involving the sensing element and the voltage divider involving a thermistor with a similar temperature coefficient of resistance.","By compensating for ambient temperature changes, the elements are maintained at constant temperature rise above the ambient. Any airflow change across the sensing element requires a change in current through the sensor element to keep it at a constant temperature rise. Platinum wire or depositions of Platinum have been commonly used because of its stability at high temperatures; Platinum has a high temperature coefficient. Since a high temperature coefficient of resistance is required, the material supporting the Platinum needs to have a good high temperature coefficient of resistance as well. Combining the cost of Platinum, the support material, and the sophisticated processes in manufacturing these elements, the costs for producing, using, and maintaining thermal anemometers has been prohibitively high. Combining these considerations with the data processing requirements of such anemometers has made use in the commercial, industrial, and military marketplaces largely impractical.","In accordance with aspects of the present invention, the measurement of wind speed and direction by thermal anemometry is accomplished with high accuracy and at a relatively low cost. For instance, low cost materials can be used with a precision manufacturing process so that wind sensing elements can be built at a significantly lower cost. In accordance with another aspect of the invention, a wind sensor utilizes a calibration array of data in conjunction with linear interpolation to achieve fast and accurate determinations of wind speed and direction. With a combination of low cost microcomputer technology, a pair of low-cost wind sensing elements, an appropriate thermistor and the improved calibration array and processing, a low cost wind sensor system can be achieved that quickly converges on an accurate wind speed and direction.","In accordance with one aspect of the present disclosure, provided is a wind sensor. The wind sensor includes a first element and a second orthogonal element. A storage media has a calibration array comprising first calibration data associated with the first element and second calibration array data associated with second element. And an anemometric processor determines a wind speed (S) and direction (W) for an airflow received by the first and second elements using a change in a first electrical parameter associated with the first element and the first calibration array data and a change in a second electrical parameter associated with the second element and the second calibration array data.","The first element can define an X-axis in an X plane and the first calibration data can be X plane data. And the second element can define a Y-axis in a Y plane and the second calibration data can be Y plane data.","The X plane data can include a plurality of first voltage calibration points V(S,Q) in the X plane and the Y plane data can include a plurality of second voltage calibration points V(S,Q) in the Y plane, where Qis a set of incremental angles with respect to the X plane and Qis a set of incremental angles with respect to the Y plane. Likewise, S is a set of incremental wind speeds.","The first electrical parameter associated with the first element can be a voltage V. And the second electrical parameter associated with the second element can be a voltage V.","A plus or minus sign associated with the incoming airflow for the first element can be a signand a plus or minus sign associated with the incoming airflow for the second element can be a sign. And the anemometric processor can be configured to determine a quadrant of the airflow in an X-Y coordinate system from the signand the signand to find wind speed (S) and direction (W) using X plane data and Y plane data in the quadrant.","The anemometric processor can be configured to determine the wind speed (S) and direction (W) for the airflow by performing linear interpolation to find the common S and W values for measured value V(S,Q\u2248W) in the X plane using the X plane data in the quadrant and measured value V(S,Q\u2248W) in the Y plane using the Y plane data in the quadrant.","In the above case, Q\u2248W and Q\u2248W when the anemometric processor determines a difference between Qand Qto be within an error threshold.","The anemometric processor can iteratively perform linear interpolation using four points in the X plane and four points in the Y plane for one or more of the iteratively performed linear interpolations.","The anemometric processor can be configured to determine the wind direction (W) from Qand Q, when Qand Qare within the error threshold.","The anemometric processor can be configured to determine the wind speed (S) from a speed associated with Qand a speed associated with Q, when Qand Qare within the error threshold.","In accordance with another aspect of the invention, provided is a method of determining wind speed (S) and direction (W) for an airflow received by first and second elements of a cross-wire wind sensor. The method includes providing a calibration data array in a storage media accessible by an anemometric processor, the calibration array comprising first calibration data associated with the first element and second calibration array data associated with second element. The method also includes calculating the wind speed (S) and direction (W) for the airflow using a first electrical parameter associated with the first element and the first calibration array data and a second electrical parameter associated with the second element and the second calibration array data.","The first element can define an X-axis in an X plane and the first calibration data can be X plane data. The second element can define a Y-axis in a Y plane and the second calibration data can be Y plane data. The X plane data can include a plurality of first voltage calibration points V(S,Q) in the X plane and the Y plane data can include a plurality of second voltage calibration points V(S,Q) in the Y plane, where Qis a set of incremental angles with respect to the X plane and Qis a set of incremental angles with respect to the Y plane.
