{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["The present application is related to application Ser. No. 12\/610,992 entitled \u201cSystem For Use In Performance Of Injection Molding Operations\u201d filed on the date of filing of the present application and to application Ser. No. 12\/611,017 entitled \u201cSystem For Use In Performance Of Injection Molding Operations\u201d also filed on the date of filing of the present application. Each of the above applications is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","The invention relates to injection molding operations and specifically to a system for use in performance of injection molding operations.","Injection molding facilities typically include one or more work cells, each comprising an injection molding machine, a mold (typically including a mold cavity and hot runner system), and one or more auxiliary components, e.g., a dryer, a chiller, a robot. Injection molding facilities are in constant change. For example, molds are often moved from work cell to work cell. When production requirements for a particular mold are lowered, it is common to move the mold to a different work cell having an associated injection molding machine with lower capacity. Also, new molds are often introduced into a facility. An existing mold at a particular work cell may be replaced with a new mold. In addition, auxiliary components for a work cell can be changed. Dryers can be moved from work cell to work cell. A new chiller can be introduced into a facility and can be associated with a particular work cell.","Considerable costs are typically associated with a component change in an injection molding facility. If a mold of a work cell is changed, or another component, significant time and effort are often required to make the injection molding assembly disposed in the current work cell operational. In addition, a change to a work cell component, if made in error, can cause damage to a component and\/or failure of a production run.","There is provided a system for use in performance of injection molding operations, wherein the system can include a plurality of injection molding assembly components. In one embodiment, the system can be operative so that various information respecting components of the system can be recorded within a component database. The component database can be a computer implemented database and in one embodiment can be utilized to output information that indicates past and\/or present conditions prevailing within the system.","There is provided a system for use in performance of injection molding operations, wherein the system can include a plurality of injection molding assembly components. In one embodiment, the system can be operative so that various information respecting components of the system can be recorded within a component database. In one embodiment, information that indicates operational injection molding assembly configurations can be recorded within the component database. As part of a functioning of the system, identification information for one or more injection molding components within a work cell can be determined and can be utilized by e.g., display of information indicating an identification of the one or more components, transmitting of communications to the one or more components and\/or recording information indicating an identification of the one or more components. In one embodiment, location information for injection molding assembly components can be recorded to provide component location information within the component database. In one embodiment, operational injection molding assembly configuration information can be recorded along with location information within a component database. The component database can be a computer implemented database and in one embodiment can be utilized to output information that indicates past and\/or present conditions prevailing within the system. The output information can be, e.g., used by an application program interface and\/or can be output for visual observation for indicating one or more of past and\/or presently prevailing conditions of the system.","In development of system  it was determined that long delays are commonly associated with setup of an injection molding assembly. An injection molding assembly typically includes an injection molding machine which controls the flow of molding material, and a mold which temporarily retains the material in the making of the finished product. An injection molding assembly can also include one or more auxiliary components, e.g., a dryer, a chiller, or a robot.","When a new mold is introduced for association to an injection molding assembly, it is often the case that auxiliary components presently associated to the injection molding machine are not compatible with the requirements of the newly introduced mold. Also, a current programming of the injection molding assembly and\/or a current programming of auxiliary components presently associated to the injection molding assembly are not compatible with the requirements of the new mold. Operators have been observed to spend considerable time retrieving compatible auxiliary components, e.g., from facility storage or from work cells of a facility other than the present work cell. Operators have also been observed to spend considerable time in reprogramming the injection molding machine and\/or auxiliary components for operation with the newly introduced mold. In performance of such operations (moving components for association, and reprogramming) an operator typically relies on human memory and experience respecting locations of components and past programming strategies for programming various injection molding assembly components. Reprogramming can be particularly time consuming in reference to the iterative nature of program development and the likelihood of debugging procedures. System  can be provided with features significantly improving the speed with which an injection molding assembly can be set up.","For example, in one embodiment system  can be operative to record information respecting past one or more operational injection molding assembly configuration which information can be queried and utilized in the setting up of a current injection molding assembly within a work cell. Associated with recording injection molding assembly configuration information can be programming data (e.g., setup parameters, executable script code, executable binary code, source code corresponding to executable binary code) associated with various components of various recorded operational injection molding assembly configurations. Such programming data can be utilized for setup of an injection molding assembly with a current work cell. In another embodiment, system  is operative to record location information respecting various components of system . Such information can be queried for returning information indicating a migration of components over time, and\/or for reporting a current location of a given component at a current time. Operational configuration information can be utilized in combination with location information.","In  there is shown a schematic diagram of a system  having various components for use in performance of injection molding operations. In the exemplary embodiment of , system  can include a plurality of injection molding work cells -, -, -, each work cell -, -, - at a different physical location of facility . Each work cell can include a number of injection molding assembly components for use in performing injection molding processes. Each work cell -, -, - can include an injection molding machine, a mold, and one or more auxiliary injection molding assembly components. A mold can include a number of subcomponents such as a mold cavity, a hot runner subsystem (which can include a manifold and one or more nozzles), and a hot runner controller. The auxiliary injection molding assembly components can include such components as a dryer, a chiller, and\/or a robot and possibly additional auxiliary components. In the state as shown in , work cell - includes injection molding machine -, mold -, dryer -, chiller -, and robot -. Work cell - includes injection molding machine -, mold -, dryer -, chiller -, and robot -. Work cell - includes injection molding machine -, mold -, dryer -, chiller -, and robot -. Additional injection molding assembly components -, -, -, -, -, -, -, - that are not currently associated to a particular work cell -, -, - can be located in storage location  of facility . Storage location  can refer to a particular location of facility . Alternatively, storage location  can refer to all areas of facility  other than cells -, -, -.","Components within an injection molding facility  can be subject to repeated location changes as components are switched between work cells or moved into or out of operation. In the example of the facility state as shown in  relative to the facility state as shown in , the mold - previously in work cell - has been moved to work cell -, the mold -, previously of work cell - is moved to work cell -, mold -, previously located at storage location  is removed from storage location  and moved into work cell -, and component -, previously located at work cell - is moved to storage location . In the example of , the locations of auxiliary injection molding assembly components -, -, -, -, -, - are changed between work cells, auxiliary components -, -, - are taken out of operation and located in storage location , and robot auxiliary component - is moved from storage location  into work cell -.","In one embodiment, each of the noted injection molding assembly components can be configured as a component for communication with an external component. For configuring an injection molding assembly component as a component operative for communication with one or more external components, the component can include the elements within dashed in border  described in connection with  including a CPU , a memory , and an I\/O device  connected via system bus . Memory  that is in communication to CPU  via system bus  can be provided by one or more of a volatile semiconductor memory devices (e.g., DRAM) or a non-volatile semiconductor memory device (e.g., a flash memory or a non-semiconductor bulk storage device such as a hard drive, or a magnetic storage device. I\/O device  can be provided by any combination of one or more, e.g., radio frequency network interface device, wireline network interface device or peripheral device communication interface device facilitating communication with an external component, e.g., IEEE 802.11 interface, Bluetooth interface, Ethernet interface, USB interface. An injection molding assembly component configured as a component operative for communication can also include a display  and keyboard  and sensor  for sensing an operational state of a component of an injection molding assembly. Keyboard  can be co-located with display  as in a touch screen (e.g., see workstation computer , ). Display  and keyboard  and sensor  can be in communication with CPU  via system bus . For configuring an injection molding assembly component as a component operative for communication, the component can include an encoded information reader unit such as RFID reader unit  for reading RFID tags of external injection molding assembly components. Where RFID tag reading functionality is incorporated into a network interface device which can be included as part of I\/O interface device , RFID reader unit  can be collocated with I\/O interface device . An injection molding assembly component configured as a component operative for communication can also include an RFID tag  that can be read by an RFID reader unit. RFID tag  can include interface circuit  and memory  for storage of RFID tag data. An injection molding assembly component configured as a component operative for communication can also include a memory drive unit  including interface circuit  and memory . In one embodiment memory drive unit  can be provided by a USB flash drive, wherein interface circuit  includes a mass storage controller and wherein memory  is provided by a NAND flash memory device. Where a certain component of system  includes a USB flash drive, an external component external to the certain component can be provided with a peripheral device communication interface device in the form of a USB interface for providing communication between the certain component and the external component. Where I\/O interface device  bus coupled to CPU  is provided on a first component operative for communication, and memory drive unit  is provided on a second component for communication, and wherein interface device  is compatible with interface circuit , I\/O interface device  can be in communication with memory drive unit  via, e.g., a wireline connector.","In some embodiments, an injection molding assembly component configured as a component operative for communication can have a subset of the elements described in connection with . In one example, an injection molding assembly component configured as a component operative for communication can have only RFID tag  out of the elements of . RFID tag  can be configured to be responsive to an interrogation signal. In one embodiment, a component operative for communication can have only memory drive unit  out of the components of . Of course, a component operative for communication can be provided without one or more of a display , keyboard , and sensor . For configuring an injection molding assembly component as a component operative for communication, the elements as described in connection with  (or a subset of the elements) can be supported by and be physically associated to the injection molding assembly component (e.g., disposed in a housing thereof or included in a separate housing which attaches to a housing of a component) or logically associated with the component without physical association.","Components of system  configured as described in connection with  can include components other than injection molding assembly components configured as components operative for communication. For example, system  can include facility server , including at least one CPU communicatively coupled to a memory, network  including one or more CPU and memory equipped components, and server system , including one or more CPU and memory equipped components. Referring ahead to the physical form view of , there can also be included in system  a plurality of components operative for communication in the form of workstation computers, e.g., personal computers  (including mobile laptops) and\/or mobile hand held workstation computer  (e.g., microprocessor based mobile phones) that can be in network communication with each other component of system .","Injection molding assembly components configured as components operative for communication can be in communication with a facility server . A variety of technologies can be utilized for establishing network communication between server  and the various injection molding assembly components. In one non-limiting example, a facility server  can be connected to injection molding machines -, -, - at each work cell -, -, - via Ethernet backbone . In one example, components operative for communication within each work cell can be in communication with each one via a discrete wireless or wireline OSI Layer 2 local area network (LAN) logically correlated to the work cell -, -, -. In another example, server  can be established as part of a common OSI Layer 2 network including one or more or each work cell component of facility . In another example, server  is deleted and a function described as being carried out by server  is carried out by a designated work cell component configured as a component operative for communication.","In another aspect, server  can be in communication with a remote server system  via network . In another aspect, system  can include a component database . Component database  can be conveniently located at a file directory of server  but in principle can be co-located at any component of system , and can be distributed among a plurality of components operative for communication. Database  can reside in one or more file directories of or accessible with use of one or more CPU and\/or controller equipped components of system  and accordingly can be regarded as being a computer-implemented database. In the exemplary network schematic diagram of , there is depicted a one to many relationship between server  and work cells -, -, -, and between database  and work cells -, -, -. However, in principle, neither server  nor database  need to be associated to a plurality of work cells as is indicated in the embodiment of . For example, each of server  and database  in one embodiment can be logically associated to a single work cell, and each of several work cells can include one dedicated central server and an associated database for recording component information relative to that work cell.","In one embodiment each component of system , including server  can run the TCP\/IP suite of communication protocols or similar higher OSI Layer communication protocol so that each component of the system  is capable of addressing each other component even where system  includes a plurality of OSI Layer 2 networks of differing technologies. In such embodiment, each component of system  can be regarded as being part of a common OSI Layer 3 network, e.g., an Internet Protocol (IP) based network. Of course, communication between various components of system  can be facilitated with use of communication protocols other than the suite of TCP\/IP protocols. For example, propriety industrial communication protocols can be utilized. Also, components can be in communication via OSI Layer 2 communication protocols without being in communication via OSI Layer 3 communication protocols. Further as noted, certain components of system  can be in communication without use of network protocols. For example, an RFID tag can adapt a component for communication of data. Also, a component can be made operative for communication with use of memory drive unit  in which case an external communication may be in communication with the component via a system hardware communication protocol peripheral device communication protocol without use of a networking communication protocol (though a networking communication protocol can be used in place of or in addition to a peripheral device communication protocol). Where components of system  are provided in network communication or in communication via a system hardware communication protocol peripheral device protocol, information can be communicated between any two components of system . Such information can include, e.g., programming data, often in the form of a file, commands including database query commands, and database data returned as a result of a database query.","Referring now to , an embodiment is described wherein system  is operative to record information respecting operational injection molding assembly configurations. In one embodiment component database  can include component registration table  and possibly N additional tables . System  can be operative so that table  is updated with a new row of information defining an operational injection molding assembly configuration responsively to a determination that an injection molding assembly configuration is operational. While database  is depicted as being implemented with use of relational database logic, alternative programming logic can be employed for organization of and access to data of database .","A representation of an exemplary table  is shown in . When an injection molding assembly configuration is determined to be operational, component identifiers corresponding to each component of the configuration can be recorded in table  together with a registration identifier, e.g., a registration ID which can be allocated serially for each newly registered configuration. Table  includes a plurality of row entries. Each row entry corresponds to a different injection molding assembly configuration determined to be operational.","A variety of methods can be employed for registering new registered configurations in database . A physical representation of an injection molding assembly within a current work cell is shown in . The work cell having various components shown in  can be a work cell currently being subject to setup. In the example of , the work cell  being subject to setup can include mold , injection molding machine , dryer , chiller , robot , workstation computer , and workstation computer . Various components of a current injection molding assembly currently located within a work cell can include one or more user interfaces. In the example shown, mold  can include user interface  and injection molding machine  can include user interface . There can also be one or more stand alone workstation computer components , , e.g., in the form of a personal computer , a mobile laptop computer as shown associated to the current work cell having an associated user interface , and\/or a mobile hand held CPU based computer . In one embodiment, CPU based hand held workstation component  can be provided by a BLACKBERRY STORM mobile telephone of the type available from Research In Motion Limited of Waterloo, Ontario. Referring to the view of , workstation computer  and workstation computer  can be mobile workstation computers that are adapted to be transported between work cells, e.g., work cells -, -, -, as shown in  and between different ones of facilities .","In one embodiment, system  can be operative so that an injection molding assembly configuration is recorded as an operational injection molding assembly configuration in response to an actuation of a user interface component by an operator, e.g., where an operator determines that an injection molding assembly within a current work cell is operational. For example, as shown in  user interface  can have registration actuator . System  can be operative so that when registration actuator  is actuated the configuration of the current work cell assembly of the current work cell in which the mold is located is registered in database  as being operational. An actuator for use in registering a current configuration can, in addition or in the alternative, be associated on any component of system  operative for communication, e.g., can be incorporated in user interface  of an injection molding machine , a user interface  of workstation computer , and\/or user interface  of workstation computer , a user interface associated to server , or server system  (as shown in ). In one example, user interface configuration  described herein relative to  can include registration actuator  which when actuated results in registration of a current injection molding assembly configuration.","In one embodiment, system  can be operative so that an injection molding assembly configuration is recorded as being operational in response to a result of a process run by system . For example, system  can be operative to run a program that monitors the performance of one or more cycles of a production run by each current injection molding assembly configuration at a certain work cell. System  can be operative so that if performance criteria indicative of an operational injection molding assembly running an injection molding process, as determined by running of a monitoring process, are satisfied for a current injection molding assembly, the current injection molding assembly is registered as an operational injection molding assembly configuration. Such program can be conveniently run by a CPU of an injection molding machine of a current work cell. Criteria that can be used to determine whether a cycle of a production run has been successful can include, e.g., cycle time within a certain threshold, a shot size related criteria, e.g., shot size repeatability. For determining whether a shot size criteria has been satisfied, a weighing mechanism can be disposed in association with a mold to weigh finished parts. For determining cycle time, a sensor  coupled to system bus  of injection molding machine  can comprise a strain gauge disposed to sense injection molding machine clamping pressure in combination with a timer. In one embodiment, an injection molding assembly can be determined to be operational if a predetermined number of successive finished parts are within a predetermined weight range. For determining whether a cycle time criteria has been satisfied, a time to complete a cycle can be monitored. In one embodiment, an injection molding assembly configuration can be determined to be operational if a predetermined number of successive cycles are completed within a predetermined time.","System  can be operative so that registered configurations herein can be deregistered through a de-registration process. A de-registration process can be initiated, e.g., responsively to an operator initiated command entered utilizing a user interface of system , or initiated responsively to a running of a process. For example, system  can be operative so that a registered configuration is de-registered responsively to an actuation of an actuator of a user interface of system  or responsively to a running of a monitoring process in which a cycle of a production run is monitored. In another aspect, each registration of an operational injection molding assembly can include an associated time stamp recording the time of the registration. Server  can include a real time clock and can be utilized for performance of such time stamping.","With the injection molding assembly components of the current work cell  being in communication with one another, the collecting and reporting of component identification information in response to a determination that a configuration is operational (e.g., by operator designation, by a running of a process) can be accomplished in a variety of ways. For example, if a certain LAN identifier is associated to a particular work cell, a component of the LAN can command, as part of a registration reporting process, each component within the LAN to report its component identifier to database . If components within system  are location aware, e.g., by incorporation of GPS or network based location detection functionality, system  can be operative so that each injection molding assembly component within a geography (set of coordinates) designated as belonging to the current work cell, as part of a registration reporting process can report its component identifier to database . System  can be operative so that on recording of an operational injection molding assembly configuration, system  records programming data associated with the components of the injection molding assembly configuration determined to be operational as well as component identifiers.","It has been mentioned that system  can monitor a cycle of a production run to determine whether an injection molding assembly is operational. In another aspect, system  can be operative to increment a counter each time a cycle is determined to be complete. In one example, a registration identifier can be recorded in an array form with an associated counter. System  can monitor whether a cycle has been complete by examining an output of a sensor  operationally disposed to sense an opening of an injection molding machine clamp and mold can be regarded as an indication of a completion of a cycle. In one embodiment, sensor  is coupled to system bus  of mold  and includes a proximity sensor disposed to sense a mold opening. In one embodiment sensor  is coupled to system bus  of injection molding machine  and comprises one or more of a strain gauge disposed to sense clamping pressure of an injection molding machine clamp and an SPI EUROMAP interface, e.g., SPI EUROMAP , SPI EUROMAP . The SPI EUROMAP interface can output signals that can be processed to determine a clamp state. System  can increment a count of the counter on each mold opening. It has been described that a registration identifier as a row entry item can associate each of several components of an injection molding assembly including, e.g., a mold, injection molding machine, dryer, chiller, and robot. Thus, while a cycle monitoring can be carried out by examining an operational aspect of a single component such as an injection molding machine or mold, the association to a registration identifier can result in a cycle count being maintained for each of several injection molding assembly components associated to the registration identifier.","There is set forth herein a method for recording a number of cycles participated in by an auxiliary injection molding assembly component, the auxiliary injection molding assembly component selected from the group consisting of a dryer, chiller, and robot, the method including the steps of assigning an identifier to an operational injection molding assembly that includes a mold, an injection molding machine and the auxiliary injection molding assembly component; monitoring an output of the mold; incrementing a counter associated with the identifier each time the monitoring indicates a completion of a cycle.","There is also set forth herein a system for use in performance of injection molding operations including an injection molding assembly comprising an injection molding machine, a mold, and an auxiliary injection molding assembly component selected from the group consisting of a dryer, chiller, and a robot; wherein the system is operative to assign an identifier to the injection molding assembly responsively to a determination that injection molding assembly is operational; wherein the system is further operative for monitoring performance of the injection molding assembly; and wherein the system is further operative to update a counter associated to the identifier responsively a monitoring indicating that a cycle has been completed.","In another aspect, system  can be operative so that certain important data messaging and\/or recording steps can ensue responsively to an injection molding assembly configuration being registered as an operational injection molding assembly configuration. In the process of setting up an injection molding assembly prior to its registration as an operational injection molding assembly, an operator may have developed reconfigurable programming data for each of the various components of the injection molding assembly. Such reconfigurable programming data can comprise e.g., setup parameters, executable code, or a combination of setup parameters and executable code. In one embodiment, such reconfigurable programming data can be recorded in registration table  as will be described herein allowing the association of component software with a historical state of an injection molding assembly component.","Some injection molding components are available with main program loops as part of the component firmware can be normally restricted from executing executable code not part of the firmware but nevertheless can be reconfigured by changing a number of setup parameters of the component with use of a user interface of a component. For example, injection molding machines, molds, dryers, and chillers are often available to operators in such configuration that allows an operator to change a setup parameter of the component. A representation of a user interface for a mold (including a mold cavity coupled with a hot runner controller) allowing operational parameters to be changed is shown in . An operator can reconfigure the current programming data associated with an injection molding assembly mold by entering new setup parameters for the mold using a user interface featurized as shown in  using in particular selection area . Injection molding machines, dryers, and chillers can be provided with similar user interfaces for changing operational parameters. Thus, current reconfigurable programming data of an injection molding machine, mold, dryer, or chiller in one embodiment can consist of a set of setup parameters. A robot associated with an injection molding assembly can be reprogrammed by providing a set of executable code instructions controlling the timing and movement of the robot in association with an injection molding machine. Thus, programming data associated with a robot may include executable instructions. Reconfigurable programming data of injection molding machines, molds, dryers, and chillers can also include executable code in place of or in addition to setup parameters, and reconfigurable programming data of a robot component can include setup parameters in addition to or in place of executable code. Programming data of an injection molding assembly component can include a setup parameter, executable script, and an executable binary sequence. An executable binary sequence can be in the form of, e.g., a binary file or a stream of bits and can have corresponding source code that can be regarded as programming data.","For recording of reconfigurable programming data associated with registered injection molding assemblies determined to be operational, the reconfigurable programming data (and\/or reference to such programming data) associated with each of several injection molding assemblies can be stored in a registration table  of database  as shown in , and can be indexed according to a registration number allocated to the registration so the programming data is easily recovered after its recording by keying using the registration ID number. Referring to the table of , a row of data recording each registered injection molding assembly determined to be operational can include a registration ID number, identifiers for each component of the configuration, and associated with each component a reference to the reconfigurable programming data of each component. Such reference can be in the form of a file reference referencing a directory path for a file including the component's programming data. Programming data in the form of setup parameters is conveniently recorded in the form of text based (e.g., XML or HTML) files. Programming data in the form of executable code is conveniently recorded using text based files or executable code files. Reconfigurable programming data is conveniently stored at a central location, e.g., at server .","System  can be operative so that when a new registration request is made, (e.g., responsively to an operator input command or monitoring process), server  requests programming data from all of the injection molding components associated with the registration (\u201cpull\u201d request). System  can also be operative so that when a registration request is made, e.g., responsively to an actuation of a user interface of an injection molding assembly component or responsively to a process, the components of the injection molding assembly to which the registration command is made transmit (i.e., \u201cpush\u201d) their current reconfigurable programming data at the time of registration to server  for storage in registered operational configurations table  of database . Programming data of an injection molding assembly component can be stored in a file format so that the programming data retains its content when transmitted between file directories of various memory equipped devices (e.g., injection molding assembly components and servers) of system .","In development of a design for system , it was determined that setup of a current injection molding assembly would benefit by the presentation of information relating to conditions prevailing within system . Such information can include past prevailing conditions (e.g., information relating to past operational injection molding assembly configurations) and\/or present prevailing conditions.","An exemplary user interface configuration  for use in setting up a current injection molding assembly in a current work cell is set forth in the example of . The user interface configuration of  can be conveniently incorporated into user interface  of workstation computer  and displayed on display  of standalone workstation computer  associated to a current work cell. User interface configuration  can, in addition or alternatively, be incorporated into another user interface, e.g., user interface  of mold, user interface  of injection molding machine , and\/or user interface  of workstation computer  in portable hand held form. Referring to the user interface configuration  of , there can be presented in area  information indicating past operational injection molding configurations that have been determined to be operational and that include the mold currently within the current work cell. The operator is therefore provided a powerful representation as to \u201cwhat has worked before\u201d with the current mold. User interface configuration  can be made active in response to an operator input command, made, e.g., a selection of an option from a set of menu options of a component of system . There is set forth a system for use in performance of injection molding operations, the system comprising a mold that can be associated with different components to define a plurality of different injection molding assembly configurations, each of the plurality of different injection molding configurations being defined by an association of components with the mold at a given time; a computer implemented database , wherein the system is operative so that the computer implemented database records information respecting one or more operational injection molding assembly configuration that includes the mold; and wherein the system is operative to display information respecting a past operational injection molding assembly configuration that includes the mold.","While a mold identifier is selected for keying database queries in the described example other component identifiers can be selected for use in making database queries of database . Nevertheless, selecting a mold identifier for controlling database querying offers certain advantages. Specifically, a selection of components of an injection molding assembly and of programming data for such components is often dependant on requirements of a mold. Thus, if a mold was operational when supported by a certain set of components and associated programming data, one or more of those same components and items of programming data often will be useful for support of the mold when the mold is re-deployed as part of a new injection molding assembly.","System  can be operative so that by default a current work cell for which there is displayed information in area  is a work cell in which the computer presenting user interface configuration  is currently located. However, in some instances a computer e.g., workstation computer  or workstation computer  presenting user interface configuration  may not be located in any work cell. For example, a workstation computer  or  presenting user interface configuration  may be located proximate server  or incorporated in server , e.g., incorporated in a workstation computer ,  proximate a server of server system , or incorporation in a server or server system , or may be located remote from a facility. Also, where user interface configuration  is located within a first work cell, it may be desirable to use that user interface configuration for setup of a second work cell. Also, system  can be operative so that user interface  can be active simultaneously for two different components which can commonly display information related to the same certain work cell in area . A first computer can be disposed within the certain work cell and the second computer can be disposed externally to the certain work cell. In one embodiment, user interface configuration  can include area  allowing an operator to designate a current work cell for which user interface configuration  will display information overriding the default state in which there is displayed information pertaining to the work cell in where the computer incorporating user interface configuration  is currently located.","In area  there can be presented information indicating identification of components of the current injection molding assembly configuration (i.e., components currently within the current work cell). For determining of identification information indicating identification of components of a current work cell, a number of methods can be implemented. For example, a component, e.g., workstation computer , injection molding machine , of the current work cell  where the work cell has a logically associated LAN can request each component within the LAN return to it an identifier, e.g., a component ID. Where system  includes location aware components, system  can be operative so that for display of information in area , system  is operative so that each component within a set of coordinates allocated to work cell  reports to the computer, e.g., CPU or controller equipped component, incorporating user interface configuration  its identifier. The providing of area  with area  which can be simultaneously displayed allows an operator to easily compare the configuration of the current work cell with historical configurations determined to be operative that utilized the mold currently in the current work cell. System  can be operative so that wherein system  determines identification information for one or more components of a current work cell, system  utilizes such identification information for performance of one more functions in addition to display of information respecting the one or more components. For example, as will be explained further herein, system  can utilize the identification information for determining destinations of one or more communications transmitted by system . In some instances, system  will transmit communications to a select subset of components of system , e.g., in one example, only to injection molding assembly components within a certain work cell. System  can record current address listings correlating identification information of system  components with network addresses of the components, e.g., system bus addresses, port addresses including network hardware port addresses (e.g., switch port addresses), Layer 2 addresses e.g., Ethernet, IEEE 802.11 addresses, and\/or Layer 3 addresses, e.g., IP addresses. Thus, if system  is to selectively send communications to, e.g., injection molding assembly components of a certain work cell, it can utilize the determined identification information in transmitting the communications, referencing one or more of such address lists. System  can also be operative to utilize determined identification information for recording of information that indicates an identification of component into database . System  in one embodiment can be operative to record an entry into location logging table  described herein responsively to use interface  configuration  being made active or at fixed time intervals when user interface configuration  is active. Regarding area , system  can be operative so that actuation of a component identifier e.g., ROB_A__ in the example of , therein returns window  including specification and current programming data. For a certain component, system  can further be operative to allow an operator editing of such displayed current programming data for the certain component.","For display of programming data in window , system  can request the certain component to return its programming data for return of the programming data. Alternatively, system  can include a component specification table  and software logging table  as set forth herein and system , e.g., by a communication transferred by the computer incorporating user interface configuration , can query database  for specification information and programming data for the certain component. A system for use in performance of injection molding operations, the system comprising an injection molding assembly disposed in a work cell including a first injection molding assembly component and a second injection molding assembly component, the first and second injection molding assembly components being of different component types and each being of a type selected from the group consisting of a mold, an injection molding machine, a dryer, chiller and robot, wherein the system is operative to determine identifiers for the first and second injection molding assembly components; a user interface operative to display identifiers for each of the first and second injection molding assembly components and providing access to one or more of programming data and specification data for each of the first and second injection molding assembly components. There is set forth herein a system for use in performance of injection molding operations, the system comprising a plurality of components including first and second injection molding assembly components, the first and second injection molding assembly components being disposed in a common work cell, the first injection molding assembly component being selected from the group consisting of a mold and an injection molding machine, the second injection molding assembly component being an auxiliary injection molding assembly of an injection molding assembly type selected from the group consisting of a dryer, chiller, and robot, wherein the system is configured so that the first and second injection molding components assembly are operative for communication with one another. There is also set forth herein a system for use in performance of injection molding operations, the system comprising a plurality of components including first and second injection molding assembly components, the first and second injection molding assembly components being disposed in a common work cell, the first injection molding assembly component being selected from the group consisting of a mold and an injection molding machine, the second injection molding assembly component being an auxiliary injection molding assembly of an injection molding assembly type selected from the group consisting of a dryer, chiller, and robot; wherein the system is operative to determine identification information for the second injection molding assembly component; and wherein the system is operative to utilize the identification information for one or more of (a) display of information relating to the second injection molding assembly component on a user interface display, (b) transmission of a communication to the second injection molding assembly component, and (c) recordation of information identifying the second injection molding assembly component in a database.","Additional features can be incorporated into a user interface of system . For example, system  can be operative so that component identifiers displayed on a display can be configured as hot button actuators which when actuated result in additional information being displayed respecting the component identified by the identifiers. Referring to the user interface described with reference to , system  can be operative so that actuation of a component identifier results in a window having the characteristics of window  being displayed. In area  window  can include additional specification data respecting the component, and in area  window  can include programming data of the component. Recovery of additional specification data for a component can include a query of a component specification table  as will be described herein. Displayed specification data can include e.g., a manufacturer of a component, a manufacture date, model number, part number, and rating information for a component each of which can be returned by query of table . It is explained herein that system  can be operative to determine a current location of one or more components of system . In another aspect, displayed specification data displayed in area  can include information indicating a current location of the component to which information currently being displayed by window  relates. In another aspect, area  can include an actuator  as further described with reference to  for access to a facility map . System  can be operative so that responsively to actuation of actuator  a facility map  is displayed on display  currently displaying window . The facility map  can highlight the current location of the component to which information currently being displayed by window  relates. Accordingly, system  can be operative to present detailed component specification information respecting specific components incorporated in past operational injection molding assembly configurations including the mold of the current work cell (or other selected component of a current work cell).","With a history of programming data for a particular component being recorded in database , various features can be incorporated into system . In one embodiment, system  can be operative so that an operator designated component of system  can be subject to a programming data update to include past programming data of a system component responsively to an operator input command input using a user interface of system . For example, system  can be operative so that by (a) highlighting via operator input command an identifier of a particular component, e.g., DRY_H__ of a past operational configuration, displayed according to user interface configuration  in area ; and (b) highlighting via operator input command an identifier presented in area  indicating a component of a current configuration, e.g., DRY_H__, results in system  attempting to transmit the past programming data of the component identified by first highlighted identifier DRY_H__ into the component identified by the second highlighted identifier DRY_H__. System  can be operative so that the transmitting is executed conditionally on the condition that the system determines that the components are compatible. The component, e.g., in the referenced example to dryer DRY_H__ can be operative to utilize the transmitted programming data, e.g., by execution of an operating program. Referring to area  of the user interface configuration  as shown in , an example is described for further description of certain available functionality of system  in one embodiment. Referring to area , identification information for three past operational injection molding configurations is shown, each of the past operational configurations has a common robot ROB_A__. For each of the three configurations, programming data that is recorded for ROB_A__ can be different, and can be programming data for determining operation of the robot ROB_A__ at different times. Accordingly, it is seen that system  can be operative to record first and second programming data for a component that determines operation of the component at first and second different times, and can allow operator access to the first and second programming data (e.g., for viewing or downloading to a certain component).","It will be understood that when an injection molding assembly component utilizes programming data recorded in database  that is transmitted from database  and which was previously recorded in a certain same or other injection molding assembly component of system , the programming data that is each of transmitted from database  and utilized by the injection molding assembly may or may not comprise the entirety of programming data previously recorded in the certain same or other injection molding assembly component of system . For example, after transmission of a set of programming data into an injection molding assembly component, a subset of the set of programming data may be subject to editing. Also, for example, database  can have recorded therein a set of programming data corresponding to and determining operations of a certain injection molding assembly at certain point in time of system , and prior to transmission of programming data to an injection molding assembly component, a subset of the set of programming data can be subject to editing so that only a subset of programming data determining operation of the certain injection molding assembly component at that certain point in time is transmitted to an injection molding assembly component for utilization by the injection molding assembly component.","There is set forth herein a system for use in performance of injection molding operations, the system comprising an injection molding assembly component being of a type selected from the group consisting of a mold, an injection molding machine, a dryer, a chiller, and robot; a computer implemented database , wherein the system is operative so that the computer implemented database records programming data for the injection molding assembly component responsively to an occurrence of a predetermined event, wherein the system is operative so that the computer implemented database records first programming data and second programming data for the injection molding assembly component, the first programming data being programming data determining operation of the injection molding assembly component at a first time, the second programming data being programming data determining operation of the injection molding assembly at a second time different from the first time; wherein system is operative to allow access to the first programming data and the second programming data. There is also set forth herein a system for use in performance of injection molding operations, the system comprising a mold that can be associated with a plurality of different components to define a plurality of different injection molding assembly configurations, each of the plurality of different injection molding configurations being defined by an association of components with the mold at a given time; a computer implemented database , wherein the system is operative so that the computer implemented database  records information respecting a past operational injection molding assembly configuration that includes the mold, the past operational injection molding assembly including a first auxiliary component of the first type, and the information including certain programming data for the first auxiliary component; wherein the system is operative for execution of a cycle of a production run using a current injection molding assembly configuration that includes the mold and that includes a configuration other than the past operational injection molding assembly configuration, the current injection molding assembly configuration including a second auxiliary component of the first type; and wherein the system is operative for transmission of the certain programming data from the database to the second auxiliary component. There is further set forth herein a system for use in performance of injection molding operations, said system comprising a first component for use in an injection molding assembly selected from the group consisting of a mold, injection molding machine, dryer, chiller and robot; a computer implemented database , wherein the system is operative so that the computer implemented database  records first programming data for the first component and second programming data for the first component, the first programming data being programming data for determining operation of the first component during a first time, the second programming data being programming data for determining operation of the component during a second time subsequent to the second time; a second component being of a common component type relative to the first component; and a user interface, wherein the system is operative so that responsively to a command activated using the user interface, a selected one of the first programming data or second programming data is transmitted to the second component.","Referring now to additional aspects of system , system  can be operative so that a current location of each injection molding assembly component can be recorded at various times so that a record can be developed indicating a history of locations of each injection molding assembly component of system  over time. Such information therefore indicates and can be regarded as a geographic migration history of a component. Although a variety of different configurations are available the location information is conveniently stored in a component database  collocated with facility server . There is set forth herein a system for use in performance of injection molding operations, the system comprising first and second injection molding assembly components, each of the first and second injection molding assembly components being selected from the group consisting of a mold, an injection molding machine, dryer, chiller, and robot; a computer implemented database ; wherein the system is operative to determine information indicating a current location for the first injection molding assembly component; wherein the system is operative to determine information indicating a current location for the second injection molding assembly component; wherein the system is operative to record in the computer implemented database  information indicating a current location of the first component at a plurality of points in time so that the computer implemented database  records a history of locations of the first injection molding assembly component; wherein the system is further operative to record in the computer implemented database information indicating a current location of the second component at a plurality of points in time so that the computer implemented database records a history of locations of the first injection molding assembly component.","System  can be operative for recording of location information of injection molding assembly components according to a variety of different configurations. In one embodiment server  can be operative to transmit a request communication, from time to time (e.g., pre-set time intervals) each injection molding assembly component of system  requesting each component to report identification information for the component and a location information for the component. Responsively to such \u201cpull\u201d requests, the various components can responsively report identification information and location information to server . In another embodiment each injection molding assembly component in communication with server  can be operative to \u201cpush\u201d identification information and location information to server . For example each injection molding assembly component on power up can be operative to transmit a communication to server  to report to server  for recording in database  identification information and location information of the component.","In another embodiment, one or more intermediary components of system  can be operative to assemble identification information and location information from other components and push the location and identification information to server . For example, molds -, -, - of system  in the state as shown in  can be designated as components of system  which on power up determine identification information and location information for components in proximity with the respective mold and report the assembled identification information and location information (including identification and location information for itself) to server .","In one embodiment, identification information and location information that can be recorded by system  can be time stamped. Time stamping can be conveniently accomplished with use of a real time clock of server . Identification information of a component of system  in one embodiment can include identification information in the form of an identification ID which can be provided, e.g., by an alphanumeric text string. The identification information, e.g., in the form of an alphanumeric text string can include embedded \u201ccomponent type\u201d information, e.g., designating the component is, e.g., a mold, injection molding machine, dryer, chiller, or robot. Such identification information for a certain component can be stored in a non-volatile memory of the certain injection molding assembly component. Such non-volatile memory can be included in system memory  if present and\/or a memory  of RFID tag  if present and\/or a memory  of memory drive unit  if present. In another embodiment, identification information can be provided by specification parameters for the component stored in a non-volatile memory of the component. Location information that can be transmitted by a component of system  can include or can be processable to determine a location ID. A location ID of system  can be a work cell ID or a storage location ID corresponding to storage location .","A number of configurations are possible for use in generating location information for the various components of system . In one example of system  in which components of system  incorporate location aware functionality, a discrete OSI Layer 2 network can be implemented in and be logically associated with each work cell -, -, - and storage location . Such an OSI Layer 2 network can be provided by e.g., an Ethernet network, a Bluetooth network, or an IEEE 802.11 network. Location indicating signature information corresponding to the OSI Layer 2 network derivable from the network can be accessed by components of the network operative for communication, can be transmitted to server  as location information, and server  can conveniently be configured to include a table correlating the LAN signature information with location identifiers, and can be operative to resolve location identifiers for various components utilizing the table and the signature identification information. An example of location indicating signature information for an OSI Layer 2 network can be e.g., an IP address of the external interface or a router connecting each OSI Layer 2 network to Ethernet backbone .","In another embodiment, a facility  can incorporate a single radio based LAN having enhanced location aware functionality such that a coordinate location for each component of the LAN can be determined within a small error range (e.g., 1 to 3 meters). Such a radio based LAN can utilize triangulation methodologies to provide location information to mobile components of the LAN. Server  can be conveniently employed to maintain a facility map including coordinate locations corresponding to various work cell and storage locations and can utilize the map to determine work cell or storage location IDs for each component of system  for which identification information and location information is received.","An injection molding assembly component need not have advanced networking communication capability for system  to determine a location ID for the component. For example, where a particular component configured to be operative for communication with an external component includes only an RFID tag  but not a network interface included as part of I\/O interface , a certain component in read range of the RFID tag  can read component identification information from the RFID tag  and can conveniently transmit a communication utilizing a network interface of the certain component to server  including the accessed identification information associated with location information for the certain component so that server  can record the identification information for the particular component and location information in database , wherein the location information for the certain component can be utilized as the location information for the particular component.","In yet another embodiment, system  can be operative so that location information for each of or a subset of injection molding assembly components includes information manually input by an operator. For example, each injection molding component of system  can be operative to prompt an operator to input a location ID for the component, which ID can be transmitted to server  with associated component identification information. In such an embodiment, system  can be operative so that an operator can be prompted to manually change the location identifier when a location of the component is changed. Configuring system  so that system  prompts an operator to enter location identification information reduces a risk of erroneous location determination by e.g., a component entering a connection range a LAN associated work cell or a coordinate range of a work cell other than a work cell to which it is associated.","In another embodiment, system  can be operative so that location information for various injection molding assembly components is based on a component's association with a particular OSI Layer 2 wireline LAN. In one embodiment a different OSI Layer 2 wireline LAN, e.g., Ethernet network can be provided for each work cell of a facility and each component of each work cell when moved into the work cell can be wireline connected to the wireline network. System  in such an embodiment can determine location information for each component based on LAN identification information of the wireline associated wireline LAN for each component.","In another embodiment where one or more injection molding assembly components incorporate wireless network communication capabilities, short range radio technologies, e.g., RFID reading technologies can be employed to resolve a current location of a component. For example, a pair of neighboring first and second work cells can be configured to include first and second IEEE 802.11 LANS. An injection molding assembly component may be located in a first work cell but may be in communication range of both of an access port of the first LAN and an access port of the second LAN. For resolution of a proper network association, and current location of the components, the component can be configured to include an RFID tag and a computer within each work cell, e.g., each work cell's access point or injection molding machine  can be configured to include an RFID reader unit , a sensitivity of which is established so that only RFID tags within the work cell of the RFID reader unit are read.","A representation of an exemplary enhanced component on database  in an embodiment wherein database records location information of injection molding assembly components over time is shown in . In the embodiment of , there is recorded in location logging table  location information together with identification information in the form of a component identifier provided by component ID with a prefix e.g., MLD=MOLD; CHI=CHILLER allowing the component type to be determined from the component ID.","Database  can include a number of additional primary tables, e.g., location logging table , component specification table , software logging table , and N additional tables  as shown in the exemplary embodiment of . Included in the tables of N additional tables  can be a registration table  as described herein or else, if operational configuration recording information is recorded, information indicating that an injection molding assembly configuration has been determined to be operational can be appended to another table, e.g., location logging table . Identification information of a component could also include, e.g., specification parameters for the component from which a component ID can be derived. The component specification table  may be configured to record component specification data e.g., the make, model, part number, and manufacture date of the component referenced by the component ID as well as values of rating metrics (ratings) logically associated with the component such that this information is accessible by querying component database  with one or more component identifiers or keys. In one embodiment such ratings of a component may include the maximum rated value of a component specific rating, e.g., the lifting weight capacity in the case of a robot and the cooling power capacity in the case of a chiller. In one embodiment one or more ratings may each be logically associated within table  with a given key unique to a standard metric unit e.g., in an associative data structure or linked list, where the data structure format may be text based, i.e., <liftingCapacity=\u201c20\u201d maxCurrent=\u201c30\u201d> or a simply a combination of values in one or more columns of a row of table . A representation of component table  in one embodiment is shown in  in which ratings information can be recorded in array form in a \u201cratings\u201d column.","In another aspect, component specification table  can include an \u201cAssociated Component Requirements\u201d column which can record one or more requirements of one or more components which can be associated in a certain component for which information is recorded in table . For example, for a certain mold, e.g., a mold identified by mold MLD_ there can be recorded in the column \u201cAssociated Component Requirements\u201d e.g., information indicating the requirement that the mold only be used with an injection molding machine or a certain rating range, or a dryer within a certain rating range. Illustrative examples are presented in greater detail herein. Information recorded in the Associated Component Requirements column can be recorded in array form.","Referring to software logging table , system  can be operative so that when programming data is updated in a component of system , a row of data indicating the prevailing condition of the update having occurred is recorded. Each component of system  can be operative so that on completion of an update of programming data programming information relative to the update can be transmitted to database . In one example, system  can be operative so that each component of system  responsively to a program update for the component reports a component identifier along with an identifier of the programming data update is reported to software logging table . Reporting of programming information can also include a reporting of the programming data to database . Reporting of programming data to database  can be accomplished in a number of ways. For example, such reporting can be accomplished by transmitting the programming data from the component to a column of table . In another example of reporting of programming data information, a component can transmit a reference to the programming data (e.g., a directory location) to table , and can also transmit the programming data to the designated location, e.g., directory location which programming data can be regarded as part of the component database . A directory reference within table  can serve as the program update identifier. A storage location, e.g., storage location at server  can be designated for storage of programming data of components of system  over time. A representation of software logging table  in one embodiment is shown in .","Where component database  includes identification information in the form of a component ID, the ID can be e.g., originally stored at the corresponding component or can be derived by system  from other identification information. In the embodiment of location logging table  set forth in , location information is recorded in the form of location IDs. However, there could alternatively be recorded in table  of database  other location information (e.g., coordinate information) from which a location ID can be derived. It is seen that system  can be configured to query component database  in a variety of ways that will return useful data respecting conditions within system , e.g., a location of a particular component over time, a list of components at a certain work cell at a certain time e.g., the present time and\/or specification parameters logically associated with one or more components.","With an application established that records location of various injection molding assembly components over time, the application can be enhanced for achieving additional functionalities. In one example of an application enhancement as will be described further herein, content of the recorded location information recorded in database  can be utilized for improved operation of an injection molding assembly when executing an injection molding process application.","It has been described that location logging table  can be operative to record time stamped locations of several injection molding assembly components of system  over time as the components are moved into and out of and between different locations of an injection molding facility. With such recorded information available from database , queries can be developed for querying database  for returning results, e.g., for display on a user interface display which can be utilized for operator observation and\/or for input into application program interfaces (APIs).","For illustration of certain aspects of database  in one embodiment, table  of  shows the result of a query of database  for component parts at a certain work cell (identified by CELL_) over time (a query may be made to return results for each state of a work cell over time, with the states being differentiated by the introduction or removal of component into the work cell). It has been described with reference to registration table  that responsively to an operator or process initiated determination that a certain injection molding assembly configuration is operational, registration information can be associated to a set of component identifiers, indicating that the components identified are operational as an operational injection molding assembly. With reference to the exemplary table architecture as shown in , registration information can in one embodiment be appended to location logging table . Table  as shown in  includes a subset of location logging table . Referring to the example of the table  as shown in , a work cell in an initial state, state , may be an unpopulated work cell and may include only an injection molding machine having the identifier IMM_K__. A first state change of the work cell may occur when a mold is introduced into the work cell. Thus, for the work cell state  in the described example, there can be included the mold having the identifier MLD_ associated to the work cell CELL_. Additional auxiliary injection molding assembly components may then be associated to the work cell. With reference to state  the dryer, DRY_G__ may be associated to the work cell. With reference to state , the chiller, CHI_P__ may be associated to the work cell. With reference to states  and , the chiller, CHI_P__ may be replaced with the chiller, CHI_T__. Such replacement may occur, e.g., if analysis reveals that CHI_P__ is not satisfactory for the current job, or e.g., that the CHI_P__ is required for servicing or needed in another work cell. Referring to state , the robot, ROB_A__ may be introduced into the current work cell. Injection molding machines, dryers, chillers, and robots identified in the table  as shown in  are identified using the character string format CCCCCCCCCwhere CCCform a component type identifier string, Cis a manufacturer identifier, CCform a model number identifier string and CCCform a character string providing a unique part identifier for distinguishing between like model numbered components.","Still referring to the table  as shown in , it will be observed that each work cell can be expected to undergo periodic state changes. With reference to state  and state  recorded in the table  as shown in , the mold identified by MLD_ might be replaced with the newly introduced mold having the identifier MLD_. Then, after introduction of the new mold, it may be determined that a new dryer and chiller may be desired for operation with the new mold. States  and  recorded in the table  as shown in  indicate a change in dryer and states  and  indicate the change in chiller. Eventually, an operator may determine that the newly configured injection molding assembly is operational for a new production run and at such time may choose to register the configuration as being operational. In addition to or alternatively, a monitoring process can determine that a particular configuration is operational, e.g., by monitoring performance of the configuration during a cycle of a production run. On determination that a particular injection molding assembly configuration is operational, registration information can be appended to a row of information to the configuration. Referring to the example of the table  as shown in , state  is recorded as a registered and operational injection molding assembly configuration, and a registration identifier is appended to the row of data for state . While not depicted in  specifically, each set of registration information can be recorded with an associated time stamp so that the time registration can be recorded via query of database . In the embodiment described with reference to , registration information can be appended to the data of location logging table . In another embodiment, registration information can be maintained in a separate table having the configuration of registration table .","Still referring to the table  as shown in , states  and  are presented in the example to illustrate the possibility that a current work cell assembly may be subject to an adjustment not involving replacement of a mold. For example, a dryer may be required to be subject to servicing. Referring to states  and , there are recorded the events of the dryer identified by DRY_H__ being replaced with the dryer identified by DRY_H__ and the new injection molding assembly configuration with dryer DRY_H__ being registered as an operational injection molding assembly configuration with Registration ID 08022. It is seen that the registration for operational setups may not be sequential for a given work cell (that is there is a jump from Reg. ID No. ID=08017 to Reg. ID No. ID=08022) in the described example. In one example, the interceding registration numbers may have been allocated to registrations of operational injection molding assemblies at other facility work cells.","Referring again to the table  as shown in , it is seen that a work cell can have recorded for it a great number of configuration states but that only a subset of the recorded configuration states may be flagged in database  as being registered configuration states corresponding to injection molding assemblies determined to be operational for purposes of manufacture of injection molded articles. Further, it can be observed that a work cell can have either zero or one active registered injection molding assembly configuration. For example, referring to the example of the table  as shown in , the work cell identified by Cell_ at the time state  is valid can be regarded as having zero active registered injection molding configurations. At the time state  is valid, however, the work cell identified as CELL_ can be regarded as having one active registered configuration, the registered configuration identified by Registration ID No. 08022.","Referring to table  as shown in , table  is a table that can be returned by querying location logging table  where location logging table  includes enhanced programming data information and where location logging table  is keyed using a registration identifier. Table  can include a subset of the data of table , and in the specific example of  can include component identifiers for each of several registered injection molding assembly configurations determined to be operational as well as programming data information associated with each component identifier of each registered configuration.","Further aspects of system  in one embodiment are described with reference to  illustrating an enhanced setup user interface configuration  for system  in which contents of database  are utilized for simplification of setup of an injection molding assembly within a current work cell . With reference again to , there is shown a physical form view of an exemplary work cell  in which there is currently associated mold , an injection molding machine  and a plurality of auxiliary components including dryer , chiller , and robot . For purposes of discussion with reference to the enhanced user interface configuration  of , it is assumed that a mold  currently located in a current work cell being subject to setup is a mold identified by the mold identifier MLD_. There is also provided in work cell  in the illustrative embodiment a workstation computer  in the form of a mobile laptop having user interface . User interface  can incorporate user interface configuration  including a displayed set of menu options that can be displayed on a display  of workstation computer . User interface configuration  can be incorporated in user interface  and\/or a user interface of another component of system  operative for communication, e.g., user interface  of mold , user interface  of injection molding machine , and\/or user interface  of mobile hand held workstation computer , or another user interface or otherwise associated to another component of system  operative for communication, e.g., server  or a server of server system . Regarding user interface configuration , all of the features described with reference to configuration  can be combined with the features described with reference to configuration  and all of the features described with reference to configuration  can be combined with configuration . For example, as in the case of configuration , component identifiers can be configured as hot buttons such that actuation of an identifier hot button results in window  being displayed having specification area  and programming data area . With software logging table  logging programming data updates, a present programming data can be available for any injection molding assembly component of system  even where the component has not previously been associated to an injection molding assembly determined to be operational.","Aspects of enhanced user interface configuration  are set forth herein in greater detail. Referring to area , area  can display component information (e.g., component identifiers) of a currently active registered injection molding assembly configuration associated with the mold identified by MLD_ (the mold currently in the work cell) if there is such an active registration. In area  there can be displayed component identifiers of past registered configurations associated with the mold identified by the mold identifier MLD_. In area  there can be displayed component information of the current configuration of the mold identified by the mold identifier MLD_. System  can be configured so that returned in area  can be component information for injection molding assembly components currently residing within work cell . In area  there can be displayed an editing area which can be used to alter components of a configuration for registration that is designed \u201coff-line\u201d, i.e., without reference to the components actually in a current work cell , and which may be regarded as an off line designed injection molding assembly configuration. In one example, area  can be used to display prospective configurations being designated by an operator. System  can be operative so that an operator can actuate a component identifier e.g., identifier ROB_A__ within area  to display programming data in a returned window , and system  can be further operative to allow editing of such displayed programming data. In areas , , , and  there can be displayed prompts and\/or messages that indicate and which are responsive to various prevailing conditions of system .","It will be seen that queries for developing information that is displayed in area , area , and area  can readily be developed. Information displayed in area  can be retrieved by querying database  to return component identifiers corresponding to the most recent un-cancelled registered configuration that includes the mold MLD_. For retrieving information for display in area , database  can be queried to return component identifiers that are associated with each past registered configuration having mold MLD_ as a component. For retrieving information for display in area , database  can be queried to return a set of component identifiers having recent time stamps that are associated to the current work cell, or alternatively, for retrieving information for display in area , system  can be operative in the manner described with reference to , for display of information in area .","In accordance with user interface configuration , a user interface can also be operative to display component specifications including ratings that may inform a determination of the suitability of a given component to participate in the intended injection molding process. For example, system  can be operative so that actuation of component identifier results in a window  as described with reference to  being displayed which includes displayed specifications, and displayed programming data. For display of specification and programming data, the component incorporating user interface configuration , e.g., component  or other component incorporating user interface configuration  and displaying the information can query database . For example, for retrieval of specification data a component for communication can query a Rating column and\/or Associated Component Requirements column of a component specification table , which can include rating or requirement information in the form of an array. System  may also be configured to restrict system  subject to a determination that the ratings or requirements of a component are not within specified requirements as will be set forth herein.","Referring to the user interface configuration  of  in further detail, a number of features and advantages are apparent. It is noted that a current active registered configuration for the mold MLD_ may not correspond to the configuration currently residing in the current work cell . For example, if the mold MLD_ has just been moved from another work cell, it is likely that the current registered configuration for the mold MLD_ has associated injection molding assembly components that currently reside at the previous work cell. Likewise if a component of the current work cell has been removed (e.g., removed for use in another injection molding process) then there will be a mismatch between the current active registered configuration and the current configuration residing in work cell .","Further, it can be seen that system  can be operative so that differences between an active registered configuration and a current configuration can be discriminated by system  to result in information being displayed that indicate the prevailing condition of system  in regard to the condition of there being such a difference. For example, system  can be operative so that if there is a difference between the active registered configuration and the configuration of the current work cell, there can be displayed a message, e.g., at area  such as \u201cCURRENT CONFIGURATION DOES NOT MATCH\u201d or in area  \u201cMISMATCHED CONFIGURATION\u201d indicating the prevailing condition of system  that there is a mismatch. There can also be displayed more specific information. It has been described that database  can be queried to return a present location of any component of system . Further, the difference discrimination can return a component identifier identifying a required component that does not correspond to the current active registered configuration. In area  there can be displayed the prompt: RECOVER [COMPONENT PART IDENTIFIER] FROM [LOCATION IDENTIFIER]. An operator would thus be prompted to retrieve a specifically identified missing component from a specifically identified designated location. Conversely, system  can be operative so that when an examination between an active registered configuration and a current configuration indicate that there is a match between components a positive reinforcing message can be displayed in area , e.g. OK TO ACTIVATE INJECTION MOLDING.","It has been described that system  can be operative so that certain processes, e.g., display of a message can be initiated responsively to a comparison between information associated with a currently active registration configuration and information of indicating an injection molding assembly configuration currently in a work cell. In another aspect, processes can be restricted responsively to a comparison between information of an active registration configuration and current configuration currently within a work cell.","With reference to the flow diagram of , there is described a process wherein operation of a current injection molding assembly is restricted if components of a current injection molding assembly do not match those of a presently active registered injection molding assembly configuration for a current work cell. Such restriction of operation can comprise, e.g., restriction of activation of a current injection molding assembly for performance of a cycle production run. At block  a command to activate a cycle of production run can be initiated, e.g., by actuation of actuator . At block  injection molding machine  can determine by appropriate query of database  as set forth herein whether components of a current configuration match those of an active registered configuration. If the current set of components and the components of the active registered configuration are not the same, activation of an injection molding process can be restricted at block . Further at block  the injection molding machine  can determine if programming data of the various components of the current injection molding assembly corresponds with the programming data of the active registered configuration. If not, a download process can be executed at block  to download programming data into various components. If download fails (determined at block ) execution of the injection molding process can be restricted at block . If download is successful, operation proceeds to block  in which an injection molding process for performance of a cycle of production run can be permitted to be executed. With further reference to an injection molding process that can be made active by actuation of actuator , an injection molding process can be run by a CPU of an injection molding machine . An injection molding process application that is run by a CPU of injection molding machine  can control such items as (a) how a mold should close, (b) cooling time, (c) opening position of mold. In performance of such process steps the injection molding machine program can read parameters that are part of the programming data of various injection molding assembly components. Also as part of an injection molding process a CPU of an injection molding machine  can command at certain times in the process activation or deactivation of various injection molding assembly components. In one embodiment, system  can be operative so that as an alternative to execution of block  (downloading of programming data if there is a mismatch between programming data of a current work cell component and programming data of the presently active registered configuration) system  can be operative to display an appropriate message indicating there being a mismatch, e.g., at area  of user interface configuration  indicating a lack of correspondence between one or more programming data of a current work cell component and programming data of an injection molding assembly configuration determined to be operative, e.g., the presently active registered injection molding assembly configuration. An operator viewing the message can take appropriate action, e.g., editing code of the one or more components of the current work cell, registering the current work cell configuration as an operational injection molding assembly configuration, e.g., by actuation of actuator  of user interface configuration .","In another aspect, system  can be operative so that an operator can change a currently active registered configuration for a current work cell. In one method for setting up an injection molding assembly, which may be termed an on-line setup method, an operator may physically move a variety of component articles into a work cell and then program them into configurations that are operational. Component information for such configuration can be displayed in area . When an operational configuration is achieved an operator can then elect to register the current configuration. Such registration can be accomplished by actuation of e.g., actuator  of user interface , or actuator  in the case of user interface configuration  or configuration . When there is a registration of a current configuration there will be a match between the configuration of area  and area .","In another method for setting up an injection molding assembly, an operator can elect as an active registered configuration a previously registered configuration. It has been described that system  can be operative to display in area  past registered configurations for the mold MLD_. System  can be operative so that an operator can select a past registered configuration as an active registered configuration, e.g., by highlighting a select past configuration and actuation of actuator . If there is a mismatch between the newly made active registered configuration and the current configuration, prompting information can be displayed in area  until an operator has retrieved the necessary components for operation of system .","The on-line setup method has been described where an operator locates a plurality of components into a work cell and works with (e.g., programs), the components at the current work cell until each component is properly configured. In an off-line setup method, an operator may develop an operational configuration based not on components currently in a work cell but rather on components that may be associated to a work cell at some point in the future. Such setup methodology is highly useful, e.g., in cases where desired components of a configuration are certain to be available at some point in the future but are currently not available (e.g., as a result of being presently in use in another work cell). For facilitation of such off-line setup methodology, system  can be operative so that displayed in area  of user interface  is an editing area. In area  there can be displayed identifiers of injection molding assembly components that are selected completely at the discretion of an operator. Commonly, however a starting configuration in editing area  is a past registered configuration that is imported for display into area  from area  upon an actuation of actuator . In one common scenario a past registered configuration displayed in area  may be very similar to a current configuration. For example, a past registered configuration may be very similar to the current configuration except the injection molding machine is different from the one of the present configuration but has the same manufacturer part number. In such a situation, an operator can highlight the noted past registered configuration, import it to area  by actuation of actuator  for editing, change the identifier of the injection molding machine so that it corresponds to the machine identifier of the current work cell, access database  for the programming data associated with the injection molding machine that was just changed, and download the programming data formerly associated to the prior injection molding machine to a new injection molding machine. User interface configuration  can be operative so that an operator can register a configuration having component identifiers displayed in area  by actuation of actuator .","Referring to further aspects of system , in one embodiment system  can be operative to restrict an operation of an injection molding assembly responsively to a determination that injection molding assembly requirements are not satisfied. Such restriction can be indirect. For example, registration (in some embodiments registration can be a prerequisite requirement for activation of an injection molding assembly) of an injection molding assembly configuration can be restricted responsively to a determination that injection molding assembly requirements are not met. System  can also restrict operation of an injection molding assembly directly by restricting activation of an injection molding assembly responsively to a determination that injection molding assembly requirements are not satisfied.","As has been described an injection molding assembly configuration registration can be responsive, e.g., to a command to register activated by an operator using a user interface of system  or responsively to a process run by system . Referring to the flow diagram of  a registration can be commenced at block , e.g., responsively to an operator command or process.","At block  system  can determine whether injection molding assembly requirements are satisfied. In one example of such determination with reference to the physical view of , a workstation computer of the current work cell, e.g., workstation computer  or other components of system  can examine requirements defining resources of system  (where a process is executed by component operative for communication other than injection molding machine , injection molding machine  can include a software interface allowing external component to determine its state). For example, a workstation computer of the current work cell, e.g., workstation computer  or other components of system  operative for communication can query component specification table , which as has been described can include injection molding assembly requirements in an Associated Component Requirements column as is indicated by table  described with reference to . Such requirements for a certain component can include, e.g., ratings required of components that can be associated to the certain component. For example if a row of data of table  is for the certain mold identified by the identifier MLD_, the data of the Associated Component Requirements column for that row entry, conveniently recorded in array form can include, e.g., the capacity or other ratings requirements for an injection molding machine which can be associated to the mold, a dryer to be associated to the mold, a chiller to be associated to the mold and\/or a robot to be associated to the mold. Other components can have associated component requirements recorded in the Associated Component Requirements column.","System  can be operative so that when registration is commenced, a workstation computer of a current work cell or another component of system  operative for communication can query the Associated Component Requirements column of table  for associated component requirements for each component of the injection molding assembly for which registration is commenced. Further at block , the querying device can then query the Ratings column of table  for each component for which registration is commenced and compare the returned requirements to the returned ratings.","Requirements defining resources of system  can also include a global requirements list. Further at block  the querying device can compare returned rating information with a global requirements list, conveniently stored at server . A global requirements list can store global requirements for injection molding assemblies, e.g., certain relationships between ratings of various components of an injection molding assembly. If system  determines that requirements are satisfied, registration can be completed at block . If system  determines that requirement are not satisfied, registration can be restricted at block . System  can be operative so that in place of or accompanying the restriction of registration at block , there is presented an indication indicating to an operator that the requirements have not been satisfied. Such indication in one example can take the form of a message displayed in area , e.g., REGISTRATION DENIED, CONFIGURATION INVALID.","In some embodiments system  can be operative so that a cycle of an injection molding production run for execution by a CPU of injection molding machine  can be permitted to be executed without a current injection molding assembly configuration of a current work cell being registered as an operational injection molding assembly. In such embodiments system  can be operative so that a cycle of an injection molding production run can be restricted responsively to a determination that requirements defining resources of system  indicate that requirements are not satisfied. An example system  operative to restrict running of an injection molding process responsively to an examination of requirements defining resources is described with reference to the flow diagram of . At block  a cycle of an injection molding production run can be commenced, e.g., by an operator actuation of production run cycle start actuator  () of an injection molding machine of a current work cell.","At block  system  can determine whether injection molding assembly requirements are satisfied. In one example of such determination with reference to the physical view of , a workstation computer of the current work cell, e.g., workstation computer  or other component of system  operative for communication, e.g., injection molding machine  operative to sense the actuation of actuator  can examine requirements defining resources of system . For examination of requirements defining resources of system , a workstation computer of the current work cell, e.g., workstation computer  or other component of system  can query component specification table  as well as a global requirements list conveniently recorded at server . As has been described with reference to , component specification table  can include injection molding assembly requirements in an Associated Component Requirements column. Associated component requirements for a certain component can include, e.g., ratings required of components that can be associated to the certain component. For example if a row of data of table  is for the certain mold identified by the identifier MLD_, the data of the Associated Component Requirements column for that row entry, conveniently recorded in array form can include, e.g., the capacity or other ratings requirements for an injection molding machine which can be associated to the mold, a dryer to be associated to the mold, a chiller to be associated to the mold and\/or a robot to be associated to the mold. Components having component types other than molds can have associated component requirements recorded in the Associated Component Requirements column.","System  can be operative so that responsively to a cycle of a production run being activated, a workstation computer of a current work cell or another component of system  operative for communication can query the Associated Component Requirements column of table  for associated component requirements for each component of the injection molding assembly for which registration is commenced. Further at block , the querying device can then query the Ratings column of table  for each component for which registration is commenced and compare the returned requirements to the returned ratings as indicated.","Requirements defining resources of system  can also include a global requirements list. Further at block  the querying device can compare returned rating information with a global requirements list, conveniently stored at server . A global requirements list can store global requirements for injection molding assemblies, e.g., certain relationships between ratings of various components of an injection molding assembly. If system  determines that requirements are satisfied, registration can be completed at block . If system  determines that requirement are not satisfied, registration can be restricted at block . System  can be operative so that in place of or accompanying the restriction of registration at block , there is presented an indication indicating to an operator that the requirements have not been satisfied. Such indication in one example can take the form of a message displayed in area , e.g., PROCESS RESTRICTED, CONFIGURATION INVALID. For restricting of an injection molding process at block , a communication to restrict operation can be transmitted to each injection molding assembly component within a current work cell or subset of the components. It will be recalled that system  can be operative to determine identification information for injection molding assembly components within a current work cell for purposes, e.g., of displaying information identifying the components in area  of interface configuration , or configuration , and for purposes of recording information identifying the components in database . System  in another aspect can maintain a list correlating identifying information for various components with port addresses, OSI Layer 2, or OSI Layer 3 addresses for each component, allowing addressing for transmission to any select one of the identified components. Accordingly, utilizing identifying information system, e.g., with use of certain component operative for communication such as workstation computer  or another component operative for communication can selectively transmit communications to select components within a current work cell to restrict activation of the components. In one embodiment, one or more injection molding assembly components within a work cell can be responsive to an inhibit command. On receipt of an inhibit command, e.g., from workstation computer  or injection molding machine , activation of injection molding assembly components within a current work cell can be restricted. In a variation of the process described with reference to the flow diagrams of , blocks  and  can be executed prior to activation of a cycle of a production run, e.g., prior to a time that a cycle of a production run is activated in satisfaction of block , e.g., by actuation of an actuator, e.g., actuator .","Examples will now be set forth detailing information that can be recorded in system  for which can be utilized for restricting operation of an injection molding assembly.","In one embodiment of system  referring to an example where a mold identified by the identifier MLD_, and a robot identified by the identifier ROB_A__ are designated for use in combination in an injection molding assembly with reference again to Table  as set forth in  information recorded in the Associated Component Requirements column of table  may include information defining process requirements. Such process requirements may include e.g., the weight of a finished article produced by a mold, e.g., a mold identified by mold MLD_. In such a case a robot e.g., ROB_A__ may be designated for use in combination (e.g., by a registration attempt, an activation of an injection molding assembly utilizing the components) with mold MLD_ may have a rated lift capacity greater than, less than, or equal to the weight of the finished article produced by mold MLD_. A computer of system  (e.g., workstation computer , workstation computer , an injection molding assembly component where CPU or controller equipped) may query the ratings of ROB_A__ in table  of database  and determine if the rated lifting capacity of the robot matches the requirements of the mold. System  may make such a determination as illustrated in , e.g., upon registration of an injection molding assembly comprising MLD_ and robot ROB_A__ or as illustrated in , e.g., upon activation of the assembly.","In another embodiment of system  referring to an example where mold MLD_, robot ROB_A__ and a chiller CHI_T__ are designated for use in combination in an injection molding assembly, information recorded in the Associated Component Requirements column of table  may include information reflecting the cooling requirements of the mold MLD_.

System  can be operative to a computer of system  and may query the ratings column for chiller CHI_T__ in table  of database  and determine if the rated cooling capacity of the chiller matches the requirements of the mold. System  may make such a determination upon registration and\/or activation of an assembly comprising mold MLD_ and chiller CHI_T__, e.g., the assembly comprising MLD_, CHI_T__, and ROB_A__, wherein system  may determine if the rated lifting capacity of robot ROB_A__ and the cooling capacity of chiller CHI_T__ meet the requirements of mold MLD--. System  may make such a determination as illustrated in  e.g., upon registration of an injection molding assembly including MLD_, chiller CHI_T__ and robot ROB_A__ or as illustrated in , e.g., upon activation of the assembly.","In another embodiment of system  referring to the example where mold MLD_, robot ROB_A__, and a chiller CHI_T__, and a dryer DRY_G__ are designated for use in combination in an injection molding assembly information recorded in the Associated Component Requirements column of table  may include information defining the drying requirements of the mold MLD_. In such a case a dryer DRY_G__ associated with the mold may have a drying capacity greater than, less than, or equal to the drying requirement of the mold. System  may query the ratings column for dryer DRY_G__ in table  of database  and determine if the rated drying capacity of the dryer matches the requirements of the mold. System  may make such a determination upon registration (flow diagram of ) and\/or activation (flow diagram of ) of an assembly comprising mold MLD_ and dryer DRY_G__, e.g., the assembly comprising MLD_, DRY_G__, CHI_T__, and ROB_A__, wherein system  may determine if the rated drying capacity of dryer DRY_G__, the lifting capacity of robot ROB_A__ and the cooling capacity of chiller CHI_T__ meet the requirements of mold MLD_.

Said process requirements may comprise a clamping pressure e.g., the clamping pressure applied to the mold by the mold interface clamp of injection molding machine IMM_K__, and the pressure, temperature, volume and type of molding material injected into the mold MLD_ by the injection unit of injection molding machine IMM_K__. In such a case the injection molding machine IMM_K__ associated with the mold MLD_ may have a clamping pressure greater than, less than, or equal to the a clamping pressure requirement of the mold. Further to this embodiment, mold MLD_ may require that the molding material be of a same or a different type than the one or more materials rated for injection molding machine IMM_K__, and\/or mold MLD_ may require an injection pressure, temperature, and\/or volume that are respectively greater than, less than, or equal to the rated injection pressure, temperature, and\/or volume of the injection unit of machine IMM_K__.
