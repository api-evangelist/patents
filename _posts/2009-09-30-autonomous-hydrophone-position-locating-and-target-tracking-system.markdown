title: Autonomous hydrophone position locating and target tracking system
abstract: An autonomous hydrophone position locating and target tracking system employing a string or array of acoustic hydrophone equipped apparatuses that are easily and rapidly deployed over the ocean bottom within a preselected volume of water. For each bottom residing hydrophone, a dedicated cable provides surface location based on satellite generated GPS positioning data. Special real time cable deflection algorithms resident in the base unit electronic processor are continuously updated using the velocity gradient inputs from several in-line velocimeters positioned at different depths along the cable. The shape of the tether cable and the resulting position of the bottom unit mounted hydrophone is then back calculated in real time in three dimensions from the known global position of the surface buoy.

Collectively the multi-hydrophone configuration provides an autonomous underwater hydrophone position locating and target tracking system that enables highly accurate position locating of the tracked objects. The system can be easily and quickly deployed to provide efficient underwater vehicle tracking. In addition, the system can be used to provide forward area anyplace-anytime test and evaluation range deployment capabilities.","(2) Description of the Prior Art","It is well known in the target tracking art to deploy a plurality of hydrophones over the ocean bottom in a dispersed pattern to effect a sensor string or array. However, the tracking accuracy of existing hydrophone sensor data output is greatly affected by the accuracy with which the relative position of the individual hydrophones is known in real time. Current methods for deploying hydrophone strings require that an expensive site survey be conducted to determine the initial bottom resting position of each individual hydrophone in the system. Over time, and especially for littoral water deployments, tether cables can be subjected to severe wave and tidal variations that may displace individual hydrophones over time which can in turn significantly impact the accuracy of overall system tracking solutions leading to a need to recalibrate. Recalibration of the deployed hydrophones presently requires that additional periodic costly site surveys be conducted. The need for further site surveys also prevents stealth deployment when tracking is desired in hostile waters.","What is needed is a way to overcome the inherent unreliable hydrophone position information associated with existing range systems by providing a quickly deployable acoustic hydrophone position locating system capable of continuous, accurate determination of each bottom deployed hydrophone's location in real time in order to permit the most accurate hydrophone string or array output data to the system.","Accordingly, it is a general purpose and object of the present invention to provide an autonomous, buoy tethered, bottom deployed, real time hydrophone position locating system.","It is a further object that the hydrophone locating system be easily deployable.","Another object is to have the hydrophone locating system be adaptable for rapid use as a test and evaluation system, especially in littoral waters.","These objects are accomplished with the present invention by providing an autonomous hydrophone position locating and target tracking system employing a string or array of acoustic hydrophone equipped apparatuses that are easily and rapidly deployed over the ocean bottom within a preselected volume of water. Each apparatus provides accurate position data for its base unit mounted hydrophone resulting in a system that permits accurate target tracking on-the-fly and also has forward area anyplace-anytime test and evaluation capabilities. For each bottom residing hydrophone, a dedicated cable tethered to a top side buoy provides surface location based on satellite generated GPS positioning data. Special real time cable deflection algorithms resident in the base unit electronic processor are continuously updated using the velocity gradient inputs from several in-line velocimeters positioned at different depths along the cable. The shape of the tether cable and the resulting position of the bottom unit mounted hydrophone is then back calculated in real time in three dimensions from the known global position of the surface buoy. The bottom residing base unit also includes the power supply for operating the apparatus. The surface buoy has the Global Positioning System (GPS) capability and also a Radio Frequency (RF) component with an antenna, to allow transmission of the hydrophone's position to a system consolidator. Together, a preselected number of these apparatuses provide an autonomous hydrophone position locating and target tracking system that provides highly accurate position location of the individual system hydrophones and hence accurate target tracking.","The tracking system of the instant invention includes a plurality of bottom deployed acoustic sensing hydrophone apparatuses, each  depicted hydrophone apparatus being positioned so as to, as part of a whole, form a desired tracking system configuration. Due to many dynamic ocean forces acting on an individual base unit during deployment and operation, the initial position of each hydrophone may shift over time. Knowledge of real time, actual position of each hydrophone is necessary for accurate tracking of moving underwater objects.","Referring now to  there is shown a typical autonomous hydrophone position locating apparatus generally identified as . Apparatus  includes a deployed base unit  that rests on the surface of an ocean bottom . Base unit  acts as the anchor for apparatus . An array cable  is connectively attached to base unit  and extends upward to the ocean surface  where it is in turn connectively attached to a buoy assembly . In the preferred embodiment, several low cost velocimeters, , are positioned at preselected intervals along the length of cable  to measure the ocean velocity gradients at various depths. A hydrophone  is affixed to the exterior of base unit  and connects to the interior thereof. Buoy assembly  includes a CP-GPS device coupled to a HF RF device, the combined device functions being shown generally in  as , which is housed within buoy . Buoy assembly  employs an inflatable rubber structure  with direct write technology shown applied as an antenna . Antenna  may be either printed on the dry interior buoy surface above the buoy's waterline, or as an alternative, may be an antenna formed by employing multi-retro-reflective technology applied on the portion of the exterior surface of the buoy that remains above the water line.","Referring now to the block diagram of , the interior of base unit  further includes a single apparatus power supply  that provides power within base unit  to an electronic processor chip  that incorporates a special deflection algorithm described in greater detail below, a depth sensor , and an apparatus controller . Depth sensor  provides base unit depth readings to processor chip  for use by its algorithm. Controller  manages the information flow between processor chip  and surface buoy assembly , and in addition provides operational power to all cable and buoy assembly components. Surface buoy assembly  includes an HF-RF transmitter connected to antenna , and a GPS unit that feeds buoy assembly 's location information to the transmitter and to the base unit processor \u2032. Buoy assembly  connects to base unit  by means of cable  having a multi-depth array of velocimeters  arranged at preselected intervals thereon. In the preferred embodiment the plurality of array sensor elements are low cost velocity accelerators.","Using the ocean velocity gradients, the GPS position of buoy assembly  and the initial position of base unit  as inputs, the deflection algorithm back calculates the relative three dimensional position of the base unit , the buoy assembly  and the shape of cable . The relative position information is next used, to determine the real time global position coordinates of hydrophone  attached to base unit . This hydrophone position information is then relayed back via satellite to a remote at sea or land based control center using the HF-RF transmitter capability for target tracking.","The primary advantage of the present invention is that it provides significantly enhanced hydrophone position location data. The autonomous sensor positioning and tracking system supports efficient traditional and future tracking on-the-fly and forward area anyplace-anytime test and evaluation capabilities. This includes TSPI and, acoustic and non-acoustic measurement and analysis. This technology provides high accuracy test and evaluation data including the ability to provide ultra complex test and evaluation scenarios such as salvo launch. With the maturing of Free Space Optical Telemetry (FSOT) (in the near term use HF RF communication links), the autonomous hydrophone position locating and tracking system of the present invention will provide collaborative test and evaluation capabilities such as connectivity of USW test and training events for joint distributed test and evaluation with live, virtual, and constructive assets. It can also provide ship systems connectivity with the joint distributed test and evaluation infrastructure for data acquisition, archive and distribution. The autonomous hydrophone position locating and tracking system will also support test and evaluation of new and emerging systems such as shallow water littoral warfare test environments and range capabilities that enhance test and evaluation of large and medium UDNS systems and unmanned vehicles.","What has thus been described is an autonomous hydrophone position locating and target tracking system employing a string or array of acoustic hydrophone equipped apparatuses that are easily and rapidly deployed over the ocean bottom within a preselected volume of water. Each apparatus provides accurate position data for its base unit mounted hydrophone resulting in a system that permits accurate target tracking on-the-fly and also has forward area anyplace-anytime test and evaluation capabilities. For each bottom residing hydrophone, a dedicated cable tethered to a top side buoy provides surface location based on satellite generated GPS positioning data. Special real time cable deflection algorithms resident in the base unit electronic processor are continuously updated using the velocity gradient inputs from several in-line velocimeters positioned at different depths along the cable. The shape of the tether cable and the resulting position of the bottom unit mounted hydrophone is then back calculated in real time in three dimensions from the known global position of the surface buoy. The bottom residing base unit also includes the power supply for operating the apparatus. The surface buoy has the Global Positioning System (GPS) capability and also a Radio Frequency (RF) component with an antenna, to allow transmission of the hydrophone's position to a system consolidator. Together, a preselected number of these apparatuses provide an autonomous hydrophone position locating and target tracking system that provides highly accurate position location of the individual system hydrophones and hence accurate target tracking.","Obviously many modifications and variations of the present invention may become apparent in light of the above teachings. For example: a single base unit mounted optical. Doppler velocimeter may be used to provide the ocean velocity gradient data in lieu of the plurality of low cost cable mounted velocimeters, although this would incur a much greater cost to implement. Antenna  may be applied inside or outside the surface of the inflatable rubber structure . Additional sensors may also be deployed on cable  such as salinity, temperature or even additional hydrophones.","In light of the above, it is therefore understood that within the scope of the appended claims, the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING","p":["A more complete understanding of the invention and many of the attendant advantages thereto will be readily appreciated as the same becomes better understood by reference to the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the accompanying drawings wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
