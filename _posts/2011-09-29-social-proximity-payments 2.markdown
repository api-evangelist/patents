title: Social proximity payments
abstract: An application or App on a payer's mobile device is used to discover people known to the user and who are in close proximity to the user at the time of a payment request. Discovery can be through searching contact lists and/or social networks of the payer and/or through the payer device discovering contacts around the payer and then searching the payer's contact or social network list to see if there are any matches. These people are then shown to the user on the user device, such as with a photo, icon, name, and/or email address. The user selects desired ones, which causes requests to be sent to the selected people, such as through text, voice, or email, to the respective devices. The selected people can then easily confirm or authorize a payment be sent to the user or to a payee.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Field of the Invention","The present invention generally relates to mobile payments and more particularly to payments based on proximity and social contacts.","Related Art","More and more consumers are purchasing items and services over electronic networks such as, for example, the Internet. Consumers routinely purchase products and services from merchants and individuals alike. The transactions may take place directly between an on-line merchant or retailer and the consumer, and payment is typically made by entering credit card or other financial information. Transactions may also take place with the aid of an on-line or mobile payment provider such as, for example, PayPal, Inc. of San Jose, Calif. Such payment providers can make transactions easier and safer for the parties involved. Purchasing with the assistance of an on-line or mobile payment provider from the convenience of virtually anywhere using a mobile device is one main reason why on-line\/mobile purchases are growing very quickly.","Typically, mobile payments are conducted between one payer and one payee and involve the payer receiving a bill or invoice from the payee and then providing full payment for the bill or invoice over an electronic network. However, in some situations, a bill or invoice may need to be \u2018split\u2019 or divided up into a plurality of bills. For example, a plurality of customers (payers) may order items together at a restaurant (payee), and those orders may be recorded for the plurality of customers as a group and presented in a single bill to the plurality of customers. The payment of such a bill with the assistance of a mobile payment provider raises a number of issues.","Conventionally, mobile payment for a bill that includes items to be paid for by a plurality of customers is accomplished by one of the customers entering the number of customers and a total amount due on the bill into a payer device. The payer device divides the total amount due by the number of customers to generate an equal amount due for each customer, and then sends a payment request to each customer. The customer using the payer device pays the total amount due on the bill with the assistance of the mobile payment provider, and then must wait to get reimbursed by each of the customers according to the payment requests sent using the payer device. Alternatively, each customer receives a request on each customer's respective mobile device, and each customer then makes a payment for the individually split amount to the payee.","The above process typically requires the payer to enter individual email addresses for each customer. If the number of participants rises over two, it quickly becomes very cumbersome to enter the required email addresses.","Thus, there is a need for an improved bill splitting system for use in making mobile payments.","According to one embodiment, an application or a mobile App on a payer's mobile device discovers people known to the user and who are in close proximity to the user at the time of a payment request. Discovery can be through searching contact lists and\/or social networks of the payer and\/or through the payer device discovering contacts around the payer and then searching the payer's contact or social network list to see if there are any matches. These people are then shown to the user on the user or payer device, such as with a photo, icon, name, and\/or email address. The user selects desired ones, which causes requests to be sent to the selected people, such as through text, voice, or email, to the respective devices. The selected people can then easily confirm or authorize a payment be sent to the payer or to the payee.","As a result, the payer does not need to manually search for and\/or enter individual email addresses during a group payment or bill splitting transaction.","These and other features and advantages of the present disclosure will be more readily apparent from the detailed description of the embodiments set forth below taken in conjunction with the accompanying figures.","Embodiments of the present disclosure and their advantages are best understood by referring to the detailed description that follows. It should be appreciated that like reference numerals are used to identify like elements illustrated in one or more of the figures, wherein showings therein are for purposes of illustrating embodiments of the present disclosure and not for purposes of limiting the same.","The present disclosure provides a system and method for determining a pool of possible payers within a group known to the primary payer or user. When the user is ready to pay a bill or make a payment, a payment provider is notified, who then determines the location of the user. People known to the user are identified, such as through a user's contact list and\/or one or more social networks of the user. The locations of those people identified are determined, and those in close proximity to the user's current location are presented to the user on the user device. The people may be shown with a photo, name, email address, or other identifier. The user then selects desired ones to share the payment. The payment provider sends requests to the selected people to make a payment. Once received, individual ones of the selected people can make a payment to the user or to the payee through the payment provider.","Thus, instead of requiring the user or customer to enter one or more email addresses or navigate through a lengthy contact list, friends or colleagues around the user can be automatically identified. After calculating the amount per person, instead of prompting the user for email addresses, the application could leverage its proximity capabilities (e.g., BlueTooth, GPS, or another technology) to not only discover the people around the user but to also utilize the user's contact list, LinkedIn list, or Facebook friend list to filter the discovered group down to only those known to the user.","In another embodiment, there is no filtering of only people known to the user. In this embodiment, all people in proximity to the user are presented to the user on the user device. This can be advantageous for different reasons. For example, there may be a person not on a user contact list or other social\/networking list who should share in the payment. This may include a friend of a friend, a new acquaintance, or simply a friend who the user has not yet entered into any searchable list. In another example, the user may want to identify all people in the area, such as during a charity event. The user could select everyone at the event discoverable by the payment provider and have a request for a donation sent to everyone. This makes it easier for people to donate something, resulting in a likelihood of a greater overall donation.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102"]},"The payment request may be received by the payment provider at a server or processor of the payment provider for processing. Included in the payment request is information about the user, such as a user identifier, account number, device identifier, or the like. This allows the payment provider to identify the user making the payment request. The payment request may also include information about the payee (e.g., the restaurant), such as identity, location, account number, etc. and details of the transaction or payment request, such as the amount.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["204","204","204","204","204","204","204","204","204","204","204","204","204","204","204","204","204","204","204","204"],"i":["a ","b","c","d","e","a ","ba","ca","da","ea","f","a","g ","f ","h ","f ","g","a ","a ","a"]},"Referring back to , after the payment request is received, the payment provider determines the location of the user at step . This can be done in any suitable way, such as determining the user's location through a GPS feature on the user's device or the location of the restaurant. The user may also directly inform the payment provider of the current location.","Once the user location is determined, identities of people in proximity to (e.g., \u201cneighbors\u201d) the user are determined. \u201cIn proximity\u201d may be defined in different ways, depending on the user, the payment provider, or the location of the user. For example, the user may set preferences that the payment provider determine people within 100 feet of the user location determined at step . Alternatively, the payment provider may set a distance to define the geographic \u201cfence\u201d for the user. In yet another example, the payment provider may determine the distance based on the location of the user. For example, if the user is in a densely populated location, such as a convention, restaurant, or mall, the distance may be shorter than when the user is in a sparsely populated location, such as at a county fair.","With a defined boundary, the payment provider can determine how many user devices are within the boundary. This may be accomplished by determining which devices are emitting a signal to enable a location to be obtained for the device and then determining which of those devices are within the specified distance from the user location. Proximity to the user device may also be determined by other means, such as NFC communication between devices. For example, using a Bump\u00ae-type network, adjacent devices and the user device may bump each other to engage in communication. Once a communication is opened, the payment provider may be able to detect these devices. In the present embodiment, the payment provider may determine people at the user's table, along with others in the restaurant or even outside the restaurant. The identities may be determined through the signal emitted from the different user devices. For example, a device may emit a signal that includes a device identifier, which the payment provider may use to determine a phone number or user of the device, such as by searching through a database of the payment provider.","Once neighbors of the user are identified, those neighbors known to the user are determined, at step . The payment provider may compare the neighbors found at step  with people in the user's contacts and\/or social networks, such as Facebook\u00ae, LinkedIn\u00ae, etc. Note that steps , , and  may be combined in different combinations or performed in a different sequence.","Continuing with the current embodiment and referring to , the payment provider may determine that within a specified proximity or distance  from a user or user device , two people or neighbor devices  and  known to the user are at the user's table, but that also three other people or neighbor devices , , and  known to the user are within close proximity (e.g., in or just outside the restaurant).","Referring back to , once people known to the user and within a certain distance from the user (i.e., \u201cknown neighbors\u201d) are determined, the results are presented to the user at step , such as on a display of the user device.  is an exemplary partial display of user device  displaying a visual representation of the known neighbors. Known neighbors or devices , , , , and  are shown as visual representations , , , , and , respectively, on a display screen . Visual representations can be one or more of a photo, a name, an image, an icon, and\/or a user name. For example, visual representations  and  may be photos retrieved from the user's Facebook\u00ae account or LinkedIn\u00ae account, and visual representations , , and  may be names from the user's contact list.","Upon viewing display screen , the user can determine whether the people to share in a payment are all displayed. There may be various reasons for not having all the people displayed, such as one or more devices not turned on or unable to be located by the payment provider and\/or a located neighbor \u201cunknown\u201d to the user, e.g., the neighbor is not in any searched database (contact list) or site (Facebook\u00ae, LinkedIn\u00ae).","At step , the payment provider receives, from the user through the user device, people who will be sharing payment of the bill. For those shown on display screen , the use may simply select desired ones, such as by tapping, checking a corresponding box, or dragging and dropping the representation to an appropriate location on the display. If the user wishes to add others not shown on the screen, the user can manually enter those in any suitable manner, such as entering an email address, user name, phone number, or other identifier recognizable to the payment provider. The user may also electronically enter and communicate the information, such as by \u201cbumping\u201d with the desired user device with a Bump\u00ae network or other NFC communication.","An example of one way for the user to select and for the payment provider to receive desired people to share the bill is shown in . The user may access a contact list  and select one or more contacts  stored on the user device to be added as payers (e.g., by selecting an \u201cADD\u201d button ). Information associated with a contact, such as email address, name, and phone number, may then be sent to the payment provider to add as an additional payer. If a visual representation is available, the newly added payer(s) can be shown on the user display with previously presented representations.","Once all desired payers are selected, the user may be asked to confirm. If the payers received by the payment provider is not accurate or complete, the user may revise as needed. For example, the user can select ones to be deleted, such as by checking or selecting a delete box. The user can also add payers, such as by manually entering an identifier (e.g., an email address or phone number) of a new payer.","Referring back to , after desired payers are identified and confirmed (which would include the user and the selected neighbors), payment requests are sent, at step , to the selected payers. The requests may be sent from a server or computing device of the payment provider to mobile devices of the selected payers. For example, each selected payer, including the user, may receive a text or email request to pay a certain amount. Other information may include the recipient of the payment. The payer can then select to pay and authenticate\/confirm as needed, such as by entering a password or PIN. The individual payments may then be made directly to the payee, i.e., the restaurant.","In another embodiment, the payment request is sent only to the payers selected by the user. Again, the payment request may include an amount for each payer to pay, along with the payment recipient. In this case, the payment recipient is the user. Once each payer is authenticated and confirms payment, the payment is processed by the payment provider and deposited with the user in a user account, typically with the payment provider. The user pays the restaurant the entire amount. This can be done in a separate transaction, such as conventionally with a credit card, check, or cash, or through the payment provider with a separate payment request sent to the user. Once the payment is approved, such as by authentication and confirmation, the payment provider processes the payment by debiting an account of the user and crediting an account of the payee (the restaurant).","Once payment is processed, notifications may be sent to the various payers and\/or the payee, such as to their mobile devices through text, email, voice, or the like.","The amount requested of each payer may vary or be split equally. For an equal split, the payment provider determines the number of payers and divides the total amount of the bill with the number of payers. That amount, with any additional fees\/charges, is included in the payment request. For a varied split, the user may determine the amount to request from each payer, such as by entering an amount corresponding to each selected payer. Payers may also modify the requested amount, such as by increasing the amount for an extra tip or other reason.","Thus, using the method described herein, a user may easily share a bill or payment with known neighbors without having to manually enter information, such as email addresses, for each and every person sharing the payment. Visual representations also allow the user to quickly identified desired persons, as well as provide the user with a more pleasant user interface during the payment process.","In another embodiment, step  may be omitted from the method in , which gives the user a larger number of people to select from for a payment request. This may be useful in a fund raising or charity event. In particular, an event organizer may be presented with all locatable people having a user device within a geographic location of the event, such as in a ballroom. The user may select all the people presented. The payment provider may then send a payment request in the form of a donation request all the people. The request may have a nominal or relatively low donation amount, which can be revised by each payer. As such, potential donors can be easily found and contacted for payment.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["600","600","602","604","606","608","610"]},"Payer devices , payee device , user device , and payment provider device  (discussed in further detail below) may each include one or more processors, memories, and other appropriate components for executing instructions such as program code and\/or data stored on one or more computer readable mediums to implement the various applications, data, and steps described herein.
