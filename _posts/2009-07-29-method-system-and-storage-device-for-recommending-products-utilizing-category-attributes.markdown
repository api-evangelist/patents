{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present disclosure relates to determining related search suggestions. Internet search engines are used to search for information on the World Wide Web. As shown in , a search engine graphical user interface (GUI) is illustrated along with a user-specified query that has been entered in text field . When the user selects a send button , the query is submitted to the search engine which then processes the query. The search engine returns a result list that is an ordered list of references to documents (e.g., web pages) that are responsive to the query. This result list is then presented in the GUI ","In general, one aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in a method that includes a method comprising receiving a query for searching documents wherein the query specifies a first product; determining a number of occurrences of the first product in a plurality of prior queries of the documents submitted by users and verifying that the number of occurrences satisfies a criterion; determining a product category for the first product based on one or more attributes associated with the first product, the category having a predetermined plurality of category attributes; selecting a suggested product wherein the suggested product is associated with attributes that satisfy the category attributes; and providing the suggested product in response to the query. Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer program products.","These and other aspects can optionally include one or more of the following features. The query can comprise one or more of a product brand and a product model. The query can comprise the product brand, and further comprising: identifying as the suggested product, a popular product model associated with the product brand. The category attributes can comprise attributes that occur in one or more of the prior queries. One of the category attributes can be received from one or more of: one of the users, a system administrator, a merchandiser, and a manufacturer of the product. Selecting the suggested product can be based on a number of times documents containing the suggested product are selected by the users from results responsive to one or more of the prior queries. Selecting the suggested product can be based on a promotion associated with the suggested product. A price for the suggested product can be provided. User selection of the suggested product can initiate a process in which a user purchases the suggested product. User selection of the suggested product's price can initiate a process in which a user views one or more of product ratings, product reviews, product previews and product comparisons. Input can be received selecting the suggested product and causing the documents to be searched for the suggested product. The query can comprise a product brand and a product model, and wherein selecting the suggested product comprises selecting one or more other product models of the product brand where a distance between attributes of the other product models and the product model satisfies a criterion.","Particular implementations of the described subject matter can realize one or more of the following advantages. By using a product database that has information about various products, product brands, manufacturers, attributes and other related information, a precise and complete set of related product models can be identified in response to a product query. Related product model suggestions are further provided in response to product queries. The ability to purchase product models identified in product model suggestions is possible through user interaction with GUI elements accompanying the suggestions.","The details of one or more implementations are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, aspects, and advantages will become apparent from the description, the drawings, and the claims.","Like reference symbols in the various drawings indicate like elements.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 1B","b":"100","i":"b "},"By way of illustration, the GUI can include a search field and a send button . Users enter, for example, query \u201ccanon power shot g 9\u201d that specifies a product name for a product item into the search field and then select the send button to cause the search engine to search a corpus of documents for documents that are responsive to the query. A corpus is space of documents that a search engine can access such as the World Wide Web or a database, for instance. In some implementations, the GUI is implemented by a web browser or a software application having web browsing capability. Other GUI's are possible, including those that accept voice, touch, or gesture input. Moreover, some implementations provide a programmatic interface (e.g., an application programming interface) for the search engine rather than a user interface.","The search engine provides a result list of documents (e.g., by document title) that are responsive to the query . In this illustration, the result list includes, for example, a document entitled \u201cDCRP Review: Canon PowerShot G9\u201d , \u201cSteves Digicams\u2014Canon Powershot G9\u2014Hands on Review\u201d , and \u201cProtect Your Powershot G9 from Scratches\u201d . The result list can also contain a universal resource locator (URL) for each document reference. For example, \u201cZAGG.com\u201d is the URL for the document reference \u201cProtect Your Powershot G9 from Scratches\u201d . If a user selects (e.g., using with a mouse or other input device such as a keyboard, microphone, camera, touch panel, and so on) the document \u201cProtect Your Powershot G9 from Scratches\u201d  from the list , the selection will cause the GUI to present the associated document for viewing. Other relevant product data may be presented in the result list , e.g., product ratings, product reviews or product previews.","When the query specifies a product model, a list of suggested related product models that are similar to the specified product model specified are also provided by the search engine or other process. The list includes, for example, a set of suggested related product models \u201cSony cybershot dsc w55\u201d , \u201cNikon coolpix p5000\u201d , and \u201cSamsung s1050\u201d . The product models \u201cSony cybershot dsc w55\u201d , \u201cNikon coolpix p5000\u201d , and \u201cSamsung s1050\u201d have a set of similar attributes that belong in a set of important product attributes for a given category. In this case, it was determined that a product category \u201cdigital camera\u201d corresponds to the query \u201ccanon power shot g 9,\u201d and certain attributes, e.g., \u201cMegapixels,\u201d \u201cZoom,\u201d \u201cVideo Mode,\u201d and \u201cPrice\u201d are considered important category attributes for the category \u201cdigital camera.\u201d","For example, the related product models , , and share a set of similar attributes such as \u201c4 megapixels,\u201d \u201c3\u00d7 optical zoom\u201d and \u201cvideo mode.\u201d These attributes also satisfy the product category attributes \u201cmegapixels,\u201d \u201coptical zoom\u201d and \u201cvideo mode\u201d that correspond to the product category \u201ccamera.\u201d Users can select, for example, the related product model \u201cSony cybershot dsc w55\u201d from the result list . The selection of the related product model \u201cSony cybershot dsc w55\u201d then causes the search engine to search for documents relevant to the suggested related product model ",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 1C","FIG. 1B"],"b":["100","102","107","108","111","114","100","108","111","114","109","112","115","110","113","116","110","100","108","106","107"],"i":["b ","c ","c ","c","c","c ","b","c","c","c","c","c","c ","c","c","c ","c ","c ","c ","b ","c "]},"In other implementations, a user can select the \u201ccompare\u201d button (e.g., link ) which will cause the GUI to present a user interface where the user can view one or more of product ratings, product reviews, product previews and other related information associated with the related product models. The \u201ccompare button\u201d  can enable easy comparison between the related product models before purchase of a related product model.","As discussed in regards to , a user that is presented with the list of suggested related product models can also, for example, select the related product model \u201cSony cybershot dsc w55\u201d to search a corpus of documents (e.g., the web) for documents relevant to the selected related product model ","In various implementations, in response to the query the search engine or another process, retrieves the prices , , and corresponding respectively to the suggested related product models \u201cSony cybershot dsc w55\u201d , \u201cNikon coolpix p6000\u201d , and \u201cSamsung s1050\u201d , from a product database populated by multiple merchants or manufacturers of the products. In other implementations, the search engine obtains, for example, the price for the related product model \u201cSony cybershot dsc w55\u201d from a website that directly sells the related product model ",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","200","200","204","204","220","206","202","220","202"]},"The server system  includes an interface  that is used to communicate with the network  and one or more merchant feeds . The interface  can be a web server that communicates with one or more clients (e.g., , ) over the Internet. The interface  can also provide hypertext markup language (HTML) formatted web pages to the clients. A web browser may interpret these web pages for display on the client, for example. The displayed pages may function as a GUI for the server system , with the client  functioning as a user interface device, for instance. The interface  accepts queries  from the client  and, in turn, provides the queries to a query processor  for processing.","The server system  interacts with a search engine . In various implementations, the search engine  is able to search various data sources, for example, a corpus of documents (e.g., the web), a product database , a query logs  (e.g., previously submitted queries), and a popular product queries database . One or more indexes  are used by the search engine  and other processes to access these data sources.","In various implementations, the product database  includes a collection of product categories, respective product brands and product models corresponding to the product brands, and sets of attributes associated with the product categories. For example, a product database can include a collection of product categories such as \u201ccamera,\u201d or \u201claptop\u201d, a collection of product brands such as \u201cSony\u201d, \u201cNikon\u201d, \u201cDell\u201d, or \u201cLenovo\u201d, respective product models such as \u201cSony cybershot dsc w55\u201d, and \u201cDell Inspiron 1150\u201d, a collection of attributes such as \u201cmegapixels (MP)\u201d, \u201coptical zoom\u201d, or \u201clens\u201d corresponding to the product category \u201ccamera\u201d, and attributes such as, for example, \u201ccpu type\u201d, \u201ccpu clock speed\u201d and \u201cmemory\u201d corresponding to the product category \u201claptop\u201d.","The product database  comprises product listings and product related information that are submitted, for example, by several merchant feeds  (e.g., product ratings, product reviews, product previews). Merchant feeds  provide information about products such as technical specifications and prices. Information received on merchant feeds  can come from different sources such as servers for merchant systems, servers that aggregate product information from variety of sources, and systems that crawl shopping web pages to aggregate this information. The product information can be provided as Extensible Markup Language (XML) documents, for example.","The query logs  comprise prior queries received by the server system  from all users, one or more group of users, and\/or individual users. For instance, the query logs  can include one or more queries received from the client  or from other clients such as client N. The popular product queries database  can include product models, brands, or both that have been identified as popular based on an analysis of the query logs . A scanning module  scans the query logs  to identify occurrences of product names for product items, where product names can be model and\/or brand names in the prior queries. In some implementations, if a product model, a product brand, or both occur a predetermined or dynamically determined number of times within a given time period, they are included in the popular product queries database . Other ways for determining whether a query is popular are possible.","In further implementations, the popular product queries database  can also be automatically updated with product brands and\/or models associated with specific proposed search suggestions or product pages presented in search results that users have clicked on.","A query parser module  parses the queries  that specify product names to identify product brands, product models, or both specified in the queries. Generally, a query includes one or more terms. For example, a query \u201ccanon power shot g 9,\u201d includes the terms \u201ccanon,\u201d \u201cpower,\u201d \u201cshot,\u201d \u201cg,\u201d and \u201c9.\u201d The parser module  can identify that the term \u201ccanon\u201d correspond to a brand and the rest of terms \u201cpower shot g 9\u201d correspond to a model. The parser  can also identify that the one or more terms of a query correspond to either a brand or a product. For example, a query \u201cSony Vaio\u201d includes two terms \u201cSony\u201d and \u201cVaio\u201d. The parser  can identify that both terms together correspond to a brand. If only a product model is specified in the query, the corresponding brand can be determined from the product database , for example. After the parser module  identifies a brand, a model, or both in a query, the parser model  provides this information to a verification module .","In various implementations, the verification module  invokes the search engine  or other processes to match the brand identified from the query  by the parser module  with a brand provided in the popular product queries database . A brand match occurs, for example, when one or more terms for the brand specified in the query  matches one or more terms of a product brand in the database . The search engine  can then select among the product model queries associated with the product brand in the database , a product model query that matches the product model that the parser module  has identified in the model section of the query. For example, the user specified product model \u201cpower shot g 9\u201d can be matched, in the database , to a product model \u201cpowershot g9\u201d because both queries contain the same string of characters.","In some implementations, the query  comprises only information concerning a brand. The verification module  then invokes the search engine  to match one or more terms for the brand specified in the query  with one or more terms of a product brand in the database . The search engine  can then select, among the product model queries associated with the product brand in the database , the product model that has been identified as the most popular. The query processing  can use the most popular product model identified in the database  as a user specified product model in further processing of the query .","In other implementations, the verification engine  can invoke the search engine  or other process to search a product database (e.g., the product database ) to identify the product brand and\/or the product model specified in the query  for a product item. The product database  can, for example, include product information provided by merchants . Each product brand, which can include one or more terms, can be associated with one or more product models. For example, a product brand such as \u201ccanon\u201d can be associated with its product models such as \u201cpowershot g10,\u201d \u201cpowershot sx1 IS,\u201d and \u201cpowershot sx10 IS.\u201d","The verification module  utilizes the search engine  or other process to identify, in the product database , for example, a product brand that matches the product brand specified in the query . A brand match can occur, for example, between the product brand one or more terms specified in the search query  and the terms of a product brand provided by merchant feeds  in the product database .","For example, a user specified product brand \u201ccannon\u201d is a brand match of the product brand \u201ccanon\u201d provided in the product database  because the product brand \u201ccanon\u201d is the correct spelling of the user specified product brand \u201ccannon\u201d based on statistical data analysis of the product database, or other data mining and analysis techniques. The verification module  can then utilize the search engine  or other process to select, in the product database , from among the different product models provided for the matched product brand, a product model whose terms match the user specified product model. For example, the user specified product model \u201cpower shot g 9\u201d can be matched, in the product database , to a product model \u201cpowershot g9\u201d because both strings contain the same terms.","The query processor  can also include a category module  for determining a product category, e.g., \u201cdigital camera,\u201d for the identified product brand and model. The category module  can determine, for example, the product category in the product database, or based on other analysis techniques. For example, the category module  can determine that the product descriptions specified in the user query  are also associated with the category \u201cdigital camera\u201d in the product database .","The category module  determines the product category attributes based on one or more attributes associated with the product name specified in the search query . Indeed, the user query  can include one or more attributes of the specified product model and\/or the specified product brand. For example, for a query \u201ccanon power shot g 9,\u201d users may have commonly specified attributes such as \u201c3\u00d7 optical zoom,\u201d and \u201c4 Megapixels.\u201d","The category module  can also cause the search engine  or another process to identify attribute values of the user query  specified product model (or the product model that has been identified as the most popular in the database ) that occurred in prior queries submitted by users (e.g., the query logs ). For example, the query logs  can include prior product queries and also attribute values of those products that users entered in the prior queries (e.g., \u201c4 MP\u201d for a camera model, \u201c256 Mb RAM\u201d for a laptop).","In some implementations, the category module  causes the search engine  or other process, using the identified attributes of the user query  specified product model (or the product model that has been identified as the most popular in the database ) to select, for example, a product category in the product database  for the product model. The identified product category can have a predefined set of attributes. Each product category is provided with attributes that characterize the product category. For example, a product category such as \u201claptop\u201d can be provided with its associated attributes such as \u201cprocessor,\u201d \u201cRAM,\u201d and \u201cweight.\u201d","In various implementations, the predefined category attributes can be provided by users of the system , a system administrator, merchandisers or manufacturers of the product items that are included in the product database . For example, the system administrator can provide for the product category \u201cdigital camera\u201d attributes such as \u201cMP\u201d, \u201cZoom\u201d and \u201cVideo Mode\u201d.","A product category \u201cdigital camera\u201d can be provided in the product database  with attributes such as \u201coptical zoom,\u201d and \u201cMegapixels.\u201d For example, the search engine  matches the attributes \u201c3\u00d7 optical zoom,\u201d \u201c4 Megapixels\u201d of the query \u201ccanon powershot g 9\u201d with the attributes \u201coptical zoom,\u201d and \u201cMegapixels\u201d provided in the product database  for the product category \u201ccamera.\u201d The search engine  or other process thus determines that the product category \u201cdigital camera\u201d is the product category for the product query \u201ccanon power shot g 9.\u201d","The query processor  can also include a product brand module . The product brand module  can identify one or more product brands of the product category determined by the category module . These product brands can be different from the product brand that may have been specified in the user query . In some implementations, the product brand module  can select the product brands from a set of predetermined or dynamically determined product brands (e.g., product brands provided in the product database ). For example, the product brand module  can search the product database  for product brands provided under the product category determined by the category module .","In other implementation, the brand module  can search the popular product queries database  to identify one or more product brands for the product category that have been determined by the category module . The brand module  can select the product brands based on the number of times documents relevant to the respective product brands are selected by users as results for one or more of the prior queries.","Yet, in another implementation, the brand module  can, because of a promotion, select one of the product brands. For example, the promotion can be information associated with the brand such as a special offer to purchase the product or an advertisement. In another example, the promotion can also be information associated with a given product model for the brand. In another example, the product brand module  can select a product brand because a business entity that sells the product brand makes a special offer via a promotion enticing users to conduct business with the business entity regarding the product brand.","The query processor  also includes a product model module  that can, for each product brand determined by the product brand module , identify one or more product models that have attributes that satisfy the predetermined or dynamically determined category attributes. The product model module  can cause the search engine  or another process to search in the product database , for corresponding product models of a product brand that satisfy the category attributes. For example, in the product database , the product category \u201cdigital camera\u201d can include product brands such as \u201cCanon,\u201d \u201cSony,\u201d and \u201cNikon.\u201d For the product brand \u201cSony,\u201d the product model \u201cSony cybershot dsc w55\u201d can have attributes such as \u201c3\u00d7 optical zoom,\u201d \u201c4 Megapixels (MP)\u201d and a price range \u201c$200-$300\u201d that satisfy the category attributes for the category \u201cdigital camera\u201d for instance. These attributes can also be similar to the attributes of the selected or queried product model (e.g., query ). The query processor  can provide one or more of the identified respective product models (e.g., as product suggestions) in response to the query .","In some implementations, the product model module  can cause the search engine  or another process to search in a database (e.g., the product database ), for the user query  specified product brand, and identify as related product models, other product models from the user query  specified product brand that are \u201cnearby\u201d product models with respect to the user query  specified product model. Nearby product models, with respect to the user query  specified product model, are other product models from the user query  specified product brand that can be determined by a \u201cdistance\u201d between attributes (e.g., variation between attribute values of same attributes) of the user query  specified product model and the other product models. A distance algorithm computes distance between attributes of two product models.","The product model module  can then cause the search engine  or another process to return as related product models, the other product models of the user query  specified product model for which the distance between their attributes and attributes of the specified product model satisfies a criterion (e.g., the nearest distance, distance between attributes is within a predetermined or dynamically determined range). For example, the user query  has specified attributes \u201c8 MP\u201d, \u201c3\u00d7 zoom\u201d for a product model query \u201ccanon powershot g 9,\u201d thus, the product model module  can return as related product models, other product models of the product brand \u201ccanon\u201d that are associated with attributes \u201c7 MP\u201d and\/or \u201c4\u00d7 zoom","In other implementations, the query processor  can provide a first product model based on a promotion associated with the first product model that allows a preference of this particular first product model over the other first product models. The interface  can forward the product suggestions (search results ) to the client , where the results can be displayed to the user.","In further implementations, the query processor can compute a distance between attributes of the user query  specified product model and of the one or more product models identified by the product model module  in the product database . A notion of \u201cdistance\u201d or \u201csimilarity\u201d can be associated with each attribute. For example, a \u201c3\u00d7 optical zoom\u201d may be considered similar to a \u201c4\u00d7 optical zoom\u201d for the attribute \u201czoom,\u201d while a \u201c20\u00d7 optical zoom\u201d may be considered too dissimilar. The query processor  can then provide one or more of the identified respective product models (e.g., as related product suggestions) for which the attributes are similar or only slightly dissimilar to the category attributes if the attribute \u201cprice\u201d associated with the identified respective product model is within a predetermined or dynamically determined threshold.","In some implementations, the interface  can not only forward to the client  the product suggestions, but also forward a respective price for each related product model. In another implementation, the interface  can forward, to the client , the related product models suggestions (search results ), a respective price for each related product model, and further a corresponding selectable link to purchase the associated related product model. In other implementation, a user selection in the client  of a product model suggestion or of its respective price can allow the purchase of the product model.","In various implementations, the interface  can also present to the client  product ratings, product reviews, product previews or a comparison shopping link (e.g., \u201ccompare\u201d button ) that can allow comparing the related product models and additional product models before purchase. Product ratings, product reviews and product previews can be included in the product database and can be provided by merchants . For example, a user selection in the client  of a product model suggestion or of its respective price can also present in the client  information associated with the selected product model such as product ratings, reviews, previews, and comparison data between the selected product model and other product models.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","302"]},"The system matches the product brand and\/or the product model specified in step  with a product brand and\/or a product model contained in a database (e.g., query logs ) (step ). For example, the system determines the number of occurrences of a product brand \u201ccanon,\u201d the number of occurrences of the product model \u201cpower shot g 9\u201d or the number of occurrences of the query \u201ccanon power shot g 9\u201d in a plurality of prior queries, and verifies that the number of occurrences satisfies a criterion. If a model is not specified, a popular model for the specified brand can be used by default.","The system determines a product category in step  corresponding to the product brand and\/or the product model matched in step . For example, the user has specified the query \u201ccanon power shot g 9,\u201d which has attributes such as \u201c3\u00d7 optical zoom,\u201d and \u201c4 Megapixels\u201d in the product database  corresponding to the important category attributes (Zoom, Megapixels).

In other implementations, the processor  is a multi-threaded processor. The processor  can include multiple processing cores and is capable of processing instructions stored in the memory  or on the storage device  to display graphical information for a user interface on the input\/output device .","The memory  is a computer readable medium such as volatile or non volatile that stores information within the system . The memory  can store processes related to the functionality of the query processor , for example. The storage device  is capable of providing persistent storage for the system . The storage device  can include a floppy disk device, a hard disk device, an optical disk device, or a tape device, or other suitable persistent storage mediums.

The input\/output device  can include a keyboard, a pointing device, and a display unit for displaying graphical user interfaces.","The computer system shown in  is but one example. In general, implementations of the subject matter and the functional operations described in this specification can be implemented in digital electronic circuitry, or in computer software, firmware, or hardware, including the structures disclosed in this specification and their structural equivalents, or in combinations of one or more of them. Implementations of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented as one or more computer program products, e.g., one or more modules of computer program instructions encoded on a computer readable medium for execution by, or to control the operation of, one or more data processing apparatus.","The computer readable medium can be a machine-readable storage device, a machine-readable storage substrate, a memory device, or a combination of one or more of them. The term \u201cdata processing apparatus\u201d encompasses all apparatus, devices, and machines for processing data, including by way of example a programmable processor, a computer, or multiple processors or computers. The apparatus can include, in addition to hardware, code that creates an execution environment for the computer program in question, e.g., code that constitutes processor firmware, a protocol stack, a database management system, an operating system, or a combination of one or more of them.","A computer program (also known as a program, software, software application, script, or code) can be written in any form of programming language, including compiled or interpreted languages, and it can be deployed in any form, including as a stand alone program or as a module, component, subroutine, or other unit suitable for use in a computing environment. A computer program does not necessarily correspond to a file in a file system. A program can be stored in a portion of a file that holds other programs or data (e.g., one or more scripts stored in a markup language document), in a single file dedicated to the program in question, or in multiple coordinated files (e.g., files that store one or more modules, sub programs, or portions of code). A computer program can be deployed to be executed on one computer or on multiple computers that are located at one site or distributed across multiple sites and interconnected by a communication network.","The processes and logic flows described in this specification can be performed by one or more programmable processors executing one or more computer programs to perform functions by operating on input data and generating output. The processes and logic flows can also be performed by, and apparatus can also be implemented as, special purpose logic circuitry, e.g., an FPGA (field programmable gate array) or an ASIC (application specific integrated circuit).","Processors suitable for the execution of a computer program include, by way of example, both general and special purpose microprocessors, and any one or more processors of any kind of digital computer. Generally, a processor will receive instructions and data from a read only memory or a random access memory or both. The essential elements of a computer are a processor for performing instructions and one or more memory devices for storing instructions and data. Generally, a computer will also include, or be operatively coupled to receive data from or transfer data to, or both, one or more mass storage devices for storing data, e.g., magnetic, magneto optical disks, or optical disks.","However, a computer need not have such devices. Moreover, a computer can be embedded in another device, e.g., a mobile telephone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a mobile audio player, a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver, to name just a few. Computer readable media suitable for storing computer program instructions and data include all forms of non volatile memory, media and memory devices, including by way of example semiconductor memory devices, e.g., EPROM, EEPROM, and flash memory devices; magnetic disks, e.g., internal hard disks or removable disks; magneto optical disks; and CD ROM and DVD-ROM disks. The processor and the memory can be supplemented by, or incorporated in, special purpose logic circuitry.","To provide for interaction with a user, implementations of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented on a computer having a display device, e.g., a CRT (cathode ray tube) or LCD (liquid crystal display) monitor, for displaying information to the user and a keyboard and a pointing device, e.g., a mouse or a trackball, by which the user can provide input to the computer. Other kinds of devices can be used to provide for interaction with a user as well; for example, feedback provided to the user can be any form of sensory feedback, e.g., visual feedback, auditory feedback, or tactile feedback; and input from the user can be received in any form, including acoustic, speech, or tactile input.","Implementations can be implemented in a computing system that includes a back end component, e.g., as a data server, or that includes a middleware component, e.g., an application server, or that includes a front end component, e.g., a client computer having a graphical user interface or a Web browser through which a user can interact with an implementation, or any combination of one or more such back end, middleware, or front end components. The components of the system can be interconnected by any form or medium of digital data communication, e.g., a communication network. Examples of communication networks include a local area network (\u201cLAN\u201d) and a wide area network (\u201cWAN\u201d), e.g., the Internet.","The computing system can include clients and servers. A client and server are generally remote from each other and typically interact through a communication network. The relationship of client and server arises by virtue of computer programs running on the respective computers and having a client-server relationship to each other.","While this specification contains many specifics, these should not be construed as limitations on the scope of the invention or of what may be claimed, but rather as descriptions of features specific to particular implementations of the invention. Certain features that are described in this specification in the context of separate implementations can also be implemented in combination in a single implementation. Conversely, various features that are described in the context of a single implementation can also be implemented in multiple implementations separately or in any suitable subcombination. Moreover, although features may be described above as acting in certain combinations and even initially claimed as such, one or more features from a claimed combination can in some cases be excised from the combination, and the claimed combination may be directed to a subcombination or variation of a subcombination.","Similarly, while operations are depicted in the drawings in a particular order, this should not be understood as requiring that such operations be performed in the particular order shown or in sequential order, or that all illustrated operations be performed, to achieve desirable results. In certain circumstances, multitasking and parallel processing may be advantageous. Moreover, the separation of various system components in the implementations described above should not be understood as requiring such separation in all implementations, and it should be understood that the described program components and systems can generally be integrated together in a single software product or packaged into multiple software products.","Thus, particular implementations of the invention have been described. Other implementations are within the scope of the following claims. For example, the actions recited in the claims can be performed in a different order and still achieve desirable results. Moreover, the server environment, which is configured to provide electronic search service and employ the ranking systems and techniques described, need not be implemented using traditional back-end or middleware components. The server environment can be implemented using a program installed on a personal computing apparatus and used for electronic search of local files, or the server environment can be implemented using a search appliance installed in an enterprise network."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":"FIG. 1A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":"FIG. 1B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIG. 1C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 5"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
