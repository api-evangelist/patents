A cache uses a block of memory, such as disk space or other storage device, to temporarily store a copy of some data that is likely to be needed in the future.","When cache clients (i.e., entities that need data, such as computers or mobile terminals) try to access some data, they check the cache first. If the necessary data is available in the cache (\u201ccache hit\u201d) then the cached copy is used. If the data is not found in the cache (\u201ccache miss\u201d) then it is downloaded from the original source. In the case if a cache miss, a copy of the data is temporarily stored in the cache, for later access.","When new data is stored in a cache, often some previously cached data has to be removed in order to free up storage capacity. The strategies that determine what of the old data should be removed are called caching algorithms or caching replacement algorithms.","Any improvements in caching which increases accuracy is of great benefit. This will provide more hits and fewer misses, which improves performance and reduces network congestion.","An object of the invention is thus to improve caching.","According to a first aspect of the invention, it is presented a method for caching comprising the steps of: determining, in a caching server of a telecommunication network, a user profile to analyse; obtaining, in the caching server, a group of user profiles; obtaining correlation measurements for each user profile in the group of user profiles in relation to the user profile to analyse; and calculating a content caching priority for at least one piece of content of a content history associated with the group of user profiles, taking the correlation measurement into account.","By considering correlation between users, improved accuracy of the caching will be achieved. This will result in fewer cache misses and more cache hits, which improves the performance of the caching using the method. Accordingly, the caching is improved.","The step of obtaining correlation measurements may comprise obtaining correlation measurements from a central correlation measurement provider server in the telecommunications network. Using a central correlation measurement provider server allows for robust data integrity. Optionally, the correlation measurements can be distributed regularly or on demand (i.e. push or pull) from the central correlation measurement provider server down through the network.","The correlation measurements may be calculated when requested by the step of obtaining correlation measurements. By calculating the correlation measurement only when requested, i.e. on demand, the most recent data can be considered, yielding a more accurate correlation measurement. This can be performed centrally or in a node at a lower level of the network hierarchy, that is a node which is closer to the clients.","The correlation measurements may be calculated using static correlation data and\/or dynamic correlation data. This provides for great flexibility in using data sources for obtaining the correlation measurement.","The correlation measurements may be calculated using correlation data provided by a third party through an external application programming interface. Third parties can have more data on relationships between users in the system, which thus gives a more accurate correlation measurement and thereby better caching.","The step of obtaining a group of user profiles may comprise obtaining a group of all user profiles currently associated with the caching server. In other words, the relations to all users associated with the caching server are processed in order not to leave any potential relation out between the analysed user and users under the caching server.","The step of obtaining a group of user profiles may comprise obtaining a group of user profiles associated with the user profile to analyse. In other words, it is first determined what users have any sort of relationship with the user to analyse, and only those users are checked for correlation. This allows for improved efficiency.","The method may be started in response to a piece of content being accessed by the user profile to analyse. This allows the cache to become updated based on the most currently accessed data.","The method may be started in response to the user profile to analyse becoming associated with the caching server. For example, this can occur in a mobile network when the user of the user profile moves into an area of responsibility of the caching server.","The step of calculating a content caching priority the content history, may be a subset of a larger content history for the group of user profiles. This allows for more efficient processing as the entire content history can be rather extensive.","The method may further comprise the step of: determining whether to pre-fetch the content coupled to the content caching priority based on the calculated content caching priority. This can create a very efficient caching strategy, particularly when the caching server is located close to the client, such as in a base station or even co-located with the client.","The method may further comprise the step of: determining whether to keep or discard the content coupled to the content caching priority based on the calculated caching priority. This allows for cache management with a small delay due to the efficient update.","In the step of calculating a content caching priority, a content type factor may be utilised, wherein the content type factor varies for different types of content. This allows an operator of the system to configure a relative strength between various types of content. For example, web pages (text and\/or images) can be configured to be more important than video content.","In the step of calculating a content caching priority, a weighting factor for the user profile to analyse may be utilised, wherein the weighting factor for the user profile to analyse indicates a levels of service. This allows differentiation in caching for various users, e.g. bronze, silver, or gold subscriptions. Better caching can thus be configured to come at premium.","A second aspect of the invention is a caching server for caching comprising: cache storage; a user profile determiner arranged to determine a user profile to analyse; a group obtainer arranged to obtain a group of user profiles; a correlation measurement obtainer arranged to obtain correlation measurements for each user profile in the group of user profiles in relation to the user profile to analyse; and a content caching priority calculator arranged to calculate a content caching priority for at least one piece of content of a content history of the group of user profiles, taking the correlation measurement into account.","By considering correlation between users, improved accuracy of the caching will be achieved.

Optionally, the correlation measurements can be distributed regularly or on demand (i.e. push or pull) from the central correlation measurement provider server down through the network.","The telecommunication network may comprise a mobile communication network and the caching server may be coupled to a base station of the mobile communication network. A base station is a point in the network which is close to the clients and is responsible for communication with the clients, e.g. part of the radio access network in a mobile communication network.","The telecommunication network may comprise a wireless local area network and the caching server may be coupled to a wireless access point device of the wireless local area network.","The caching server may be comprised in a mobile terminal. By co-locating the caching server with the client, in this case a mobile terminal, great efficiency can be achieved, e.g. using pre-fetching.","The content caching priority calculator may calculate the correlation measurements when requested by the correlation measurement obtainer.

The caching servers -, \u2032 are located in different locations within the caching system . For instance, in the embodiment shown in , caching servers -are each connected to a respective network node -of a caching system . The network nodes -can for example be base transceiver stations, node B (in compliance with UMTS, Universal Mobile Telecommunications System), enhanced node B (in compliance with LTE, Long Term Evolution). Alternatively, the network nodes -can be wireless access points, e.g. in compliance with any of the IEEE 802.11 standards.","Each network node -has a set -of one or more associated clients. In this way, each of the caching servers -is responsible for the caching of a set of clients -. The clients -can be any suitable client capable of receiving digital content, e.g. a mobile terminal such as a mobile phone, personal digital assistant (PDA), netbook, or laptop computer. Alternatively or additionally, the client could even be in the form of a stationary desktop computer. The users of the clients -have an associated user profile, as identified using a user identifier. The user profile can for example be connected to a subscription, such as a mobile phone subscription. The user identifier can be a phone number, an e-mail address or any other suitable user identifier which is unique within the caching system. Whenever the term user is mentioned herein, it is to be interpreted as a user identifiable by a user identifier.","One or more third parties  can be connected to the correlation measurement provider server . This allows, for example, the third party  to provide data to the correlation measurement provider server  about usage history of a user, or connections between various users under the responsibility of the caching system .","For example, the third party  can be a server of a social networking website, such as FaceBook, MySpace or Twitter, or an instant messaging service such as Windows Live Messenger, ICQ or Google talk. Such websites can provide not only information regarding two users being connected, but can also provide a measurement of the extent to which they are connected, e.g. using communication history between two users. Alternatively or additionally, the third party  can be a server with access to some for of content history of the user, such as Google, or any content provider. For example, a video content website can have information that 80 percent of users that request content A also requests content B. This can for example indicate two pieces of content that are content parts that have been split up. In other words, in a situation where content A is requested, it would be beneficial to pre-fetch content B. Furthermore, online shopping platforms such as Amazon, Ebay, etc. can register preferences for different types of content for each user, along with relationships between users. DPI (deep packet inspection) capabilities would allow inferring some of this information from unencrypted traffic within the network.","Optionally, the caching servers can be arranged in a hierarchy. For example, a central caching server \u2032 can be provided with more storage and thereby save more content than each of the caching servers -that are arranged in a lower point in the hierarchy. This allows the central caching server \u2032 to serve as a second caching server if there is a miss in the local caching server -.

This would enable to maintain preferences related to the type of content a particular user is accessing from a particular type of device, potentially allowing for further optimisation of the caching process.","The social networking database can contain static as well as dynamic information. For example, the matrix described above, referring to static information, could be complemented by short-lived information describing similarities between users, such as user location or content accessed recently.","One possible algorithm to manage the correlation measurement between two users (nin the description above) is to increase this number when there is an indication of social relationship between the two users, and decrease the number with time. The increase can vary depending on the nature of the indication of relationship.","Another option is to increase the number corresponding to the relationship between the users (n) based on the rate of cache hits generated by the algorithm based on content accessed by one of the users.","The user history data base is part of the correlation measurement provider server . The user history data base stores a record of what data was accessed by each user based on information e.g. received from an external interface.","From an implementation point of view, the user history data base can be co-located or integrated with the caching servers . Since the caching servers  store the previously accessed data, the additional requirement is to store a list of users who have accessed the given piece of data. As the data storage in the caching servers  is temporary, the privacy of the user is not at risk. For longer periods, the user history data base stores for longer intervals only aggregate information related to general characteristics of the data that was accessed by a particular user.","As an extension, the user history data base can store the circumstances when a piece of data was downloaded. Examples are the downloading user's location, type of terminal, time of day, content accessed previously, etc.","While the embodiments herein are disclosed in conjunction with telecommunication and data networks, the present invention can be embodied in any digital communication network where caching is beneficial.","The invention has mainly been described above with reference to a few embodiments. However, as is readily appreciated by a person skilled in the art, other embodiments than the ones disclosed above are equally possible within the scope of the invention."],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS","p":["The invention is now described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":"FIGS. 1","i":["a","c "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIGS. 1"],"i":["a","c, "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0062"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0063"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0064"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0065"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 1"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
