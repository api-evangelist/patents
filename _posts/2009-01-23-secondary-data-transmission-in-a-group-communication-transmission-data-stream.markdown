Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to point-to-point or point-to-multipoint wireless communications systems. More specifically, the present invention relates to systems and methods for transmitting secondary data from within a communication channel established for group communications between wireless telecommunication devices.","2. Description of the Related Art","In wireless telecommunication devices, such as cellular phones, PDAs, mini-laptops, and advanced pagers, the devices typically communicate over long distances by bridging telephone calls through existing cellular telephone networks and passing data packets across the network. These wireless devices often have limited to significant data processing and computing capability, and can accordingly send and receive software programs, in addition to voice, across the telephone network. The communication channels established between the wireless telecommunication devices and the telecommunication portals, such as cellular base stations, have a limited bandwidth to allocate to any one particular device.","There exists a wireless telecommunication service that provides a quick one-to-one or one-to-many communication that is generically referred to as \u201cPush-To-Talk\u201d (PTT) capability. The specific PTT group of recipient devices for the communicating wireless device is commonly set up by the carrier. A PTT communication connection is typically initiated by a single button-push on the wireless device that activates a half-duplex link between the speaker and each member device of the group and once the button is released, the device can receive incoming PTT transmissions once the button is released. In some arrangements, the PTT speaker will have the \u201cfloor\u201d where no other group member can speak while the speaker is speaking. Once the speaker releases the PTT button, any other individual member of the group can engage their PTT button and they will have the floor.","In existing PTT systems, member devices establish a communication channel for an outgoing voice communication and a channel for incoming communications. It is preferable to optimize the quality of voice transmission, and therefore, the full bandwidth of each channel is typically utilized to transmit the voice data packets to insure a high fidelity transmission. If other data is needed to be sent from and to a wireless communication device, typically either a separate channel is opened to the device solely for the additional data, which is expensive, or other existing channels allocated to the device, such as signaling and control channels, are utilized for the additional data. However, utilizing the other channels restricts the communication on those channels, which is often already predetermined by the system such as with control channels, and can impair the functionality of the device on the wireless network.","Accordingly, it would be advantageous to provide a system and method for a wireless communication device that is a member of a group to have the ability to send and\/or receive non-voice data to and from other members of the group without necessarily opening an additional communication channel or utilizing and interfering with other channels established for other features and functions. The system and method should not compromise the integrity of other PTT communications or unduly utilize device resources. It is thus to the provision of such a system and method to allow this secondary data transmission that the present invention is primarily directed.","Briefly described, the present invention includes a system, method, and wireless communication device that allows the transmission of secondary data in a group-communication data stream between wireless communication devices across a wireless communication network. The wireless communication device selectively transmits at least group-directed voice communication data to other members of the group, such as a push-to-talk (PTT) group, and selectively sends secondary data in the same communication channel as the voice data, even though the communication channel has a limited bandwidth. A group-communication server can receive the voice communication data and secondary data, and will then selectively transmit at least the voice communication data to other member wireless communication devices of the communication group, and the secondary data can be sent to one or more members of the group. To facilitate secondary data transmission, the wireless communication device can be embodied so as to reduce the data size of the voice communication data to a second data size that is less than the bandwidth of the communication channel so that secondary data can be transmitted within the communication channel.","In one embodiment, the system for transmitting secondary data in a group-communication data stream between wireless communication devices includes at least one wireless communication device that is a member of a communication group of wireless communication devices that communicate with each other in direct group communications across a wireless communication network, with the wireless communication device configured to selectively transmit at least group-directed voice communication data to other members of the communication group in a communication channel having a limited bandwidth thereof, and secondary data to other computer devices, such as members of the group, across the wireless communication network with the transmission of the secondary data occurring in the communication channel in combination with the voice communication data. The system includes at least one group-communication server that is configured to receive voice communication data and secondary data from wireless communication device and selectively transmit at least the voice communication data to other member wireless communication devices of the communication group. If so embodied, the voice communication data will have a first data size thereof and the wireless communication device can be further configured to reduce the first data size of the voice communication data to a second data size that is less than the bandwidth of the communication channel and transmit secondary data within the communication channel in combination with the voice communication data of the second data size.","In one embodiment, the method of transmitting secondary data in a group-communication data stream between wireless communication devices includes transmitting at least voice communication data from at least one wireless communication device that is a member of a communication group of wireless communication devices that communicate with each other in direct group communications across a wireless communication network, with the at least one wireless communication device configured to selectively transmit at least group-directed voice communication data to other members of the communication group and secondary data to other computer devices across the wireless communication network, and the transmission of the voice communication data and secondary data occurring in a communication channel having a limited bandwidth thereof. If so embodied, the voice communication data has a first data size thereof, and the method includes reducing the first data size to a second data size that is less than the bandwidth of the communication channel, and transmitting secondary data within the communication channel in combination with the voice communication data of the second size.","In one embodiment, the wireless communication device, which is a member of a communication group of wireless communication devices that communicate with each other in direct group communications across a wireless communication network, is configured to selectively transmit at least group-directed voice communication data to other members of the communication group in a communication channel having a limited bandwidth thereof and secondary data to other computer devices across the wireless communication network. The transmission of the secondary data occurs in the same communication channel as the voice communication data. The voice communication data can have a first data size thereof and the wireless communication device can be further configured to reduce the first data size to a second data size that is less than the bandwidth of the communication channel and transmit secondary data within the communication channel with the voice communication data of the second data size.","The present system and method are therefore advantageous in that they give a wireless communication device the ability to transmit and receive non-voice data to and from other wireless communication device members of the group without needing to open additional communication channel or utilizing other channels. The voice communication data can even be reduced to allow greater secondary data throughput. The system and method thus allows the non-voice data to be communicated without unduly utilizing device resources or other dedicated communication channels.","Other objects, features, and advantages of the present invention will become apparent after review of the Brief Description of the Drawings, Detailed Description of the Invention, and the Claims.","In this description, the terms \u201ccommunication device,\u201d \u201cwireless device,\u201d \u201cwireless communications device,\u201d \u201cPTT communication device,\u201d \u201chandheld device,\u201d \u201cmobile device,\u201d and \u201chandset\u201d are used interchangeably. The terms \u201ccall\u201d and \u201ccommunication\u201d are also used interchangeably. The term \u201capplication\u201d as used herein is intended to encompass executable and non-executable software files, raw data, aggregated data, patches, and other code segments. The term \u201cexemplary\u201d means that the disclosed element or embodiment is only an example, and does not indicate any preference of user. The term \u201ccommunication channel\u201d means the same data flow in a real or virtual data traffic channel or other established socket. Further, like numerals refer to like elements throughout the several views, and the articles \u201ca\u201d and \u201cthe\u201d includes plural references, unless otherwise specified in the description.","With reference to the figures in which like numerals represent like elements throughout,  illustrates one embodiment of the system  for sharing group media among one or more wireless telecommunication devices in a PTT group , such as the wireless telephone , smart pager  and personal digital assistant (PDA) , with other wireless telecommunication devices across a wireless network . In the system , each wireless telecommunication device ,, is capable of selectively directly communicating across the wireless communication network  with a target set of one or more other wireless telecommunication devices of the plurality. For example, the target set for mobile telephone  can be all devices in the communication group  or a subset thereof, such as pager  and PDA .","Typically, the wireless telecommunication device (such as mobile telephone ) notifies the group communication computer device, shown here as server , which is present on a server-side LAN  across the wireless network , that the wireless device is present, i.e. accessible, on the wireless network . The group communication computer device  can either keep the information on group member devices on the wireless network  or share this information with the set of target wireless telecommunication devices designated by the first wireless telecommunication device, or can also share it with other computer devices resident on the server-side LAN  or accessible across the wireless network . The group communication computer device  can have an attached or accessible database  to store the group identification data for the wireless devices. A data store , shown here as file management server, is also present on the server-side LAN . It should be appreciated that the number of computer components resident on server-side LAN , or across the wireless network , or Internet generally, are not limited.","The direct communication, such as a PTT voice communication, can be established through a half-duplex channel between the communicating wireless telecommunication device ,, and the one or more other wireless telecommunication devices of the target set. Also, the group communication computer device  can attempt to bridge the requested direct communication with the target set without knowledge of the wireless telecommunication devices of the target set actually receiving the PTT communication sent. Alternately, the group communication computer device  can inform the PTT transmitting wireless telecommunication device ,, of the inability to bridge a direct communication to the target set . Further, while the group communication computer device  is shown here as having the attached database  of group identification data, the group communication computer device  can have group identity data resident thereupon, and perform all storage functions described herein.","In overview, the system  can reuse an existing PTT data stream, such as an RTP voice stream, to carry custom application data packets to other computer devices, rather than set up a separate communication pathway. A PTT-enabled system already has established connectivity to the group members, so there is a great advantage to reusing the existing connectivity. The system  allows the transmission of secondary data in a group-communication data stream between wireless communication devices ,,, where at least one wireless communication device, such as telephone , that is a member of a communication group  of wireless communication devices that communicate with each other in direct group communications across a wireless communication network , selectively transmits at least group-directed voice communication data to other members of the communication group  and secondary data to other computer devices, such as wireless pager  and PDA , across the wireless communication network . The transmission can occur in the communication channel, which has a limited bandwidth, so that additional communication channels are not required to send the secondary data.","In the system , it is desirous to maintain a specific \u201cquality of serve\u201d (QoS) for the voice data transmission between the wireless communication devices. If bandwidth is limited for the transmission of data, especially with a limited amount of communication channels available for data transmission, the sending of secondary data within the limited communication channels could interrupt the voice data and degrade the QoS. The system  will therefore allow the secondary data transmission in the limited communication channel(s) while still maintaining QoS in the voice communications.","A group-communication server  receives the voice communication data and secondary data from the at least one wireless communication device (telephone ) in the same communication channel and selectively transmits at least the voice communication data to other member wireless communication devices of the communication group . As further described in , wireless communication device (telephone ) is preferably further configured to reduce the first data size of the voice communication data (up to the equivalent of bandwidth data slot size A) to a second data size (size C) that is less than the bandwidth (A) of the communication channel, and then transmit secondary data (data block having size B in slot ) within the communication channel in combination with the voice communication data (data block having size C in data slot ) of the second data size. Alternately, the wireless communication device  can keep the voice communication data at the current size and simply insert secondary data when adequate bandwidth is available, with the inserted secondary data up to the maximum bandwidth A. In such embodiment, however, a guaranteed throughput of secondary data may not be possible as transmission in each data slot  is not assured if bandwidth is not available. Several communication channels that are in use can also be utilized in the present direction, in both the forward and reverse direction, such that each channel can implement the transmission or receipt of secondary data.","The system  can further include a data store  in communication with the group communication computer device(s) , with the group communication computer device  configured to send group-directed media to the data store , as is further described herein. The data store  is configured to receive the group-designated media from the wireless communication device (such as mobile phone ) and selectively permit members of the communication group  for which the group-directed media was sent to access the stored group-directed media across the wireless communication network .","The secondary data can be group-directed media, such as graphic media, such as pictures in JPEG, TIF, and the like, audio files such as MP3, MP4, WAV, and the like. The media can also be streaming media, such as a multimedia application (Powerpoint, MOV file, and the like). The group-directed media can also be streaming media, or an interactive session on another computer device on the wireless communication network , such as a game hosted on data store  or private bulletin board. Also, the group-directed media could be half-duplex video conferencing among members of the communication group wherein the picture of the speaker is broadcast to the other group members in substantial real-time, or in delay.","The size of these media files can be very large, and because of the potential delay of sending the media, or inability of the receiving wireless communication device to handle the sent media, the system  can use a data store  (or file management server or other computer storage device or memory) to store the secondary data such that the secondary data can be selectively sent to the target members of the communication group  able to receive the secondary data, preferably without interrupting other PTT communications. Furthermore, upon receipt of the secondary data by at least one of the member wireless devices of the communication group , the group communication computer device  can send to the wireless communication device ,, sending the secondary data an acknowledgement that at least one member wireless communication device of the communication group  received the secondary data.","The wireless communication device ,, can target data to the group communication computer device  at the time of requesting the secondary data to be sent, e.g. send to a target list, and thus, the group communication device  will send or store the secondary data to the member wireless communication devices identified in the communication group identification data based upon one or more criteria as is further discussed herein. Alternately, prior to the wireless communication device sending secondary data, the wireless communication device ,, can request member data for a communication group  from the group communication computer device , and the group communication computer device  can identify one or more of the target devices that can and\/or will receive the secondary data. In one embodiment, the communication group computer device  can filter the potential communication groups available based upon their member devices' capability to receive secondary data.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["32","70","72","74","76","20","32","50","14","16","18","32"]},"The group communication server(s)  are connected to a wireless service provider's packet data service node (PDSN) such as PDSN , shown here resident on a carrier network . Each PSDN  can interface with a base station controller  of a base station  through a packet control function (PCF) . The PCF  is typically located in the base station . The carrier network  controls messages (generally in the form of data packets) sent to a messaging service controller (\u201cMSC\u201d) . The carrier network  communicates with the MSC  by a network, the Internet and\/or POTS (\u201cplain ordinary telephone system\u201d). Typically, the network or Internet connection between the carrier network  and the MSC  transfers data, and the POTS transfers voice information. The MSC  can be connected to one or more base stations . In a similar manner to the carrier network, the MSC  is typically connected to the branch-to-source (BTS)  by both the network and\/or Internet for data transfer and POTS for voice information. The BTS  ultimately broadcasts and receives messages wirelessly to and from the wireless devices, such as cellular telephones ,,,, by short messaging service (\u201cSMS\u201d), or other over-the-air methods known in the art. It should also be noted that carrier boundaries and\/or PTT operator network boundaries do not inhibit or prohibit the sharing of data as described herein.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["14","78","12","14","80","14","14","82","20","82","84","84","84","86","84","88"]},"As shown here, the wireless device can be a mobile telephone , with a graphics display , but can also be any wireless device with a computer platform  as known in the art, such as a personal digital assistant (PDA), a pager with a graphics display , or even a separate computer platform  that has a wireless communication portal, and may otherwise have a wired connection to a network or the Internet. Further, the memory  can be comprised of read-only or random-access memory (RAM and ROM), EPROM, EEPROM, flash cards, or any memory common to computer platforms. The computer platform  can also include a local database  for storage of software applications not actively used in memory . The local database  is typically comprised of one or more flash memory cells, but can be any secondary or tertiary storage device as known in the art, such as magnetic media, EPROM, EEPROM, optical media, tape, or soft or hard disk. The graphics display  can present not only information about the ongoing group call, but also the information on the group-directed media, to include a file preview as is more fully described herein.","In this embodiment of the wireless device , the computer platform  also includes a communication interface  that can open one or more communication channels from the wireless device . The communication interface  is typically configured as a standard communication interface for the wireless communication device which ordinarily carries the voice and data transmitted to and from the wireless device. The communication interface  typically is comprised of hardware as is known in the art.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["82","100","102","104","104","102","104"]},"The PTT Client  is an application that offers access to PTT services and applications  through an external interface, here shown at a PTT-aware UI . The PTT Client  includes all the functions required to enable mobile operating system  data applications . In addition to providing access to PTT services with the PTT Client , the PTT Client  preferably acts as an isolation layer between all PTT-aware applications and the interface to the group communication computer device . In this embodiment, the PTT Client  maintains access to PTT services, responds to group communication requests, processes all PTT-aware mobile operating system applications requests for PTT services, processes all outgoing PTT requests, collects and packages vocoder packets for originating PTT talk spurts, and parses packets of vocoder data for terminated PTT talk spurts.","The data applications  can communicate and pass secondary data through the PTT interface, and can be developed entirely as a mobile operating system-based application or used in combination with an AMSS  interface. The data applications  invoking the appropriate APIs and program interfaces, such as those from other resident PTT and applications .","In one embodiment, the system will have a new payload type for custom secondary data, which is filtered either at the group communication server , or at the receiving wireless communication device ,,. A class ID (or generic application ID) will be embedded by the sending data application  in the RTP payload such that the receiving computer device can route the received packets to the appropriate data application . Thus, multiple data applications could be using the PTT interface and communication channel at any one time, but only one of them would be data application  that would \u201cunderstand\u201d the received custom data packet.","In order to increase the likelihood of data delivery, the custom data packets can be retransmitted, as necessary. However, such configuration may actually increase bandwidth usage. The same secondary data packet can simply be retransmitted according to preconfigured or signaled retransmission values. In one embodiment, the same packet can be transmitted multiple times and the receiving computer device could use the timestamp or a sequence number (\u201cseqnum\u201d) to filter out duplicate packets. However, this method of retransmission can violate certain standard transmission protocols, such as RFC4588. Alternately, for increased likelihood of delivery, the application can use multiple PTT streams (but all in the same communication channel, i.e. various talk \u201cspurt\u201d data streams) to transmit the same packet. However, this embodiment will require using different SSRC values.","In another embodiment, the data applications  use a convention for a certain range of the SSRC values which are reserved for reuse. For example, the first 3 bits of the SSRC are reserved for identifying multiple streams. A receiving data application  then assumes that incoming streams with identical SSRCs from bit  to  are transmitting the same data, and filter out retransmitted packets on that basis. It should be noted that while Internet protocol dictates that SSRC should be random, this approach makes the SSRCs only mostly random. If the group communication server  signals multiple SSRC values to all receiving wireless communication devices (or computer devices), this would not violate the protocol.","It should be noted that group-communication server  can be configured to send both voice and secondary data, but those functions can be distributed among several servers or computer devices, typically across the LAN , with the secondary data not necessarily being associated with the voice communication data at the receiving computer device. Although, in PTT communications with the secondary data intended to supplement the voice data, it is preferably to associate the secondary with the voice data for ease of handling at the receiving computer device. In an embodiment where the communication group is limited to a primary wireless communication device of the member wireless communication devices ,, that can transmit group-directed voice communications to the group  at a specific time, i.e. an arbitrated floor, the wireless communication device  will be configured to transmit voice-communication data and secondary data upon the wireless communication device ,, being the primary wireless communication device, i.e. has the floor. Alternately, the wireless communication device ,, can be further configured to transmit secondary data independently of having the floor, as is further described below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["120","120","124","126","122","124","122","126","14","16","18","32","124","126","14","16","18"]},"In one embodiment, the sending application will break up larger data voice packets into smaller blocks, thereby requiring the receiving computer device (group communication server  or wireless communication device ,,) to reassemble the larger data packets and\/or the data stream, similar in functionality to segment structuring in transmission control protocol (TCP). This functionality can also be implemented in user datagram protocol (UDP). If so embodied, the starting and ending seqnums are transmitted so the receiving computer device can determine all blocks of the packet are received and if any of the blocks are missing, the received packets can be discarded.","In one embodiment, as the group communication server  is designed to only forward secondary data from a transmitting wireless communication device ,, that has been granted the floor. On the transmitting device, the data application  can prepend, append, or embed a custom data packet in the middle of a voice data stream, possibly even increasing the overall bandwidth. The transmitting wireless communication device can monitor the bandwidth usage by tracking frame size(s) of the voice stream \u201cthrottle\u201d when it sends custom data packets. If a stream of several frames are detected (number required would depend on data packet size, for example one standard is a 118-rate) the wireless communication device ,, can use the extra bandwidth available due to the smaller media packets to send a custom data packet with secondary data.","In one embodiment, the group communication server  informs the data application  applications (through OS  and then the PPT-Aware UI ) what the group communication bandwidth capability is so applications can adjust the size and\/or frequency of data packets being sent. This will allow richer features in the OS  and\/or PTT layer as larger or more frequent data delivery is achieved when all data applications  have larger than normal bandwidth capabilities.","Additionally, the group communication server  can inform the wireless communication device ,, what the minimum voice data packet requirement is such that the wireless communication device ,, can reduce the voice data size to a second data size above that minimum, thereby causing the voice communication data to have voice data of a second, likely poorer quality. The wireless communication device ,, can thereby transmit secondary and voice communication data of a second size to comprise the full bandwidth (bandwidth A in ) of the communication channel. Furthermore, several communication channels can be used with the same method applied to the full bandwidth of each available channel, and the secondary data can be split up across the several channels.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["162","14","16","18","110","162","166","168","110","110","162","110"]},"The call setup request can contain, for instance, the target user address, the non-voice data application ID, the media type, and an indication that the non-voice data is to be shared using the same floor control mechanism as the PTT call. The call setup request may also be sent with a DataOverSignaling Access channel message. A Dispatch Call Handler (DCH) (not shown) performs the PTT call setup functions, including locating the target, applying call restrictions, selecting a vocoder and assigning Media Control Unit (MCU)  resources.","The target PTT Client  verifies that the target user is available to participate in the call and that the data application  associated with the secondary data application ID is present on the target client wireless communication device ,,. The target PTT Client  sends an acknowledgement to the indicating that the call has been accepted. Once the acknowledgement is received from the target PTT Client , a floor grant message is sent to the originating PTT Client , which indicates the call is being established and the PTT Client  can start collecting voice data and\/or secondary data for transmission. The PTT Client  notifies the data application  that the call setup was successful and group-directed media can be sent. The PTT Client  also notifies the user that the user can begin speaking. The PTT Client  collects and buffers both the voice media (the user's talk spurt) and the non-voice data that is received from the data application . Once the MCU  contact information message is received and acknowledged by the originating PTT Client , the buffered media is sent to the MCU . The MCU  waits for the target PTT Client's  acknowledgment of the MCU  contact information message prior to forwarding the voice and non-voice data to the target device. When the target PTT Client  receives the media, it may filter the media based on the synchronization source (SSRC) and payload type to process the PTT media correctly. The payload of the custom data packet could contain a list of SSRC (or any identifier) to route data packets to. The MCU will then only forward these packets to the member devices identified as capable of receipt, which is either known to the MCU  or sent from the transmitting device. Thus, a sending data application  can transmit data packets to only a subset of the group members  who host the requisite data application  that is responsible for processing the secondary data.","In another embodiment, the group communication server  can maintain a second \u201cfloor\u201d used solely for secondary (non-voice) data packet transmission. In such manner, data applications  can send custom data at any time during a PTT call regardless of the state of the \u201cvoice floor.\u201d The data application  requests the voice floor for transmitting talk spurts and the data floor for transmitting data packets, or both. If enough bandwidth is available, the group communication server  (and supporting devices) can grant multiple data and voice floors. If the wireless environment in which the group members are running have access to adequate resources, for example 38400 kbps, the group members would have enough bandwidth to support several RTP streams, both incoming and outgoing. The group communication server  will then provide multiple floors, permitting more than one data application  to hold a floor for data transmission (or potentially also the voice floor) at any one time.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 6"],"b":["14","16","18","14","16","18","130","132","132","134","160","134","136","138","134","150","152"]},"Otherwise, if there are voice packets being sent at decision , a determination is made as to whether there is also secondary data to be sent to one or more other group members, as shown at decision . If there is no secondary data being sent at decision , then the voice data is sent, as shown at step , and then the PTT communication is ended, as shown at termination . However, if there is secondary data for transmission at decision , then the non-voice, secondary data packets are prepared for transmission, as shown at step , and then a determination is made as to whether there is bandwidth for the data packets in the PTT communication channel, as shown at decision .","If there is adequate bandwidth at decision  for the non-voice data packets in the PTT stream, then the non-voice packets are send in the PTT stream and the process returns to decision  to again determine if there is more voice and non-voice data to be sent. Otherwise, if there is insufficient bandwidth for the non-voice data packet(s) in the PTT communication channel at decision , the voice packets size in the PTT data stream are reduced in size (as is shown in ), as shown at step , and then the non-voice packet(s) are sent in the PTT stream as shown in step , and then process again iterates to decision  to determine if more voice and non-voice data is present for sending. In this embodiment, the sending of the voice and non-voice data packets is typically to the group communication server , but can alternately be directly to a member wireless device on another communication path (e.g. PTP, Internet, or other wireless or wired pathway), or other another computer device on the wireless network .","It can thus be seen that system  provides a method for transmitting secondary data in a group-communication data stream between wireless communication devices ,,, that includes transmitting at least voice communication data from at least one wireless communication device ,, that is a member of a communication group  of wireless communication devices that communicate with each other in direct group communications across a wireless communication network , with at least one wireless communication device (such as telephone ) configured to selectively transmit at least group-directed voice communication data to other members of the communication group  and secondary data to other computer devices (such as group member  and ) across the wireless communication network . The transmission of the voice communication data and secondary data occurs in a communication channel having a limited bandwidth thereof, e.g. size A in . In one embodiment, the voice communication data  has a first data size thereof, and the first data size is selectively reduced to a second data size that is less than the bandwidth A of the communication channel, such that the secondary data  is transmitted within the communication channel along with the voice communication data of the second size, as shown in .","The transmission of the secondary data can be to other wireless communication devices ,, of the communication group , or can be transmission to a group communication server  such that the group communication server  receiving the secondary data and forwarding the secondary data to other wireless communication devices ,, of the communication group . The voice communication data can include voice data of a first quality, and the method includes reducing the first data size to the second data size which thereby causes the voice communication data to have voice data of a second quality. The method can include associating the secondary data with the voice communication data, or alternately that the data is not associated and can travel independently of each other. The method can also further include sending the secondary data such that the secondary data and voice communication data of a second size comprise a full bandwidth A of the communication channel, as shown in .","Further, the transmission to the communication group  can be limited to a primary wireless communication device of the member wireless communication devices that can transmit group-directed voice communications to the group at a specific time, such as a device that has the floor, and the transmitting of voice-communication data and secondary data occurs upon the wireless communication device ,, being the primary wireless communication device. Otherwise, the transmitting of secondary data can occur independently of the wireless communication device ,, being the primary wireless communication device, such as with a secondary data \u201cfloor.\u201d","In view of the methods being executable on a mobile device and other computer platforms, the method can accordingly be performed by a program resident in a computer readable medium, where the program directs the mobile device or other computer device having a computer platform to perform the steps of the method. The computer readable medium can be the memory of the server, or can be in a connective database. Further, the computer readable medium can be in a secondary storage media that is loadable onto a wireless communications device computer platform, such as a magnetic disk or tape, optical disk, hard disk, flash memory, or other storage media as is known in the art.","In one or more exemplary embodiments, the functions described may be implemented in hardware, software, firmware, or any combination thereof. If implemented in software, the functions may be stored on or transmitted over as one or more instructions or code on a computer-readable medium. Computer-readable media includes both computer storage media and communication media including any medium that facilitates transfer of a computer program from one place to another. A storage media may be any available media that can be accessed by a computer. By way of example, and not limitation, such computer-readable media can comprise RAM, ROM, EEPROM, CD-ROM or other optical disk storage, magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices, or any other medium that can be used to carry or store desired program code in the form of instructions or data structures and that can be accessed by a computer. Also, any connection is properly termed a computer-readable medium. For example, if the software is transmitted from a website, server, or other remote source using a coaxial cable, fiber optic cable, twisted pair, digital subscriber line (DSL), or wireless technologies such as infrared, radio, and microwave, then the coaxial cable, fiber optic cable, twisted pair, DSL, or wireless technologies such as infrared, radio, and microwave are included in the definition of medium. Disk and disc, as used herein, includes compact disc (CD), laser disc, optical disc, digital versatile disc (DVD), floppy disk and blu-ray disc where disks usually reproduce data magnetically, while discs reproduce data optically with lasers. Combinations of the above should also be included within the scope of computer-readable media.","While the invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to a preferred embodiment thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and detail may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention as set forth in the following claims. Furthermore, although elements of the invention may be described or claimed in the singular, the plural is contemplated unless limitation to the singular is explicitly stated."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 7"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
