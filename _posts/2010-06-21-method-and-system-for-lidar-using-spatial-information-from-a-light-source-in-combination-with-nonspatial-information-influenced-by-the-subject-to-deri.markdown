QGI increases versatility in imaging objects of interest. The imaging is adaptable to adverse imaging situations and there is a benefit to exploiting quantum optical information to image objects through partially obscuring media, i.e., optical turbulence, obstructions, smoke, and fog. Imaging through obscuring media is difficult; such as the difficulty of driving in foggy weather.","Quantum entanglement is a quantum mechanical phenomenon in which the quantum states of two or more quantum particles are linked together such that the quantum state of one quantum particle appears to interact with its counterpart; even though the individual quantum particles may be spatially separated. This apparent interconnection leads to correlations between observable physical properties of remote systems, since the interaction of the remote system with quantum state of one of a pair can be observed though observation of the counterpart. For example, according to quantum mechanics, the spin of a quantum particle is indeterminate until such time as some physical intervention is made to measure the spin; which, in general, could equally be spin-up or spin-down. However, when two members of an entangled pair are measured, one will always be spin-up and the other will be spin-down, regardless of the distance between the two particles. It is normally taught in quantum theory that no hidden variable theory can account for these results of quantum mechanics. The statistics of multiple measurements must generally relate to an inequality (called Bell's inequality), which is violated both by quantum mechanical theory and experimental results.","The non-classical two-photon interaction or quantum entanglement was described by Albert Einstein et al. (Einstein, Podolsky, Rosen paradox), \u201cCan Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?\u201d Physical Review, Volume 47, May 15, 1935, pgs. 777-800. The paradox of quantum entanglement, as described therein, relates to the concept that as a result of the process of measurement of a first system, using quantum mechanics, two different physical quantities are obtainable in the second system, despite the fact that at the time of the measurements, the two systems no longer interact and the second system is not disturbed in any way by the first. Einstein, et al, were unable to reconcile this quantum mechanical description of reality with the so-called classical physics determination that no \u201creal\u201d change can take place in the second system as a consequence of anything that may be done to the first system after the two systems no longer interact.","The theoretical work reported by Klyshko in \u201cCombined EPR and Two-Slit Experiments: Interference of Advanced Waves\u201d, Physics Letters A, Volume 132, number 6.7, pp. 299-304 (1988) see also, Sov. Phys. Usp. 31, 74 suggested a non-classical two-photon interaction could exist.","The first two-photon imaging experiment was reported by Pittman et al., in \u201cOptical Imaging by Means of Two-photon Quantum Entanglement,\u201d Physical Review, A, Vol. 52, No. 5, November 1995. According to the Pittman article, a two-photon optical imaging experiment was performed to test the two-particle entanglement as described by Albert Einstein et al. (Einstein, Podolsky,Rosen), referenced above, to determine if there was a correlation in position and in momentum for an entangled two-photon system; using \u201ctest beam or path\u201d and \u201creference beam or path\u201d photon pairs. Specifically, an aperture placed in front of a fixed detector was illuminated by a signal beam through a convex lens. A sharp magnified image of the aperture was found in the coincidence counting rate when a mobile detector was scanned in the transverse plane of the reference beam at a specific distance in relation to the lens. The experiment was named \u201cghost imaging\u201d due to its surprising nonlocal feature.","Additional experiments are reported in Pittman, et al. \u201cOptical Imaging by Means of Two-Photon Entanglement,\u201d Phys. Rev. A, Rapid Comm., Vol. 52, R3429 (1995) and ghost interference by Strekalov, et al, \u201cObservation of Two-Photon \u2018Ghost\u2019 Interference and Diffraction,\u201d Phys. Rev. Lett., Vol. 74, 3600 (1995), which together stimulated the foundation of quantum imaging in terms of multi-photon geometrical and physical optics.","Boto and colleagues (Boto, Agedi, et al.), in \u201cQuantum Interferometric Optical Lithography: Exploiting Entanglement to Beat the Diffraction Limit\u201d, Physical Review Letters, Volume 85, Number 13, 25 September 2000, The American Physical Society, pgs. 2733-2736, developed an entangled multi-photon system for sub-diffraction-limited imaging lithography and proposed a heuristic multiphoton absorption rate of a \u201cnoon\u201d state and proved that the entangled N-photon system may improve the spatial resolution of an imaging system by a factor of N, despite the Rayleigh diffraction limit. The working principle of quantum lithography was experimentally demonstrated by D'Angelo, Milena, et al., in \u201cTwo-Photon Diffraction and Quantum Lithography\u201d, Physical Review Letters, Volume 87, Number 1, Jul. 2, 2001, pgs. 1-4, by taking advantage of an entangled two-photon state of spontaneous parametric down-conversion. Applications relating to quantum entanglement have been described, inter alia, in a series of patent applications by the present inventors.","Quantum-inspired Ghost-imaging, as used herein, refers to techniques such as those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 7,536,012 ('012 Patent), to R. Meyers and K. Deacon, entitled \u201cEntangled Quantum Communications and Quantum Imaging,\u201d filed Jul. 28, 2004 (provisional filing date Aug. 6, 2003). The '012 Patent discloses, inter alia, an apparatus for generating a shared quantum key between a sender and a receiver comprising a sending apparatus which generates entangled photon pairs, and a receiving apparatus. The shared quantum key is generated from stochastic temporal coincidences between sender photon detection data and receiver photon detection data shared over the communication link. The '012 Patent further discloses an apparatus for image transmission from a sender to a receiver with the sending apparatus including a source of entangled photons providing an entangled beam, a beamsplitter, an image generator, and a beam recombiner, the entangled beam being incident on the beamsplitter, the beamsplitter providing a first beam which illuminates the image generator, and a second beam which does not interact with the image generator, the beam recombiner combining the first beam and the second beam into a transmitted beam which is then sent to the receiving apparatus. The receiving apparatus comprises a receiver beamsplitter, a first receiver detector for providing first receiver data, a second receiver detector for providing second receiver data, and a coincidence circuit. The transmitted beam is split by the receiver beamsplitter into a first receiver beam incident on the first receiver detector, and a second receiver beam incident on the second receiver detector. The coincidence circuit reconstructs the image from determined coincidences between the first receiver data and the second receiver data.","In application Ser. No. 12\/343,384, to R. Meyers and K. Deacon, entitled \u201cMethod and System for Quantum Imaging Using Entangled Photons Pairs,\u201d filed Dec. 23, 2008, hereby incorporated by reference, there is disclosed a system using entangled photon pairs in which a first part of entangled pair is sent towards a target while a second part is sent along a reference path for future measurement. If the first part of the entangled photon pair is absorbed or reflected by the target, it will effect a property (e.g., spin, polarization, transverse momentum, angular momentum, color) of the photon. The influence by the target is also reflected in the reference photons. By knowing the time of flight, one can determine the distance that the reference photon travels. Similarly, by identifying reference photons which exhibit changed characteristics (such as color, spin, polarization), one can determine the possible existence of a target or object in the target space; i.e., it can determined whether it is likely or unlikely that there was a target in the space based upon the reference path entangled photon that travelled during the same time period.","In application Ser. No. 12\/330,401, to R. Meyers and K. Deacon, entitled \u201cMethod and System for Creating an Image Using Quantum Properties of Light Based Upon Spatial Information From a Second Light Beam Which Does not Illuminate the Subject\u201d [ARL07-33] filed Dec. 8, 2008, hereby incorporated by reference, in a preferred embodiment, incoherent, partially coherent, chaotic or entangled light source is reflected from a subject target into a bucket detector which does not process spatial information and in effect, merely measures the \u201cquantity\u201d of light reflected from the subject into the bucket detector. A second detector is a spatial detector illuminated by the light source. Using spatial information from the second detector in conjunction with the light measurement from the first detector, an image is generated using coincidence circuitry.","As discussed in the '401 Application, The ability to image through obscuring media (e.g., smoke or clouds) remains a problem in a variety of fields, such as satellite imaging analysts, firefighters, drivers, oceanographers, astronomers, military personnel, and medical personnel. The ability to improve resolution in each of these exemplary instances represents an opportunity to derive more information from images and presumably the decisions made from such images. By way of example, improved resolution in x-ray or endoscopy medical imagery facilitates lower radiation dosing and diagnosis of abnormal morphologies earlier than currently possible with conventional imaging methodologies. Conventional imaging techniques have, to a large extent, arrived at the theoretical limits of image resolution owing to wavelength-limited resolution, optical element distortions, and the reflective interaction between photons and an object to be imaged.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["11","2","3","4","5","20"]},"Currently, there is a need for improvement and miniaturization of ladar capability for use on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), UGS and UGV platforms. Attempts at other solutions to image by penetration of obscurants have involved use of different wavelengths and polarimetry. In cases in which these techniques are not effective, do not produce three dimensional information, or when they cannot be employed it would be helpful to have small package three dimensional imaging methods such as Ghost Ladar to penetrate obscuring media such as smog and fog to produce three dimensional images.","A number of near-infrared, prototype laser detection and ranging (LADAR) Systems have been developed based on the chirp, amplitude-modulated LADAR (CAML) architecture. The use of self-mixing detectors in the receiver, that have the ability to internally detect and down-convert modulated optical signals, have significantly simplified the LADAR design. Single-pixel, self-mixing, InGaAs-based, metal-semiconductor-metal detectors have been designed, the details of which are set forth in Aliberti, et al., \u201cCharacterization of InGaAs self-mixing detectors for chirp amplitude-modulated ladar (CAML),\u201d Proc. SPIE, Vol. 5412, 99 (2004); doi:10.1117\/12.542072 Online Publication Date: 20 Oct. 2004, hereby incorporated by reference.","For ease of understanding, the terminology \u201ctest path\u201d may be used to designate the path or beam of the photon(s) entering the object or target area. The terminology \u201creference path\u201d will be used to designate the beam or path that the reference photon(s) travels.","Quantum imaging has so far demonstrated two peculiar features: (1) reproducing ghost images in a \u201cnonlocal\u201d manner, and (2) enhancing the spatial resolution of imaging beyond the diffraction limit. Both the nonlocal behavior observed in the ghost imaging experiment and the apparent violation of the uncertainty principle explored in the quantum lithography experiment are due to the two-photon coherent effect of entangled states, which involves the superposition of two-photon amplitudes, a nonclassical entity corresponding to different yet indistinguishable alternative ways of triggering a joint-detection event in the quantum theory of photodetection as articulated by Glauber in \u201cThe Quantum Theory of Optical Coherence\u201d, Physical Review, Volume 130, Number 6, pp. 2529-2539, Jun. 15, 1963, and \u201cCoherent and Incoherent States of the Radiation Field\u201d, Physical Review, Volume 131, Number 6, 15, pp. 2766-2788, September 1963. The nonlocal superposition of two-photon states may never be understood classically. For further discussion, see U.S. application Ser. No. 12\/330,401, hereby incorporated by reference. The ongoing lack of theoretical understanding of ghost imaging has hampered efforts to develop reflective ghost imaging systems for practical field uses in such fields as satellite, field, medical and research imaging. Moreover, there exists a need for a system using ghost image where feedback or measurement is not possible at the target area.","Traditionally, imagers have collected two dimensional information on objects in the field of view. Addressing the additional need for range, Ladar systems have been developed to identify the range information at each pixel thus extending images to three dimensions as disclosed in greater detail in \u201cCharacterization of InGaAs self-mixing detectors for chirp, amplitudemodulated LADAR (CAML)\u201d by Keith Alibertia, et al. U.S. Army Research Laboratory, 2800 Powder Mill Road Adelphi, Md. 20783, hereby incorporated by reference.","There are generally two types of Lidars, one which measures the time delay using short pulses of laser light and the other uses time delay using modulated waveforms. While Lidar systems are an extension of two dimensional images that incorporate range in the third dimension, augmentation of their capability is needed; particularly when considering utilization of Lidar systems in all types of adverse imaging situations, where there is a benefit to the exploitation of three dimensional quantum optical information to image objects through partially obscuring media, i.e., smoke, fog and optical turbulence. Lidar systems have had some limited success in penetrating some smoke, fog and clouds, but they have limitations when the scattering or absorption is too large. In addition, Lidar systems require circuitry for time processing of spatial information.","The resent invention relates in general to a process and apparatus for 3-D imaging. A preferred embodiment has range imaging capability and scattering penetration associated with \u201cGhost-imaging.\u201d The extension of Ghost-imaging capability to three dimensions and miniaturization of lidar enables use on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), UGS and UGV platforms.","Attempts at solutions to image by penetration of obscurants have involved the use of different wavelengths and polarimetry. The present invention provides a solution in cases where prior techniques are ineffective or cannot be employed, or when they cannot produce three-dimensional information. A preferred embodiment provides a small package, three dimensional imaging method that is capable of penetrating obscuring media such as smog and fog. A preferred embodiment three-dimensional Ghost-imaging Ladar images objects in three dimensions through adverse imaging scenarios, overcoming scattering challenges, with reduced processing time using photon coincidence measurements.","As shown in , a laser source  directs a beam of photons  to a target area  and a \u201cbucket\u201d detector\/sensor  located at a distance D may be used to measure reflected and scattered photons R. A second detector  is spaced a distance D from the target area . A correlation and phase difference calculator  calculates the phase difference between sensors  and . A modulator  may be used on laser beam  to modulate the temporal and spatial profiles of the beam .","An embodiment of the present invention can be used to generate 3-D images from photons that have not interacted with object being imaged. As an example, can be used to detect 3D features of objects which absorb but reflect only minimal light. An embodiment of the present invention provides 3-D Image generation by photons that have never directly interacted with the object being 3-D imaged.","A preferred embodiment Ladar sends out successive pulses of light according to an appropriate changing beam formation and composition to become incident on the target object and surrounding objects and then scatter and reflect. Between successive pulses a single pixel bucket detector will receive reflected and scattered photons as a function of time from each pulse. This is not customary for Ghost-imaging in which ensembles of only a single coincidence time window are usually considered. A lens will be used to collect and focus the return photons onto the photon bucket detector as is customary for Ghost Imaging. A quantum photon mathematical equation will project the reference light intensity from the initial pulse to a down-beam position and intensity value. This will be combined with bucket photon information for an ensemble of pulses to produce coincidence measurements needed for Ladar imaging. Each time interval after initiation of a pulse will correspond to a range distance of an object. Since ghost imaging has a narrow depth of focus each object at each distance can be resolved based on their delay from the initial pulse. The preferred embodiment Ladar imaging of a complicated scene will render in focus all those parts of objects at a given range r=ct\/2 where t is the time for a Ghost Ladar photon to travel to the object and return. Thus a 3D scene can be constructed from slices of in-focus images returned at each t between pulses. The period between pulses can be delayed to cover all expected returns. Optionally, other methods such as multiplexing can be used to increase frequency of pulses. Optionally, to improve imaging with fewer pulses modern compressive imaging techniques can be used. These may provide approximately a factor of ten decrease in measurements needed.","A preferred embodiment of the present invention provides the ability to obtain correct structured illumination (using, for example, speckles) and obtain accurate timing with many repetitions so as to create a sufficiently large ensemble of measurements. Several types of sensors can be used that can measure optical information at sufficient speeds to resolve in the nanosecond or smaller time intervals. Various alternate techniques include use of single photon counting modules, high speed laser communication hardware, or windowed coincidence detectors and other fast detectors that ensure sufficient time resolution and repetition rate to acquire an ensemble in a short enough time to produce a successful 3-D Ghost Ladar image.","Optionally, the only sensor in Ghost Ladar may be a single pixel photon detector which suggests a myriad of Army Ghost Ladar applications related to UAV, UGS, and UGV platforms such as compressed 3D image acquisition and exfiltration. The research will also test the limits of the ability of the Ghost Ladar to penetrate obscurants.","The present invention now will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which embodiments of the invention are shown. However, this invention should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein. Rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art. In the drawings, the dimensions of objects and regions may be exaggerated for clarity. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout. As used herein the term \u201cand\/or\u201d includes any and all combinations of one or more of the associated listed items.","The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to limit the full scope of the invention. The terms lidar, Lidar, Ladar and ladar are equivalent for purposes used herein. As used herein, the singular forms \u201ca\u201d, \u201can\u201d and \u201cthe\u201d are intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. It will be further understood that the terms \u201ccomprises\u201d and\/or \u201ccomprising,\u201d when used in this specification, specify the presence of stated features, integers, steps, operations, elements, and\/or components, but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, integers, steps, operations, elements, components, and\/or groups thereof","It will be understood that when an element such as an object, layer, region or substrate is referred to as being \u201con\u201d or extending \u201conto\u201d another element, it can be directly on or extend directly onto the other element or intervening elements may also be present. In contrast, when an element is referred to as being \u201cdirectly on\u201d or extending \u201cdirectly onto\u201d another element, there are no intervening elements present. It will also be understood that when an element is referred to as being \u201cconnected\u201d or \u201ccoupled\u201d to another element, it can be directly connected or coupled to the other element or intervening elements may be present. In contrast, when an element is referred to as being \u201cdirectly connected\u201d or \u201cdirectly coupled\u201d to another element, there are no intervening elements present.","It will be understood that, although the terms first, second, etc. may be used herein to describe various elements, components, regions, layers and\/or sections, these elements, components, regions, layers and\/or sections should not be limited by these terms. For example, when referring first and second photons in a photon pair, these terms are only used to distinguish one element, component, region, layer or section from another region, layer or section. Thus, a first element, component, region, layer or section discussed below could be termed a second element, component, region, layer or section without departing from the teachings of the present invention.","Furthermore, relative terms, such as \u201clower\u201d or \u201cbottom\u201d and \u201cupper\u201d or \u201ctop,\u201d may be used herein to describe one element's relationship to other elements as illustrated in the Figures. It will be understood that relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in addition to the orientation depicted in the Figures. For example, if the device in the Figures is turned over, elements described as being on the \u201clower\u201d side of other elements would then be oriented on \u201cupper\u201d sides of the other elements. The exemplary term \u201clower\u201d, can therefore, encompass both an orientation of \u201clower\u201d and \u201cupper,\u201d depending of the particular orientation of the figure. Similarly, if the device in one of the figures is turned over, elements described as \u201cbelow\u201d or \u201cbeneath\u201d other elements would then be oriented \u201cabove\u201d the other elements. The exemplary terms \u201cbelow\u201d or \u201cbeneath\u201d can, therefore, encompass both an orientation of above and below. Furthermore, the term \u201couter\u201d may be used to refer to a surface and\/or layer that is farthest away from a substrate.","As used herein the terminology target path, object path, target beam, object beam, test path or test beam refers to the beam or path directed to the target or object space and or area. The terminology reference path or beam relates to the photon path or beam which is detected and\/or measured. The terminology is not intended to limit the scope of the invention inasmuch as other terminology could be used to similarly describe similar operating systems.","Embodiments of the present invention are described herein with reference to cross-section illustrations that are schematic illustrations of idealized embodiments of the present invention. As such, variations from the shapes of the illustrations as a result, for example, of manufacturing techniques and\/or tolerances, are to be expected. Thus, embodiments of the present invention should not be construed as limited to the particular shapes of regions illustrated herein but are to include deviations in shapes that result, for example, from manufacturing. For example, a region or object illustrated as a rectangular will, typically, have tapered, rounded or curved features. Thus, the regions illustrated in the figures are schematic in nature and their shapes are not intended to illustrate the precise shape of a region of a device and are not intended to limit the scope of the present invention.","Unless otherwise defined, all terms (including technical and scientific terms) used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. It will be further understood that terms, such as those defined in commonly used dictionaries, should be interpreted as having a meaning that is consistent with their meaning in the context of the relevant art and will not be interpreted in an idealized or overly formal sense unless expressly so defined herein. It will also be appreciated by those of skill in the art that references to a structure or feature that is disposed \u201cadjacent\u201d another feature may have portions that overlap or underlie the adjacent feature.","As used herein the terminology object or target space means an area or space in which a target may or may not be detected. In medical applications, the target may be a body or a component of the body. In environmental applications, the target area may be an area in space which is subject to surveillance. The target subject to surveillance may be an aerial vehicle or the like, a satellite, or an object in space. The target area may also be at ground level and involve areas of the ground or landscape. Accordingly, the invention may be used for purposes of mapping or imaging an area on the ground.","An embodiment of the present invention utilizes a 3D Quantum-Image Ladar capability that is capable of imaging objects in three dimensions through adverse imaging scenarios. That would exploit the Ladar time resolution and photon source capability as well as the quantum-imaging optical information processing to overcome increased scattering challenges. Quantum-imaging exploits quantum optical information using photon coincidence measurements. For Quantum-imaging photon energy needs to be put onto a target and a bucket detector must measure reflected and scattered photons. The energy would be put on target by the ladar part of the quantum ladar and combining it with time resolving ghost imaging technique for producing the quantum ladar three dimensional image.","In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the ladar  will send out successive pulses of light  according to an appropriate changing beam formation and composition to become incident (or illuminate) the target object  and surrounding objects and then scatter and\/or reflect. A modulator M may be used to modulate the spatial and temporal profile of the light from the laser . The quantum ladar will send out successive pulses of light according to an appropriate changing beam formation and composition to become incident on the target object and surrounding objects and then scatter and reflect. Between successive pulses a single pixel bucket detector will receive reflected and scattered photons as a function of time from each pulse. Successive pulses are divided by the period 2\u03c0. A lens may be used to collect and focus the return photons onto the photon bucket detector.","In the preferred embodiment shown in , a laser  sends out an amplitude modulated speckle light pattern that reflects and scatters due to target object . The returned and scattered light is collected by a first detector or sensor  at a distance D. Detector  may be a bucket detector. A second detector or sensor , which also may be a bucket detector, is positioned at a distance D and receives scattered and reflected light. In a preferred embodiment, D is not equal to D. The intensity versus time signals from the two detectors are compared to compute a phase shift between the two received signals at the first and second detectors  and . The phase shift is proportional to distance and unambiguous us to a 2 pi value of the phase shift; since in the case of a periodic signal having a period of 2 pi, the signal repeats after 2 pi. The image is computed as a function of equivalent time delay from the laser to the object and back to the bucket detectors  and .","Shown in  is another preferred embodiment in which a laser  sends light through a thermalizing element T which creates a light pattern. A beam splitter  is used to split the beam from the laser  into a target path A and a reference path R. The pattern of the beam is recorded by a charge coupled device (CCD)  or the like which records spatial information concerning the light pattern as discussed more fully in U.S. application Ser. No. 12\/330,401, hereby incorporated by reference. In its simplest terms, CCD is a device for the movement of electrical charge from the detector area () to an area where the charge can be manipulated, for example conversion into a digital value. CCDs may be implemented as shift registers that move charge between capacitive bins in the device. The CCD device may be made up of semiconductors arranged in such a way that the electric charge output of one semiconductor charges an adjacent one. The CCD device may be integrated with an image sensor, such as a photoelectric device to produce the charge that is being read for digital imaging. The CCD device  may optionally be a camera, photodetector array or a photographic device capable of imaging the beam pattern B. The beam pattern comprising the spatial information concerning the light beam B is sent to computer . Light Beam A is directed to the target  and the returned and scattered light is collected by a first detector or sensor  at a distance Dl. Detector  may be a bucket detector, or any kind of detector which has the capability of detecting a photon strike. A second detector or sensor , which also may be a bucket detector or any detector having the capability of detecting a photon strike, is positioned at a distance D and receives scattered and reflected light. The detectors  and  are spaced a known distance apart so a phase shift can be computed based upon the speed of light, \u03c6=(4\u03c0*r* f\/c. Detectors  and  need not be alike; and either may be of a large variety of photo detectors well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. A feature of the preferred embodiments of  is that the detectors  and  need not record spatial information regarding the target . Instead, spatial information is recorded by spatial detector . The spatial information recorded by spatial detector  is transmitted to the computer  which combines and correlates this spatial information with the coincidence data received from detectors  and . For example, the data recorded by a detector  or  may be transmitted to computer  in a form resembling that depicted in , where roughly 200 normalized \u201cbucket\u201d measurements are represented.","The spatial information from detector  is combined with the coincidence information from the detectors ,  in computer . Computer  may be a microprocessor, processor, multiprocessor, CPU, mainframe, or any computing element capable of combining the spatial information from the detector  with the coincidence information from detectors , . Further description of the coincidence detection feature is found in U.S. Pat. No. 7,536,012 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/330,401, both of which are hereby incorporated by reference.

In the preferred embodiments of , D is not equal to D. The intensity versus time signals from the two detectors are compared to compute a phase shift between the two received signals at the first and second detectors  and . The phase shift is proportional to distance and unambiguous us to a 2 pi value of the phase shift; since in the case of a periodic signal having a period of 2 pi, the signal repeats after 2 pi. The image is computed as a function of equivalent time delay from the laser to the object and back to the bucket detectors  and .","A quantum photon mathematical equation will project the reference light intensity from the initial pulse to a down-beam position and intensity value. This will be combined with \u201cbucket\u201d photon information (such as that exemplified in ) for an ensemble of pulses to produce coincidence measurements needed for \u201cghost\u201d Ladar imaging. The terminology \u201cghost\u201d relates to the feature that the spatial information is not reflected from the target but is either derived from the modulation of the laser beam in  or the spatial information obtained through the use of beam splitter  and detector  which records spatial information from a beam which has not \u201cseen\u201d or illuminated the target.","Each time interval after initiation of a pulse will correspond to a range distance of an object. Since \u201cghost\u201d imaging has a narrow depth of focus each object at each distance can be resolved based on their delay from the initial pulse. Ghost Ladar imaging of a complicated scene will render in focus all those parts of objects at a given range r=ct\/2 where t is the time for a Ghost Ladar photon to travel to the object and return. Thus a 3-D scene can be constructed from slices of in-focus images returned at each t between pulses. The period between pulses can be delayed to cover all expected returns. After proof of concept, other methods such as multiplexing can be used to increase frequency of pulses. To improve imaging with fewer pulses modern compressive imaging techniques can be used. Compressive techniques facilitate approximations resulting in decreasing the number of measurements necessary.","The ability to correct structured information (e.g., speckles) and obtain accurate timing with many repetitions so as to create a sufficiently large ensemble of measurements is described further in U.S. Pat.

The laser beam illuminates a MEMS mirror which is controlled by an HV Amplifier . The ladar utilizes a pulsed laser as a means to determine range to a pixel and a two-axis MEMS mirror to establish the angular direction to a pixel. Referring to the block diagram of , a trigger signal commands an Erbium fiber laser S to emit a short 2-3 ns pulse of light at a rate of 200 kHz that is collimated and then directed to the surface of a small MEMS mirror . Analog voltages from a high voltage amplifier  set the pointing direction of the mirror. Light reflected from the mirror is then fed into a telescope that \u201camplifies\u201d the scan angle of the MEMS mirror . Light backscattered from the target is collected by a detector (described above).

The light source used may be a nearly diffraction free source rather than a Gaussian light source. The approach was to find diffraction free patterns that will propagate down beam with the self mending property. The problem is mitigated in several ways. One technique is to bundle a number of fibers in parallel that each launch self-mending solitions of light that substitute for speckles. Another technique is to use a fiber positioner on the diffraction free light source fiber and have it undergo a high speed random displacement and launch the light solitons in random transverse positions. Our solution to producing the variation of the signal source was to randomly displace the center of the Bessel beam projected through a spatial light modulator (SLM). A Bessel beam is nearly diffraction free and has a self-mending property upon interaction with particulate disturbances. The Bessel beam approach is depicted in, inter alia,  to be successful.  is a shematic layout of the Bessel beam illumination ghost imaging experiments. Quantum Ghost Imaging (QGI) may use a plurality of sensors. The first sensor (CCD ) is a camera that looks at the reference beam of the light source. Second sensors (, ) may be single-pixel photon bucket detector that collects photons from a separate test beam path that are scattered and reflected from the object to be imaged. The quantum ghost image is constructed from the Glauber G() coherence using the coincidence measurements of photons. QGI is quantum, since it can use entangled photons or thermal photons that have a nonlocal, nonfactorizable property. The term QIGI may be used since only a photon bucket detector is used. The G() is computed using projected patterns of light for the reference beam and not the measured patterns of light. As the illuminating Bessel beam pattern (insert A in ) is transmitted, each illumination pattern of the SLM was saved in computer memory so the QIGI could be computationally reconstructed using the additional photon bucket detector values. Detectors ,  may comprise a single-pixel distant photon bucket detector as the only sensors. A diffraction free laser light source may be used in place of the usual transverse Gaussian or spatially random intensity beam. Diffraction free light beams penetrate though obscuring media far better than Gaussian beams. The diffraction free light beams have a self mending property in that when they encounter a small absorber their shape is temporarily distorted, but as they pass around the absorber they re-form into a self-similar shape. There is some loss of energy, but the concentrated light beam shape is maintained. This is a near ideal property for putting energy on target in the presence of the small and large particulates that occur in military smokes and fog. The diffraction free source can be fabricated from axicon lenses, special fiber optics, diffraction gratings, or an SLM (T, A, R) and a laser .","The schematic layout for the basic experiments using Bessel beams is shown in . A laser beam was expanded and transmitted through an SLM A to impress on the laser beam profile the phase for a Bessel beam. Single-pixel photon bucket detectors ,  were used to collect photons scattered and reflected from the object. This beam was then propagated to a target, in this case, the letters \u201cARL\u201d as represented by target  in . For example, the ARL may be a 10-point font size. To achieve reasonable illumination coverage over the ensemble of measurements of the target area, the Bessel beam patterns were randomly translated in x and y on the SLM. The sum, or equivalently the average, of all the Bessel beams used for illumination were computed and are displayed in . The patterns were not quite uniform; rather they exhibited some structured variation, although most of the space was filled.","Bessel patterns were randomly translated in x and y across the field of view by modulating the SLM for different illumination patterns on the target ().  is an illustrative image of the coarse Bessel pattern illuminating the ARL target. A single-pixel, photon-counting bucket detector collected and measured the light reflected from the \u201cARL\u201d target (). These \u201cbucket\u201d measurements were then combined with the known Bessel illumination patterns (see insert A, ) to generate an image of the object (). Fine-scale illumination patterns can be resolved with high resolution fine images. Coarse Bessel patterns were used in an attempt to see if they could resolve fine lettering, where the distance between maxima in the illuminating beam was greater than the size of the letter dimensions. This first set of experiments was performed without obscuration to align and test the optics and SLM properties. Test images () revealed that coarse Bessel beams could resolve the fine letters.","Obscured Experiments","The light beam  was passed through an offset pinhole (less than 2 mm in diameter) placed between an \u201cARL\u201d target and the Bessel beam source. The target \u201cARL\u201d was not in the direct line of sight from the laser to pin hole. The experiments were performed again using the randomly translated Bessel patterns similar the one used in . As was anticipated from the self-mending property of the Bessel beams, one was able to generate a ghost image under such an adverse condition that was only slightly degraded from the unobscured ghost image in .","Quantum Inspired Ghost Imaging","The SLM was used to project random illumination patterns onto a model soldier to generate ghost images of a threedimensional (3-D) opaque object. Varying numbers of \u201con\u201d illuminating pixels of the SLM were used in these experiments.
