{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The description relates to using a mobile device to remotely control a computing device.","Mobile devices such as smart phones, portable digital assistants (PDAs) and tablet computers have become ubiquitous. Smart mobile devices can be configured to send and receive emails, access the World Wide Web using a browser, and\/or perform many tasks that formerly required a desktop or laptop computer. Many mobile devices include touch-sensitive displays that can be used by a user to provide various types of input and\/or control applications operating on the mobile devices for a variety of tasks. For example, a user can interact with the user interface (UI) components, which are virtually displayed on a touch-sensitive display of a mobile device, through physical interactions (such as gestures) with the touch-sensitive display.","Although touch-sensitive displays of mobile devices can used to perform a variety of functions, these mobile devices often lack the processing capabilities required to execute resource-intensive applications. For example, touch-sensitive displays can be useful for image processing tasks, but mobile devices having such displays may lack the processing capabilities required to run sophisticated image processing applications. While more powerful computers have the resources to run such applications, these types of computers often lack touch-sensitive displays and\/or the mobility of a mobile device.","In one general aspect, a computer-readable storage medium can store instructions that when executed cause a mobile device to perform a process. The instructions can include instructions to establish a portion of a communication link with a host device, and receive, at the mobile device, an instance of at least a portion of a user interface operating at the host device and associated with an application operating at the host device. The instructions can include instructions to receive a first signal at the mobile device from a drawing device, to receive a second signal produced by a touch-sensitive display, and to send, via the portion of the communication link, a third signal representing an interaction of the drawing device with the instance of the user interface on the touch-sensitive display of the mobile device based on the first signal and the second signal.","In another general aspect, a computer-readable storage medium can store instructions that when executed cause a mobile device to perform a process. The instructions can include instructions to establish a portion of a communication link with a mobile device, and send an instance of at least a portion of a first user interface operating at the host device and associated with an application operating at the host device to the mobile device. The instructions can include instructions to receive, via the portion of the communication link, a signal representing an interaction of a drawing device with the mobile device, and send, in response to the signal, an instance of at least a portion of a second user interface operating at the host device and associated with the application.","In yet another general aspect, a computer-readable storage medium can store instructions that when executed cause a mobile device to perform a process. The instructions can include instructions to receive a first signal produced by a touch-sensitive display and representing an interaction of a drawing device at a location within the touch-sensitive display of the mobile device, and receive a second signal produced by the drawing device and representing an interaction of the drawing device with a surface of the touch-sensitive display. The instructions can include instructions to receive, at the mobile device, an instance of at least a portion of a user interface operating at a host device and associated with an application operating at the host device, and define, based on the combination of the first signal and the second signal, at least a portion of an image simulating an interaction of a writing instrument type with the user interface.","The details of one or more implementations are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features will be apparent from the description and drawings, and from the claims.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["120","110","110","120","105"]},"The host device  and mobile device  are collectively configured so that the mobile device  can be used to access (e.g., control) one or more applications operating at the host device . Moreover, the mobile device  can function as an extension of (or as a satellite controller) of the host device . Accordingly, the mobile device  can have functionality that is not available at the host device  and can be used in conjunction with the host device  to enhance the functionality of the host device .","For example, in cases where the host device  does not have a touch-sensitive display, and where the host device  has processing capabilities not available at the mobile device , the host device  and mobile device  can be collectively configured so that a user can use the touch-sensitive display  of the mobile device  to control and\/or interact with applications operating (e.g., executing) using the processing resources of the host device . Accordingly, the mobile device  can be used by the user to obtain the benefits of the touch-sensitive display  (e.g., touching and\/or gesturing capabilities such as dragging, pinching, etc.), which may not be native to (or available at) the host device , in combination with the processing power and\/or other computational resources available on the host device .","As a specific example, a user interface  (UI) (e.g., a graphical user interface) can be associated with an application operating at the host device . At least a portion of (e.g., an instance of or copy of) the user interface  can be sent to (e.g., delegated to) the mobile device  and displayed on the touch-sensitive display  of the mobile device . A copy of a user interface (or portion thereof) sent from the host device  for display at the mobile device  can be referred to as a delegation of the portion of the user interface (or portion thereof) to the mobile device . The mobile device  can be used (e.g., used by a user) to interact with the portion of the user interface  via the touch-sensitive display , which is configured to display the portion of the user interface  at the mobile device . A signal representing the interaction with the touch-sensitive display  (and with the portion of the user interface ) can be sent to the host device  and can be used to trigger one or more operations associated with the application operating at the host device . In some embodiments, the signal can include, for example, one or more x-y coordinates and\/or corresponding time values that represent an interaction (e.g., a physical interaction) with a portion of the surface of the touch-sensitive display . In some embodiments, a signal associated with an interaction via a display such as the touch-sensitive display  can be referred to as a display signal.","Thus, the display  of the mobile device  can function as a virtual window into the user interface  operating at the host device  and associated with an application also operating at the host device . The user interface  (or portion thereof) displayed at the display  of the mobile device  can be referred to as being mirrored, duplicated, or delegated to the mobile device  from the host device . The virtual window into the user interface  provided by the interactions (e.g., communications, delegation) between the mobile device  and the host device  can be used to, for example, control the application operating at the host device .","In some embodiments, the mobile device  can be configured to interact with the host device  via the communication link  to register the touch-sensitive display  as an I\/O device for the host device . Thus, a user can use the touch-sensitive display  to interact with the applications (e.g., operating system) operating at the host device . For example, an application operating at the host device  can send (e.g., output) at least a portion of (e.g., an instance of or copy of) the user interface  to the touch-sensitive display  so that a user may control at least a portion of the application via the portion of the user interface . Thus, an application operating at the host device  can be controlled via the touch-sensitive display  of the mobile device , while maintaining the advantages of the processing resources available at the host device . Moreover, processing tasks can also be delegated from the host device  to the mobile device  and vice-versa when appropriate. For example, graphics processing tasks can be delegated from the host device  to the mobile device  (in cases where the mobile device  has the greater graphics processing resources than the host device ).","In some embodiments, one or more peripherals associated with (e.g., connected with, in communication with) the mobile device  can also be used in conjunction with the host device . For example, as shown in , a drawing device  can be configured to interact with the mobile device . The drawing device  can be configured to send, to the mobile device  and\/or to the host device , a signal representing an interaction of the drawing device  with the mobile device . Similar to the signal representing the interaction with the touch-sensitive display , the signal representing the interaction of the drawing device  can be sent to the host device  and can be used to trigger one or more operations associated with the application operating at the host device . In some embodiments, the signal associated with (e.g., produced by) the drawing device  can be referred to as a drawing device signal or as a stylus signal. Other peripherals (e.g., mouse device, keyboard device) (not shown) associated with the mobile device  can similarly be used in conjunction with the host device .","In some embodiments, the drawing device  can be a pressure sensitive stylus configured to send a signal representing a level of pressure applied by the drawing device  against at least a portion of the mobile device . In some embodiments, the pressure sensitive stylus can include one or more capacitive and\/or resistive type pressure sensing mechanism, an electromagnetic pressure sensing mechanism, a spring-loaded pressure sensing mechanism, and\/or so forth. For example, an application operating at the host device  can be a drawing application and a user interface delegated (from the host device ) to the mobile device  can be a drawing interface associated with the application. The drawing device  can be used by a user to draw a line with a specified pressure within the delegated user interface (or portion thereof), which can correspond with a line thickness, translucence, shading, consistency, color, and\/or so forth.","Signaling associated with the drawing device  (or other peripheral device) and signaling associated with the touch-sensitive display  can be used in combination to trigger one or more operations at the host device . For example, a signal representing an interaction of the drawing device  with a location of the touch-sensitive display  can be produced by the touch-sensitive display  (and\/or software and\/or hardware thereof) can be sent to the host device . Also, a signal representing a level of pressure of the drawing device  at the location can be produced by the drawing device  (and\/or software and\/or hardware thereof) and sent to the host device . The signal (e.g., a raw electrical signal) produced by the touch-sensitive display  and the signal (e.g., a raw electrical signal) produced by the drawing device  can both be processed at the host device  and can be used to trigger an operation at the host device . In some embodiments, the signal (e.g., a raw electrical signal) produced by the touch-sensitive display  and the signal (e.g., a raw electrical signal) produced by the drawing device  can both be processed at the mobile device  before being sent to the host device  to trigger an operation at the host device . In other words, one or more signals produced by the touch-sensitive display  and\/or one or more signals produced by the drawing device  can be processed at the mobile device  to produce another signal (e.g., an instruction) configured to trigger an operation of the host device .","Although, signaling associated with interaction of the drawing device  with the mobile device  can be produced by the drawing device  and can be separate from signaling representing interactions with the touch-sensitive display , the signaling associated with a drawing device  can be synchronized with signaling associated with the touch-sensitive display , and\/or vice versa. For example, a signal representing an x-y coordinate of a location of an interaction of the drawing device  with the touch-sensitive display  can be synchronized with a signal representing a level of pressure applied by the drawing device  at the location. The synchronized signaling can be processed at the mobile device  (before being sent to the host device ) and\/or at the host device .","In some embodiments, the signals described herein can be, for example, a digital signal (e.g., a binary digital signal, a binary sequence of bits) and\/or an analog signal that represents one or more portions of an interaction. In some embodiments, the signal can be an approximation of the interaction. For example, the signal can be configured to approximate or more portions of the interaction.","In some embodiments, the host device  can be, for example, a desktop computing device, a laptop computing device, a tablet computing device, a server, and\/or so forth. In some embodiments, the host device  can be a projector configured to project an image. In such instances, the user interface  can be projected for display (e.g., on a screen) and a portion of the projected user interface  can be delegated to the mobile device .","In some embodiments, the host device  can be configured to execute one or more applications (e.g., installed applications, embedded applications, third-party applications, operating system). In some embodiments, an operating system of the host device  can be a graphical operating system such as a variant of MICROSOFT WINDOWS, APPLE OS X, or the GOOGLE CHROME OS. In some embodiments, the application(s) operating at the host device  can provide (e.g., can be associated with) a user interface through which a user can interact with the host device  via images displayed on a display. The user can trigger, via the user interface, operations of the application(s) on the host device  for performing tasks such as web browsing, word processing, and\/or image editing. In some embodiments, the application(s) can be configured to support multiple displays and\/or display types. For example, the application(s) can include functionality to provide the user interface on multiple displays of differing resolutions. In addition, the application(s) can be configured to support various types of input\/output (I\/O) devices. The application(s) can also support communications via, for example, a network interface.","The mobile device  can be a portable computing device with a touch-sensitive display . For example, the mobile device  can be a mobile phone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a tablet computing device, etc. The touch-sensitive display  can be an electronic visual display that both displays graphical information and can process input via touches of the device with a finger, hand, or other object (e.g., a drawing device). The touch-sensitive display  can use different technologies to detect touch in different embodiments, such as resistance-based technologies and\/or capacitance-based technologies. In addition, the touch-sensitive display  can support multi-touch functionality that allows the display to process (e.g., detect) various types of gestures. In addition, external peripherals such as keyboards, the drawing device , cursor devices (e.g., mouse devices), and\/or so forth can be connected to the mobile device  via a wired communication link and\/or a wireless communication link. Furthermore, the mobile device  can include location-determination and\/or motion\/orientation detection capabilities.","As with the host device , the mobile device  can be configured to operate one or more applications (e.g., installed applications, embedded applications, third-party applications, operating system). For example, the mobile device can be a table computing device such as an iPAD operating a variant of the APPLE iOS operating system. Likewise, the mobile device can be configured to support communications via a network interface. The computational resources of the mobile device  may differ from those of the host device . For example, the mobile device  can have processing resources with less capabilities than the processing resources of the host device . However, in some embodiments, the mobile device  can have, for example, graphics processing capabilities that exceed the graphics processing capabilities of the host device .","The host device  and mobile device  can be configured to communicate via the communication link  that can be established, at least in part, by the host device  and\/or the mobile device . In some embodiments, the communication link  can be based on a wireless networking technology such as BLUETOOTH, WI-FI (IEEE 802.11), an Infrared Data Association (irDA)-based technology, and\/or so forth. In some embodiments, the communication link  can be a point-to-point link through which the host device  and mobile device  directly communicate without passing through any intermediate device, or other network topology. The host device  and mobile device  can exchange data over the communication link  using networking protocols such as the transmission control protocol\/Internet protocol (TCP\/IP) and the hypertext transport protocol (HTTP). The data exchanged over the communication link  can be represented using technologies and\/or formats including the hypertext markup language (HTML), the extensible markup language (XML), and\/or so forth. In addition, the communication link  can be based on encrypted communication using encryption technologies such as the secure sockets layer (SSL), secure HTTP, and\/or so forth. The communication link  can be wired in some embodiments.","In some embodiments, the host device  can be configured to support multicast network communications protocols via the communication link  between one or more mobile devices (not shown) similar to mobile device  and the host device . The multicast network protocol can be used for efficient communication between the one or more mobile devices and the host device  by allowing the host device  to push (e.g., continually push) information to the one or more mobile devices. Multicast network protocols also allow the host device  to push, for example, desktop display information to all participating mobile devices  simultaneously, with the mobile devices individually identifying and using the information directed to the specific mobile devices.","In some embodiments, multiple mobile devices (similar to mobile device ) (not shown) can be linked to the host device  through the communication link . The multiple mobile devices can be used by a single user or by multiple users to interact with one or more portions of an operating system and applications operating (e.g., executing) on the host computer using each device's touch-sensitive display. The multiple users can each interact with the host device  from various geographic locations, passing controls back and forth via applications executing on each of the multiple mobile device. Although many of the embodiments described herein are discussed in the context of a touch-sensitive display (e.g., a touch-sensitive display of a mobile device), in some embodiments a non-touch-sensitive display may be used in lieu of a touch-sensitive display.","The mobile device  optionally includes one or more detectors, such as one or more pressure detectors and\/or one or more motion detectors. A pressure detector can be used to detect force or pressure applied to the mobile device . A pressure detector may include a pressure sensor that is configured to detect an applied pressure directly. The pressure detector may be part of the touch-sensitive display , or may be provided as a separate or standalone component. For example, a piezoelectric sensor can be used to convert a mechanical strain on the sensor into an electrical signal that serves to measure the pressure applied to the sensor. Capacitive and electromagnetic pressure sensors can include a diaphragm and a pressure cavity, and when the diaphragm moves due to the application of pressure to the diaphragm a change in the capacitance or inductance in a circuit caused by movement of the diaphragm can be used to measure the pressure applied to the sensor.","A pressure detector also may measure an applied pressure indirectly. For example, the touch sensitive device\/display can include a capacitively- or resistively-coupled display that is used detect the presence or contact of a pointing device (e.g., a human finger) with the touch-sensitive display . The touch-sensitive display  may receive input indicating the presence of a pointing device (e.g., a human finger) near, or the contact of a pointing device with, one or more capacitively- or resistively-coupled elements of the touch-sensitive display . Information about input to the touch-sensitive display  may be routed to a processor, which can process (e.g., recognize) contact with the touch-sensitive display  by a relatively small area of a human finger as a light, low-pressure touch of the user's finger and which may process contact with the display by a relatively large area of the user's finger as a heavy, high-pressure touch, because the pad of a human finger spreads out when pressed hard against a surface. Similarly, the touch-sensitive display  can be configured to process (e.g., recognize) contact with the display with a human finger over a relatively short time as a light, low-pressure touch of the user's finger and may recognize contact with the touch-sensitive display  with a human finger over a relatively long time as a heavy, high-pressure touch of the user's finger, because a user generally contacts the touch-sensitive display  for a longer time when pressing hard than when pressing softly. In some embodiments, the processor can execute instructions that allow the mobile device  to learn over time what is a relatively light or short contact for a particular user and what is a relatively heavy or long contact for the user. Alternatively, or in addition, the mobile device  can allow a user to train the device with regard to particular force-based physical cues.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["200","240","200","260","262","260","262","260","20","260","262","260","262","260","262"]},"As shown in , the host device  includes an interaction combination module , an application delegation module , and a display . The application delegation module  is configured to send an instance  of a portion  of a user interface  to the mobile device  for display on the touch-sensitive display . The instance  can be a copy of the portion  of the user interface  configured for display on the touch-sensitive display  of mobile device . Accordingly, the touch-sensitive display  of the mobile device  can function as a window into the user interface  operating at the host device . Because the instance  is a copy of the portion  of the user interface , the instance  mirrors the portion  of the user interface . The host device  and the mobile device  are collectively configured so that interactions with the instance  at the mobile device  will be reflected within the user interface  operating of the host device . The user interface  can be associated with (e.g., can be used to control) an application  operating at the host device . In some embodiments, the instance  can be referred to as a delegated portion of the user interface .","In some embodiments, the user interface  may or may not be simultaneously (e.g., concurrently) displayed on the display  while the instance  of the user interface  is displayed on the touch-sensitive display . The instance  of the user interface  displayed at the touch-sensitive display  may mirror (e.g., may replicate\/duplicate) the portion  of the user interface  being displayed at the display .","Although not shown, in some embodiments, the instance  can be a copy of the entire user interface  operating at the host device . Although not shown, in some embodiments, the instance  can have a resolution (e.g., an aspect ratio, a size) that is different than a resolution of the portion  of the user interface . For example, the instance  can have a 4:3 aspect ratio that is different than a 16:9 aspect ratio of the portion  of the user interface . More details related to differences between a user interface and a delegated portion of the user interface are discussed below.","The application delegation module  can be configured to send (e.g., delegate) the instance  from the host device  mobile device . For example, the application delegation module  can be configured to select the portion  of the user interface  for delegation to the mobile device . More details related to the specifics of an application delegation module of a host device and operations thereof are described, for example, in connection with .","As shown in , the drawing device  and the interaction detection device  are each configured to send (e.g., transmit) one or more signals to the interaction combination module  of the host device . The signal(s) from the drawing device  and the interaction detection device  can be sent via one or more network modules (not shown) and\/or one or more communications ink (not shown) between the mobile device  and the host device .","Specifically, the drawing device  is configured to send a signal  that can represent an interaction of the drawing device  with the touch-sensitive display  of mobile device . The interaction detection device  is configured to send a signal  that represents an interaction of the drawing device  with the touch-sensitive display . The interaction of the drawing device  with the touch-sensitive display  can correspond with the instance  displayed on the touch-sensitive display . Interactions of the drawing device  with the touch-sensitive display  that correspond with the instance  can be referred to as interactions with the instance .","As shown in , the signal  from the drawing device  and the signal  from the interaction detection device  are separate signals and can represent different information. For example, the signal  from the drawing device  can represent a pressure level related to an interaction of the drawing device  with the touch-sensitive display , and the signal  can represent an x-y coordinate of the interaction of the drawing device  with the touch-sensitive display . Thus, the signal  from (e.g., produced by) the drawing device  can characterize a different aspect of the interaction of the drawing device  with the touch-sensitive display  than the signal  from (e.g., produced by) the interaction detection device . In embodiments where a signal represents a pressure level, the signal can be referred to as a pressure signal.","As shown in , the drawing device  is configured to send the signal  to the host device  via the mobile device . In other words, the signal  is transmitted from the drawing device  to the mobile device , and then re-transmitted from the mobile device  to the host device . Although not shown, in some embodiments, the drawing device  can be configured to send the signal  directly to the host device . In such embodiments, the drawing device  can be configured to communicate with host device  via a communication link established between the drawing device  and the host device . Also, in such embodiments, the drawing device  can be configured to function as an I\/O device of the host device .","The interaction combination module  can be configured to process the signals ,  to cause the host device  to perform one or more operations associated with the application . The interaction combination module  can be configured to process the signals ,  and determine how the signals ,  may be related to the application . When the signals ,  are related to the application , the host device  can be configured to use the signals ,  to produce one or more instructions that can trigger functionality (e.g., operations) associated with the application . Although not shown, in some embodiments, one or more additional instances (different from instance ) associated with the user interface  can be sent to the mobile device  for display on the touch-sensitive display .","For example, the application  can be a drawing application and user interface  can be a drawing interface associated with the application . The instance  of the user interface  can be a rendering of (e.g., a copy of) the portion  of the user interface  with which a user can interact using the mobile device . In other words, the instance  can be a delegated portion of the user interface  from the host device  to the mobile device . The user can use the drawing device  to draw a line with a specified pressure (which corresponds with a line thickness, translucence, shading, consistency, color, and\/or so forth) within the instance  of the user interface . The signal  can represent the pressure level of the drawing device  against the surface of the touch-sensitive display, and the signal  can represent a location within the instance  of the user interface  contacted by the drawing device . The signals ,  (which can be, for example, raw voltage measurements) can be sent to the interaction combination module  where they can be collectively processed (e.g., interpreted) and used to produce the line at the location within the user interface  (as corresponding within the instance  of the user interface ). As the line is drawn within the user interface  updated portions of the user interface  can be sent as additional instances (not shown) of the user interface  to the mobile device  for display at the touch-sensitive display . Thus, the mobile device  can be used as a satellite device through which the application  operating at the host device  can be controlled.","Although not shown in , in some embodiments, the functionality of the interaction combination module  (or a portion thereof) can operate at the mobile device .

Instead, the signaling from the drawing device  and\/or the interaction detection device  can be processed (e.g., interpreted) at the mobile device  to produce another signal (e.g., a set of instructions) that can be sent to the host device  and used to trigger one or more operations of the host device . Although not shown in , in some embodiments, the interaction combination module  (or portion thereof) can be associated with, or otherwise integrated into, the application delegation module .","In some embodiments, the interaction combination module  can be associated with (or included in) an application that can be installed at the mobile device  and\/or the host device . In such embodiments, the interaction combination module  can be configured to operate at an abstraction layer above an operating system and\/or driver system level of the mobile device  and\/or the host device . In some embodiments, the interaction combination module  can be configured to be compatible with one or more applications (e.g., drawing programs, word processing programs) that are installed separate from the interaction combination module . For example, the interaction combination module  can be included in a first application that is installed at the mobile device  separate from a second application installed at the mobile device . But the first application (which includes the interaction combination module ) can be configured to interoperate with the second application so that one or more signals produced by the drawing device  can be used to trigger operations of the second application (e.g., trigger drawing of lines within the user interface of the second application) even though the second application may not be natively configured to handle signaling produced by the drawing device .","As shown in , the computing device  includes a writing instrument database , which can be stored in a memory (not shown). The writing instrument database  includes one or more writing instrument definition files that can be used to define one or more images (e.g., glyphs, lines, characters) associated with the drawing device . Each of the writing instrument definition files included in the writing instrument database  can include, for example, one or more algorithms, one or more conditions, and\/or so forth that can be used to define one or more images associated with (e.g., simulating) a particular writing instrument type (or collection of writing instrument types). For example, a writing instrument definition file associated with a particular writing instrument (e.g., a pencil, a pen, a crayon) can include an algorithm that can be used by the drawing device module  to define an image so that writing using the particular writing instrument can be displayed when using the drawing device .","In some embodiments, one or more writing instrument definition files stored in the writing instrument database  can be used in conjunction with one or more of the signals ,  to produce one or more images. For example, a writing instrument definition file representing a crayon can be selected from the writing instrument database  for use with the application . If the signal  represents a level of pressure produced by the drawing device  when contacted against the touch-sensitive display  at a location represented by signal , the level of pressure can be used to produce a crayon image of a particular thickness that can be represented within (e.g., simulated within) the user interface  and replicated in an instance (such as instance ) of the user interface  sent to the mobile device  at the location represented by the signal .","In some embodiments, a writing instrument definition file can be selected via the user interface  for use with application .

For example, several writing instrument definition files can be stored in a writing instrument database at the drawing device .

In such an embodiment, the user interface delegation module  can be configured to direct certain aspects of the user interface of the host device  to the display area of the touch-sensitive display of the mobile device. For example, the user interface delegation module  can be configured to fit a portion (e.g., an instance of a portion) of a user interface for an application operating (e.g., executing) at the host device  within the display area corresponding to a touch-sensitive display of a mobile device so that the touch-sensitive display of the mobile device can be used (e.g., used by a user) to interact with the application.","In some embodiments, the user interface delegation module  can be configured to direct certain aspects of a user interface of the host device  that is not simultaneously displayed at the host device  to a display area of a touch-sensitive display of a mobile device. For example, the user interface delegation module  can be configured to trigger display of a first user interface at the display  of the host device , and trigger display of a second user interface (mutually exclusive from the first user interface) at a display of a mobile device. The first user interface and the second user interface can be associated with a single application or different applications operating at the host device . In some embodiments, this delegation mode can be referred to as a dual-display delegation mode.","In another delegation mode (which can be referred to as a replicated or duplicated delegation mode), the user interface delegation module  can be configured to replicate (e.g., replicate an instance of, mirror an instance of) the user interface of the host device  at a touch-sensitive display of a mobile device. Thus, the user interface delegation module  can cause the touch-sensitive display of the mobile device to replicate the user interface that the host device  displays on its local display (i.e., display ). The touch-sensitive display of the mobile device can be used to interact with the entire user interface of the host device . In some embodiments of the replicated delegation mode where the native resolutions of the display  of the host device  and a touch-sensitive display of a mobile device are different, the user interface delegation module  can be configured to generate a replicated version (e.g., an instance) the user interface scaled to fit on the touch-sensitive display of the mobile device. In such embodiments, the touch-sensitive display of the mobile device can be used by a user to zoom into a portion of the user interface, so that the user interface can be viewed on the mobile device at the same or greater resolution as displayed on the display  of the host device .","In an additional delegation mode (which can be referred to as a customized delegation mode), the user interface delegation module  can be configured to generate (e.g., produce) a customized user interface adapted to a touch-sensitive display of a mobile device and can be configured to delegate it to the touch-sensitive display. In some embodiments, the customized user interface can replace the native user interface of the host device  and serve as a remote desktop. With a customized user interface, the mobile device can be used to control the host device  using a user interface specific to (e.g., adapted to) the touch-sensitive display.","In another delegation mode (which can be referred to as an orientation delegation mode), the user interface delegation module  can be configured to generate a customized user interface responsive to the orientation of a touch-sensitive display of a mobile device. For example, the user interface delegation module  can be configured to receive information from the device registration module  indicating a change in an orientation of a mobile device. The user interface delegation module  can be configured to automatically adjust a portion (e.g., a mirrored portion) of a user interface (for sending to the mobile device) responsive to the updated device resolution information. Similarly, in one delegation mode (which can be referred to as a zoomed delegation mode), the user interface delegation module  can be configured to generate a customized user interface responsive to the zoom level of a user interface (e.g., an instance of at least a portion of a user interface operating at the host device ) displayed on a touch-sensitive display of a mobile device.","In another delegation mode (which can be referred to as a multi-delegation mode) the user interface delegation module  can be configured to send a delegated (e.g., a mirrored) portion (e.g., instance) of a user interface to multiple mobile devices. In some embodiments, the delegated portions can be different. For example, when operating with multiple mobile devices, the user interface delegation module  can be configured to determine the zoom level of each touch-sensitive display of the multiple mobile devices and generates a user interface for each of the mobile devices at the varying zoom levels. As a specific example, the user interface delegation module  can be configured to generate a user interface for close-in interaction such as detailed graphics work for one mobile device and another user interface for a zoomed out view of the same screen area for another mobile device.","In yet another delegation mode, the user interface delegation module  can be configured to generate a user interface based on positional information received from a mobile device. One or more sensors (e.g., motion sensors) included in the mobile device can be configured to generate information characterizing (e.g., representing) the position\/orientation of the mobile device, and the user interface delegation module  can be configured to use this information to update the user interface. For example, when a mobile device is moved, the user interface delegation module  can be configured to move (e.g., shift) portions (e.g., mirrored portions, delegated portions) of the user interface triggered for display on the touch-sensitive screen (corresponding to the movement of the mobile device). Accordingly, the mobile device can be used by a user to pan through the user interface operating at the host device  by moving the mobile device. Similarly, when operating with multiple mobile devices, the user interface delegation module  can be configured to define portions of the user interface shown on the touch-sensitive displays of the mobile devices based on respective positions and\/or orientations of the mobile devices, and redefine (e.g., update) the user interface portions should one device change position relative to another.","The task delegation module  can be configured to delegate processing tasks between the host device  and one or more mobile devices. In some embodiments, the task delegation module  can be configured to maintain information describing the processing capabilities of the host device  and one or more mobile device. The task delegation module  can be configured to monitor one or more tasks requested to be performed on the host device  and\/or mobile device(s) by, e.g., monitoring communication passing through the device driver module , and\/or causing the task(s) to execute on the machine having the processing capabilities to which it is best suited. For example, if a mobile device is optimized to perform an image processing task, the touch-sensitive display of the mobile device can be used to request the task. The task delegation module  can be configured to delegate the task to the mobile device by sending information to the mobile device describing the task and\/or instructions to execute the task. The task delegation module  can also be configured to receive information from a mobile device describing (or including instructions related to) a task delegated to the host device  by the mobile device. In such embodiments, the task delegation module  can be configured to interact with components of the host device , such as the operating system and\/or applications, to perform the requested task and output the results of the task to the mobile device.","Further, in some embodiments, the user interface delegation module  can be configured to delegate a customized user interface to a touch-sensitive display of a mobile device.

Implementations may implemented as a computer program product, i.e., a computer program tangibly embodied in an information carrier, e.g., in a machine-readable storage device (computer-readable medium, a non-transitory computer-readable storage medium, a tangible computer-readable storage medium) or in a propagated signal, for processing by, or to control the operation of, data processing apparatus, e.g., a programmable processor, a computer, or multiple computers. In some implementations, a computer-readable storage medium can store instructions that when executed can cause a processor (e.g., a processor of a mobile device, a processor of a host device) to perform a process. A computer program, such as the computer program(s) described above, can be written in any form of programming language, including compiled or interpreted languages, and can be deployed in any form, including as a stand-alone program or as a module, component, subroutine, or other unit suitable for use in a computing environment. A computer program can be deployed to be processed on one computer or on multiple computers at one site or distributed across multiple sites and interconnected by a communication network.","Process steps may be performed by one or more programmable processors executing a computer program to perform functions by operating on input data and generating output. Process steps also may be performed by, and an apparatus may be implemented as, special purpose logic circuitry, e.g., an FPGA (field programmable gate array) or an ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit).","Processors suitable for the processing of a computer program include, by way of example, both general and special purpose microprocessors, and any one or more processors of any kind of digital computer. Generally, a processor will receive instructions and data from a read-only memory or a random access memory or both. Elements of a computer may include at least one processor for executing instructions and one or more memory devices for storing instructions and data. Generally, a computer also may include, or be operatively coupled to receive data from or transfer data to, or both, one or more mass storage devices for storing data, e.g., magnetic, magneto-optical disks, or optical disks. Information carriers suitable for embodying computer program instructions and data include all forms of non-volatile memory, including by way of example semiconductor memory devices, e.g., EPROM, EEPROM, and flash memory devices; magnetic disks, e.g., internal hard disks or removable disks; magneto-optical disks; and CD-ROM and DVD-ROM disks. The processor and the memory may be supplemented by, or incorporated in special purpose logic circuitry.","To provide for interaction with a user, implementations may be implemented on a computer having a display device, e.g., a cathode ray tube (CRT), a light emitting diode (LED), or liquid crystal display (LCD) monitor, for displaying information to the user and a keyboard and a pointing device, e.g., a mouse or a trackball, by which the user can provide input to the computer. Other kinds of devices can be used to provide for interaction with a user as well; for example, feedback provided to the user can be any form of sensory feedback, e.g., visual feedback, auditory feedback, or tactile feedback; and input from the user can be received in any form, including acoustic, speech, or tactile input.","Implementations may be implemented in a computing system that includes a back-end component, e.g., as a data server, or that includes a middleware component, e.g., an application server, or that includes a front-end component, e.g., a client computer having a graphical user interface or a Web browser through which a user can interact with an implementation, or any combination of such back-end, middleware, or front-end components. Components may be interconnected by any form or medium of digital data communication, e.g., a communication network. Examples of communication networks include a local area network (LAN) and a wide area network (WAN), e.g., the Internet.","While certain features of the described implementations have been illustrated as described herein, many modifications, substitutions, changes and equivalents will now occur to those skilled in the art.
