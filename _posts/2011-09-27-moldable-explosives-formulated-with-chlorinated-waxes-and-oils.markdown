{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["U.S. GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE","BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE","SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","EXAMPLES"],"p":["The inventions described herein may be manufactured, used and licensed by or for the U.S. Government for U.S. Government purposes.","This disclosure relates generally to the field of energetic materials. More particularly, it pertains to moldable explosives containing chlorinated waxes and oils.","Moldable explosives have widespread applicability in military and industrial applications. Concurrent with this widespread use are efforts to make such moldable explosives less sensitive to unintended detonation\u2014a characteristic which is generally known in the art as insensitive munitions (IM).","Accordingly, moldable explosive compositions which exhibit this IM characteristic without significant loss of energetic output would represent an advance in the art.","An advance in the art is made according to an aspect of the present disclosure directed to moldable explosives containing chlorinated waxes and\/or oils. Advantageously, moldable explosives formulated according to aspects of the present disclosure exhibit a satisfactory IM characteristic while\u2014at the same time\u2014not appreciably losing desired energetic effects.","Viewed from a first aspect, the present disclosure is directed to a moldable explosive composition comprising: 60-75 wt % of an explosive selected from the group consisting of: RDX, TNT, TATB and CL20; 25-35 wt % halogenated oil; and 0-5 wt % halogenated wax.","Viewed from another aspect, the present disclosure is directed a method for making a moldable explosive composition comprising the steps of: combining a quantity of an explosive selected from the group consisting of: RDX, TNT, TATB and CL20, along with a quantity of halogenated oil along with a quantity of a halogenated wax such that the overall mixture includes 60-75 wt % of the explosive, 25-35 wt % of the halogenated oil and 0-5 wt % of the halogenated wax; and mixing the combined materials until a substantially homogeneous, moldable solid is produced.","The following merely illustrates the principles of the disclosure. It will thus be appreciated that those skilled in the art will be able to devise various arrangements which, although not explicitly described or shown herein, embody the principles of the disclosure and are included within its spirit and scope.","Furthermore, all examples and conditional language recited herein are principally intended expressly to be only for pedagogical purposes to aid the reader in understanding the principles of the disclosure and the concepts contributed by the inventor(s) to furthering the art, and are to be construed as being without limitation to such specifically recited examples and conditions.","Moreover, all statements herein reciting principles, aspects, and embodiments of the disclosure, as well as specific examples thereat are intended to encompass both structural and functional equivalents thereof. Additionally, it is intended that such equivalents include both currently-known equivalents as well as equivalents developed in the future, i.e., any elements developed that perform the same function, regardless of structure.","By way of some additional background, it is noted that composition C4 explosive\u2014or C4 as it is commonly known in the art is a widely used plastic explosive which comprises approximately 91% by mass RDX (cyclonite or cyclotrimethylene trinitramine), 5.3% by mass plasticizer (diethylhexyl or dioctyl sebacate) and 2.1% by mass binder\u2014usually polyisobutylene.","C4 is typically manufactured by combining the noted ingredients with binder dissolved in a solvent. The solvent is then flashed off and the mixture dried and filtered. The final material is an off-white solid having a texture similar to modeling clay.","Due in part to its unique and difficult to replicate characteristics, C4 has been a military and industrial staple for 50+ years. It advantageously maintains a high level of moldability and energetic performance. It may be forced into cracks or voids easily by hand manipulation\u2014giving it a distinct advantage over other\u2014more rigid explosives. Despite its physical flexibility and energetic power, it exhibits favorable insensitive munitions (IM) character. Given these difficult to replicate characteristics\u2014replacements for C4 while extremely desirable have not been forthcoming.","Such an advance is made in the art according to an aspect of the present disclosure directed to moldable explosives having significant IM characteristics. Such explosives are advantageously produced\u2014according to the present disclosure\u2014through the use of chlorinated waxes and\/or oils in their formulation and compounding. Advantageously, such compositions formulated with chlorinated waxes and oils benefit from the relative low cost of such waxes and oils, they bind well to RDX\u2014unlike the binders used in C4, and they are hydrophobic, chemically inert and exhibit a very low vapor pressure.","A series of formulations were developed to evaluate the use of chlorinated binders in moldable explosives. More particularly, to a quantity of 60-75% by weight RDX (Class V\u20144 micron) was added 35-25% by weight chlorinated oil and 0-5% chlorinated wax. The mixture was combined and mixed using a common B&P mixing system. As may be readily apparent to those skilled in the art, such a 1 step process offers distinct advantages over the conventional, 3-step C4 manufacturing process.","The resulting compositions (moldable explosives) exhibit Chapman and Jouguet (CJ) pressures nearly identical to contemporary C4 while still maintaining 90% of the performance of the C4. And since they exhibit a more favorable consistency permitting hand packing, more effective hand-packed shaped charges are possible with the explosives according to the present disclosure than with the C4.","Variations to the above to evaluate IM characteristic were performed by reducing the amount of RDX employed (up to 20% less). As may be appreciated, energetic performance was still satisfactory while exhibiting a significant drop in sensitivity. Accordingly, a wide array of C4 replacements may be formulated according to the present disclosure wherein chlorinated waxes and oils are mixed with RDX to produce the moldable explosive.","At this point we note that given their desirable moldable characteristics, explosives formulated according to the present disclosure may be extruded after mixing into any of a variety of shapes possible with contemporary extruding method(s). More particularly, ropes of varying dimensions may be produced as well as ropes exhibiting particular cross-sectional shapes.","As may be further appreciated, moldable explosives according to the present disclosure are not limited to RDX formulations and sizes. More particularly, other explosives\u2014including but not limited to\u2014such as Trinitrotoluene\u2014TNT, cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine\u2014RMX, triaminotrinitrobenzene\u2014TATB and 2,4,6,8,10,12-hexanitro-2,4,6,8,10,12-hexaazaisowurtzitane\u2014CL20 are all suitable for use in formulations according to the preset disclosure.","In addition to these noted explosives, any of a number of known taggants and\/or other chemical markers may be included in the formulation. Such tagants are added to the explosive formulation so that a manufacture and\/or batch information may be obtained post-detonation. Still further, as an alternative to the chlorinated waxes and\/or oils described, other halogenated oils and\/or waxes\u2014i.e., fluorinated ones\u2014may be employed as well. Still further, chlorinated and\/or fluorinated rubbers or elastomers may be mixed with the energetic explosive, as they are chemically similar to the currently used binder ingredients, and may promote elasticity.","At this point, while we have discussed and described exemplary embodiments generally directed to halogen containing waxes and oils added to explosive compositions to produce an overall, moldable explosive composition exhibiting significant IM characteristics. Further variations to the compositions described are anticipated to be within the scope of the present disclosure and as such\u2014the present disclosure should only be limited by the scope of the claims that follow."],"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
