{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["1. Field of Invention","This invention generally relates to systems and methods for uniformly identifying digital files.","2. Description of Related Art","High value information is frequently inaccessible to users of wireless-enabled and\/or web-enabled personal digital assistants, web-enabled cell phones and the like, which are generally referred to herein as mobile information devices (MID), because this information is embedded as an e-mail attachment inaccessible to software installed on the mobile information device. Mobile information devices include handheld devices that combine computer applications with telephony and\/or remote networking features. A mobile information device may be equipped with a hypertext-markup-language (HTML) or wireless access protocol (WAP) browser and\/or an e-mail reader.","E-mail attachments may be in any number of file formats, such as, for example, spreadsheet, word processing, or high resolution graphical files. Software applications which can interact with the data format of the attachment file are frequently not installed on the mobile information device. Instead, these applications are installed only on a remote mobile document access server, while the attachments are stored in some repository that is accessible to the server. Therefore, the user of the mobile information device cannot easily access the information embedded in these attachments. The access server allows a remote user to fax, print, and view information stored in corporate repositories. In response to a command issued at the mobile information device, the access server can prepare the attachment for printing or faxing, and may additionally dispatch the prepared attachment to a remote location.","The document creator applications, e-mail software, communication software, and mobile information device-resident browsers come from various suppliers. Existing methods for accessing the attachments are ad-hoc, and do not work for many combinations of these components.","As outlined above, conventional e-mail attachment identification techniques are typically proprietary and dissimilar. Moreover, conventional methods for accessing e-mail attachments do not work for many software component combinations.","This invention provides systems and methods for uniformly identifying e-mail attachments.","This invention separately provides systems and methods for uniformly identifying e-mail attachments from mobile information devices.","In various exemplary embodiments according to this invention, an electronic file is identified by a record including a unique identifier field and\/or a user-friendly textual field. The unique identifier field may be any alphanumeric string that can uniquely identify the document. In various exemplary embodiments, the unique identifier is a uniform resource locator. In various other exemplary embodiments, the unique identifier is an integer. This alphanumeric string may be generated using any known technique. For example, a unique integer identifier may be generated by adding a value incrementor to a previous unique identifier.","In various exemplary embodiments of the systems and methods according to this invention, the user-friendly text is the name of the electronic file. In various other exemplary embodiments, the user-friendly text is a title or text string obtained or extracted from the document, where the title or text string is different from the name of the document.","In various exemplary embodiments of the systems and methods according to this invention, the uniform identifier record is appended to an electronic file to which the file identified by the uniform identifier record is associated. The electronic file may be e-mail. The associated file may be an e-mail attachment.","These and other features and advantages of this invention are described in or apparent from the following detailed description of the systems and methods according to this invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","100","110","120","100","110","110","110","110"]},"The user-friendly text field  is able to contain any textual information usable to appropriately identify the attachment file. Thus, the text string in the user-friendly text field  can be the name of the attachment file. Alternatively, the text string in the user-friendly text field  can be the title or any other text string of the document, where the title or other text string can be obtained or extracted from the attachment file and is different from the name of the document.","In various exemplary embodiments, the uniform identifier record  is a character string. The unique identifier field  and the user-friendly text field  portions of the uniform identifier record  are delimited by any known or later-developed text delimiter, such as, for example, commas, tabs or any other appropriate non-printing character combinations.","In various exemplary embodiments, the uniform identifier record  is appended to the message body of the e-mail file associated with the identified attachment.  illustrates one exemplary embodiment of an e-mail file  modified in accordance with the invention to include one exemplary embodiment of a uniform identifier record. As shown in , the e-mail file  includes the uniform identifier record  appended to the original e-mail body . More than one uniform identifier record  may be appended to the e-mail body  when the e-mail file  contains more than one attachment.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["1000","1100","1200","1300","1400","1500"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["1100","1100","1110","1120","1130","1170","1140"]},"In step S, a unique identifier is generated for the attachment file. Next, in step S, a user-friendly description is generated for the attachment file. Then, in step S, the unique identifier and user-friendly description are inserted as a uniform identifier record into the message body of the e-mail file. Operation then continues to step S.","In step S, the e-mail file is sent to the mobile information device being used by the remote user to access the e-mail. Then, in step S, operation of the method returns to step S. It should be appreciated that, in various exemplary embodiments, the user-friendly text field  may not be appended to the email body since its purpose is merely to aid the human user of the mobile information device in distinguishing one attachment from another. In particular, when an email message has no more than one attachment, a user-friendly text field may be deemed unnecessary, and therefore omitted. In this case, step S is skipped or omitted. Then, in step S, only the generated one of the unique identifier field  or the user-friendly text  is inserted into the email.","It should be appreciated that, in various exemplary embodiments of the invention, the user-friendly description may be a unique identifier for the attachment file. In these exemplary embodiments, the user-friendly description is a unique identifier at least in the context of the mobile document access server.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["1200","1200","1210","1220","1220","1230","1230","1240"]},"In step S, the current selection is retrieved. Next, in step S, a determination is made whether the selection contains or is associated with a valid unique identifier. If not, operation returns to step S. Otherwise, operation continues to step S.","In step S, an action identifier associated with the selected action is retrieved. The action identifier may be a character string similar or identical to the menu selection of the action selected. Alternately, the action identifier may be a numeric identifier associated with the action. Then, in step S, operation of the method returns to step S.","The unique identifier determined in step S may be stored in a database local to the mobile information device. In various exemplary embodiments, the unique identifier is removed or copied from the e-mail file before the attachment information is displayed. Alternately, in various other exemplary embodiments, the unique identifier may be retrieved from the e-mail file itself after the attachment is selected. In these exemplary embodiments, the unique identifier is not displayed with the user-friendly text. In still other exemplary embodiments, the unique identifier is user-friendly text.","The action determined in step S may be any action that may be appropriately invoked against the selected file. For example, the file can be faxed to any location. Alternatively, the file can be printed. Moreover, the file can be e-mailed to another user. In most cases, this will involve gathering further information from the user, i.e., having the user supply and\/or identify further information. For example, to fax the attachment, the user will need to supply the phone number of a receiving fax machine. In various exemplary embodiments, the information is gathered when the user indicates that an action is to be performed on the attachment. In various exemplary embodiments, the further information is gathered, for example, using a pop-up dialog box or other user-interface widget or mechanism appropriate to the mobile information device involved.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6"],"b":["1400","1400","1410","1420","1440","1450","1500"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 7"],"b":["300","300","305","335","375","310","315","320","325","340","345","350","355","360","365","370","330"]},"The system  is implemented on a standard mobile information device.
