Technical Field","The present invention relates to an organic semiconductor transistor, a method of producing the organic semiconductor transistor, and an electronic device.","2. Related Art","A thin film transistor is widely used as a switching element for display devices such as liquid crystal displays. Conventionally, the thin film transistor is produced by using amorphous or polycrystalline silicon.","Meanwhile, organic semiconductors typified by organic EL devices or the like have been studied extensively in recent years. At the same time, organic materials have been reported to be incorporated in electronic circuits in place of silicon material, owing to their advantages of light weight and flexibility.","According to an aspect of the invention, there is provided an organic semiconductor transistor having plural electrodes and an organic semiconductor layer that contains at least one compound represented by the following Formula (I).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0008"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"23.54mm","wi":"76.20mm","file":"US08217391-20120710-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"In Formula (I), each Rindependently represents a straight-chain alkyl group having from 3 to 20 carbon atoms, a straight-chain alkoxy group having from 3 to 20 carbon atoms, a branched alkyl group having from 3 to 20 carbon atoms, or a branched alkoxy group having from 3 to 20 carbon atoms; and each Rindependently represents a hydrogen atom, a straight-chain alkyl group having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms, a straight-chain alkoxy group having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms, a branched alkyl group having 3 to 20 carbon atoms, or a branched alkoxy group having from 3 to 20 carbon atoms.","Hereinafter, the exemplary embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail. Further, the present invention is in no way limited by the action or function deduced from the present description.","The organic semiconductor transistor of the exemplary embodiments of the present invention has plural electrodes and an organic semiconductor layer that contains at least one compound represented by the following Formula (I). The compound represented by the Formula (I) is described at first, and then the organic semiconductor transistor of the exemplary embodiments will be described.","<Compound Represented by Formula (I)>","The compound represented by Formula (I) is a thiazolothiazole derivative. Hereinafter, the compound represented by Formula (I) is called as the thiazolothiazole derivative in some cases.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0019"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00003","num":"00003"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00003","he":"23.62mm","wi":"76.20mm","file":"US08217391-20120710-C00003.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"In the Formula (I), each Rindependently represents a straight-chain alkyl group having from 3 to 20 carbon atoms, a straight-chain alkoxy group having from 3 to 20 carbon atoms, a branched alkyl group having from 3 to 20 carbon atoms, or a branched alkoxy group having from 3 to 20 carbon atoms; and each Rindependently represents a hydrogen atom, a straight-chain alkyl group having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms, a straight-chain alkoxy group having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms, a branched alkyl group having 3 to 20 carbon atoms, or a branched alkoxy group having from 3 to 20 carbon atoms.","Among these, preferably, Rin the Formula (I) is a straight-chain substitution group having from 3 to 12 carbon atoms or a branched substitution group having from 3 to 12 carbon atoms in the main chain thereof and Ris a straight-chain substitution group having from 1 to 12 carbon atoms or a branched substitution group having from 2 to 12 carbon atoms in the main chain thereof.","The straight-chain substitution group having from 3 to 12 carbon atoms may include a straight-chain alkyl group having from 3 to 12 carbon atoms and a straight-chain alkoxy group having from 3 to 12 carbon atoms. The branched substitution group having from 3 to 20 carbon atoms in the main chain thereof may include a branched alkyl group having from 3 to 20 carbon atoms and a branched alkoxy group having from 3 to 20 carbon atom, in which the straight main chain portion thereof except the branched group portion of the alkyl group or alkoxy group has from 2 to 12 carbon atoms.","It is thought that the thiazolothiazole derivative represented by Formula (I) exerts an excellent charge mobility owing to conjugated \u03c0-electrons spreading over the aromatic rings thereof which have a high planarity in terms of molecular structure.","The solubility of the thiazolothiazole derivative represented by Formula (I) is increased by selecting a phenyl group for the substitution groups adjacent to the thiophene rings. This is presumably because the bond between the end phenyl substitution group and the thiophene ring rotates freely. Further, by incorporating an alkyl or an alkoxy group into R, hydrophobic interaction with an organic solvent is increased, whereby the solubility in the organic solvent is thought to be increased. Still further, by incorporating an alkyl group or an alkoxy group into R, hydrophobic interaction with an organic solvent is increased, whereby solubility is thought to be greatly increased. In addition, an effect of reducing ionization potential is exhibited. Also, presumably by incorporating an alkyl group or an alkoxy group as the substitution group of the phenyl group, the molecular weight is increased, thereby exhibiting adequate heat resistance.","In particular, in the thiazolothiazole derivative represented by Formula (I), by selecting the length of the substitution groups Rand Rto be 20 or less in terms of the carbon atom number of an alkyl or alkoxy group, preferably 12 or less, and, in the case of R, more preferably 8 or less, the substitution groups are presumably prevented from being tangled with each other, thereby increasing the solubility.","Further, the exemplary embodiments of the present invention are in no way limited by the presumptions described above.","On the other hand, a thiazolothiazole derivative that is not the thiazolothiazole derivative represented by Formula (I) and is represented by the following Chemical Formula 3 is obtained in the form of crystals; however, this thiazolothiazole derivative is not easily dissolved in an organic solvent, whereby crystals are precipitated when a coating liquid is prepared and the coating liquid lacks temporal stability. The derivative represented by Chemical Formula 3 is difficult to use.
