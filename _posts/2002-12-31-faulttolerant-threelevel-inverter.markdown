{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This invention was made with government support under contract number DE-FC36-99-GO-10285 awarded by the Department of Energy. The U.S. Government has certain rights in this invention.","This invention relates generally to power conversion and, more specifically, to three-level inverter modulation.","Inverters are utilized in AC motor drive, utility interface, and an uninterruptible power supply (\u201cUPS\u201d) applications as a means for converting DC to AC electrical power. A traditional inverter generates a low frequency output voltage with controllable magnitude and frequency by programming high-frequency voltage pulses. The high frequency voltage pulses open and close switches to expose a load to pulses of DC current. An inverter of this type is said to be using pulse width modulation (\u201cPWM\u201d). Timing, duration, and voltage of the pulses simulate the peaks and troughs of traditional sinusoidal alternating current. Where the load has an inherent inductive nature, such as windings of a motor, the pulses approximate the sinusoid without significant high frequency harmonics.","To handle larger and larger input voltages, larger switching transformers are needed. Where silicon fabrication has not kept up with the need for greater power, a three-level inverter topology has arisen. The topology equally divides two input voltage sources, thereby allowing twice the total voltage at the output for the same capacity transistor. The inverter was further refined for applications that do not have divided input voltage sources to have instead a series connected capacitor bank defining a neutral point-clamped three-level inverter.","The three-level inverter is one of the most popular topologies for three-phase multi-level voltage source inversion. The advantages of the three-level inverter are:","1) Because of the redundancy of the switches, voltage across any one switch is only half of the DC bus voltage;","2) Switching losses are cut in half due to the reduced harmonics present in the output wave forms for the same switching frequency; and","3) The power rating increases.","The literature recognizes certain drawbacks, as well, in the three-level inverter. Such inverters require complex control circuitry, each of the redundant switches add to the price of the inverter, and the charge at the mid-point between the two DC linking capacitors can accumulate when switching is not balanced.","In many applications, including for example, energy storage flywheels coupled to synchronous motors, failure of the inverter will cause the driving motor to impart an unequal torque to the flywheel. Such unequal torque, especially at very high revolution rates, might be catastrophic to the flywheel. However, the inverters will only work as long as the switching components within them will work.","The three-level topography is configured to allow current to pass through two distinct switching paths for each activation state. In every instance there is a \u201cbest\u201d solution and a second \u201cbetter\u201d solution. Because of this inherent redundancy and because of the strength of the switching products the three-level topography of the three-level inverter has inherent redundancies that will allow it to be used, if properly driven, for a fault-proof inverter. However, without a driver that will quickly recognize a fault, in turn, disabling one of two switching paths, diverting current only through valid switches at appropriate voltages, the redundancy of the design is not exploited. The fault-caused imbalances can easily upset the driven load.","There is, thus, an unmet need in the art for a method and a device for driving a fault-tolerant three-level inverter.","A method for driving a neutral point clamped three-level inverter is provided. In one exemplary embodiment, DC current is received at a neutral point-clamped three-level inverter. The inverter has a plurality of nodes including first, second and third output nodes. The inverter also has a plurality of switches. Faults are checked for in the inverter and predetermined switches are automatically activated responsive to a detected fault such that three-phase electrical power is provided at the output nodes.","The present invention exploits inherent redundancy in a three-phase inverter. Upon detecting a faulty switch in the inverter, a driver activates predetermined switches whose vector sum has a same resultant phase angle as the switches they replace. By selecting the predetermined switches, the resulting phase angles are the same as in the unfaulted operation though the magnitude may be diminished according to rules of vector addition.","By way of overview, a method for driving a neutral point clamped three-level inverter is provided. In one exemplary embodiment, DC current is received at a neutral point-clamped three-level inverter. The inverter has a plurality of nodes including first, second and third output nodes. The inverter also has a plurality of switches.

Subpanes (a), (b), (c), and (d) as representing any of the output phases of the inverter. For example, the output phase A, switch S is the switch switch S is the switch switch S is the switch and the switch S is the switch The same convention applies to any of the three phases.","In subpane (a), arrows indicate two current paths that exist between the positive node  represented by the voltage Vto the output node  either through the clamping diodes or through the switches S and S. In subpane (b), arrows represent the two current paths between the neutral point  that connect the voltage Vand the output node  upon activation of the switches S and S. Subpane (c) shows two resulting paths between the negative node and the voltage Vat the node  and the output node  upon activation of switches Sand S. As a result, subpane (d) shows an equivalent construction for this single output phase A of the inverter. Subpane (d) shows the output node  as a common terminal of a rotary switch allowing switching between the terminal Sproviding a current path to the positive node , terminal Sproviding a current path to the neutral point , and terminal Sproviding a current path to the negative point .","The convention set forth in ) suggests an advantageous means of conveying a state of the inverter . If the voltage applied to a synchronous three-phase motor is considered as though the motor were connected in delta, voltages to drive the motor are suitably the potential differences between the output nodes. A tri-axial graph where each voltage difference between terminals defines each of the three axes of a tri-axial graph. The voltage difference between the output nodes  and  as being the vertical axis; leaving the voltage difference between the output nodes  and  and the voltage difference between the output nodes  and  as the two remaining axes. Carrying this convention further, a situation where each of the output phases A, B, and C corresponds to each of the subpanes (a), (b), and (c) of . Thus phase A has the switches S and S activated providing a current path between the positive node  and the output node , phase B has switches S and S activated thereby providing a direct current path between the neutral point  and the output node , and phase C has switches S and S activated providing a direct line between the output node  and the negative node .","If the voltage difference between the positive  and negative  nodes is Vor source voltage, then the difference between the output nodes at  and  and  and  are both suitably one-half of the source voltage represents the difference between the mid-point and each of the extreme nodes , .","In , the suitably relationship between the voltages is shown by the voltage on the Vaxis being one-half of the source voltage and the voltage on the Vaxis also being one-half of the source voltage. Thus vector Vrepresents the switching state of the phases in sequence being positive-neutral-negative. In a convenient shorthand this is represented p0n as shown at an arrowhead of the vector V. If, as a second example, phase A connects the output node to the positive node  and both phases B and C connect to the negative node , the convention is suitably pnn. In voltage terms this means Vrepresents the full source voltage, i.e., the difference between the positive and negative nodes. Vis suitably equal to the negative of the source voltage. Vis suitably equal to zero. Therefore, the resulting vector is Vwith an annotation pnn at its arrowhead.","Using this same convention, a hexagonal representation of a full cycle of the inverter  is shown in . Eighteen possible vectors result from twenty-seven possible switch combinations. It will be appreciated that six main vectors define the six states of the switches where only the positive  or negative  nodes are implicated. Starting from the Vaxis and listing from the clockwise direction, the six main vectors are ppn, pnn, pnp, nnp, npp, npn. These six vectors defining the major axis of the hexagon are the \u201clarge vectors.\u201d Six medium vectors introduce the moderating influence of the neutral point , and represent vectors to the midpoints of these sides of the defined hexagon. These \u201cmedium vectors\u201d begin from the axis V, include switching combinations are 0pn, p0n, pn0, 0np, n0p, np0. Small vectors are aligned with the six major vectors and are generated where two of the switching paths are directed to the neutral point or to this same extreme node. Because there exist two equivalent ways to generate a same vector, these small vectors are suitably represented as ordered pairs (pp0, 00n), (p00, 0nn), (p0p, nn0), (00p, nn0), (0pp, n00), and (0p0, n0n). Finally, there exists three zero vectors which are the result of all switches leading to the same node. These zero vectors are ppp, 000, and nnn.","In order to generate three-phase power to drive a synchronous motor the switching state jumps alternately from large vector to medium vector and back to large vector as the state of the inverter  moves one switch at a time in the counter-clockwise direction around the hexagon portrayed in . Assuming a starting point at the Vaxis where the switching state is 0pn, the first phase moves to the negative for a resulting npn the third phase then moves to the neutral point for a resulting state np0 and the third phase then moves to the positive node for an npp state. The inverter continues in a similar fashion all the way around the hexagon, thereby defining a rough sinusoid at each of the phase output nodes.","In order to effect the rotation around the hexagon portrayed in  the inverter is driven by an exemplary driver circuitry  as portrayed in . Referring to ,  shows a of a block diagram of the inverter , specifically the driver  for the inverter . The central element in the driver  is the processor . Connected to the processor are the gate leads for the inboard transistors and and the gate leaves for the outboard transistors, and Though the block diagram shows the leads as a pair of single blocks, each of the leads, for example triggers independently at the command of the processor . Also connected to the processor  are number of voltage sensors for the positive, neutral, and negative nodes, , ,  and the voltage sensors across the switches, and as well as the output voltage sensors for phases A, B, and C respectively and Each of the voltage sensors present the instantaneous readings of the voltage to the processor .","Finally, the processor  is connected to a look up table  containing switching combinations capable of producing appropriate voltage vectors. Within a look up table , there are prestored each of the switching strategies necessary to react to a fault across any of the switches or diodes. Thus, for example, in the event of the detected switching fault across switch the look up table contains appropriate strategies to rotate the phase of the inverter  through the cycle without relying upon switch ","The present invention advantageously sensing voltages at various nodes within the inverter. While several configurations of sensors suitably alert the processor  of faults that may exist, the presently preferred embodiment portrayed in  places the sensors into three groups. The first group represents the two voltage source nodes  and  and the neutral point . The sensor  is connected to the neutral point  between capacitors  and . Sensor  is attached to the positive node  and sensor  is attached to the negative node .","The sensors at and sense either the current or the voltage or both at the output nodes for each of the three phases A, B and C respectively. Alternate embodiments may use sensors situated to sense current into or out of a node such that Kirchoff's first law might be used to determine the state of the switches and diodes that make up the inverter but in this embodiment voltage sensors are used. In a presently preferred embodiment all of the sensors shown in , i.e., , , , (), (), (), (), (), and (), (), () and (), will all be voltage sensors.","For the sake of clarity, this discussion of faults will be confined to faults occurring in phase A. One skilled in the art can see that because phase A is repeated identically in phases B and C no additional information would be garnered from an additional discussion of either phase B or C. Additionally, there are only three types of failure that might occur in each phase. Case One is the failure of an outboard power transistor. Outboard power transistors are defined as those transistors connected to either the positive node  or the negative node . In  for phase A, the outboard power transistors are () and (). Case Two is the failure of the inboard power transistors () or (). Inboard power transistors are power transistors connected to the neutral point . Finally, Case Three is the failure of the clamping diode, in the case of phase A, the short circuit-failure of either of clamping diodes () or ().",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":["FIGS. 6","FIG. 6"],"i":["a, ","b ","c, ","d ","b, ","a","b"],"b":["6","6","6","70","45","45"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":["FIGS. 6","FIGS. 6"],"i":["a, ","b, ","c, ","d, ","a, ","b, ","c, ","d, "],"b":["6","6","6","6","6","6","10","53"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6","FIG. 5"],"i":["c ","a","b","d ","a","b"],"b":["160","43","43","90","21","21","70","160","170","10","10","53","55"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["60","61","63"]},"At a block , when such a fault does occur, it is detected by the fact that the voltage across the terminals of either a diode or a switch remains at zero in a quarter-cycle of operation.
