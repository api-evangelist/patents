{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present invention relates to Business Process Management (BPM) software. BMP software can be used to automate and track business processes. The business processes can include work done by users, as well as automated steps.","One embodiment of the present invention is a system . A plug-in  for an office software product  can allow for the creation of a business process management instance  related to an open document in the office software product . The business process management instance  can be launched at a business process management server running  business process management software . The business process management software  can be separate from the office software product .","The use of a BPM plug-in at office software can make it easier for a user to put the office documents into a BPM process. Rather than being required to leave the office software to attach the office document into a BPM process, the user can remain in the familiar office software environment, while sending the office document into the BPS process. This can improve user productivity.","The BPM plug-in can hook into APIs provided by the office software to provide displays and allow for actions using the BPM system. Exemplary plug-ins can be add-ins for Microsoft\u2122 Office Software.","The office software product  can be a word processor program, a spread sheet program, an email program or any other such office software.","The plug-in  can allow the user to select the business process management server  from a display of available business process management servers.","The user of the plug-in  can select a type of action to be done at the business process server.","The available BPM servers and available possible actions shown by the plug-in to a user can depend on user credentials.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIGS. 2A-2D","b":["202","204","204","204","204"],"i":["a","b ","c.

Once executed, this process can form a process instance which can call on the various applications in order to invoke their functionality. Furthermore, the BPM system can allow creation of new processes which can invoke the existing applications in order to reuse their functionality and prevent duplication of code.","In various embodiments, the BPM system can include a process designer component that can be used to graphically draw a definition of a business process. The process definition can be comprised of multiple activities linked by various transitions, all of which can be graphically represented in the process definition.","At a high level, a business process can be designed to represent a specific set of business tasks and activities which must be executed in an organization to reach a well-defined outcome. When this outcome is reached, the process is deemed to be complete. Examples of such processes can include hiring a new employee, processing a sales order, reimbursing a business expense and other more complex processes according to the particular needs of the organization. In some cases, it may not be possible to reach the main goal of the process. For example, the shipping clerk may have to cancel a sales order because the product is out of stock. Therefore, a business process allows different possible end conditions besides the principal objective of the process. It can allow more than one way to reach the main objective. For instance, if the product is out of stock it may be possible to offer an equivalent alternative. In turn, this offer may be accepted or rejected. A range of possibilities can thus be included in the process.","At a more functional level, the business process can be broken down into a set of logical steps called activities, each of which can comprise one or more tasks. As an illustration, an activity that notifies a client of an incomplete sales order may include the task of sending an electronic mail (email) message to the client. Each of these tasks and activities can be graphically represented in the business process definition. When activities are executed automatically by the system, they are referred to as automatic activities. When human input is required, they are referred to as interactive activities. As an illustration, the following are the types of activities that can be included in the BPM system:\n\n","It should be noted that the above activities are provided purely for illustrational purposes and that the BPM system is not limited to this or any other specific list of activity types.","In various embodiments, the activities of the business process can be linked by transitions, which bridge the activities and determine the order in which the activities will be performed and the basic workflow for the process. In other words, the transition can determine which path the process will follow from any given activity. As an illustration, the BPM system can support the following transition types:\n\n","It should be noted that these are intended to be non-limiting examples of transitions and other such transitions between activities are possible within the scope of the present embodiments.","In one embodiment, activities have at least an outgoing unconditional transition so there is always a way to continue the process. In most real-world processes several activities also have outgoing conditional transitions. In this case, the conditional transitions are evaluated first, and the unconditional transition is taken only if the conditional transitions all evaluate to false. In programming terms, the unconditional transition is like an else clause in an if-then-else construct. In one embodiment, the business rule transitions are evaluated before conditional transitions, so if a business rule transition and a conditional transition both evaluate to true, the business transition is used. Due transitions can act separately. They can pull the instance from the activity as soon as a time condition is met. In this case, all other outgoing transitions can be ignored.","In various embodiments, each activity of the business process can belong to a role. Roles can then be assigned to participants who are the actual individual users who interact with the process. A given participant can have one role or multiple roles. The participants who can perform an activity are those who have been assigned the role that the activity belongs to. In certain embodiments, the roles can be parametric, i.e. they can take on different values at execution of the process instance and depending on that value at execution time, the task can be assigned to a different person. For example, depending on the dollar amount of the credit request, the same activity of the process can be directed to a different approval manager according to that value. Similarly, depending on the value of the geographical region where the request originated, the activity\/task may be forwarded to a different person. The parametric role thus allows one business process definition and one activity to be executed by different roles, depending on specific values which take place at runtime.","In various embodiments, the BPM system further includes an execution console that manages the execution of process instances by the engines, and a repository that maintains state data associated with each process instance (e.g. persistent variables and decisions of the process). Furthermore, the system can include an organizational settings module that populates the process with organization-specific values upon instantiation.","Business processes can thus be designed with the process designer and executed with a BPM execution engine, along with client applications, management tools, and other components, to interact with it. All of these modules can be included within the BPM system. Additionally, if a business process invokes web services, reads from a custom database, or uses Enterprise JavaBeans (EJBs), it may be necessary to ensure that these services are available in order to enable the application to work as expected.","In various embodiments, the BPM system can be used to integrate a set of multiple, heterogeneous applications (both backend and front end applications) into a single and seamless business process. New business processes can then be similarly created to invoke these existing applications. To achieve this, integration adapters can be generated using technology-specific discovery mechanisms. This approach enables integration with a wide range of common technologies, including but not limited to Java libraries, .NET assemblies, COM\/DCOM components, Web Services, message queues, Enterprise Java Beans (EJBs), CORBA objects, relational databases and XML documents. In one embodiment, the BPM system introspects or discovers the metadata from any application programming interface (API) to identify the business service and its incumbent data, and then packages those elements as reusable components that are invoked from business processes when required. For example, when a business process instance is executed, one of its activities can invoke an application, while another activity can invoke a completely different application, one that is remotely located and built on a different technology platform from the first application.","When a business process is executed by an engine, it can form a specific process instance. A business process instance is a specific item proceeding through the business process. Thus, the process instance can be the representation of a single enactment of a process, or an activity within a process, including its associated data. For example, in a business process which handles purchases, each instance will be an individual purchase order. There can be any number of instances traversing a business process, as there can be any number of purchase orders going through a purchase order system. In one embodiment, each instance can represent a separate thread of execution of the process or activity, and will have its own internal state and externally visible identity, which may be used, for example, to record or retrieve audit data relating to the individual enactment, such as a particular purchase order number, as opposed to the general purchase order process. Instances can start at the Begin activity of the process and finish in the End activity. The path the instances take can depend entirely on the data of the instance and the external environment.","Each process instance can have a specific history and properties. In the case of a purchase order, the instance can contain a customer name, a list of items, an amount due, dates of delivery and payment, and other relevant data. An instance can also have various status conditions. In the case of a purchase order, it may be desirable to know if it has been approved, if it has been paid for, or if the requested products have been shipped. The process instance can also utilize different backend applications within the enterprise via the introspection discovery mechanism previously described. Thus, each activity of the instance can invoke a different application within the enterprise.","Each instance can have a beginning and an end, as defined in the business process. As the instance proceeds through the process, it can be worked on by various participants or processed automatically by software. Thus, when the process instance is executed, activities and tasks are accessed by the various participants within the organization.","Embodiments of the present invention can include computer-based methods and systems which may be implemented using conventional general purpose or a specialized digital computer(s) or microprocessor(s), programmed according to the teachings of the present disclosure. Appropriate software coding can readily be prepared by programmers based on the teachings of the present disclosure.","Embodiments of the present invention can include a computer readable medium, such as computer readable storage medium. The computer readable storage medium can have stored instructions which can be used to program a computer to perform any of the features present herein.
