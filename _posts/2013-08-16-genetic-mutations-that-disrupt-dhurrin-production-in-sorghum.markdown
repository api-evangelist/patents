Fern and gymnosperm species generally produce cyanogenic glucosides from the aromatic amino acids, whereas angiosperms produce cyanogenic glucosides from aliphatic and aromatic amino acids (Bak et al., 2006). Arthropods including millipedes (Diploda), centipedes (Chilopoda), beetles (Coleoptera), and true bugs (Heteroptera) also produce cyanogenic glucosides that are synthesized from aromatic amino acids or in the case of lepidopterans from aliphatic amino acids (Bak et al., 2006; Zagrobelny et al., 2008).","When plant tissues are disrupted through chewing or tissue maceration, the cyanogenic glucosides in the vacuoles are brought into contact with \u03b2-glucosidases and \u03b1-hydroxynitrile lyases that hydrolyze the cyanogenic glucosides and produce HCN (Vetter et al., 2000). This HCN renders the consumption of plant materials containing cyanogenic glucosides toxic to humans and most animals (Oluwole et al., 2000). The affinity of cyanide for the terminal cytochrome oxidase in the mitochondrial respiratory pathway is the main cause of toxicity (Brattsten et al., 1983). A lethal dose of cyanide for vertebrate animals is in the range of 35-150 \u03bcmol kg-1, but higher amounts can be tolerated if consumed over a longer period (Davis and Nahrstedt, 1985). Studies in horses showed that -based diets consumed over a 2-month period resulted in incoordination of the hind legs, urinary incontinence, and haematuria. These symptoms were followed by increased nasal discharge, increased body temperature, and depression of appetite (Varshney et al., 1996).","Given the toxicity of HCN, cyanogenic glucosides are assumed to play a role in plant defense against animal and insect herbivores. The effects of cyanogenic plants in human and animal health is well documented (Banea-Mayambu et al., 1997, 2000; Robinson, 1930; Boyd, 1938; Webber et al., 1985; Hopkins et al., 1995). In the case of forage, cyanide poisoning resulting in cattle death was first reported in Australia more than a hundred years ago (Anon, 1897).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"i":["Sorghum ","S. bicolor ","sorghum","S. bicolor "],"figref":"FIG. 1"},"Dhurrin is a cyanogenic glucoside of and dhurrin accumulation in plant tissues negatively impacts forage and feedstock quality. breeders are working to modify dhurrin content to improve forage and biomass quality but are constrained by a lack of natural genetic variation for this trait in the elite gene pool. Mutation breeding is being used to induce mutations in the dhurrin biosynthesis pathways. One mutant was recently identified in Australia that produced no dhurrin in any tissue but exhibited \u201cslightly slower growth at early seedling stage.\u201d (Blomstedt, 2012). Different mutations or alleles that similarly disrupt dhurrin biosynthesis but without impacts on growth may be better suited to commercial product development.","Dhurrin content is highest in young seedlings and can represent as much as 6 to 10% of the dry weight of plants (Akazawa et al., 1960; Conn, 1994). Accumulations as high as 30% dry weight have been reported in some parts of seedlings (Halkier et al., 1989). However, little is known about the downstream processing and utilization of cyanogenic glucosides in or any other plant species.","Thus, there is a need for a low-dhurrin or dhurrin-free plant that has a standard growth rate compared to existing commercial varieties.","Embodiments of the present invention relate generally to new forage crops and methods of creating new forage crops. In a specific embodiment, the present invention relates to new varieties of that do not produce dhurrin. In a still further embodiment, the present invention relates to new varieties of that do not produce dhurrin but have a standard growth rate. In an example, the genome is mutated via chemical mutagenesis and mutants are identified that produce no dhurrin. In some embodiments, the mutant plants comprise the genetic mutation present in the plant mutants identified as Tx623(EMS)2447 and Tx623(EMS)5085 and hence the mutant plants do not produce dhurrin.","In one embodiment, a method of producing a plant with altered dhurrin content or catabolism as compared to a control plant is provided. The method comprises inducing mutagenesis by applying a chemical mutagen to a reproductive portion of a plant; producing a population of mutant plants using the treated reproductive portion; assaying the population of mutant for altered dhurrin content; and growing the mutant plant, wherein the mutant plant exhibits altered dhurrin content or catabolism as compared to a control plant.","In some embodiments, the mutant plant has the same genetic mutation or mutations that result in lack of dhurrin production in the mutant plants identified as Tx623(EMS)2447 and Tx623(EMS)5085.","In some embodiments, the mutant plant exhibits decreased dhurrin content as compared to the control plant. In some embodiments, the mutant plant is substantially dhurrin-free as compared to a control . In some embodiments, the mutant plant exhibits no significant difference in growth rate as compared to the control plant. For example, the photosynthetic properties, maturation rate, and\/or the biomass accumulation are not significantly different between the mutant plant as compared to the control plant. In an embodiment, there is no significant difference in chlorophyll concentration between mutant plants identified as Tx623(EMS)2447 and Tx623(EMS)5085 as compared to control plants. In a further embodiment, the mutant plants produce dhurrin but lack the ability to catabolize dhurrin to HCN.","The features, functions, and advantages that have been discussed may be achieved independently in various embodiments of the present invention or may be combined with yet other embodiments, further details of which can be seen with reference to the following description and drawings.","Embodiments of the present invention now will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which some, but not all, embodiments of the invention are shown. Indeed, the invention may be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein; rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will satisfy applicable legal requirements.

Like numbers refer to like elements throughout.","Embodiments of the present invention relate generally to new forage crops and methods of creating new crops. Chemical mutagenesis and screening for variation in plants is a promising technique for creating new forage crops with desired traits. Examples of desirable traits for forage crops include, but are not limited to, crops that do not produce cyanogenic glucosides such as dhurrin, crops that do not produce hydrogen cyanides, and crops that have a standard growth rate compared to existing commercial varieties.","In some embodiments, the crops of the present invention are annual grasses, such as members of the Poaceae plant family. The species may also be biennials or perennials depending on cultivar and species. In an exemplary embodiment, the crop is a member of the genus , such as the cultivated species can grow in arid solids and withstand prolonged droughts. It has a large root-to-leaf surface area and will roll its leaves in times of drought to lessen water loss by transpiration. is a C4 plant and hence it has improved photosynthetic efficiency and reduced water loss in hot or dry environments. Development of with altered dhurrin content or catabolism is therefore desirable as it improves a highly drought tolerant forage crop. Dhurrin-free forage crops are less likely to sicken domesticated animals when used as a feed.","In , a set of three hundred genotypes from a panel of conversion lines and advanced breeding lines (Casa et al., 2008) was screened to determine the extent of natural genetic variation for dhurrin content in . The initial survey utilized a spectrometric approach to estimate differences in dhurrin content among lines (Gorz et al., 1977). Genotypes representing the phenotypic extremes of predicted dhurrin content were re-analyzed by HPLC. These experiments demonstrated a 5-fold variation among lines with a few entries showing extremely high- or low-dhurrin content. None of the genotypes represented a dhurrin-free phenotype.","Researchers have attempted to improve as a forage crop through breeding programs. Unfortunately, the lack of genetic variation in dhurrin production has made it difficult to breed crop varieties that do not produce dhurrin.","Chemical mutagenesis is a process by which the genes of an organism are changed by exposure to chemical mutagens. In an embodiment, ethyl methanesulfonate can be used as a chemical mutagen to produce a population of mutants having a greater range of variation in dhurrin content than available in the natural gene pool. Ethyl methanesulfonate is a mutagenic organic compound with the formula CHSOCH. Ethyl methanesulfonate produces random mutations in genetic material by nucleotide substitution. In an embodiment, ethyl methanesulfonate may be applied to seeds to induce genetic mutations in the seed genomes.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"14.48mm","wi":"23.71mm","file":"US09512437-20161206-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"In some embodiments, chemical mutagenesis is used to produce crops with altered cyanogenic glucoside composition. In an exemplary embodiment, ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) mutagenesis is used to produce with lowered dhurrin content. Annual grasses such as sorghums (spp.) are appealing candidates for creating new forage crops. As used herein, the term \u201c\u201d refers to all of the spp., including hybrids.","In one embodiment, a method of producing a plant with altered dhurrin content or catabolism as compared to a control plant is provided. The method comprises inducing mutagenesis by applying a chemical mutagen to a reproductive portion of a plant; producing a population of mutant plants using the treated reproductive portion; assaying the population of mutant for altered dhurrin content; and growing the mutant plant, wherein the mutant plant exhibits altered dhurrin content or catabolism as compared to a control plant.","In some embodiments, the chemical mutagen is ethyl methanesulfonate. Alkaloids such as diethyl sulfate (DES) or dimethyl sulfate may be used instead of or in addition to ethyl methanesulfonate. Other chemical mutagens may also be used.","In some embodiments, the mutated plant exhibits altered dhurrin content or catabolism in the form of decreased dhurrin content as compared to the control plant. In some embodiments, the mutated plant exhibits altered dhurrin content or catabolism in the form of substantially no dhurrin content as compared to the control plant. In an embodiment, substantially no dhurrin content means dhurrin content undetectable by standard lab procedures. In some embodiments, the mutated plant exhibits altered dhurrin content or catabolism in the form of decreased or zero dhurrin content while retaining a standard growth rate. In one embodiment, the mutation of the plants results in at least one plant not producing dhurrin while still having a standard, as opposed to reduced, growth rate at all stages of plant development compared to existing commercial varieties. The control plant can be a wild-type plant, a commercial or hybrid variety, or any other plant suitable for the purpose of comparison. In a still further embodiment, the mutant plant produces dhurrin but lacks at least one enzyme in the catabolic stages to convert dhurrin to HCN.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"i":["Sorghum ","sorghum","sorghum "]},"As noted above, development of forage crops with altered dhurrin content or catabolism is desirable as it improves forage quality, possibly by reducing or removing the production of HCN. In many plant bioenergy crops, such as , barley (L.), and cassava (Crantz.), dhurrin is produced and causes HCN to be produced when the biomass is crushed, macerated, or otherwise disturbed. Further, dhurrin content increases during times of plant stress or nitrogen-enrichment. The availability of dhurrin-free forage biomass with low or no-dhurrin reduces threats to livestock.","Having discussed the importance of as a forage crop, the problem of dhurrin content in , and the limitations related to producing dhurrin-free varieties, an example is now provided disclosing the production of two dhurrin-free varieties. An exemplary flowchart of the method used to produce forage crops having altered dhurrin concentration is presented in . In this example, ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) mutagenesis was used to produce a population of mutants having a greater range of variation in dhurrin content than available in the natural gene pool. Approximately 1.5 kg seeds of BTx623, the genotype of the sequenced genome, were treated with 45 mM EMS () and the seeds were planted under field conditions (). The M1 panicles were allowed to self-pollinate then hand-harvested and threshed to produce approximately 12,000 M2 families.","Next, the M2 families were screened for variation in dhurrin metabolism by planting seeds in sand benches in a greenhouse () and evaluating 10-12 young seedlings per family at the 2- to 3-leaf stage. A portion of the upper-leaf was sampled into 96-well plates and frozen at \u221280\u00b0 C. overnight. In the morning, the plates were covered with Feigl-Anger paper (Feigl and Anger, 1966) and thawed at 35\u00b0 C. for 30 minutes. Blue spots on the Feigl-Anger paper indicated release of HCN from the leaf tissue ().  depicts the results of the Feigl-Anger paper assay for mutants Tx623(EMS)2447 and Tx623(EMS)5085 as compared to the wild-type. This high-throughput assay provided a powerful screen for identification of plants compromised in dhurrin biosynthesis or catabolism.","In some embodiments, the nucleotide sequence for Tx623(EMS)2447 and Tx623(EMS)5085 or other mutants depicting impaired dhurrin concentration can be determined, the mutant sequence compared to the wild-type sequence, and the genetic mutation responsible for the decreased dhurrin concentration determined (). In a still further embodiment of the method, this genetic mutation can be incorporated into forage crops in order to produce a mutated forage crop having altered dhurrin production ().","A comparison of HCN release in numerous pairs of white and green siblings from M2 families segregating for albinism showed that even albino plants produce large-quantities of HCN. This indicated that photosynthesis was not required for dhurrin accumulation in young seedling tissues. The dhurrin produced in albino tissues must be synthesized from precursors stored and released from the endosperm reserves. Based on these results, mutants identified in a screen for HCN release may not only indicate lesions in dhurrin metabolism but also genes involved in precursor biosynthesis and transport.","A forward genetic screen of 5,000 M2 families identified several mutants impaired in HCN production. HPLC analysis was used to determine if these mutants were capable of producing dhurrin. Plants were grown in a greenhouse. The youngest fully expanded leaf from seedlings and adult plants was sampled and the fresh weight recorded. The leaf samples were then immersed in 50% methanol maintained at 75\u00b0 C. for 15 minutes to inactivate the catabolic enzymes. The samples were ground and suspended in 500 \u03bcl of 50% methanol. A Shim-pack XR-ODS column (3.0\u00d775 mm, 2.2 mm) (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) was used to analyze the samples as previously described (De Nicola et al., 2011). The results from these studies indicated that many mutants that could not produce HCN were able to produce dhurrin. These mutants represent lesions in genes associated with dhurrin catabolism.","However, as shown in , mutant plants from Tx623(EMS)2447 and Tx623(EMS)5085 did not produce dhurrin (Table 1). Note also that the wild type genotope, when used as a comparison, produced 24.1 \u03bcmol\/g FW.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"HPLC analysis of the chemical composition of"},{"entry":{"i":"sorghum "}},{"entry":"biosynthesis."}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"91pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Mutant Family","Genotype","Dhurrin (\u03bcmol\/gFW)"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"91pt","align":"char","char":"."}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Tx623(EMS)2447","WT","24.1"]},{"entry":[{},{},"HCN\u2212","0"]},{"entry":[{},"Tx623(EMS)5085","WT","30.4"]},{"entry":[{},{},"HCN\u2212","0"]},{"entry":[{},"BTx623","WT -

For example, a recombinagenic oligonucleotide can be introduced into a plant cell using any method commonly used in the art, including but not limited to, microcarriers (biolistic delivery), microfibers, electroporation, and microinjection.","In some embodiments, the Tx623(EMS)2447 or Tx623(EMS)5085 plant exhibits altered dhurrin content or catabolism in the form of decreased dhurrin content as compared to the control plant. In some embodiments, the Tx623(EMS)2447 or Tx623(EMS)5085 plant exhibits altered dhurrin content or catabolism in the form of zero dhurrin content as compared to the control plant. In some embodiments, the Tx623(EMS)2447 or Tx623(EMS)5085 plant exhibits altered dhurrin content or catabolism in the form of decreased (e.g., zero) dhurrin content but retaining a standard growth rate as compared to the control plant. The control plant can be a wild-type plant, a commercial or hybrid crop variety, or any other plant suitable for the purpose of comparison.","The Tx623(EMS)2447 and Tx623(EMS)5085 mutants described in this disclosure were shown to be dhurrin-free. Whole genome sequencing of the Tx623(EMS)2447 and Tx623(EMS)5085 genotypes showed that both mutants harbored a C493Y mutation in the CYP79A1 gene that disrupts dhurrin biosynthesis (). These mutants do not produce measurable dhurrin and do not exhibit a slow-growth phenotype.","Although this description mainly refers to using embodiments of the invention in conjunction with the Tx623(EMS)2447 and Tx623(EMS)5085 genotypes, it should be appreciated that these embodiments may be used to induce other mutations in for modulating or altering dhurrin content or catabolism.","Given the normal growth pattern of these dhurrin-free mutants, the dhurrin-free mutants identified in this disclosure may provide an alternative genetic resource for modifying dhurrin production in . On a national and global scale, development of dhurrin-free grain, forage, and biomass cultivars has the potential to replace corn and other forage crops that have lower water-use efficiency characteristics resulting in reduced water requirements for irrigation.","Specific embodiments of the invention are described herein. Many modifications and other embodiments of the invention set forth herein will come to mind to one skilled in the art to which the invention pertains having the benefit of the teachings presented in the foregoing descriptions and the associated drawings. Therefore, it is to be understood that the invention is not to be limited to the specific embodiments disclosed and that modifications and other embodiments and combinations of embodiments are intended to be included within the scope of the appended claims.
