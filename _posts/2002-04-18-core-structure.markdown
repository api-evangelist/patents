title: Core structure
abstract: There is disclosed a core structure with a very low profile, high power density and lower losses. Higher core surface area and improved core utilization in terms of flux density are other desirable feature in the disclosed design. The disclosed design also allowed for a larger core area where the DC fluxes are added, thereby reducing the air-gap requirements in the cores derived from low saturation density materials such as ferrites. The cellular nature of the design can also be effectively employed in vertically packaged power converters and modules.

Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to core structures.","2. Description of Related Art","Power converters are key components in many military and commercial systems and they often govern size and performance. Power density, efficiency and reliability are key characteristics used to evaluate the characteristics of power converters. Transformers and inductors used within these power converters may be large and bulky and often limit their efficiency, power density and reliability.","The magnetic theory controlling the operation of inductors and transformers is well known. The general concepts for combining magnetic functions of inductors and transformers on a single magnetic core structure are also well known. Integrated transformer\/inductor devices typically take advantage of a transformer's magnetizing inductance to combine the function of a transformer and the function of an inductor connected in parallel with the transformer's secondary winding on a single core structure.","One type of well-known core is the E-core. An E-core has a cross-section that looks like the capital letter \u201cE.\u201d An E-core is typically disposed on its side, with the long part of the E at the bottom, forming a base. E-cores are commonly used in current doubler circuits. To obtain current of different levels, a number of E-cores may be used in a circuit.","E-cores typically have one of two configurations\u2014the EI-core or the EE-core. In the EI-core, a flat plate, the \u201cI,\u201d is disposed on top of the basic E-core. In the EE-core, two Es are put together, with the legs of the Es facing each other. The EI-core, the EE-core and other cores incorporating the E core structure are referred to generically as E-cores.","E-cores are typically used for transformers and inductors, and a single E-core may be adapted for use as both a transformer and an inductor. In one typical design, both of the outer legs have a primary and a secondary winding. Current to the windings is typically switched so that only one outer leg at any given time is acting as a transformer. The device is said to have one or two switching periods during which the inductors charge, and a freewheeling period during which the inductors discharge. In devices having two switching phases, the circuitry provides for one outer leg to act as an inductor while the other outer leg is acting as a transformer. Because of their dual but time-separated nature, the outer legs are said to have a transformer phase and an inductor phase. E-cores can be isolated (without transformers) or non-isolated (with transformers). E-cores may also be used only as transformers.","When an outer leg of an E-core is acting as an inductor, magnetic flux is stored in the core. Magnetic flux flows through the outer leg which is acting as an inductor, through the top, the base, and through the center leg of the E. To provide increased energy storage, there is typically an air gap between the center leg and the top. Because of the air gap, the center leg is therefore typically shorter than the outer legs. Inductance in an E-core is primarily determined by the area of the center leg. To obtain higher inductance, the area of the center leg is increased.","One limitation on the area of the center leg is fringing flux. Like bright light from one room leaking under a door into a dark second room, flux from the air gap can spill onto the outer legs. Fringing flux causes current losses in the transformer of the other outer leg. One way to accommodate fringing flux is to place the windings on the outer legs a safe distance from the air gap. To do this, the outer legs may be far from the center leg, or the outer legs may be longer so that the windings may be positioned closer to the base and far enough from the air gap. These two solutions result in either a wider E-core or a taller E-core, both of which can be burdens on mechanical designs. Another way to reduce fringing is to increase the area of the air gap. Fringing varies inversely with the area of the air gap.","Another problem with most E-cores arises from their inefficiency. In general, the energy losses come in the form of heat. This generated heat can become a significant problem, requiring cooling through fans, air flow and other means. The additional power and cooling needs create additional burdens on electronic and mechanical designs.","Throughout this description, the embodiments and examples shown should be considered as exemplars, rather than limitations on the apparatus and methods of the present invention.","A core in accordance with the invention is useful in power modules and power converters. These power modules and power converters are well suited for low voltage, high current DC-DC converter applications. A core in accordance with the invention may have ultra-low profile magnetics, resulting in better utilization, higher inductance, improved efficiency and lower temperature. In typical E-cores, increased compactness results in decreased efficiency. In contrast, in a core of the invention, increased compactness may result in increased efficiency. Improved efficiency is an unexpected benefit of the invention.","Principals of the invention are described below with respect to a half-bridge current doubler rectifier application. The invention is, however, applicable to a wide variety of DC-DC converter topologies and control algorithms. The core of the invention may also be useful in other types of power converters and modules, such as AC-AC and AC-DC. The cellular structure also enables the use of interleaving with multi-phase DC-DC converters to further reduce the current and voltage ripple and higher integration levels for multiple output DC-DC converters with integrated magnetics.","Referring now to , there are shown two views of a core  having a square design in accordance with the invention. The core  comprises a base , a center portion , plural posts , , ,  and a top . The base , the posts , , ,  and the center portion  may be produced as an integrated unit. Alternatively, some or all of these parts , , , , ,  may be produced separately and joined. The core  may be formed of a single material. Alternatively, the materials of the separate components may be different and varied. The materials may be magnetic, such as ferrite, 3F3, powdered iron, nickel-iron alloys, or non-magnetic, or composite.","Whereas the base of a typical E-core has a linear shape, the base  of core  has a square shape, with the four posts , , ,  disposed at the four corners of the square. The posts , , ,  are disposed on a top region  of the base . Post  is disposed at the intersection of outer edges  and . Post  is disposed at the intersection of outer edges  and . Post  is disposed at the intersection of outer edges  and . Post  is disposed at the intersection of outer edges  and . The base  is planar and the top region  is flat where exposed, though these configurations are not required.","The center portion  is also disposed on the top region  of the base . The center portion  includes legs , , ,  which are between the posts , , , . Leg  is disposed between posts  and . Leg  is disposed between posts  and . Leg  is disposed between posts  and . Leg  is disposed between posts  and . The legs , , ,  provide separation between the posts , , , . In the square-shaped core  of , the center portion  has a plus shape.","The legs , , ,  and the posts , , ,  also define respective windows. There is a window  between post  and center legs , . There is a window  between post  and center legs , . There is a window  between post  and center legs , . There is a window  between post  and center legs , .","The top  of core  comprises a flat plate, similar to the top plate of an EI-core. However, a top in accordance with the invention need not be flat or plate-like, may be similar to that of an EE-core, and its shape may be adapted for the desired characteristics of the core.","Referring now to , there is shown a side view of the core . In this view, the core  looks like a typical E-core. In this view, an air gap  is apparent. The air gap  is defined by the top  and the center portion . The height of leg  is exaggerated in this view to make the air gap  larger and therefore more apparent. The air gap  extends the entire space between the center portion  and the top \u2014above all of the legs , , , .","The view of  demonstrates the cellular nature of a core of the present invention. As used herein, a \u201ccell\u201d comprises two posts, the base and the center portion. Although two posts in part define a cell, windings on these posts and their electrical connections provide further definition of a cell. The number of primary and secondary windings on a given post is selected based in part upon the number of cells which are desired to share the post.","The core  may be used in a four cell structure. The combination of the two posts ,  with the center portion  and the base  may be used in one cell of the core . The view taken from any of the four sides , , ,  of the core  has the same appearance. Thus, the four cells of core  may be comprised of the center portion , the base  and any two adjacent posts: post +post , post +post , post +post , or post +post . Whether such a combination is a cell, however, depends on the windings on each post.","One of the benefits of the core of the present invention is the presence of a shorter air gap than would be found in a comparable typical E-core or collection of E-cores. Whereas a typical E-core has a center leg between the two outer legs, the core of the invention has a center portion which may be considerably larger in comparison. The larger center portion may result in a shorter air gap. The shorter air gap has reduced fringing flux, meaning that the core may be more compact. In use, a power converter or power module of the invention should be considerably more efficient than a collection of E-cores providing comparable outputs. Thus, power consumption is reduced, heat losses are reduced, cooling requirements are reduced, and overall size requirements are reduced.","Referring now to , there is shown a top view of a core  having a radial design in accordance with the invention. The radial core  is similar to the rectangular core  of FIG. . The core  includes a base , center portion , posts , , ,  and windows , , , . The base  is round and the posts , , ,  are disposed on its perimeter. The center portion  has a round central portion  Legs , , ,  radiate from the central portion .","The core  has a cellular structure. Referring now to , there is shown a side view of the core . From the side, the core  has substantially the same appearance as the rectangular core  shown in FIG. . In , the visible cell comprises posts , , the center portion  and the base . The core  has three more cells, also comprised of the center portion , the base , and: post +post , post +post , and post +post .","The desired transformer and inductor behavior, as well as cost and mechanical constraints, determine dimensions of the core, posts, legs, windows and air gap. Although the cores ,  are symmetric, a core of the invention may be asymmetric. There may be variations amongst the posts, legs, windows and air gap in their sizes, shapes and placement on the base. The solid geometries of the posts, legs, center portion and base may also be varied. The number of windings on each post may be varied.","Although some center portion must be included in a core, the legs may be omitted. The legs improve performance of the power conducting device by giving a shorter or more direct path to the center area. The legs also contribute to the larger area of the center portion and the larger area of the air gap.","Because of the large center portion of a core of the invention, very high inductance can be obtained from a smaller device. The size and shape of the center portion may be determined from the maximum flux density of the material and the total load current. How far the legs extend to, along side and past the posts may be determined from many factors, including performance, cost, and ease of manufacturing.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00042","num":"00042"},"figref":["FIG. 5A","FIG. 5A"],"b":["500","5","100","1","400","4","500","511","512","521","522","511","512","521","522","110","111","120","121","210","211","220","221","110","111","120","121","210","211","220","221"]},"In the four cell core  of , the posts , , ,  each have two primary windings and two secondary windings. For example, a cell comprising posts  and  includes primary windings P and P. The other cells include, respectively, posts ,  and windings P, P, posts ,  and windings P, P, and posts ,  and windings P, P. When the primary voltage is of a given polarity, the secondary windings on diagonally opposite posts (e.g.,  and , and  and ) share the load current. The energy due to the primary current in the posts in their inductor phase is stored in the air gap of the center portion. Thus, the load current is divided into four parallel paths when the power is transferred across the transformer core and into eight parallel paths during the freewheeling period.","Referring now to , there is shown a circuit diagram corresponding to the diagram of  typical E-core is used in a current doubler circuit. The circuit of  is a current quadruplet.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00045","num":"00045"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 3"],"b":["600","610","611","612","613","614","615","616","617","618","619","600"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00046","num":"00046"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 7","FIGS. 1 and 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["700","710","110","100","700","700","700","720","730","740"]},"The core may have other shapes besides square and circle. The desired number of cells may be used to determine the shape. The shape may be rectangular, hexagonal, trapezoidal, oval, T-shaped, L-shaped and other regular and irregular shapes.","A core in accordance with the invention may be viewed as a combination of typical E-cores. In this way, the E-core may be considered an elementary cell, and a core of the invention may be derived by integrating multiple such cells with a shared center portion. By replicating elementary cells, one can develop higher current modules without compromising performance and power density.","As can be seen, this cellular structure enables the development of novel interleaving schemes to reduce switching ripple in inductor current and output voltage.
