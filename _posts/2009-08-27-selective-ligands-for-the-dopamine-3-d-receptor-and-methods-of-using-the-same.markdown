The government has certain rights in the invention.","The present invention relates to ligands for the dopamine 3 (D) receptor and to therapeutic methods of treating conditions and diseases wherein modulation of the Dreceptor provides a benefit.","Dopamine (DA) is a neurotransmitter that plays an essential role in normal brain functions. As a chemical messenger, dopamine is similar to adrenaline. In the brain, dopamine is synthesized in the pre-synaptic neurons and released into the space between the pre-synaptic and post-synaptic neurons.","Dopamine affects brain processes that control movement, emotional response, and ability to experience pleasure and pain. Therefore, the regulation of dopamine plays an important role in mental and physical health. Neurons containing dopamine are clustered in the midbrain area called the substantia nigra. Abnormal dopamine signaling in the brain has been implicated in a substantial number of pathological conditions, including drug (e.g., cocaine) abuse, depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, Tourette's syndrome, eating disorders, alcoholism, chronic pain, obsessive compulsive disorders, restless leg syndrome, Parkinson's Disease, and the like.","Dopamine molecules bind to and activate dopamine receptors on the post-synaptic neurons. Dopamine molecules then are transported through the dopamine transporter protein (DAT) back into the pre-synaptic neurons, where they are metabolized by monoamine oxidase (MAO). In conditions such as cocaine abuse, cocaine binds to the dopamine transporter and blocks the normal flow of dopamine molecules. Excess concentrations of dopamine cause over-activation of dopamine receptors. In other conditions, such as Parkinson's Disease, lack of sufficient dopamine receptors in the brain causes insufficient activation of dopamine receptors.","Dopaminergic neurotransmission is mediated by five dopamine receptors (D-D) that can be grouped into the D-like (Dand D) and D-like (D, Dand D) receptor subtypes. Recent studies suggest that the Dreceptor is a promising therapeutic target for a variety of conditions, including drug abuse, restless leg syndrome, schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, and depression (1-6). Therefore, considerable effort has been expended to discover and develop potent and selective Dligands (6-22).","Despite these intense efforts, the design and discovery of truly selective Dligands with good aqueous solubility and bioavailability remains a challenge. Compound 1 (pramipexole) is a known, potent D-preferring agonist, but has limited selectivity over the Dreceptor in vitro (23) and in vivo (24, 25). Compound 2 (BP 897) initially was reported as a Dpartial agonist and has a 67-fold selectivity over the Dreceptor (2).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0009"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"72.81mm","wi":"75.78mm","file":"US08283368-20121009-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"A number of potent and selective Dligands, such as compound 3, have been designed based upon the core structure of compound 2 (17). Compound 4 is a potent and selective Dligand using hexahydropyrazinoquinoline as the core structure. Despite its relatively high affinity and excellent selectivity for Dover other dopamine receptor subtypes, compound 4 has a poor aqueous solubility, which limits in vivo evaluations. Poor aqueous solubility also is a major limitation for many recently disclosed selective Dligands, and is an obstacle for evaluating these compounds in animal behavioral models and for a therapeutic potential.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0011"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00003","num":"00003"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00003","he":"90.34mm","wi":"75.69mm","file":"US08283368-20121009-C00003.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"Accordingly, a need still exists in the art for a potent and selective Dligand having physical and pharmacological properties that permit use of the ligand in therapeutic applications.

One or more dose of the compound of structural formula (I) and\/or one or more dose of the second therapeutic agent can be administered.","The compounds of structural formula (I) therefore can be used in conjunction with one or more second therapeutic agents, for example, but not limited to, antipsychotic agents (e.g., clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, ziprasidone, haloperidol, and aripiprazole), antidepressant agents, such as tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., amitriptyline, dothiepin, doxepin, trimipramine, butriptyline, clomipramine, desipramine, imipramine, iprindole, lofepramine, nortriptyline, and protriptyline), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (e.g., isocarboxazid, phenelzine, and tranylcyclopramine), 5-HT reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluvoxamine, sertraline, fluoxetine, and paroxetine), serotonin-1 B antagonists (e.g., elzasonan), serotonin-2A antagonists (e.g., eplivanserin and MDL-100907), histamine-3 antagonists or agonists (e.g., cipralisant, ABT239, TISQ, and GSK-189254A) and\/or with antiparkinsonian agents such as dopaminergic antiparkinsonian agents (e.g., levodopa, preferably in combination with a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor e.g., benserazide or carbidopa, or with a dopamine agonist, e.g., bromocriptine, lysuride, and pergolide).","The compounds of structural formula (I) are highly selective dopamine Dreceptor ligands which, because of their low affinity for other receptors such as dopamine Dand D, give rise to fewer side effects than compounds that are non-selective D\/Dligands (agonists, partial agonists, antagonists, or inverse agonists). Compounds of the present invention can be selective agonists, partial agonists, antagonists or inverse agonists for the D3 receptor over other dopamine receptors.","The present invention provides a selective Dligand, as exemplified by compounds of structural formula (I), for the treatment of a variety of diseases and conditions, in which selective modulation of the Dreceptor has a beneficial effect. Preferably, a compound of structural formula (I) is selective for the Dreceptor over the Dreceptor by a factor of at least 100, and over the Dreceptor by a factor of at least 1000.","Conditions and diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) are understood as meaning disorders which affect the spinal chord and, in particular, the brain. Within the meaning of the present invention, the term \u201cdisease\u201d or \u201ccondition\u201d denote disturbances and\/or anomalies that as a rule are regarded as being pathological conditions or functions, and that can manifest themselves in the form of particular signs, symptoms, and\/or malfunctions. The treatment methods according to the invention can be directed toward individual disorders, i.e. anomalies or pathological conditions, but it also is possible to treat several anomalies that may be causatively linked to each other to be combined into patterns, i.e., syndromes.","The diseases and conditions that can be treated in accordance to the invention include, for example, psychiatric and neurological disturbances. These diseases and conditions include, for example, organic disturbances, including symptomatic disturbances, such as psychoses of the acute exogenous reaction type or attendant psychoses or organic or exogenous cause, e.g., in association with metabolic disturbances, infections, and endocrinopathologies; endogenous psychoses, such as schizophrenia and schizotype and delusional disturbances; affective disturbances, such as depressions, mania, and\/or manic-depressive conditions; and also mixed forms of the above described diseases and conditions; neurotic and somatoform disturbances and disturbances in association with stress; dissociative disturbances, e.g., loss of consciousness, clouding of consciousness, double consciousness, and personality disturbances; disturbances in attention and waking and\/or sleeping behavior, such as behavioral disturbances and emotional disturbances whose onset lies in childhood and youth, e.g., hyperactivity in children, intellectual deficits, in particular, attention disturbances (attention deficit disorders), memory disturbances and cognitive disturbances, e.g., impaired learning and memory (impaired cognitive function), dementia, narcolepsy, and sleep disturbances, e.g., restless leg syndrome; developmental disturbances; anxiety states, delirium, sex-life disturbances, e.g., impotence in men; eating disturbances, e.g., anorexia or bulimia, addiction, and other unspecified disturbances.","The disorders which can be treated in accordance with the invention also include Parkinson's disease and epilepsy, and, in particular, affective disturbances connected thereto.","The addiction diseases include psychic disorders and behavioral disturbances which are caused by the abuse of psychotropic substances, such as pharmaceuticals or narcotics and also other addiction diseases, such as addiction to gaming (impulse control disorders not elsewhere classified). Examples of addictive substances are opioids (e.g., morphine, heroin, and codeine), cocaine, nicotine, alcohol, substances which interact with GABA chloride channel complex, sedatives, hypnotics, and tranquilizers, for example, benzodiazepines; LSD; cannabinoids; psychomotor stimulants, such as 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-methylamphetamine (i.e., ecstasy), amphetamine and amphetamine-like substances, such as methylphenidate and other stimulants including caffeine. Addictive substances of particular consideration are opioids, cocaine, amphetamine or amphetamine-like substances, nicotine, and alcohol.","With regard to the treatment of addiction diseases, particular preference is given to compounds of structural formula (I) that do not possess a psychotropic effect. This can be observed in a test using rats which, after having been administered a compound of the invention, reduce their self-administration of a psychotropic substance, for example, cocaine.","According to another embodiment of the present invention, the compounds of structural formula (I) are suitable for treating conditions and diseases whose cause can be at least partially attributed to an anomalous activity of dopamine Dreceptors.","According to another embodiment of the present invention, the treatment is directed toward conditions and diseases that can be influenced by the binding of exogenously administered ligands to dopamine Dreceptors.","The diseases and conditions that can be treated with a compounds of the present invention frequently are characterized by progressive development, i.e., the above-described conditions change over the course of time, and, as a rule, the severity increases and conditions possibly can merge into one another, or other conditions appear in addition to those which already exist can appear.","The compounds according to the invention can be used to treat a large number of signs, symptoms, and\/or malfunctions that are connected to disease and condition of the central nervous system and, in particular, the abovementioned diseases and conditions. These signs, symptoms, and\/or malfunctions include, for example, a disturbed relationship to reality, lack of insight, and ability to meet customary social norms or the demands made by life, changes in temperament, changes in individual drives, such as hunger, sleep, and thirst, for example, and mood, disturbances in the ability to observe and combine, changes in personality, in particular emotional lability, hallucinations, ego-disturbances, distractedness, ambivalence, autism, depersonalization, and false perceptions, delusional ideas, chanting speech, lack of synkinesia, short-step gait, flexed posture of trunk and limbs, tremor, poverty of facial expression, monotonous speech, depressions, apathy, impeded spontaneity and decisiveness, impoverished association ability, anxiety, nervous agitation, stammering, social phobia, panic disturbances, withdrawal symptoms in association with dependency, maniform syndromes, states of excitation and confusion, dysphoria, dyskinetic syndromes and tic disorders, e.g. Huntington's chorea and Gilles-de-la-Tourette's syndrome, vertigo syndromes, e.g., peripheral positional, rotational and oscillatory vertigo, melancholia, hysteria, hypochondria, and the like.","Therefore, compounds of the present invention are suitable for treatment of diseases of the central nervous system, in particular for treating affective disorders; neurotic disturbances, stress disturbances and somatoform disturbances and psychoses and, in particular, for treating schizophrenia and depression. Because of their high selectivity with regard to the Dreceptor, the compounds of structural formula (I) also are suitable for treating disturbances of kidney function which are caused by diabetes mellitus (see WO 00\/67847 incorporated herein by reference) and, especially, diabetic nephropathy.","In the present method, a therapeutically effective amount of one or more compound (I), as a rule formulated in accordance with pharmaceutical practice, is administered to a human being in need thereof. Whether such a treatment is indicated, depends on the individual case and is subject to medical assessment (diagnosis) that takes into consideration signs, symptoms, and\/or malfunctions which are present, the risks of developing particular signs, symptoms and\/or malfunctions, and other factors.","A compound of structural formula (I) can be administered by any suitable route, for example by oral, buccal, inhalation, sublingual, rectal, vaginal, intracisternal or intrathecal through lumbar puncture, transurethral, nasal, percutaneous, i.e., transdermal, or parenteral (including intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous, intracoronary, intradermal, intramammary, intraperitoneal, intraarticular, intrathecal, retrobulbar, intrapulmonary injection and\/or surgical implantation at a particular site) administration. Parenteral administration can be accomplished using a needle and syringe or using a high pressure technique.","The pharmaceutical compositions include those wherein a compound of structural formula (I) is administered in an effective amount to achieve its intended purpose. Determination of a therapeutically effective amount is well within the capability of those skilled in the art, especially in light of the detailed disclosure provided herein.","The exact formulation, route of administration, and dosage is determined by an individual physician in view of the diagnosed condition or disease. Dosage amount and interval can be adjusted individually to provide levels of a compound of structural formula (I) that is sufficient to maintain therapeutic effects. The amount of pharmaceutical composition administered is dependent on the subject being treated, on the subject's weight, the severity of the affliction, the manner of administration, and the judgment of the prescribing physician.","Specifically, for administration to a human in the treatment of a disease or condition, oral dosages of a compound of structural formula (I), individually generally are about 0.005 to about 500 milligrams daily for an average adult patient (70 kg), typically one dose per day or divided into two to three doses per day. Thus, for a typical adult patient, individual doses contain about 0.005 to about 500 milligrams of compound (I), in a suitable pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle or carrier, for administration in single or multiple doses, once or several times per day. Dosages for intravenous, buccal, or sublingual administration typically are about 0.005 to about 250 milligrams\/kg per single dose as required. In practice, the physician determines the actual dosing regimen that is most suitable for an individual patient, and the dosage varies with the age, weight, and response of the particular patient. The above dosages are exemplary of the average case, but there can be individual instances in which higher or lower dosages are merited, and such are within the scope of this invention.","The compounds of the present invention can be administered alone, or in admixture with a pharmaceutical carrier selected with regard to the intended route of administration and standard pharmaceutical practice. Pharmaceutical compositions for use in accordance with the present invention thus can be formulated in a conventional manner using one or more physiologically acceptable carriers comprising excipients and auxiliaries that facilitate processing of the compounds of structural formula (I) into preparations that can be used pharmaceutically.","These pharmaceutical compositions can be manufactured in a conventional manner, e.g., by conventional mixing, dissolving, granulating, dragee-making, emulsifying, encapsulating, entrapping, or lyophilizing processes. Proper formulation is dependent upon the route of administration chosen. When a therapeutically effective amount of the compound of structural formula (I) is administered orally, the composition typically is in the of a tablet, capsule, powder, solution, or elixir. When administered in tablet form, the composition additionally can contain a solid carrier, such as a gelatin or an adjuvant. The tablet, capsule, and powder contain about 1% to about 95%, and preferably from about 1% to about 50%, of a compound of structural formula (I). When administered in liquid form, a liquid carrier, such as water, petroleum, or oils of animal or plant origin, can be added. The liquid form of the composition can further contain physiological saline solution, dextrose or other saccharide solutions, or glycols. When administered in liquid form, the composition contains about 0.1% to about 90%, and preferably about 1% to about 50%, by weight, of a compound of structural formula (I).","When a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of structural formula (I) is administered by intravenous, cutaneous, or subcutaneous injection, the composition is in the form of a pyrogen-free, parenterally acceptable aqueous solution. The preparation of such parenterally acceptable solutions, having due regard to pH, isotonicity, stability, and the like, is within the skill in the art. A preferred composition for intravenous, cutaneous, or subcutaneous injection typically contains, an isotonic vehicle. A compound of structural formula (I) can be infused with other fluids over a 10-30 minute span or over several hours.","Compounds of structural formula (I) can be readily combined with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers well-known in the art. Such carriers enable the active agents to be formulated as tablets, pills, dragees, capsules, liquids, gels, syrups, slurries, suspensions and the like, for oral ingestion by a patient to be treated. Pharmaceutical preparations for oral use can be obtained by adding the compound of structural formula (I) to a solid excipient, optionally grinding the resulting mixture, and processing the mixture of granules, after adding suitable auxiliaries, if desired, to obtain tablets or dragee cores. Suitable excipients include, for example, fillers and cellulose preparations. If desired, disintegrating agents can be added.","A compound of structural formula (I) can be formulated for parenteral administration by injection, e.g., by bolus injection or continuous infusion. Formulations for injection can be presented in unit dosage fowl, e.g., in ampules or in multidose containers, with an added preservative. The compositions can take such forms as suspensions, solutions, or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and can contain formulatory agents such as suspending, stabilizing, and\/or dispersing agents.","Pharmaceutical compositions for parenteral administration include aqueous solutions of the active agent in water-soluble form. Additionally, suspensions of a compound of structural formula (I) can be prepared as appropriate oily injection suspensions. Suitable lipophilic solvents or vehicles include fatty oils or synthetic fatty acid esters. Aqueous injection suspensions can contain substances which increase the viscosity of the suspension. Optionally, the suspension also can contain suitable stabilizers or agents that increase the solubility of the compounds and allow for the preparation of highly concentrated solutions. Alternatively, a present composition can be in powder form for constitution with a suitable vehicle, e.g., sterile pyrogen-free water, before use.","A compound of structural formula (I) also can be formulated in rectal compositions, such as suppositories or retention enemas, e.g., containing conventional suppository bases. In addition to the formulations described previously, the compound of structural formula (I) also can be formulated as a depot preparation. Such long-acting formulations can be administered by implantation (for example, subcutaneously or intramuscularly) or by intramuscular injection. Thus, for example, the compounds of structural formula (I) can be formulated with suitable polymeric or hydrophobic materials (for example, as an emulsion in an acceptable oil) or ion exchange resins.","In particular, the compounds of structural formula (I) can be administered orally, buccally, or sublingually in the form of tablets containing excipients, such as starch or lactose, or in capsules or ovules, either alone or in admixture with excipients, or in the form of elixirs or suspensions containing flavoring or coloring agents. Such liquid preparations can be prepared with pharmaceutically acceptable additives, such as suspending agents. The compounds of structural formula (I) also can be injected parenterally, for example, intravenously, intramuscularly, subcutaneously, or intracoronarily. For parenteral administration, the endothelin antagonists are best used in the form of a sterile aqueous solution which can contain other substances, for example, salts or monosaccharides, such as mannitol or glucose, to make the solution isotonic with blood.","As an additional embodiment, the present invention includes kits which comprise one or more compounds or compositions packaged in a manner that facilitates their use to practice methods of the invention. In one simple embodiment, the kit includes a compound or composition described herein as useful for practice of a method (e.g., a composition comprising a compound of structural formula (I) and an optional second therapeutic agent), packaged in a container, such as a sealed bottle or vessel, with a label affixed to the container or included in the kit that describes use of the compound or composition to practice the method of the invention. Preferably, the compound or composition is packaged in a unit dosage form. The kit further can include a device suitable for administering the composition according to the intended route of administration.","As discussed above, prior Dligands suffered from a low selectivity for the Dreceptor and\/or possessed physical properties, e.g., a low water solubility that hindered development as therapeutic agents. One Dreceptor ligand approved for the treatment of Parkinson's disease and restless leg syndrome is pramipexole hydrochloride (compound 1). Compound 1 is a very potent Dligand and has a Kvalue of 0.78 nM to D(see Table 1 below). Compound 1 also has an excellent aqueous solubility and an excellent pharmacological and toxicological profile in humans and in animals. Although compound 1 has been widely used as a Dpreferring ligand, it also binds potentially to the high affinity state of the Dreceptor with a Kvalue of 3.1 nM (Table 1), thus displaying only a 4-fold selectivity for the Dreceptor over the Dreceptor.","In accordance with an important feature of the present invention, compounds of structural formula (I) were synthesized and evaluated as ligands for the dopamine 3 (D) receptor. For example, compound 12 described below has a Kvalue of 0.41 nM to Dand a selectivity of >30,000 and 800-fold over the D-like and Dreceptors, respectively. In vivo functional assays show that compound 12 is a partial agonist at the Dreceptor with no detectable activity at the Dreceptor.","Compounds of the present invention and comparative compounds were prepared as follows.","Solvents and reagents were obtained commercially and used without further purification.

disclosed, for example, in WO 95\/04713, WO 96\/23760, WO 97\/45503, WO 98\/27081, WO 99\/58499, WO 05\/118588, WO 06\/040182, WO 06\/082456, WO 06\/066885, and WO 08\/026,046. Some of these compounds possess moderate affinities and\/or selectivities for the dopamine Dreceptor, and therefore have been proposed as suitable for treating diseases of the central nervous system. Unfortunately, the affinity and selectivity of these compounds towards the Dreceptor and\/or their pharmacological profile are not satisfactory. Consequently, there is an ongoing need to provide new compounds that preferably have a high affinity for the Dreceptor and an improved selectivity. The compounds also should have a good pharmacological profile, e.g., a high brain plasma ratio, a high bioavailability, a good metabolic stability, and\/or a decreased inhibition of the mitochondrial respiration.","The present compounds exhibit these beneficial properties. In particular, crystal structures for the human \u03b22 adrenergic (\u03b22AD) G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) were solved (26,27). The human Dreceptor structure was modeled upon the high-resolution crystal structures of \u03b22AD receptor because these two proteins belong to the same GPCR sub-family (28) and share close sequence homology. Because the crystal structure of \u03b22AD receptor was solved with an inverse agonist bound to it, a modeled Dstructure () is theorized, but not relied upon, to represent the conformational state bound to either antagonists or inverse agonists.","The binding of pramipexole (compound 1) to the Dreceptor structure was modeled through computational docking, followed by extensive refinement. The predicted model () showed that the primary amino group in the thiazole ring of compound 1 forms a hydrogen bonding network with the hydroxyl groups of Ser192 and Ser193. The thiazole ring in compound 1 is parallel to the imidazole ring in His349, thereby providing a favorable \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interaction. The protonated nitrogen in compound 1 forms a salt bridge with the negatively charged Asp110. The n-propyl group in compound 1 inserts into a hydrophobic channel formed by Cys114, Phe345, Phe346, Trp342 and Try373.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0223","num":"0221"},"figref":"FIG. 1","sub":["3 ","3 "]},"The predicted model of compound 1 complexed with the Dreceptor suggested ample available room to accommodate a larger hydrophobic group where the n-propyl group in compound 1 binds. In the adjacent area is another well-defined, but smaller, hydrophobic cavity formed by Cys114, Phe197, and Trp342 residues. Compound 5 (comparative) therefore was synthesized to explore the interactions with these two pockets.","Compound 5 was tested for its binding affinities to the dopamine receptors using the same methods as described previously (See Table 1 below) (21). It was found that compound 5 has a Kvalue of 0.043 nM to the Dreceptor, being 18-times more potent than compound 1. Compound 5, however, also potently binds to the high affinity state of the Dreceptor with a Kvalue of 2.7 nM, thus displaying a 62-fold selectivity for the Dreceptor over the Dreceptor. Similar to compound 1, compound 5 has a weak affinity to the D-like receptors and has a Kvalue of 11,000 nM. Although compound 5 has a very high affinity to the Dreceptor, its selectivity over the Dreceptor is modest.","Table 1 summarizes the binding affinities at the D-like, D, and Dreceptors in binding assays using rat brain.

Therefore, compound 6 was designed to investigate whether introduction of a rigid cyclohexyl group into compound 5 may improve the selectivity. Compound 6 binds to the Dand Dreceptors with Kvalues of 0.40 nM and 307 nM, respectively. Hence, compound 6 is a potent Dligand and displays an excellent selectivity of 763-fold for the Dreceptor over the Dreceptor.","Compounds 7-10 then were designed and synthesized to investigate the effect of the n-propyl group of compound 6 on binding and selectivity. Compound 7, with an n-butyl group, has a slightly weaker affinity for the Dreceptor than compound 6, and exhibited a 2-site competition curve at the Dreceptor, with roughly a 10-fold less selectivity for the Dreceptor over the Dreceptor with a high affinity binding component. Compound 8, with an isopentyl group, is 5-times less potent than compound 6 to the Dreceptor, but has a similar binding affinity to the Dreceptor. Compound 9, with a bulky cyclohexylethyl group, is 55-times less potent than compound 6 to the Dreceptor, but is only 3-times less potent than compound 6 to the Dreceptor. Compound 10, with a hydrogen atom at this site, has a Kvalue of 7.6 nM to the Dreceptor, being 19-times less potent than compound 6, but their binding affinity to the Dreceptor are essentially the same. Therefore, binding data suggests, but is not relied upon, that substitution on this nitrogen atom has a major effect on binding to the Dreceptor, but modest influence on binding to the Dreceptor. The data shows that the n-propyl group in compound 6 enhances the binding affinity to the D-receptor by 19-fold compared to the hydrogen atom in compound 10.","The influence of the naphthyl group in compound 6 on binding and selectivity also was investigated. Compound 11, in which the naphthyl group is replaced by a 2-benzofuran, binds to the Dreceptor with the same affinity (K=0.5 nM) as compound 6, but its selectivity over the Dreceptor is decreased to 133-fold, due to an increased binding affinity to the Dreceptor. Compound 12, in which a cinnamyl group replaces the naphthyl group, retains a high binding affinity for the D-receptor K=0.41 nM) and displays 800- and >30,000-fold selectivity over the Dand D-like receptors. These data suggest, but not relied upon, that the modifications of the naphthyl group can have a significant effect on the selectivity.","Compounds 5, 6, and 12 have good aqueous solubility. For example, the dihydrochloride salt form of compound 6 has an aqueous solubility greater than 100 mg\/ml. This excellent aqueous solubility provides an ability to evaluate an in vivo functional profiles in animals.","Recently, in vivo functional assays for the Dand Dreceptors have been validated. (24,25). Yawning in rats provides a sensitive measure of in vivo agonist activity at the dopamine Dreceptor (24,25), while the induction of hypothermia has been shown to be mediated by agonist activity at the Dreceptor (32,33). By employing these validated assays, compounds 5, 6, and 12 were evaluated for their in vivo functional activity at the Dand Dreceptors. Compound 1, a known Dand Dagonist, was used as a control in the evaluations. The results are summarized in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0233","num":"0231"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"sub":["3 ","2 ","3 "],"i":["a","b"]},"As seen in , and consistent with data obtained in previous studies (24,25), increases in yawning were observed over low doses (0.01 to 0.1 mg\/kg) of compound 1 with inhibition of yawning, and the induction of hypothermia occurring at higher doses. These data indicate that compound 1 functions as a preferential Dagonist in vivo and a Dagonist at higher doses.","Compound 5 induced yawning and produced an inverted U-shaped dose-response curve. The maximum levels of yawning induced by compound 5 are very similar to that induced by compound 1. Further more, hypothermia was induced by compound 5 at higher doses, concurrent with decreases in yawning. These data show that compound 5 functions as a full agonist at the Dand Dreceptors in vivo, consistent with the 2-site competition curve observed in the [H]spiperone binding assay for compound 1 and compound 5 (). Furthermore, the in vivo data suggest that compound 5 is bioavailable.","Unlike compounds 1 and 5, the dose-response curves for compounds 6 and 12 induced yawning were relatively flat, and failed to reach significance during the initial 30 minute observation period. While significant levels of yawning induced by compounds 6 and 12 were observed after 60 minutes, the dose-response curves for both compounds remained relatively flat. Moreover, compounds 6 and 12 failed to induce changes in body temperature over the initial hour of observation, an effect that is indicative of Dagonist activity. Together, the low levels of yawning, combined with the absence of any hypothermic effect suggest that compounds 6 and 12 function as weak partial agonists at the Dreceptor, with no detectable agonist activity at the Dreceptor.","The ability of compound 12 to alter pramipexole induced yawning and hypothermia was evaluated and the data are shown in ). Similar to the effects of compound 12 alone, but unlike the effects of D-selective antagonists, low levels of yawning were observed during the initial 30 minutes after administration of either 10.0 or 32.0 mg\/kg of compound 12. This effect persisted upon administration of low doses of pramipexole as significant increases in yawning were observed when rats were pretreated with compound 12 (10.0 or 32.0 mg\/kg). However, compound 12 resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in the amount of yawning observed following the maximally effective dose of pramipexole at 0.1 mg\/kg. No significant effects of compound 12 were observed at higher doses of pramipexole (0.32 and 1 mg\/kg). These data suggest that compound 12 is capable of antagonizing the D-mediated effects of pramipexole.","However, the profile of activity for compound 12 is different from that observed for selective Dantagonists, which generally produce selective rightward and\/or downward shifts of the ascending limb of the yawning dose-response curve for D-preferring agonists without increasing the amount of yawning observed at low doses. In fact, the effects of compound 12 alone, and in combination with pramipexole, suggest that it is more similar to the partial agonist, aripiprazole, than an antagonist. Moreover, compound 12 failed to alter the induction of hypothermia by pramipexole, an effect that is indicative of Dagonist activity, which can be reliably blocked by both selective and non-selective Dantagonists (32,33). Together, the data provides evidence that compound 12 is a partial agonist at the Dreceptor with no detectable agonist or antagonist activity at the Dreceptor, thus possessing a novel in vivo functional profile.","In summary, a series of enantiomerically pure compounds of structural formula (I) have been synthesized, and their binding and selectivity to the D, D-like and Dreceptor has been evaluated. The present invention therefore identifies several potent and highly selective Dligands with excellent aqueous solubility. In vivo functional evaluations show, for example, that while compound 5 functions as a full Dagonist, compound 12 behaves as a selective Dpartial agonist with no activity at the Dreceptor.","The present invention therefore is directed to a class of potent and selective Dligands that are highly potent and selective for the Dreceptor over the other dopamine receptor subtypes and that have a unique of pharmacological and behavioral profile. The present ligands have the therapeutic potential for the treatment of, for example, drug abuse, Parkinson's diseases, restless leg syndrome, and other conditions in which modulation of the Dreceptor is desirable.","Experimental Protocols","Computational Modeling Methods","The human dopamine subtype 3 (D) receptor was homology-modeled using the crystal structure of human \u03b22 Adrenergic (\u03b22AD) receptor (PDB entry: 2RH1) at 2.4 \u212b resolution as the template (26). The sequence alignment used was based on sequence analysis of 493 members of the amine sub-family of GPCR proteins (35). Initial 3D models of the human Dwere generated using the program Modeller (version 9v2) (36). The initial Dreceptor models from Modeller then were inserted into a 2-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (POPC) membrane (37) in a TIP3 water environment. Molecular dynamic (MD) simulations were performed to further refine the modeled structures of the Dreceptor using Gromacs (version 3.3.1) with united atom representation for the receptor (38).","For docking, all the binding poses of the compounds with the Dreceptor were predicted using the GOLD program (version 3.1) (39,40). The center of the binding site for the Dreceptor was set at center of the Asp110 with a radius of 13 \u212b, large enough to cover the binding pocket. For each genetic algorithm (GA) run, a maximum number of 200,000 operations were performed on a population of 5 islands of 100 individuals. Operator weights for crossover, mutation, and migration were set to 95, 95, and 10, respectively. The docking simulations were terminated after 10 runs for each compound. GoldScore implemented in Gold was used as the fitness function to evaluate the docked conformations. The ten conformations ranked highest by each fitness function were saved for analysis of the predicted docking modes. For the docking poses reported in , these were the highest ranked conformations from the docking simulations.","In Vitro Dopamine Receptor Binding Assays","Determination of Ddopamine receptor affinity and selectivity were performed in membranes prepared from the brains of adult, male Sprague-Dawley rats (Harlan Sprague-Dawley, Indianapolis, Ind.). All compounds were dissolved in 100% ethanol at a concentration of 5 mM.","[H]PD 128907 binding assays. [H]PD 128907 binding assays for D3 receptors dopamine receptors were performed as previously described in detail (30,31). Rat ventral striatum (nucleus accumbens and olfactory tubercles) was prepared in assay buffer (50 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA; pH 7.4 at 23\u00b0 C.) to yield a final concentration of 10 mg original wet weight (o.w.w.)\/ml. Membranes were incubated with [H]PD 128907 (0.3 nM; 116 Ci\/mmol; Amersham, Arlington Heights, Ill.) and various concentrations of competing compounds (10to 10M). Nonspecific binding was defined by 1 \u03bcM spiperone. Assay tubes were incubated at 23\u00b0 C. for 3 hours. The reaction was terminated by rapid vacuum filtration. Data were analyzed using SigmaPlot 8.0.2. using the Kvalue for [H]PD 128907 of 0.3 nM (30). Kvalues are expressed at the mean\u00b1SEM of 3-6 independent determinations.","[H]Spiperone binding assays. [H]spiperone binding assays for D-like receptors were performed as previously described in detail (29,31) and as described for [H]PD 128907 except for the following. Assays were performed using membranes prepared from rat caudate-putamen, which predominantly express the Dsubtype of D-like receptors, and the final membrane homogenate concentration was 1.5 mg o.w.w.\/ml. The assay buffer was 50 mM Tris-HCl, 5 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl, and 2 mM CaCl, pH 7.4 at 23\u00b0 C.; the concentration of [H]spiperone (24 Ci\/mmol; Amersham) was 0.2 nM; and the incubation time was 90 minutes at 23\u00b0 C. Nonspecific binding was defined in the presence of 1 \u03bcM (+)-butaclamol. Kvalues were determined using the Kvalue for [H]spiperone of 0.1 nM (29).","[H]SCH 23390 binding assays. [H]SCH 23390 binding assays for D-like dopamine receptors were performed as previously described in detail (31) and as described for [H]spiperone binding, except the concentration of [H]SCH 23390 (73 Ci\/mmol; Amersham) was 0.3 nM. Kvalues were determined using the Kvalue for [H]SCH 23390 of 0.3 nM (31).","The binding curves for compounds 1, 5, 6 and 12 are shown in .","In Vivo Yawning and Hypothermia Assays in Rats","Rats were purchased from Harlan (Indianapolis, Ind.) and housed three to a cage for yawning studies, and one to a cage for hypothermia studies. Rats used in the hypothermia studies had a radio-telemetric probe (E-4000 E-Mitter, Mini-Mitter, Bend, Oreg., USA) implanted into their peritoneal cavity, and were allowed 7 days to recover prior to experimentation as previously described (25). Yawning studies were performed as previously described (24,25), with yawning defined as a prolonged (about 1 second), wide opening of the mouth followed by a rapid closure. The capacity of pramipexole and other compounds investigated to induce yawning and hypothermia was assessed using a single dosing procedure (one dose per rat), with yawns recorded for a period of 60 minutes, and hypothermia for a period of 120 minutes after s.c. (1 ml\/kg) administration of compounds. The capacity of CJ-1037 to alter the induction of yawning and hypothermia by pramipexole was assessed using a multiple dosing procedure in which rats were first treated with CJ-1037 (0.0, 10.0, or 32.0 mg\/kg) followed by five successive doses of pramipexole each separated by 30 minutes. Yawning was recorded for 30 minutes after each injection. Determination of changes in core body temperature for compounds alone were determined by comparing body temperature 30 and 60 minutes after each single dose of compounds to that obtained 1 minute prior to injection of that compound, while the effects of compound 12 on pramipexole-induced hypothermia were determined by comparing the differences in core body temperature 30 minutes after each dose of compound 12 alone, or in combination with pramipexole to the body temperature obtained 1 min prior to the injection of compound 12. Yawns and changes in core body temperature are presented as the mean\u00b1standard error of the mean (SEM) with 8 (yawning) or 6 (hypothermia) rats per group. A one-way, repeated-measures ANOVA with post-hoc Dunnett's tests was used to determine significant changes in yawning or body temperature compared to vehicle treated animals, while significant effects of compound 12 on pramipexole-induced yawning and hypothermia were determined by two-way, repeated-measures ANOVA with post-hoc Bonferroni tests (GraphPad Prism; GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, Calif.).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0249","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":["1.
