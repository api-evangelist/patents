The government has certain rights to the invention.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention generally relates to wideband antennas with compact and planar geometry and, more particularly, to planar inverted cone and fourpoint antennas.","2. Background Description","The need for wideband antennas with omnidirectional coverage is increasing in military and commercial applications. Thin antennas are preferred in most situations. The classic solution is to obtain an omnidirectional pattern uses a thin wire dipole or its counterpart monopole version with a ground plane (if a half-space is to be eliminated). However, the wire dipole and monopole suffer from narrow impedance bandwidth. The bandwidth can be widened by using flat metal rather than a thin wire structure. Many flat radiator geometries have been explored over several decades. However, most such antennas suffer from pattern degradation at the high end of their impedance bandwidth.","Crossed half circle flat radiators have also been investigated and appear to provide better patterns within impedance bandwidth, but simulation results reveal that they have high cross polarization over the entire band due to the interaction between flat elements.","A flat circular disc antenna was used as a TV antenna operating at 90\u2013770 MHz and described by S. Honda in 1992. (S. Honda, M. Ito. H. Seki and Y. Jinbo, \u201cA disc monopole antenna with 1:8 impedance bandwidth and omnidirectional radiation pattern\u201d, 92 (Sapporo, Japan), pp. 1145\u20131148, September 1992). The circular disc antenna is composed of a flat circular disc  mounted above and perpendicular to a ground plane  as shown in . The circular disc antenna has a very large impedance bandwidth, about 10:1. A circular disc antenna of diameter A=25 mm, made of 0.5 mm thick brass plate mounted at height h=0.7 mm over a square ground plane (30 cm\u00d730 cm) yielded acceptable impedance (VSWR<2) over the operating band from 2.25 to 17.25 GHz for a bandwidth of 7.7:1 as shown in P. P. Hammoud and F. Colomel. \u201cMatching the input impedance of a broadband disc monopole\u201d, , Vol. 29, pp. 406\u2013407, February 1993. However, the radiation patterns of the circular disc antenna degrade at the high end of the band. The direction of the conical beam maxima in the E-plane pattern vary from 30\u00b0 to 60\u00b0 in elevation as frequency increases from 2.5 to 9.0 GHz, whereas in the H-plane the pattern remains somewhat omnidirectional with maximum variation in azimuth increasing from 4 dB to 7 dB over the band as described in N. P. Agrawall, G. Kumar, and K. P. Ray, \u201cWide-band Planar Monopole Antennas\u201d, , Vol. 46, No. 2, pp. 294\u2013295, February 1998.","Several modified flat monopole antennas were proposed by N. P. Agrawall, G. Kumar, and K. P. Ray in \u201cWide-band Planar Monopole Antennas\u201d, , Vol. 46, No. 2, pp. 294\u2013295, February 1998, to obtain better impedance bandwidth. They are elliptical, square, rectangular, and hexagonal shaped flat monopoles. An elliptical disc monopole antenna having an ellipticity ratio of 1.1 yields the best performance. However, the modified flat monopole antennas still suffer from radiation pattern degradation in E-plane.","A trapezoidal shape flat monopole antenna shown in  has been proposed as a variation of square flat monopole antenna by J. A. Evans and M. J. Ammann, \u201cPlanar Trapezoidal and Pentagonal monopoles with impedance bandwidth in excess of 10:1(Orlando), Vol. 3, pp. 1558\u20131559, 1999. The trapezoidal radiating element  is mounted above and perpendicular to the ground plane . The impedance bandwidth of the antenna was optimized by tapering the lower base  near the ground plane . However, the trapezoidal flat monopole antenna does not solve the problem of variations in tilt angle of the E-plane pattern peak.","A crossed half disc antenna shown in  was proposed as a variation of the bow-tie antenna described by R. M. Taylor, \u201cA broadband Omnidirectional Antenna\u201d, (Seattle), Vol. 2, pp. 1294\u20131297, June 1994. The crossed flat (i.e., planar) elements ,  and ,  improve the antenna pattern over the impedance bandwidth compared to a single half disc element. The dotted circle inside of the half disc  in  represents the size of a circular disc having similar impedance bandwidth. The crossed half disc antenna is about double the size of the circular disc antenna.","Typical specification for omnidirectional antennas from 0.5 to 18 GHz require \u00b12.0 dB pattern variation from omnidirectional, 0 dBi gain, and 3:1 Voltage Standing Wave Ratio (VSWR). The crossed half disc antenna of  maintains the pattern and gain specifications over a much broader bandwidth, with a 2:1 VSWR from 0.5 to 18 GHz.","However, cross polarization can be high. Additionally, there are many applications in both industry and government for a wideband, low-profile, polarization diverse antenna. Communication systems, including commercial wireless communications, often require antennas that cover several frequency bands simultaneously. Another desirable feature is that of dual polarization to support polarization diversity, polarization frequency reuse, or polarization agile operation.","Wideband antenna research at VTAG (Virginia Tech Antenna Group) began in 1994 and has resulted in several inventions. Of specific interest are two patents for the Foursquare antenna: J. R. Nealy, \u201cFoursquare Antenna Radiating Element,\u201d U.S. Pat. No. 5,926,137, and Randall Nealy, Warren Stutzman, J. Matthew Monkevich, William Davis, \u201cImprovements to the Foursquare Radiating Element-Trimmed Foursquare,\u201d U.S. Pat. No. 6,057,802.","The operating band of an antenna spans a lower operating frequency fto an upper operating frequency f. The center frequency is denoted as f=(f+f)\/2. The operating band limits fand fare determined by acceptable electrical performance. For wideband antennas, this is usually the input VSWR referenced to a specified impedance level. For example, a popular specification is the VSWR\u22662 over the band fto ffor an input impedance of 50 \u03a9. Bandwidth defined as a percent of the center frequency is Bp=(f)\/f\u00d7100%. Bandwidth defined as a ratio is Br=f\/f.","The Foursquare antenna, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,926,137, is shown in . It comprises four square radiating elements , , , and  on the top side of a dielectric substrate  which is separated from a ground plane  by a foam separator . At least two coaxial feeds  and  connect to interior corners of opposing pairs of radiating elements. This Foursquare antenna provides wideband performance and several practical advantages for commercial and military applications. Its features are a low-profile geometry, dual polarization, compact radiating element size; these features make it ideal for use as an array element. The Foursquare antenna provides dual, orthogonal polarizations naturally, but these polarization outputs can be processed to produce any polarization state.","The diagonal length, \u221a{square root over (2)}A, of the antenna is about \u03bb\/2 and the height \u201ch\u201d of the element above the ground plane is about \u03bb\/4, where \u03bband \u03bbrepresent wavelength at the lower and upper operating frequencies fand f.","Several Foursquare antenna models have been constructed and tested.  show the computed and measured impedance and VSWR (Voltage Standing Wave Ratio) curves of the Foursquare antenna in  with the dimensions listed in Table 1.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"84pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"84pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":[{},"TABLE 1"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"Description","Symbol","Size"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"84pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"28pt","align":"right"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Element side length","A","21.3","mm (0.84\u2033)"]},{"entry":[{},"Substrate side length","C","21.8","mm (0.86\u2033)"]},{"entry":[{},"Gap width","W","0.25","mm (0.01\u2033)"]},{"entry":[{},"Substrate thickness","t","0.7","mm (0.028\u2033)"]},{"entry":[{},"Foam thickness","t","6.4","mm (0.25\u2033)"]},{"entry":[{},"Element height above","h","7.06","mm (0.278\u2033)"]},{"entry":[{},"ground plane"]},{"entry":[{},"Feed position distance","F\u2032","4.3","mm (0.17\u2033)"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}}},"A dielectric constant 2.33 of the dielectric substrate was used in both simulation and measurement.

No. 5,926,137 also shows a cross-diamond antenna as a modification of the basic Foursquare antenna. The construction of the cross-diamond antenna is the same as Foursquare antenna. The cross-diamond radiating elements are shown in FIG. 8 of U.S. Pat. No. 5,926,137 and comprise four diamond-shaped metal plates with included angles \u03b1and \u03b1, that may the be the same or different, depending on the application. A test model with the same outer dimensions with the Foursquare antenna listed in Table 1 and with angles \u03b1=60\u00b0 and \u03b1=59.76\u00b0 was constructed and measured. The measured data demonstrated that the cross-diamond antenna may be used in the same applications as the Foursquare antenna and has a bandwidth intermediate between conventional dipole antenna and the Foursquare antenna.","It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide new, compact antenna structures with significantly improved antenna performance over the prior art antennas.","According to a first embodiment of the invention, in order to overcome disadvantages of the above described disc antennas, a new monopole antenna has been invented. This new antenna is called the Planar Inverted Cone Antenna (PICA) and offers several advantages over previous monopole antennas. The Planar Inverted Cone Antenna (PICA), and its variations, is composed of single flat radiating element above a ground plane. The antenna geometry is very simple, having a shape of an inverted cone intersecting an elliptical curve, yet provides outstanding impedance and radiation pattern performance. The pattern of PICA does not degrade over a bandwidth up to 6:1 and has very low cross polarization. Investigations were performed through both computer simulations and experimental models. Simulation and measured data for the antennas are compared in terms of Voltage Standing Wave Ration (VSWR) and antenna patterns.","The operating band of an antenna spans a lower operating frequency fto an upper operating frequency f. This operating from fto fband has acceptable electrical performance, usually determined by impedance (or VSWR). The primary application for the invention is for very wideband wireless communications. Bandwidth is defined as a ration as BW=f\/f; for example, a 2:1 bandwidth means f=2f.","The new wideband PICA has better omnidirectional radiation with smaller antenna size than a circular disc or half disc antenna. Simulation data demonstrates that the PICA yield twice the pattern bandwidth than other disc antennas, Also, its impedance bandwidth is similar to disc or half disc antennas.","According to the second embodiment of the invention, a new Fourpoint antenna is provided which enhances the performance of the Foursquare antenna. The Fourpoint antenna improves the performance of the Foursquare antenna dramatically without increasing mechanical size. Changes in the antenna physical geometry and the introduction of a tuning plate have a significant influence in the antenna performance. Inclusion of a tuning plate in the Fourpoint and Foursquare antenna increases the bandwidth by extending the high end of the operating band. The new shape allows achieving balanced impedance over the operating band and dual polarization over its operating frequency. The addition of a tuning plate also improves significantly bandwidth through extension of the high end of the frequency band. The present invention also provides a variation of the Foursquare and Fourpoint radiation elements by adding metal tabs to the vertices of the radiating elements, which allows a reduction in antenna size, maintaining similar antenna performance.","The Fourpoint antenna has been designed, modeled, constructed, and measured at VTAG. The computed and measured data are presented to validate the enhanced performance of the Fourpoint antenna. Variations of the Fourpoint and Foursquare antenna also reduce the antenna size and are useful for elements in an array system.","Referring now to  of the drawings, there is shown the geometries of the antenna according to the first embodiment of the invention. This embodiment is based on the conventional circular disc antenna of  and has similar impedance bandwidth and improved antenna pattern, but has smaller area than the circular disc antenna.  shows a general geometry of the antenna according to the first embodiment of the invention. The antenna comprises a radiating element  having a shape of a truncated inverted cone intersecting an elliptical curve. This radiating element is positioned above and perpendicular to a ground plane . Dimension W of the truncated cone could have arbitrary shape and size based on the specific application. However, the edge W should be tapered with smoothly rounded shape such as circular, elliptical, tangential, or Chebyshev-tappered shape to obtain broad impedance bandwidth. For some applications, the edge W could be modified with a piecewise linear geometry. In , the radiating element  is in the form of an inverted cone intersecting an elliptical curve, where the cone part is not truncated as in . The cone angle, a, in  can be varied to obtain optimum performance.","The difference between this design and others, such as the circular disc and half disc flat radiation elements, is that the Planar Inverted Cone Antenna (PICA) shape leads to an improved radiation pattern, while maintaining similar impedance characteristics and the proposed antenna is smaller.","A test model of the specific PICA in  with dimensions of A=50.8 mm (2.0\u2033), \u03b1=80\u00b0, and h=0.64 mm (0.025\u2033) was investigated using both simulations and measurements. The test antenna was simulated using the Fidelity code from Zeland Software described by Fidelity User's Manual, Zeland Software Inc., Release 3, 2000. Fidelity uses the Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) method to perform numerical computation. The antenna was also constructed from a tin plate. The VSWR curves referenced to a 50 \u03a9 input impedance are shown in  for simulation and measured results. The VSWR curve for simulation is well below 2:1 from 1.5 to 20 GHz. It is evident that acceptable operation exists above 1.5 GHz. The PICA has an ultra wideband impedance bandwidth. The agreement between measured and calculated results indicates design studies can be performed by simulation. The difference at high frequencies between simulation and measurement is due to the reflected-wave power in measurement facility, the SMA connector and the rough edge at the bottom of PICA. The electrical size of the PICA at 1.5 GHz is about 0.25\u03bb.","Far field radiation patterns (elevation patterns. E) were computed for the PICA, as well as the circular disc and half disc antennas. The radiation patterns are compared in  for several frequencies. These patterns show that the circular disc and half disc antenna suffer from pattern degradation as frequency increases beyond 3:1 impedance bandwidth, while there is no significant pattern variation with the PICA up to a 6:1 impedance bandwidth. The elevation patterns (E) for the antennas were computed in the plane containing the flat area of the antennas (\u03c6=90\u00b0). Cross polarization patterns (E) are not displayed, but are about 20 dB below the co-polarized pattern for the PICA.","Antenna gain was also computed at several elevation angles, \u03b8, for \u03c6 fixed at 90\u00b0. Computed gain is displayed in , B and C for three antennas. The PICA has superior gain performance. The elevation pattern and gain at \u03c6=0\u00b0 are not presented but are similar to, or even better than, the ones at \u03c6=90\u00b0.","A modification of the first embodiment of the present invention is the Crossed Planar Inverted Cone Antenna (Crossed PICA). The idea of crossed planar discs in a monopole configuration was investigated by Taylor in R. M. Taylor, \u201cA broadband Omnidirectional Antenna,\u201d IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium Digest (Seattle), Vol. 2, pp. 1294\u20131297, June 1994 with the goal of improving the antenna radiation pattern. A crossed half disc antenna with dimension A=50.8 mm in  was simulated to determine the level of cross-polarization. Even though the crossed half disc antenna enhanced the co-polarization component increased considerably to a level of about \u221210 dB. Representative computed patterns at 5 GHz in  show co-pol and cross-pol components for angles \u03c6=40\u00b0 and \u03c6=90\u00b0.","Even though the single PICA has excellent co- and cross-polarized antenna patterns, a crossed PICA antenna was examined to see if even lower cross-pol content could be achieved. The geometry of the crossed PICA antenna is shown in . The antenna has two elements  and  of the same size and shape that are perpendicular to one another and to a ground plane . The height \u201ch\u201d between the ground plane  and the base of the crossed elements  and  controls the overall level of the antenna impedance.","The crossed PICA of  with A=50.8 mm (2.0\u2033), \u03b1=80\u00b0, and h=1.3 mm (0.05\u2033) was simulated. The height \u201ch\u201d in  is larger than the \u201ch\u201d of single PICA in  to optimize antenna impedance. Again, the Fidelity software used to model the antenna and to compute antenna characteristics. The antenna also was constructed with a tin plate of the same dimensions. The computed VSWR results are shown in  for a 50 \u03a9 input impedance. The VSWR for the crossed PICA is only slightly worse than a single PICA (see ) at the low-end of the band. This effect occurs for crossed circular disc, crossed half disc, and any other crossed planar antenna. Far field radiation patterns (E) for the crossed PICA are shown in  for several frequencies over the impedance bandwidth. Computed gain for the crossed circular disc, crossed half disc, and crossed PICA antenna are compared in , B and C. Gain values are very stable over the impedance bandwidth. Cross-polarization patterns (E) are not shown, but the cross-polarization level is high on the order of \u221210 dB relative to the co-polarization pattern. Simulation data reveal that the crossed PICA also increases the cross-polarization content (E) due to an interaction between the two perpendicular plates, while it has similar impedance bandwidth with and better co-pol component and gain than the single PICA element.","It should be concluded that crossed planar element with plate geometries such as circular, elliptical, square, rectangular, hexagonal, trapezoidal, or any flat monopole element increases the cross-polarization level compared to a single flat monopole.","Another modification of the first embodiment of the present invention is related to the wideband, dual-band disc antenna. The conventional single planar or crossed antennas were modified by adding a loading element on the top of the antenna. Example antennas of this modification are shown in . In , a disc element  perpendicular to a ground plane  is provided with a wire loading element . In , the disc element  is provided with a flat, triangular loading element . In , a PICA element  is provided with a flat, rectangular loading element . In , crossed disc elements  and  are provided with a wire loading element . In all these variations, the additional antenna element on the top can be any wire antenna such as a straight, helix, zigzag, or meander shape wire, as generally shown in , or any flat antenna such as a rectangular or triangular shape plate, as shown in , respectively. These antennas could provide wideband dual-band impedance bandwidth. The dimensions can be modified depending on the applications. The total height of the antenna element is about \u03bb\/4 where \u03bbrepresents a wavelength at the lowest operating frequency.","As a test model, a wire-loaded crossed circular disc antenna in  was constructed with wire-loaded crossed circular disc antenna and dimensions of A=50.8 mm (2.0\u2033), B=58.4 mm (2.3\u2033), and h=0.27 mm (0.05\u2033). The measured VSWR curves are shown in  for a 50 \u03a9 Input impedance. The antenna operates over the following two bands with VSWR 2: 807\u20131002 MHz and 1661\u20132333 MHz. These bands cover typical commercial bands such as AMPS, GSM, DCS, and PCS. Antenna size can be reduced further by dielectric material loading or employing a helical shaped wire top element. Computed far field radiation patterns for the antenna are shown in  at several frequencies over impedance bandwidth. The antenna pattens in both bands are acceptable. The computed gain for the wire-loaded crossed circular disc antenna is plotted in .","The second embodiment of the present invention is the Fourpoint antenna which improves the performance of the Foursquare antenna and cross-diamond antenna in the same size. Better performance can be obtained by adding capacitive reactance at the high end of the frequency band to achieve a net reactance that is close to zero over the band. This is the concept of the Foursquare antenna. The data, tabulated in Table 2, show that the Fourpoint antenna has about 20% of bandwidth at VSWR\u22672. Note that the height \u201ch\u201d of the Foursquare antenna listed in Table 1 is about 0.16\u03bbrather than 0.25\u03bbas mentioned in association with . These data came from an early model with non optimized geometry. About 20% more bandwidth can be achieved by changing the height into about 0.25\u03bb.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0101","num":"0100"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 2"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Measured and Computed Performance of the Foursquare Antenna"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},{},"Performance","Performance"]},{"entry":["Description","Symbol","Measured","Simulated"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Lowest frequency at","f","5.5 GHz","\u20025.4 GHz"]},{"entry":["VSWR = 2","(VSWR = 2)"]},{"entry":["Upper frequency at","f","6.7 GHz","6.65 GHz"]},{"entry":["VSWR = 2","(VSWR = 2)"]},{"entry":["Percent bandwidth","Bp","19.7%","20.7%"]},{"entry":["Element size in \u03bb","A","0.39 \u03bb","\u20020.38 \u03bb"]},{"entry":["Substrate size in \u03bb","C","\u20020.4 \u03bb","\u20020.39 \u03bb"]},{"entry":["Height h in \u03bb","h","0.13 \u03bb","0.127 \u03bb"]},{"entry":["Beam width of E-plane","HPat f","\u224860\u00b0","\u224860\u00b0"]},{"entry":"at f"},{"entry":["Beam width of H-plane","HPat f","\u224870\u00b0","\u224870\u00b0"]},{"entry":"at f"},{"entry":["Beam width of E-plane","HPat f","\u224860\u00b0","\u224860\u00b0"]},{"entry":"of E-plane at f"},{"entry":["Beam width of H-plane","HPat f","\u224870\u00b0","\u224870\u00b0"]},{"entry":"at f"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"The geometry of the Fourpoint antenna is shown in . Essentially, the geometry of this antenna is based on the Foursquare antenna shown in , but provides significantly improved impedance bandwidth. The antenna has four metalization areas , , , and  on a dielectric substrate , as in the Foursquare antenna, but each of the metalizations in the Four point antenna comprise two short sides with an included right angle and two longer sides with an included acute angle. Eliminating the right angle at the outer corners of Foursquare antenna yields an antenna that has four points rather than four squares. The dielectric substrate  is separated from a ground plane  by a distance tso that the sum of the thickness tof the dielectric substrate and the distance tis equal to the distance \u201ch\u201d. The space between the ground plane  and the dielectric substrate is filled with a foam , and diametrically opposite ones of a pair of metalizations ,  and\/or ,  are fed by coaxial feed lines  and .","The new antenna geometry increases capacitive reactance at the high frequency band, balancing the inductive reactance component of the antenna impedance over the operating band; that is, the reactance components are equally distributed over the band. The remainder of the geometry is similar to the Foursquare antenna except for the height \u201ch\u201d of the radiating element above the ground plane. The Foursquare antenna performance is optimum for a height about h=\u03bb\/4, where \u03bbrepresents a wavelength at the upper operating frequency. However, the Fourpoint antenna provides the best impedance bandwidth at about h=\u03bb\/4, where \u03bbis a wavelength at the center frequency of the operating band.
