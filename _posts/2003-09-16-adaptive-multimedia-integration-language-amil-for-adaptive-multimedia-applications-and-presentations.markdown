{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD AND BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","OBJECT OF THE UNDERLYING INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE UNDERLYING INVENTION","Modules","AMIL (Main) and Core Modules","Linking between Elements","Granularity of Reuse","AMIL Namespace","AMIL Document Object Model (AMIL DOM)"],"p":["The underlying invention generally relates to the field of markup languages used to describe adaptive mobile multimedia applications and\/or presentations being inherently dependent on the continuously changing environment they are running in, which means that these mobile multimedia applications and\/or presentations need to be adapted to the preferences of mobile users, the capabilities of their mobile computing devices, and the users physical impact like current location, time or temperature.","Applications running on mobile devices are experiencing a highly dynamic environment. They have to cope with inherent fluctuation of the available Quality of Service (QoS) in wireless networks, and they should be usable on a wide range of different devices. Additionally, for providing a good service, they should take the users' preferences and context into account, e.g. his current location. To meet those requirements, the developers of such applications need to be supported by a platform that allows applications to adapt to different networks, device and user situations, and which hides some of the complexity involved. Adaptive Multimedia Support Environment (AMUSE) is a platform, which supports adaptive distributed multimedia retrieval applications. The platform consists of three parts, a client-side middleware, a multimedia application built on top of the middleware, and a server-side context-aware mobile portal.","By contrast, the focus of the underlying invention is the document-based approach in the way that adaptive mobile applications and\/or presentations are described with an XML-based document, generated by a server-side authoring system (represented by the context-aware mobile portal), processed and rendered by client-side middleware, capable of executing the processing of the XML-based document description.","There are different ways to realize multimedia applications. First, a multimedia application can be quite specific, implemented for a specifically defined scenario, and the application itself might be adjustable by a configuration file, which is quite good for a specific, narrowed scenario. The second way would be to describe a multimedia application in a document-based way and let a browser or player interpret the document, which is done e.g. in \u201cSynchronized Multimedia Integration Language\u201d (SMIL, cf. SMIL 2.0, W3C Recommendation, 7 Aug. 2001, http:\/\/www.w3.org\/TR\/smil20\/), and is a more general approach. In the scope of the underlying invention, the latter has been applied. Thereby, multimedia document models such as Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), Dynamic HTML (DHTML), Multimedia and Hypermedia Information Coding Expert Group (MHEG, cf. International Organization for Standardization, ISO\/IEC JTC1\/SC29\/WG12, http:\/\/www.mheg.org\/), SMIL and HyTime (cf. Users' Group Home Page www.hytime.org) have been evaluated in order to use or extend their document models for describing adaptive multimedia applications. Unfortunately, these document models do not provide sufficient modeling support for adaptive applications. Adaptation is addressed to some extend once at start-up time of a multimedia application, but mobile adaptive multimedia applications have additional adaptation requirements owing to the inherent dynamic environment they are running in. Selecting appropriate streaming media at start-up time does not consider changes, like fluctuation of QoS in wireless network during the run-time of an application.","Applications running on mobile devices are experiencing a highly dynamic environment. The environmental changes can be categorized into three different dimensions: network QoS, mobile device capabilities, and user context. A mobile application has to cope with changes in all three dimensions. Thereby, the term \u201csituation\u201d is used for a given network QoS, mobile device capabilities and user context. A situation can be characterized by a set of parameters describing different aspects of the environment. The \u201ccurrent situation\u201d is the situation, which exists at present for a mobile application. If the current situation causes a problem for the application or if it allows the application to improve its service, the application may change its behavior to better reflect said current situation. As this is true for all mobile applications, the situation is especially interesting when looking at multimedia applications, as those have very tough requirements, especially concerning Quality-of-Service (QoS) conditions of the applied network.","In view of the explanations mentioned above, it is the object of the invention to propose a technology supporting a personalization and context-aware adaptation of document-based mobile multimedia applications.","The multimedia applications can e.g. be retrieved from specific content providers via mobile networks to the preferences of mobile users, the capabilities of their mobile devices and different application scenarios.","This object is achieved by means of the features of the independent claims. Advantageous features are defined in the dependent claims. Further objects and advantages of the invention are apparent in the following detailed description.","In the following, the preferred embodiment of the underlying invention as depicted in  shall be explained in detail. The meaning of the symbols designated with reference signs in  can be taken from the annexed table.","First, the main concepts and characteristics of the new AMIL document model  shall be introduced.","As mentioned above, the AMUSE document model is invented due the fact that state-of-the-art document models do not, or only to some extend, consider the adaptation aspect in a way required if a document-based application runs in a highly dynamic environment.","The AMIL document model  is the link between a technique regarding the authoring process of a mobile adaptive multimedia application and an AMIL player, which is doing the processing of an AMIL document . The AMIL player can be split up into two separate components\u2014a browser and a supporting \u201cclient-side middleware\u201d. In the scope of the underlying invention, these expression are used in the following way: The browser, which is also named \u201cMultimedia Browser\u201d, executes presentation related functions and user interaction ; whereas the \u201cclient-side middleware\u201d provides the functionality for executing the adaptation process.","In the following section, the AMIL document model  according to one embodiment of the underlying invention shall be explained. The document is concluded with several demonstrative examples.","The adaptive document model  can be split up into different modules according to their functionality. This enables the reuse of specific modules as an extension to other document models . The example  depicted in  explains the reuse of complete AMIL documents. Relationships between these modules are realized by linking elements together. The AMIL document model  supports a \u201cMain Module\u201d , which simply serves as a container for all others modules. The \u201cMain Module\u201d  itself does not provide any further functionality; it serves logically as an overall aggregation\/container module.","Each module is described in the following way: First, a table containing an Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagram and an Extensible Markup Language (XML) Schema description  is shown, and second, the meaning\/semantic of each element and attribute is explained in detail. In case a clear separation to similar concepts is necessary, the differences are set down after the explanation of each element's or attribute's semantic.","It should be noted that, for describing the syntax, UML and XML Schemata are used. For describing XML in UML, UML's extensible mechanism (stereotypes, tagged values and constraints) was applied. Detailed information about this kind of modeling can be found in \u201cModeling XML Applications with UML. Practical e-Business Applications\u201d (ISBN 0-201-70915-5) by D. Carlson.","The \u201cCore Module\u201d  encompasses all module required in each AMIL document . The Extension Module  can optionally be used for a more comprehensive description of the adaptation processes.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0060"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":"100"},"Note:","Each package logically \u201cdepends\u201d (UML relationship \u201cdependency\u201d) upon the \u201cStructure Module\u201d . This relationship is not shown in  but still exits.","The \u201cCore Module\u201d  and the \u201cExtension Module\u201d  are, like the \u201cMain\u201d Module , simply used for grouping.","1. AMIL Structure Module","The AMIL \u201cStructure Module\u201d  reflects the fundamental structure of an AMIL document . Like XHTML, it splits up the document into two sections\u2014a \u201chead module\u201d section  containing the declaration of the layout , used media items , interactions , and e.g. constraints  as well as a \u201cbody module\u201d section  focusing on the adaptation aspect where the intrinsic adaptation possibilities  are described.\n\n","2. AMIL Layout Module","The AMIL \u201cLayout Module\u201d  is taken on from the SMIL Layout Module as described in \u201cSynchronized Multimedia Integration Language\u201d (SMIL 2.0, W3C Recommendation, 7 Aug. 2001, http:\/\/www.w3.org\/TR\/smil2O\/). Thereby, the elements\n\n","\u201cregion\u201d Element :","The element \u201csmil:region\u201d is taken over from the SMIL document model. Its attribute \u201csmil:fill\u201d is extended in order to consider the aspect of size adaptation. The state-of-the-art usage of this attribute is to specify the behavior if the intrinsic height\/width of a media item  is not equal to the dimension of a region .","In AMIL, a region  can be used by different media items  during playing back a multimedia presentation, which means that media items  with different formats  are displayed in a region  with a well-defined dimension. Therefore, new attribute values for the attribute \u201csmil:fill\u201d are specified. The problem is that scaling the visual size of a media requires, under certain circumstance, a lot of CPU power. Especially up-scaling is a quite expensive operation. Down-scaling also takes CPU power, but not as much as scaling up. A further characteristic in AMIL is that a region  can be used by many media items , which can support different formats \u2014e.g. the Common Intermediate Format (CIF), or Quarter CIF (QCIF). At a specific scaling factor, a replacement of a media does make more sense than scaling a media \u201cendless\u201d down.","It should be noted that\n\n","\u201cfill\u201d Attribute:","This attribute is extended by the following values:\n\n","3. AMIL MediaItems Module","An adaptive multimedia application has somehow to describe all possible used media. As a result of an adaptation decision, made by the client-side middleware, a media might be replaced by a different one, with different properties.\n\n","The \u201cMediaItems Module\u201d  serves as a description  unit for all, in a specific multimedia application, available media items . The content of a media item  can be different, dependent on the characteristics of the media item  itself. In general, it can be differentiated between the following two categories:\n\n","Independent from this characteristic, every media item  can have meta information about itself as a part of its content model. Supported languages \u201cResource Description Framework\u201d (RDF) as described in \u201cRDF Model and Syntax Specification\u201d (W3C Recommendation, 22 Feb. 1999, http:\/\/www.w3.org\/TR\/REC-rdf-syntax\/) or Session Description Protocol Next Generation (SDPng) as described in \u201cSession Description and Capability Negotiation\u201d (IETF Internet Draft, work in progress, Bormann University Bremen, 21 Nov. 2001, <draft-ietf-mmusic-sdpng-03.txt>) by D. Kutscher et al.\n\n","A media item  is an abstraction for different kinds of media. It is distinguished between discrete media items  and continuous media items  (the latter representing time-based media). An element \u201cmediaitem\u201d , as a child of the element \u201cmediaitems\u201d , is used to describe the properties\/characteristics of a media item , like e.g. the location of the content and meta information.\n\n","4. Interactions Module","A multimedia application without any interaction mechanisms appears for the user as one video stream. Therefore, interaction  is a quite important mechanism to embrace the user and adapt to its personal preferences and the mobile device characteristics. The \u201cInteractions Module\u201d  specifies what kind of control elements is used in the application, its location and its start-up parameters.\n\n","5. Adaptation Module or Adaptation Description Module","The \u201cAdaptation Description Module\u201d  is by far the most important module in AMIL. It describes the adaptation possibilities . By contrast, the modules mentioned above have more a \u201cdescriptive\u201d character. Describing how the layout  looks like, the property of each media item , the interactions , and so far. This module describes the essential adaptive multimedia application by referencing elements of the other modules\u2014especially the \u201cMediaItems Module\u201d  and the \u201cInteractions Module\u201d .\n\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0085","num":"0184"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"189pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"<choose>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2002<mediaitem idref=\u201cmedia_A_high_quality\u201d>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2002<mediaitem idref=\u201cmedia_A_middle_quality\u201d>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2002<mediaitem idref=\u201cmedia_A_low_quality\u201d>"]},{"entry":[{},"<\/choose>"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0051","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0051-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0052","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0052-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0053","list-style":"none"},"li":["As depicted in , it is assumed that the resource situation at the beginning is quite good, allowing to start with a the high quality media \u201cA(hq)\u201d.

An element is acceptable if the element is a SMIL element, the media-type can be decoded, and each test-attribute of the element yields \u201ctrue\u201d. An element is selected as follows: The player evaluates the elements in the order in which they occur in the switch element. The first acceptable element is selected at the exclusion of all other elements within the switch.","This is in contrast to the semantics of the element \u201cchoose\u201d  used in the \u201cAdaptation Description Module\u201d . As described above, all possible media of an element \u201cchoose\u201d  are evaluated, which means that the media's properties (e.g. bandwidth, duration, etc.) are evaluated and stored in an internal data structure\u2014cf. description of the \u201cConfiguration List\u201d in \u201cModeling of Adaptable Multimedia Documents\u201d (Interactive Distributed Multimedia Systems and Telecommunication Services; 4th International Workshop, IDMS'97, Darmstadt, Germany, September 1997, pp. 420-429) by S. Wirag, R. Steinmetz, and L. C. Wolf (editors). At start-up time and if the \u201ccurrent situation\u201d changes, the adaptation description  is evaluated and the most appropriate adaptation possibility , for the \u201ccurrent situation\u201d, is selected and played back.","b) From an SMIL Document Author Point of View","In SMIL, the author describes which media is used in which condition. The condition (logical expression described with the attribute \u201ctest\u201d) is a fix part of each media element in SMIL. During start-up time, the SMIL player sequentially evaluates each media element's condition. If the condition can be fulfilled, the media is selected for playing back.","Note:\n\n","In SMIL, the properties describe the situation in which one or a set of media items  has to be chosen. In the \u201cAdaptation Description Module\u201d  the properties describe attributes of the media items  and the \u201cAMIL player\u201d uses this information to find out which set of media items  to use for an actual situation. (Example: If the available bandwidth is below 1 MBit\/s, two media items , A and B, are used. A needs 300 kBit\/s and B needs 400 kBit\/s.) In SMIL, the author has to manually create the mapping from media attributes to situations during authoring time. In the \u201cAdaptation Description Module\u201d  this mapping is left to the browser, which simplifies the authoring significantly, especially as the media item properties can often be created automatically, thereby using meta data for the media or by examination of the media files.","In AMIL, the \u201cAMIL player\u201d aggregates information about the \u201ccurrent situation\u201d and the media, which is a part of the adaptation description . Based on the \u201ccurrent situation\u201d, that is monitored continuously, a specific \u201cadaptation possibility\u201d  is selected and used for playing back until the \u201ccurrent situation\u201d changes and a new \u201cadaptation possibility\u201d  is selected. The author can give hints to express the author's preferences, which can influence the decision which adaptation possibility  is used for playing back. In AMIL, the decision which media is chosen is determined by the adaptation control unit, but the author of the document can influence the adaptation control process by the usage of attributes supported by elements of the \u201cAdaptation Possibility Module\u201d \u2014e.g. the priority attribute  of the elements \u201cswitch\u201d and \u201cmediaitems\u201d .","c) From an Adaptation Point of View","If the \u201ccurrent situation\u201d changes, an adaptation is accomplished, which means that media are substituted. The exact behavior how this is done is not described in SMIL. AMIL supports the author of a document with different attributes, e.g. a \u201cstartmode\u201d for specifying the transition from one media to another media, restart and looping functions if the movie is over, and so on.","Priority Attribute","The attribute \u201cpriority\u201d  is supported with the elements \u201cchoose\u201d  and \u201cmediaitem\u201d  and enables the weighting of adaptation possibilities . To understand the idea of priorities , the concept of adaptation possibilities  should be reminded.","Based on the \u201cAdaptation Possibility Description\u201d mentioned above, different adaptation possibilities  are calculated. While playing back, appropriate adaptation possibilities  matching the \u201ccurrent situation\u201d are selected. Thereafter, the adaptation possibility  with the highest priority  out of the set of appropriate adaptation possibilities  is selected.","The first activity diagram depicted in  shows that if the \u201ccurrent situation\u201d has changed; out of all available adaptation possibilities  the set that matches the \u201ccurrent situation\u201d is filtered out. Out of this set, the adaptation possibilities  with the highest priority  are selected. If at the end more than one adaptation possibility  is left, either that with the lower resource consumption is selected or the selection is done randomly.","The evaluation of the priorities  is done in line with the calculation of all adaptation possibilities .  shows the adaptation possibilities , thereafter sometimes abbreviated with \u201cAP\u201d, derived from the adaptation possibility  description  depicted in . Adaptation Possibilities (APs) are calculated in such a way that a \u201cchoose\u201d element  is considered as an \u201cOR\u201d operator, and a \u201cpar\u201d element  as an \u201cAND\u201d operator. This results in the following \u201cBoolean\u201d expression:\n\n(M4 AND M2) OR (M4 AND M1) OR (M3 AND M2) OR (M3 AND M1).\n","Thereby, the selection of one \u201cAND\u201d expression (e.g. M AND M) (also named adaptation possibility ) is based on the \u201ccurrent situation\u201d.","The evaluation of the associated priority  of an adaptation possibility  is done in the following way:\n\n","The result at the end is a list of possible adaptations attributed with an attribute priority  calculated from the priorities  of the used media of this possible adaptation.","The term \u201clink\u201d, as used in this document, describes the connection of different elements in one AMIL document \u2014in contrast to the general meaning where various Web resources (in different documents) are linked together. A link is described by its \u201csource anchor\u201d  and its \u201cdestination anchor\u201d  as depicted in . An anchor's source  is described by the usage of the XML attribute \u201cid\u201d\u2014an anchor's destination  by the XML attribute \u201cidref\u201d.

It supports the dynamically access and update of the content and structure of an AMIL document . The document can further be processed, and the results of that processing can be incorporated back in the presented document. The AMIL DOM is quite straightforward. In fact, it is an extension to the DOM proposed by W3C. Like \u201cXHTML DOM\u201d and \u201cWML DOM\u201d, \u201cAMIL DOM\u201d simply extents the basic W3C DOM by means of an AMIL-specific vocabulary.","In extension to state-of-the-art document object models, AMIL DOM supports a simplified transaction model. This allows making a set of logically grouped manipulations to the AMIL DOM, which results in the support of transactional modification for adaptive documents. For example, the replacement of an \u201cadaptation-description-specific\u201d element \u201cchoose\u201d  has to be done as an atomic change, which results in a recalculation of all adaptation possibilities . If that is not done atomically, a modification might be a quite crucial step, which results in an inconsistent state.","As depicted in , the AMIL DOM supports, aside from state-of-the-art primitives, primitives for doing simple transaction-oriented processing by enhancing the interface \u201cdocument\u201d  with a \u201ccommit\u201d primitive. It should be noted that modifications are not passed to the middleware until the \u201ccommit\u201d primitive is triggered.","After having created an internal presentation of an AMIL document , it can be adapted to changes in the \u201ccurrent situation\u201d, e.g. a user interaction  or the change of the user's location. Modifications do not get visible until they are committed. This fact is depicted in . The illustration on the right shows how the layout  can change after the document has been modified.","The following sections introduce modules that can optionally be used for a more detailed description  of the adaptation process. They are not mandatory, which means that an AMIL document  is semantically valid without these modules.","1. Events Module","An \u201cevent\u201d  is a signal to the AMIL Browser from any sensor, indicating that the \u201ccurrent situation\u201d has changed. As mentioned in the introduction, the \u201ccurrent situation\u201d is categorized into three different dimensions: network QoS, mobile device capabilities and user context. In this scenario, an AMIL document  is dynamically generated at request time, based on the \u201ccurrent situation\u201d. After that, the supporting middleware, as described in the article \u201cModeling of Adaptable Multimedia Documents\u201d (Interactive Distributed Multimedia Systems and Telecommunication Services; 4th International Workshop, IDMS'97, Darmstadt, Germany, September 1997, pp. 420-429) by S.

Constraints Module","The Constraints Module  allows adding additional constraints  to the adaptation description elements to influence (in most cases to reduce) the set of possible adaptation alternatives . When constraints  are applied, it is e.g. possible to remove all adaptation alternatives  (each consisting of different media items ) that need a higher \u201cbit rate\u201d than specified by the respective constraint .","Thereby, it is useful to allow such constrains also for the \u201cmediatiem\u201d element  in spite of the fact that there are no alternatives on this level. This is because a media item  may be able to run in different media configurations. A media item  may expose different media configurations, which can dynamically be selected when playing the media item . Each media configuration may result in different media properties like different quality, resource requirements or error robustness. Examples for such media items  are video streams using a layered codec, a live stream whose coding parameters can be influenced from the receiver side or media items  that can dynamically apply Forward Error Correction (FEC) algorithms. When constraints  are used, the author has the possibility to exclude unwanted media configurations.","It is important to understand the difference of the semantics between a constraint  applied to a media item  and another adaptation description element. When applied to a media item , it restricts the possible media item configurations. When applied to an adaptation description element (e.g. like \u201cchoose\u201d ), it applies to all possible adaptation possibilities  of that element (each consisting of a set of media items ). In the is AMIL code depicted in , the outermost \u201cpar\u201d has at least four adaptation alternatives  (m AND m, m AND m, m AND m, m AND m). If the media items  allow different media configurations, the list is further extended as two alternatives either differ in one media item  or one media configuration.","A constraint  applied to this \u201cpar\u201d element  could remove one or more of these alternatives. For example, a constraint \u201cbitrate<500 kBit\/s\u201d would remove all alternatives whose media-items-combined bit rate is higher.","The author has to take care that the constraints  are consistent and do not result in a situation, where all adaptation alternatives  are removed.","In the following section, the \u201cConstraint Module\u201d  supported by AMIL language shall be introduced.\n\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0143","num":"0359"},"figref":"FIG. 11","b":"804"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0144","num":"0360"},"figref":"FIG. 12","b":"806"}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["Further advantages and possible applications of the underlying invention will become evident from the following description of the preferred embodiment of the invention, which is depicted in the following drawings:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 13"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 15"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 16"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 17"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 18"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 19"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 20"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 21"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 22"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 23"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 24"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 25"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 26"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 27"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 28"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 29"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 30"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 31"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 32","i":"a "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 32","i":"b "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 33"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 34"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 35"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 36"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 37"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 38"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 39"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0050"},"figref":"FIG. 40"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
