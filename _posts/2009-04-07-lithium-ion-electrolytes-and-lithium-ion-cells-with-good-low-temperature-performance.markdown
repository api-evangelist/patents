No. 61\/123,441, filed Apr. 8, 2008, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","The invention described herein was made in the performance of work under a NASA contract, and is subject to the provisions of Public Law 96-517 (35 U.S.C. 202) in which the Contractor has elected to retain title.","a. Field of the Invention","The invention relates to electrolytes and organic solvents for electrochemical cells. In particular, the invention relates to lithium ion electrolytes and organic solvents for lithium ion cells.","b. Background Art","Lithium ion cells typically include a carbon (e.g., coke or graphite) anode intercalated with lithium ions to form LiC; an electrolyte consisting of a lithium salt dissolved in one or more organic solvents; and a cathode made of an electrochemically active material, typically an insertion compound, such as LiCoO. During cell discharge, lithium ions pass from the carbon anode, through the electrolyte to the cathode, where the ions are taken up with the simultaneous release of electrical energy. During cell recharge, lithium ions are transferred back to the anode, where they reintercalate into the carbon matrix.","Lithium ion rechargeable batteries have the demonstrated characteristics of high energy density, high voltage, and excellent cycle life. Known state-of-the-art lithium ion rechargeable batteries and systems have been demonstrated to operate over a wide range of temperatures (e.g., \u221230\u00b0 C. (Celsius) to +40\u00b0 C.). However, the performance of such known lithium ion rechargeable batteries and systems is limited at temperatures below \u221230\u00b0 C., making them unsuitable for many terrestrial and extra-terrestrial applications. Many scheduled NASA missions demand good low temperature battery performance without sacrificing such properties as light weight, high specific energy, long cycle life, and moderate cost. Moreover, such scheduled NASA missions require rechargeable batteries that can operate at low temperatures to satisfy the requirements of various applications, such as landers, rovers, and penetrators. For example, the Mars Exploration Program requires rechargeable batteries capable of delivering several hundred cycles with high specific energy, and the ability to operate over a broad range of temperatures, including the extremely low temperatures on and beneath the surface of Mars. Mars rovers and landers require batteries that can operate at temperatures as low as \u221240\u00b0 C. Mars penetrators, which can penetrate deep into the Martian surface, require operation at temperatures less than \u221260\u00b0 C. Additional applications may require high specific energy batteries that can operate at temperatures down to \u221280\u00b0 C., while still providing adequate performance and stability at ambient temperatures.","To be used on the Mars missions and in low earth orbit (LEO) and geostationary earth orbit (GEO) satellites, as well as in terrestrial applications, lithium ion rechargeable batteries may exhibit high specific energy (60-80 Wh\/Kg (Watt hours per Kilogram)) and long cycle life (e.g., >500 cycles).","Known state-of-the-art lithium ion cells typically exhibit limited capacities below \u221230\u00b0 C. This may be due to limitations of the electrolyte solutions, which become very viscous and freeze at low temperatures, resulting in poor electrolyte conductivity. In addition, the surface film, such as solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), that forms on the electrodes, can either build up over the course of repeated charge\/discharge cycling or become highly resistive at lower temperatures. Ideally, the SEI layer on the carbon anode should be protective toward electrolyte reduction and yet conductive to lithium ions to facilitate lithium ion intercalation, even at low temperatures.","Several factors can influence the low temperature performance of lithium ion cells, including: (a) the physical properties of the electrolyte, such as conductivity (lithium ion mobility in the electrolyte solution), melting point, viscosity, and other physical properties; (b) the electrode type; (c) the nature of the SEI layers that can form on the electrode surfaces; (d) the cell design; and, (e) the electrode thickness, separator porosity and separator wetting properties. Of these factors, the physical properties of the electrolyte typically have the predominant impact upon low temperature performance, as sufficient electrolyte conductivity is typically a condition for good performance at low temperatures. Ideally, a good low temperature performance electrolyte solvent should have a combination of properties such as high dielectric constant, low viscosity, adequate Lewis acid-base coordination behavior, as well as appropriate liquid ranges and salt solubilities in the medium.","Known electrolytes used in state-of-the-art lithium ion cells have typically consisted of binary mixtures of organic solvents, for example, high proportions of ethylene carbonate, propylene carbonate or dimethyl carbonate, within which is dispersed a lithium salt, such as lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF). Examples may include 1.0 M (Molar) LiPFin a 50:50 mixture of ethylene carbonate\/dimethyl carbonate, or ethylene carbonate\/diethyl carbonate. Such electrolytes typically do not perform well at low temperatures because they become highly viscous and\/or freeze.","Optimized electrolyte formulations consisting of a ternary, equi-proportion mixture of ethylene carbonate (EC), dimethyl carbonate (DMC), and diethyl carbonate (DEC) were disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,492,064 to Smart et al. In addition, lithium ion cells with a quaternary electrolyte formulation consisting of 1.0 M LiPFEC+DEC+DMC+EMC (1:1:1:2 v\/v), as well as low EC (ethylene carbonate)-content quaternary solvent blend electrolytes, which have enabled excellent performance down to \u221250\u00b0 C., are known. However, such ternary and quaternary electrolyte formulations may not provide good cell rate capability at temperatures below \u221250\u00b0 C., primarily due to poor ionic conductivity.","Improved performance with multi-component electrolytes of the following formulation: 1.0 M LiPFin ethylene carbonate (EC)+ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC)+X (1:1:8 v\/v %) (where X is methyl butyrate (MB), ethyl butyrate (EB), methyl propionate (MP), and ethyl valerate (EV)) are also known. Although such electrolyte formulations do provide good performance at very low temperatures, the high temperature resilience of cells containing such electrolytes may be compromised, primarily due to the use of small quantities of ethylene carbonate and high quantities of the ester component.","The use of methyl formate (MF), methyl acetate (MA), ethyl acetate (EA), ethyl propionate (EP), and ethyl butyrate (EB) in multi-component electrolyte formulations is known. However, although some of these electrolytes provide good low temperature performance, they generally do not result in cells with good rate capability at lower temperatures and do not display good high temperature resilience (e.g., >25\u00b0 C.).","Higher molecular weight esters, such as ethyl propionate and ethyl butyrate, resulting in both improved low temperature performance and good stability at ambient temperatures, were disclosed in M. C. Smart, B. V. Ratnakumar, S. Surampudi, 149 (4), A361, (2002), where excellent performance was obtained down to \u221240\u00b0 C. with electrolytes consisting of the following formulations: a) 1.0 M LiPFEC+DEC+DMC+ethyl butyrate (EB) (1:1:1:1 v\/v %) and b) 1.0 M LiPFEC+DEC+DMC+ethyl propionate (EP) (1:1:1:1 v\/v %). However, although electrolytes containing methyl acetate and ethyl acetate (low molecular esters) were shown to result in high conductivity at low temperatures and good cell performance at low temperature initially, their high reactivity toward the anode led to continued cell degradation and poor long term performance.","In addition, ester based co solvents having improved low temperature performance were disclosed in A. Ohta, H. Koshina, H. Okuno, and H. Murai, 54 (1), 6-10, (1995), where electrolytes consisting of the following formulations were disclosed: a) 1.5 M LiPFin EC+DEC+MA (1:2:2), b) 1.5 M LiPFin EC+DEC+MP (1:2:2), and c) 1.5 M LiPFin EC+DEC+EP (1:2:2). However, the incorporation of a large proportion of diethyl carbonate (DEC) produced undesirable effects upon the surface films of carbon anodes.","In addition, electrolytes containing ethyl acetate (EA) and methyl butyrate (MB) were disclosed in S. Herreyre, O. Huchet, S. Barusseau, F. Perton, J. M. Bodet, and Ph. Biensan, 97-98, 576 (2001) and in U.S. Pat. No. 6,399,255 to Herreyre et al., where electrolytes consisting of the following formulations were disclosed: a) 1.0 M LiPFin EC+DMC+MA, b) 1.0 M LiPFin EC+DMC+MB, c) 1.0 M LiPFin EC+PC+MB, and d) 1.0 M LiPFin EC+DMC+EA (solvent ratios not provided). Good low temperature performance with the methyl butyrate-based electrolyte was disclosed. However, the performance at temperatures below \u221240\u00b0 C. was not investigated.","In addition, electrolytes containing methyl acetate and ethyl acetate in ternary mixtures with and without blending with toluene were disclosed in H. C. Shiao, D. Chua, H. P., Lin, S. Slane, and M. Solomon, 87, 167-173 (2000), in an attempt to obtain improved performance at temperatures as low as \u221250\u00b0 C. However, such improved performance at temperatures as low as \u221250\u00b0 C. was not shown.","In addition, the performance of electrolyte formulations at low temperatures were disclosed in S. V. Sazhin, M. Y. Khimchenko, Y. N. Tritenichenko, and H. S. Lim, 87, 112-117 (2000), where electrolytes consisting of the following formulations were disclosed: a) 1.0 M LiPFin EC+EMC+EA (30:30:40), b) 1.0 M LiPFin EC+DMC+MA (30:35:35), c) 1.0 M LiPFin EC+DEC+EP (30:35:35), and d) 1.0 M LiPFin EC+EMC+EP (30:30:40). Although good performance of the electrolytes was demonstrated at \u221220\u00b0 C., the performance at temperatures below \u221220\u00b0 C. was not investigated. However, at very low temperatures (<\u221240\u00b0 C.) the high EC (ethylene carbonate)-content (30%) and low proportion of the ester-based component (30-40%) in these formulations was not anticipated to yield good performance.","Accordingly, there is a need for lithium ion electrolytes for use with lithium ion cells with improved low temperature performance over known electrolytes and cells.","This need for lithium ion electrolytes for use with lithium ion cells with improved low temperature performance is satisfied. None of the known electrolytes and cells provide all of the numerous advantages discussed herein. Unlike known methods and systems, embodiments of the method and system of the disclosure may provide one or more of the following advantages: provide lithium ion ester and carbonate-based blended electrolytes that result in improved discharge performance and rate capability at low temperatures (down to \u221260\u00b0 C.); provide improved performance with multi-component electrolytes of various compositions including 1.0 M LiPFin ethylene carbonate (EC)+ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC)+X (20:60:20 v\/v %) [where X is methyl propionate (MP), ethyl propionate (EP), methyl butyrate (MB), ethyl butyrate (EB), propyl butyrate (PB), and butyl butyrate (BB)]; provide lithium ion electrolytes for use in lithium ion cells capable of delivering over 6 (six) times the amount of capacity delivered by known electrolyte and organic solvents and capable of supporting aggressive rates at low temperatures (\u221250\u00b0 C. and \u221260\u00b0 C.); and, provide lithium ion electrolytes and lithium ion cells that contain solvent blends of high molecular weight ester cosolvents which inherently possess greater stability and that perform well at very low temperatures. Furthermore, the embodiments of the electrolyte systems of the invention are anticipated to display superior cycle life performance and improved resilience at higher temperatures (e.g., >25\u00b0 C.), compared to the state-of-the-art low temperature electrolyte systems.","In one embodiment of the invention there is provided an electrolyte for use in a lithium ion electrochemical cell. The electrolyte comprises a mixture of an ethylene carbonate (EC), an ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC), an ester cosolvent, and a lithium salt. The electrochemical cell operates in a temperature range of from about \u221260 degrees Celsius to about 60 degrees Celsius.","In another embodiment of the invention there is provided a lithium ion electrolyte for use in a lithium ion electrochemical cell.

Indeed, several different embodiments may be provided and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein. Rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete and will fully convey the scope of the disclosure to those skilled in the art.","In one embodiment of the invention there is provided an electrolyte for use in a lithium ion electrochemical cell. The electrochemical cell preferably operates in a temperature range of from about \u221260 degrees C. (Celsius) to about 60 degrees C. (Celsius). The electrolyte comprises a mixture of an ethylene carbonate (EC). The electrolyte may comprise from about 15% to about 40% by volume ethylene carbonate.

Preferably, the electrolyte provides improved cycle life characteristics.","In another embodiment of the invention there is provided a lithium ion electrochemical cell.  is an illustration of a partially exploded view of a lithium ion electrochemical cell  constructed according to one embodiment of the invention. The electrolytes and organic solvents described herein may be used in the construction of the improved lithium ion electrochemical cell, characterized by good low temperature performance. The electrochemical cell preferably operates in a temperature range of from about \u221260 degrees C. (Celsius) to about 60 degrees C. (Celsius). The lithium ion electrochemical cell  comprises an anode . The anode  may comprise mesocarbon microbeads (MCMB) carbon, lithium titanate (LiTiO), carbon graphite, coke based carbon, lithium metal, or another suitable material. Carbon is the preferred anode material for lithium ion rechargeable cells due to its low potential versus lithium (of the lithiated compound), excellent reversibility for lithium intercalation\/deintercalation reactions, good electronic conductivity, and low cost. Three broad types of carbonaceous anodic materials are known: (a) non-graphitic carbon, e.g., petroleum coke, pitch coke, (b) graphitic carbon, e.g., natural graphite, synthetic graphite, and (c) modified carbon, e.g., mesocarbon microbead carbon material. The lithium ion electrochemical cell further comprises a cathode  such as an insertion-type cathode. The cathode  may comprise lithium cobalt oxide (LiCoO), lithium nickel cobalt oxide (LiNiCoO), lithium manganese oxide (LiMnO), lithium nickel cobalt aluminum oxide (LiNiCoAlO), lithium metal phosphate (LiMPO) where the metal may comprise iron, cobalt, manganese, or another suitable metal, lithium nickel cobalt manganese oxide (LiNiCoMnO), or another suitable material. Suitable cathode materials include transition metal oxides, such as insertion-type metal oxides. In lithium ion cells, the cathode functions as a source of lithium for the intercalation\/deintercalation reactions at the anode and the cathode, because of the instability of carbon materials in a lithiated state. Also, it is preferable that the cathode material in lithium ion cells have a high voltage versus lithium (>3.0V) to compensate for voltage losses due to the use of alternate lithium anode materials (having reduced lithium activity) such as lithiated carbon. Lithiated cobalt oxide is a preferred compound because of its ease of preparation and reversibility. Lithiated nickel oxide, lithiated manganese oxide, and other suitable lithiated metal oxides are good alternatives. The anode  may be separated from the cathode  by one or more electrolyte-permeable separators , with the anode\/separator(s)\/cathode preferably cylindrically rolled up in \u201cjelly roll\u201d fashion and inserted into a can or case , which is sealed or closed by a cap . The lithium ion electrochemical cell  further comprises an electrolyte (not shown), as discussed above, interspersed between the anode and the cathode. Both the anode  and the cathode  are bathed in the electrolyte (not shown) as discussed above, which is able to pass through the separator(s), allowing ion movement from one electrode to the other. The electrolyte comprises a mixture of an ethylene carbonate (EC); an ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC); an ester cosolvent comprising methyl propionate (MP), ethyl propionate (EP), methyl butyrate (MB), ethyl butyrate (EB), propyl butyrate (PB), butyl butyrate (BB), or another suitable ester cosolvent; and a lithium salt. The lithium salt may comprise lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF), lithium tetrafluoroborate (LiBF), lithium bis(oxalato oxalate) borate (LiBOB), lithium hexafluoroarsenate (LiAsF), lithium perchlorate (LiClO), lithium trifluoromethanesulfonate (LiCFSO), lithium bistrifluoromethanesulfonate sulfonyl imide (LiN(SOCF)), or mixtures thereof, or another suitable lithium salt. Preferably, the electrolyte of the lithium ion electrochemical cell comprises 20% by volume ethylene carbonate, 60% by volume ethyl methyl carbonate, and 20% by volume ester cosolvent. Other features, such as one or more gaskets, anode tabs, safety vents, center pin, and other features known in the art may be included as deemed appropriate, in accordance with known battery design and fabrication.","Experiments were conducted on ester-based electrolyte formulations at temperatures ranging from \u221260\u00b0 C. (Celsius) to 60\u00b0 C. (Celsius), with an emphasis upon improving the rate capability at these temperatures. The following electrolyte solutions were prepared and evaluated: (1) 1.0 M LiPFEC+EMC (20:80 v\/v %); (2) 1.0 M LiPFEC+EMC+MP (20:60:20 v\/v %) where MP is methyl propionate; (3) 1.0 M LiPFEC+EMC+EP (20:60:20 v\/v %) where EP is ethyl propionate; (4) 1.0 M LiPFEC+EMC+MB (20:60:20 v\/v %) where MB is methyl butyrate; (5) 1.4 M LiPFEC+EMC+EB (20:60:20 v\/v %) where EB is ethyl butyrate; (6) 1.0 M LiPFEC+EMC+PB (20:60:20 v\/v %) where PB is propyl butyrate; and, (7) 1.0 M LiPFEC+EMC+BB (20:60:20 v\/v %) where BB is butyl butyrate. Improved performance was shown with, for example: (1) 1.00 M LiPF+0.40 LiBF, and (2) 1.40 M LiPFdissolved in EC+EMC+MP (1:1:8 v\/v %) and EC+EMC+MB (1:1:8 v\/v %) solvent mixtures. The rate capability increased at low temperatures (e.g., \u221260\u00b0 C.) with these formulations. It is anticipated that increased salt concentration and the use of mixed salt systems will also improve the low temperature performance characteristics of other solvent blends of carbonates and esters. In the invention the following ester cosolvents were tested: methyl propionate (MP), ethyl propionate (EP), methyl butyrate (MB), ethyl butyrate (EB), propyl butyrate (PB), and butyl butyrate (BB), in multi-component electrolytes of the following composition: 1.0 M LiPFin ethylene carbonate (EC)+ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC)+X (20:60:20 v\/v\/v %) [where X is the ester cosolvent]. These electrolytes were optimized to provide good low temperature performance (down to \u221260\u00b0 C.) while still offering reasonable high temperature resilience to produce the desired wide operating temperature systems (\u221260\u00b0 C. to 60\u00b0 C.). This was primarily achieved by fixing the EC-content at 20% and the ester cosolvent content at 20%, in contrast to known systems which have the EC-content at 10% and the ester-content at 80%.","A number of experimental lithium ion cells, consisting of mesocarbon microbeads (MCMB) carbon anodes and LiNiCoOcathodes were fabricated. These cells verified and demonstrated the reversibility, low temperature performance, and electrochemical aspects of each electrode as determined from a number of electrochemical characterization techniques. The electrolytes selected for evaluation included the following ester-containing electrolytes and all carbonate-based baseline formulations: (1) 1.0 M LiPFEC+EMC (20:80 v\/v %) (Baseline); (2) 1.0 M LiPFEC+DEC+DMC (1:1:1 v\/v %) (Baseline); (3) 1.0 M LiPFEC+DEC+DMC+EMC (1:1:1:3 v\/v %) (Baseline); (4) 1.0 M LiPFEC+EMC+MP (20:60:20 v\/v %) where MP is methyl propionate; (5) 1.0 M LiPFEC+EMC+EP (20:60:20 v\/v %) where EP is ethyl propionate; (6) 1.0 M LiPFEC+EMC+MB (20:60:20 v\/v %) where MB is methyl propionate; (7) 1.4 M LiPFEC+EMC+EB (20:60:20 v\/v %) where EB is ethyl butyrate; (8) 1.0 M LiPFEC+EMC+PB (20:60:20 v\/v %) where PB is propyl butyrate; and, (9) 1.0 M LiPFEC+FMC+BB (20:60:20 v\/v %) where BB is butyl butyrate. As shown in , a table shows all cells displayed good reversibility at room temperature and minimal reactivity during the formation cycling.  is an illustration of a table summary of charge-discharge (formation) characteristics of experimental lithium ion cells containing EC-based electrolytes with various ester cosolvents in 20% proportion compared with all carbonate-based formulations. Slightly lower cumulative irreversible capacity losses were observed for the majority of the ester-containing electrolytes compared to the all carbonate-based baseline solutions, suggesting that desirable solid electrolyte interphases (SEI) were formed with the formulations. In addition, high coulombic efficiency and comparable irreversible capacity losses were indirectly related to the overall stability and suggested good cycle life characteristics can be obtained. The data showed that the optimized electrolyte solutions containing the ester cosolvents did not display deleterious effects which limit the reversible capacity or hinder the kinetics of the lithium intercalation\/deintercalation processes.","When the cells were evaluated at low temperature (\u221240\u00b0 C.) at moderate rate (\u02dcapproximately) C\/16 discharge rate), as shown in , enhanced low temperature performance was observed with many of the cells containing the ester cosolvents, with 71%-77% of the room temperature capacity being delivered, in contrast to the all carbonate baseline solutions which yielded \u02dc(approximately) 55%-75%.  is an illustration of a graph showing discharge capacity (Ah (Amp-hour)) of experimental lithium ion cells at \u221240\u00b0 C.

Given that methyl propionate-based solution is anticipated to have the highest ionic conductivity at lower temperatures, due to possessing the lowest viscosity of the series of esters, the results were to be expected, provided that the lithium kinetics through the electrode interfaces do not have a stronger influence upon low temperature performance that is often observed with more reactive electrolytes.","As shown in , a table summarizes the low temperature discharge performance of the cells and a number of ester-based formulations displayed good low temperature performance down to \u221260\u00b0 C.  is an illustration of a table summary of discharge performance (capacity, Ah) of experimental lithium ion cells at various low temperatures containing electrolytes according to the invention comprising 1.0M LiPFEC+EMC+X (20:60:20 v\/v %), where X=MP, EP, MB, EB, PB, and BB, and where the cells were charged at room temperature prior to discharge.","These ester containing solutions dramatically outperformed the ternary based all carbonate-based electrolyte (baseline electrolyte used on NASA's MER (Mars Exploration Rover) mission) and outperformed the comparable baseline formulation (EC+EMC (20:80 v\/v %)) in many cases. Improvements were expected in the low temperature capability of aerospace quality, large capacity, prototype cells compared to the experimental cells (due to thermal effects and design advantages) when fabricated with these low temperature electrolytes possessing mixed salt systems.","It is believed that the low temperature performance, especially the rate capability, was benefited by the use of these ester-based solutions primarily due to improved mass transfer characteristics in the electrolyte (higher ionic conductivity) and facile kinetics of lithium intercalation\/deintercalation at the interface due to favorable film formation behavior at the electrode surfaces. To enhance this understanding the electrochemical characteristics of the systems were assessed using a number of techniques, including Tafel polarization measurements (as shown in ), Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) (as shown in ), and linear micro-polarization measurements.","The lithiation\/de-lithiation kinetics were determined for the anode and the cathode by conducting Tafel polarization measurements of the MCMB-LiNiCoOcells in contact with the various electrolytes. The Tafel polarization measurements were generated under potentiodynamic conditions, but at slow scan rates, approximating to steady-state conditions. Thus, the measurements provided insight into the lithiation\/de-lithiation kinetics at each electrode. The measurements were conducted on the cells while they were in a full state-of-change (SOC) (open circuit voltage (OCV)=>4.07 V) before and after each storage period. In all of these Tafel plots, there were distinct charge-transfer controlled regimes, where the overpotential increased linearly with log (l). The effect of mass transfer was relatively insignificant, such as kinetic parameters, e.g., exchange current and transfer coefficients. In summary, at the lower temperatures (\u221240\u00b0 C. and \u221260\u00b0 C.), the kinetics of lithium deintercalation at the anode were most facile for the systems containing ethyl butyrate (EB) and propyl butyrate (PB), outperforming the all carbonate-based solutions, suggesting that in addition to enhanced solution conductivity, the film formation process at the electrode surface was also desirable producing thin, conductive films. Different trends were observed at the cathode, in which the highest lithium intercalation kinetics were observed at low temperature for the cell containing the methyl propionate-based electrolyte.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0079","num":"0078"},"figref":"FIG. 9","sub":["x","1-x","2 ","6 ","x","1-x","2 "],"sup":"+"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0080","num":"0079"},"figref":"FIG. 10","sub":["6 ","x","1-x","2 "],"sup":"+"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0081","num":"0080"},"figref":"FIG. 11","sub":["x","1-x","2 ","6 ","x","1-x","2 "],"sup":"+"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0082","num":"0081"},"figref":"FIG. 12","sub":["6 ","x","1-x","2 "],"sup":"+"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0083","num":"0082"},"figref":"FIG. 13","sub":["x","1-x","2 ","6 ","x","1-x","2 "],"sup":"+"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0084","num":"0083"},"figref":"FIG. 14","sub":["6 ","x","1-x","2 "],"sup":"+"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0085","num":"0084"},"figref":"FIG. 15","sub":["6 ","x","1-x","2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0086","num":"0085"},"figref":"FIG. 16","sub":["x","1-x","2 ","6 ","x","1-x","2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0087","num":"0086"},"figref":"FIG. 17","sub":["6 ","x","1-x","2 "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0088","num":"0087"},"figref":"FIG. 18","sub":["6 ","x","1-x","2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0089","num":"0088"},"figref":"FIG. 19","sub":["x","1-x","2 ","6 ","x","1-x","2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0090","num":"0089"},"figref":"FIG. 20","sub":["6 ","x","1-x","2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0091","num":"0090"},"figref":"FIG. 21","sub":["6 ","x","1-x","2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0092","num":"0091"},"figref":"FIG. 22","sub":["x","1-x","2 ","6 ","x","1-x","2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0093","num":"0092"},"figref":"FIG. 23","sub":["6 ","x","1-x","2 "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0094","num":"0093"},"figref":"FIG. 24","sub":["6 ","x","1-x","2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0095","num":"0094"},"figref":"FIG. 25","sub":["x","1-x","2 ","6 ","x","1-x","2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0096","num":"0095"},"figref":"FIG. 26","sub":["6 ","x","1-x","2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0097","num":"0096"},"figref":"FIG. 27","sub":["6 ","x","1-x","2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0098","num":"0097"},"figref":"FIG. 28","sub":["x","1-x","2 ","6 ","x","1-x","2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0099","num":"0098"},"figref":"FIG. 29","sub":["6 ","x","1-x","2"]},"To evaluate the viability of the technology, three of the promising low temperature electrolytes were prepared at JPL (Jet Propulsion Laboratory) and shipped to Yardney Technical Products, Inc. for incorporation into large capacity (7 Ah (Amp-hour)) prototype lithium ion (Li-ion) cells. Yardney Technical Products, Inc. (also known as Lithion, Inc.) was the battery vendor for both the MSP'01 (Mars Surveyor Program 2001) Lander project and the 2003 MER (Mars Exploration Rover) mission or program. In addition, the cell chemistry selected for this study was nearly identical to that used for the cells\/batteries fabricated for the two flight missions mentioned above, enabling a direct comparison. The electrolytes selected for incorporation into these cells were the following: (1) 1.0 M LiPFEC+EMC+MP (20:60:20 v\/v %), (2) 1.0 M LiPFEC+EMC+EP (20:60:20 v\/v %), and (3) and 1.0 M LiPFEC+EMC+EB (20:60:20 v\/v %). The results of these cells were compared with the results obtained with a number of cells that were fabricated with baseline all carbonate-based electrolytes, including the ternary mixture consisting of 1.0 M LiPFEC+DEC+DMC (1:1:1 v\/v %), which was previously developed and utilized on the MSP'01 Lander battery and the 2003 MER battery.","After the formation process at the vendor, the cells were subjected to conditioning cycling at various temperatures (20\u00b0 C., 0\u00b0 C., and \u221220\u00b0 C.) to determine the reversible capacity, the specific energy, and the impedance of the cells. As illustrated in , the ester-based electrolytes resulted in cells with comparable capacity and specific energy to the baseline electrolyte-containing cells.  is an illustration of a table summary of conditioning cycling at 20\u00b0 C. of prototype 7 Ah (Amp-hour) lithium ion cells containing electrolytes according to the invention comprising 1.0M LiPFEC+EMC+X (20:60:20 v\/v %), where X=MP, EP, MB, EB, PB, and BB, as well as cells with baseline all carbonate-based electrolytes.","After completing the conditioning cycling, the cells were subjected to low temperature discharge rate characterization testing. As shown in , when the cells were discharged at \u221250\u00b0 C. using a fairly aggressive discharge rate (C\/5, or 1.40 A), the cell containing the methyl propionate-based electrolyte delivered the highest capacity, yielding 5.78 Ah, which corresponded to 72.3% of the room temperature capacity.  is an illustration of a graph showing discharge capacity (Ah) at \u221250\u00b0 C., using a C\/5 rate, of prototype 7 Ah lithium ion cells containing electrolytes according to the invention comprising 1.0M LiPFEC+EMC+X (20:60:20 v\/v %), where X=MP, EP, MB, EB, PB, and BB, as well as cells with baseline all carbonate-based electrolytes. The x-axis shows discharge capacity (Ah (Amp-hour)) and the y-axis shows cell voltage (V). This represented over a six-fold improvement over the baseline electrolyte (the ternary carbonate mixture), which yielded only 0.84 Ah, or 10.4% of the room temperature capacity.","When the cells were compared with respect to the specific energy, as shown in , the cell containing the methyl propionate-based electrolyte delivered 65.0 Wh\/kg (Watt hour per kilogram) and the cells containing the ethyl propionate and ethyl butyrate-based electrolytes were observed to give \u02dc60 Wh\/kg under these conditions. In contrast, the baseline cell delivered only 8.6 Wh\/kg.  is an illustration of a graph showing discharge energy (Wh\/kg) at \u221250\u00b0 C., using a C\/5 rate, of prototype 7 Ah lithium ion cells containing electrolytes according to the invention comprising 1.0M LiPFEC+EMC+X (20:60:20 v\/v %), where X=MP, EP, MB, EB, PB, and BB, as well as cells with baseline all carbonate-based electrolytes. The x-axis shows discharge energy (Wh\/kg) and the y-axis shows cell voltage (V).","When the cells were evaluated at \u221260\u00b0 C. using a C\/10 discharge rate, as shown in , the same trend was observed with the ester-containing electrolytes outperforming the baseline all carbonate-based blends, expressed in terms of decreasing capacity: EC+EMC+MP (5.08 Ah)>EC+EMC+EP (4.27 Ah)>EC+EMC+EB (3.89 Ah)>EC+EMC (2.40 Ah)>EC+DEC+DMC+EMC (0.71 Ah)>EC+DEC+DMC (0.41 Ah).  is an illustration of a graph showing discharge capacity (Ah) at \u221260\u00b0 C., using a C\/10 rate, of prototype 7 Ah lithium ion cells containing electrolytes according to the invention comprising 1.0M LiPFEC+EMC+X (20:60:20 v\/v %), where X=MP, EP, MB, EB, PB, and BB, as well as cells with baseline all carbonate-based electrolytes. The x-axis shows discharge capacity (Ah) and the y-axis shows cell voltage (C).","In summary, lithium ion ester and carbonate-based blended electrolytes resulted in improved discharge performance and rate capability at low temperatures (down to \u221260\u00b0 C.). More specifically, improved performance with multi-component electrolytes of the following composition was demonstrated: 1.0 M LiPFin ethylene carbonate (EC)+ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC)+X (20:60:20 v\/v %) [where X is methyl propionate (MP), ethyl propionate (EP), methyl butyrate (MB), ethyl butyrate (EB), propyl butyrate (PB), or butyl butyrate (BB)]. A number of these electrolytes were demonstrated in both experimental as well as aerospace quality high capacity prototype cells. As shown, a prototype cell containing the 1.0 M LiPFEC+EMC+MP (20:60:20 v\/v %) electrolyte was capable of delivering over 6 (six) times the amount of capacity delivered by the baseline ternary all carbonate blend, and was able to support reasonably aggressive rates at low temperature (\u221250\u00b0 C. and \u221260\u00b0 C.). Cells containing the other esters also performed well at low temperature, with the lower molecular weight, lower viscosity cosolvents generally yielding better performance at low temperatures. Although slightly less favorable in terms of electrolyte conductivity, the higher molecular weight esters (e.g., propyl butyrate (PB), and butyl butyrate (BB)) were expected to result in cells with more favorable high temperature resilience (>40\u00b0 C.) compared to the lower molecular weight esters.","Many modifications and other embodiments of the disclosure will come to mind to one skilled in the art to which this disclosure pertains having the benefit of the teachings presented in the foregoing descriptions and the associated drawings.
