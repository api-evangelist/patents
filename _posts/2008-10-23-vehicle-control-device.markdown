More specifically, the present invention relates to a vehicle control device for performing automatic follow-up running in a plurality of vehicles.","Vehicles that utilize an inverted pendulum attitude control (hereinafter simply referred to as \u201cinverted pendulum vehicles\u201d) have been drawing attention in recent years. For example, Patent Document 1 (Japanese Patent Application Publication No. JP-A-2004-129435) proposes a conveying apparatus that utilizes an inverted pendulum attitude control.","Meanwhile, conventional automatic driving systems are known that automatically drive a vehicle such as an automobile. Under such automatic driving systems, it is often more preferable for a plurality of automobiles traveling on an expressway or the like to form a line and travel as a vehicle group rather than as individual vehicles from the standpoints of saving labor, mitigating traffic, and the like. Therefore, various research has been carried out regarding how following vehicles form a line with respect to a preceding vehicle and to what extent follow-up running is automatically performed with respect to a preceding vehicle in automatic driving systems. Art related to such follow-up running is described in Patent Document 2 (Japanese Patent Application Publication No. JP-A-2001-273588), for example.\n\n","To prevent the vehicle body of an inverted pendulum vehicle from falling over due to inertial force when braking the vehicle, an acceleration torque is applied once to the vehicle wheel before braking to incline the vehicle body rearward, and then after a predetermined rearward inclination angle has been achieved, a braking torque is applied to the vehicle wheel to start braking.","An automatic follow-up running control in an inverted pendulum vehicle that behaves as described above during braking will be examined here. In this case, an example using two vehicles will be considered for simplicity. Specifically, an example in which a following vehicle automatically follows a preceding vehicle in accordance with a rider's driving operation will be considered.","When the preceding vehicle initiates braking, an acceleration for inclining the vehicle body rearward is started that increases the wheel rotational acceleration of the preceding vehicle. Thus, the difference between the wheel rotational speeds of the preceding vehicle and the following vehicle increases. Consequently, an acceleration command value of the following vehicle becomes larger than an immediately prior acceleration command value. When the preceding vehicle subsequently achieves the target vehicle body inclination angle and starts to brake, the following vehicle is given a deceleration command to follow such behavior, and an acceleration for inclining the vehicle body of the following vehicle rearward is started.","Thus, the timing at which the following vehicle initiates braking is delayed with respect to the timing at which the preceding vehicle initiates braking. This results in reduced accuracy of the automatic follow-up control in the following vehicle, and at worse, may result in an inability to perform follow-up running.","Note that the same problems may occur in the following vehicle during acceleration of the preceding vehicle and the like.","In summary, in preparatory operations before acceleration and braking of inverted pendulum vehicles, a counter-direction operation is performed, namely an operation is performed once in the direction of acceleration in preparation for braking and once in the direction of braking in preparation for acceleration (with such operations hereinafter referred to as \u201ccounter operations\u201d). If an automatic follow-up running control is performed in the inverted pendulum vehicles for such operations, the following vehicle ends up reacting to the preparatory operation for braking or acceleration of the preceding vehicle, which causes a delay in the automatic follow-up running control of the following vehicle and lowers control accuracy.","In order to solve the above problems, an invention according to claim  is a vehicle control device controlling a vehicle so as to follow a preceding vehicle performing an inversion control.

Further, instead of using the expressions, a map may be prepared in advance representing a relationship between the vehicle target acceleration \u03b1* and the vehicle body target attitude and the vehicle body target attitude may be determined using that map.","A more complicated relational expression may also be used. For example, a relational expression may be established, with which: if an absolute value of the vehicle target acceleration \u03b1* is equal to or smaller than a predetermined threshold value, the riding section is moved without inclining the vehicle body at all; and inclination of the vehicle body starts as the absolute value exceeds the predetermined threshold.","Note that, in the present embodiment, the maximum forward movement amount of the riding section from a reference position is equal to the maximum rearward movement amount of the riding section from the reference position.

In this case, the previous Formula (13) may be used as the formula for calculating the second acceleration command value.","In the second embodiment, the main control ECU  calculates both of the two acceleration command values \u03b1and \u03b1\u2032 as the acceleration command value \u03b1* of the following vehicle B, and a control is performed so as to utilize the appropriate value among these acceleration command values depending on the estimated behavior of the preceding vehicle A. In the present embodiment, a control is performed such that the second acceleration command value \u03b1\u2032 is utilized as the acceleration command value \u03b1* of the following vehicle B. Specifically, in the third embodiment, \u03b1*=\u03b1\u2032. Thus, a control can be achieved without the determination of a deceleration command or the like.","The control process of the follow-up running mode in the following vehicle B according to the third embodiment will be described next.  is a flowchart of an automatic follow-up control process in the vehicle control device according to the third embodiment of the present invention. Once the automatic follow-up control process is initiated at step S in , the process proceeds to step S where the communication unit  is used to receive the vehicle speed information and the acceleration command value \u03b1of the preceding vehicle A (running condition data).","At step S, the vehicle speed of the host vehicle (following vehicle B) is measured by the drive wheel sensor . Next, at step S, the inter-vehicle distance d between the host vehicle (following vehicle B) and the preceding vehicle A is measured by the inter-vehicle distance sensor .","At step S, the second acceleration command value \u03b1\u2032 of the host vehicle is calculated using Formula (13) based on the vehicle speed v, the vehicle speed vof the host vehicle, the inter-vehicle distance d, and the acceleration command value \u03b1of the preceding vehicle A.","At step S, the second acceleration command value \u03b1\u2032 is utilized as the target acceleration command value \u03b1*.","At step S, the drive torque command is executed based on the utilized acceleration command value. Following step S, the process returns to step S and loops again. Note that this flowchart assumes looping of the process until the follow-up running mode is canceled.","According to the present invention, by calculating only \u03b1\u2032 to obtain the acceleration command value \u03b1* of the following vehicle B and setting \u03b1*=\u03b1\u2032, a control can be achieved without the determination of a deceleration command or the like, which is effective in cases that place particular importance on the follow-up capability of the following vehicle B with respect to the preceding vehicle A such as when follow-up is performed with a short inter-vehicle distance.","Although an example was described with the present embodiment in which a vehicle follows a preceding vehicle, the same control can be achieved when a vehicle travels side by side with the preceding vehicle.","According to the vehicle control device of the present invention, when automatic follow-up running is performed in a vehicle that utilizes an inverted pendulum attitude control, no delay occurs in the automatic follow-up running control of the following vehicle and information regarding braking is transmitted without delay to the following vehicle, which can help avoid the risk of collision and realize a highly accurate automatic follow-up running control. It is often more preferable for a plurality of vehicles to form a line and travel as a vehicle group from the standpoints of saving labor, mitigating traffic, and the like. Thus, a vehicle control such as that performed by the vehicle control device of the present invention has significant industrial applicability.","[]",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0227","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002","list-style":"none"},"li":[{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0001","num":"0228"},"b":"1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0002","num":"0229"},"b":"2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0003","num":"0230"},"b":"3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0004","num":"0231"},"b":"4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0005","num":"0232"},"b":"5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0006","num":"0233"},"b":"6","br":{},"figref":"FIG.
