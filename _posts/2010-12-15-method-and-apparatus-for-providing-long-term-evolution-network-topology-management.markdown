{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"p":["The present disclosure relates generally to communication network and, more particularly, to a method and apparatus for providing Long Term Evolution (LTE) network topology management in a wireless communication network.","In a 3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE) network, service outages and degradation can be difficult to detect (e.g., a sleeping cell) and will require considerable manual effort for troubleshooting. These service outages or degradations are difficult to detect because of the self-healing aspect of certain cellular network, e.g., the LTE network. For example, services in a failed cell site can be automatically covered by neighboring cell sites. Hence, the failed or degraded cell site can remain in a failed or degraded state without being noticed for a period of time. The LTE network topology changes dynamically due to the self healing capability when a cell site enters into or goes out of service. This requires that the network topology data, used by the wireless service provider, to be updated accordingly in order to provide effective fault and performance correlation as well as service impact analysis.","In one embodiment, the present method and apparatus provide a network topology management of a wireless communication network. The method discovers network topology data of the wireless communication network, wherein the wireless communication network comprises a self-healing capability, and identifies a difference between the network topology data that is discovered against a stored network topology data of the wireless communication network. The method updates the stored network topology data with the difference that is identified.","To facilitate understanding, identical reference numerals have been used, where possible, to designate identical elements that are common to the figures.","As discussed above, in a 3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE) network, the self-healing aspect of the LTE network causes the network topology to change dynamically when a cell site enters into or goes out of service. This requires that the network topology data, used by the wireless service provider, to be updated accordingly in order to provide effective fault and performance correlation as well as service impact analysis.","To address this criticality, the present method and apparatus enable a wireless communication service provider to manage the topology of the LTE network and obtain accurate network topology and configuration data to keep track of dynamic changes in the LTE network. Using the accurate network topology and configuration data, the wireless service provider can accurately and effectively correlate fault scenarios and alarms from the LTE network. For example, the method performs network topology discovery and updates the network topology data when the network topology has changed, wherein the updated network topology data is used by the service provider to correlate a plurality of alarms from a plurality devices down to a single device which is the root cause of a service trouble in the LTE network.","Broadly defined, an eNodeB is a radio base transceiver station (RBS) as per the 3GPP standards (or simply referred to as a base station). An eNodeB provides the LTE air interface and performs radio resource management for wireless access. 3GPP is a global effort to define a wireless communication system specification. In 3GPP release 8, LTE is a set of enhancements to the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) which focuses on adopting 4th Generation (4G) mobile communication's technology including an all-Internet Protocol (IP) end-to-end networking architecture.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","103","140","104","101","111","102","101","111","102","111","112","102","103","105","102","111","121","112","122"]},"In one embodiment, eUTRAN  is connected to the EPC network  via metro-Ethernet network  serving as a transport network. In particular, SIAD  in eUTRAN  is connected to Multi-service Node (MSN)  in EPC network  via metro-Ethernet network . An EPC network provides key functions that support wireless services in the LTE environment. In one embodiment, an EPC network is an Internet Protocol (IP) packet core network that supports both real-time and non-real-time service delivery across a LTE network, e.g., as specified by the 3GPP standards.","In one embodiment, the SIAD is a device that provides wireless traffic aggregation and backhaul from a cell site to an EPC network. An MSN provides layer 2 and layer 3 networking functions for wireless service between one or more SIADs and the EPC network and the eUTRAN is the air interface of the 3GPP's Long Term Evolution (LTE) specifications for mobile networks. Namely, the eUTRAN comprises a radio access network standard that will replace previous generations of air interface standards.","In EPC network , network devices Mobility Management Entity (MME)  and Serving Gateway (SGW)  support key functions as part of the LTE network . MME  is the control node for the LTE access-network. It is responsible for UE (User Equipment) tracking and paging (e.g., such as retransmissions), bearer activation and deactivation process, selection of the SGW, and authentication of a user. SGW  routes and forwards user data packets, while also acting as the mobility anchor for the user plane during inter-eNodeB handovers and as the anchor for mobility between LTE and other wireless technologies, such as 2G and 3G wireless networks.","In addition, in EPC network , the Home Subscriber Server (HSS)  contains subscription-related information (e.g., subscriber profiles), performs authentication and authorization of a wireless service user, and provides information about the subscriber's location. The Policy Charging and Rule Function (PCRF)  supports accesses to subscriber databases and specialized functions of a charging system. The Public Data Network Gateway (PDN GW)  is a gateway that provides access between the EPC network  and the public data network.","In one embodiment, the TMS  comprises a collection of modules that provides topology management of dynamic changes occurring in an LTE network. For example, the TMS  comprises a Topology Discovery Engine (TDE) , a Configuration Management System (CMS) , a Topology Builder and Trouble Domain and Classification Engine (TBTDCE) , a Network Management System (NMS) , a Network Topology and Configuration Inventory Database (NTCID) , and an Element Management System (EMS) . The functions performed by these modules will be described below.","In one embodiment, the TDE  supports the discovery functions of dynamic changes in the LTE network. For example, TDE  uses information collected from devices in eUTRAN , EPC network , and EMS  as inputs to support dynamic topology change discovery in the LTE network.","In , X interface flow  is used to communicate between two eNodeBs, e.g., between eNodeB  and eNodeB ; S interface flow  is used to communicate between an eNodeB, such as eNodeB , and a device in EPC network , such as MME  and SGW . Note that the S and X interfaces are standard interfaces defined by the 3GPP standard.","In one embodiment, the CMS  receives inputs from TDE  and performs the appropriate configuration data consolidation and update. For instance, CMS  receives newly discovered LTE network topology and configuration change data discovered by TDE  and updates those data in EMS  and NTCID  accordingly.","In one embodiment, TBTDCE  generates a LTE network topology view as well as supports network alarm correlation functions. The generated network topology and alarm correlation information will be sent to NMS  for further processing.","In one embodiment, the NMS  performs network level management of the LTE network .","In one embodiment, the NTCID  contains the inventory of all network topology and configuration data of the LTE network .","In one embodiment, the EMS  is a module that provides management of one or more specific types of network elements, e.g., eNodeBs, SIADs, MMEs etc., in the LTE network .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","200","104","200","205","210"]},"In step , a TDE discovers the topology of the LTE network, e.g., retrieves network topology, configuration and connectivity data from one or more network devices (e.g., a SIAD in an eUTRAN or a MME in an EPC network) in or from an EMS having the data for the one or more network devices associated with an LTE network. Given that the LTE network has the ability to self-heal, the topology of the LTE network may change, e.g., an eNodeB interacting with a different SIAD in support of another sleeping eNodeB. Such change may be dynamically implemented without the knowledge of the network. Over time, the \u201ccurrent\u201d network topology may have changed to such a degree that it no longer matches a \u201cstored\u201d topology as noted by the network. As such, when a fault isolation function is implemented on the \u201cstored\u201d topology, inconsistent results may result. Thus, discovery of the topology may need to be implemented, e.g., on a periodic schedule (e.g., daily, weekly, and so on).","In one embodiment, the retrieval can be performed through various standard protocols or interfaces including, but not limited to, File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA), Web service, and Application Programming Interface (API). For example, the TDE uses the ping command to validate the IP addresses of the network devices and adds the validated IP addresses to a validated list. The TDE may also use the traceroute command sent to these network devices to determine the network connectivity of these devices.","In step , the TDE determines if a stored pre-provisioned network topology data and the discovered post-deployment network topology and configuration data are in sync. If the data are in sync, the method proceeds to step ; otherwise, the method proceeds to step .","In step , the CMS consolidates the newly discovered network topology data that are different from the stored network topology data using the validated list from step  and then updates the appropriate systems in the LTE network. For instance, the CMS loads the newly discovered network topology data that are different from the stored network topology data to an EMS system and updates the newly discovered network topology data that are different from the stored network topology data to the NTCID. The CMS creates objects in a hierarchical manner in the order of location, node, card, port, circuit, logical connection, pool, cell, and sector objects to reflect changes, e.g., a network device that has entered into service, in the LTE network.","Note that an object is created only if the object does not already exist and the required components associated with the primary key exist. For instance, a port object for an eNodeB can only be created if both the eNodeB device object and the card object associated with the eNodeB exist.","If an object already exists, the object table fields containing the pre-provisioned data will be modified using the updated post-installation data fed by the TDE. The last-update-time of the modified object will be updated with the current timestamp.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","300"]},"In one embodiment, the location object class represents a physical network location that contains network equipment.

The location object class has an aggregation relationship with the cell object class. For instance, multiple cell objects can be aggregated within a location object.
