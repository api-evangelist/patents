title: Subcarrier time offsets for improved peak-to-average power of a transmitter
abstract: A system, wireless device () and method reduce the peak-to-average power of a transmitter by creating at least two sampled carrier data streams, running each carrier through a separate delay block, mixing each carrier over in frequency an appropriate amount, resulting in at least two frequency division multiplexed signals, and combining the at least two frequency division multiplexed signals together. The four sampled carrier data streams may each have a bandwidth of 25 kHz. Each separate delay block is less than 20% of its corresponding symbol time. The transmitter may be used to transmit wideband integrated digitally enhanced network (WiDEN) signals.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present invention generally relates to the field of wireless communications, and more particularly relates to a method to improve the peak-to-average power ratio (PAR) of an integrated Digital Enhanced Network (iDEN) system using subcarrier time offsets.","Many wireless telecommunications systems, i.e. cellular communications networks, are divided into a series of cells that provide coverage for a particular service area. Each cell is contains a base station, which communicates with mobile subscriber users on an operating frequency set comprising a plurality of radio channels. Each channel represents an information signal at a particular frequency. In order to improve the usage efficiency of the channel, many coding schemes and networks divide the channel slot (or band) into multiple sub-channels (subcarriers), allowing for more subscribers to operate in the same bandwidth. Motorola's iDEN (integrated Digital Enhanced Network) is an example of this type of system.","However, a multiple carrier Wideband integrated Digital Enhanced Network (WiDEN) signal suffers from poor peak-to-average power ratio (PAR) due to the signal being composed of two to four combined 25 kHz iDEN slot formats, each separated by 25 kHz. The sync and pilot symbols occur at the same symbol times and phases in both subcarriers. This is desirable for maintaining compatibility with the current iDEN slot format, but contributes to poor PAR.","Peak to average ratio compression is a technique for improving average power levels from an amplifier with limited peak power capability. However, the additive nature of having the sync and pilot symbols occur simultaneously in both subcarriers creates large peak power levels, thereby reducing the overall effective output power level of the transmitter. Typical methods of lowering PAR, such as adaptive gain control and hard or soft clipping, create splatter, which impacts adjacent channel power specs and may raise the noise floor of the transmitted signal.","Briefly, in accordance with preferred embodiments of the present invention, disclosed are a system, method, wireless device, and computer readable medium for improving the peak-to-average power ratio (PAR) of an integrated Digital Enhanced Network (iDEN) system using subcarrier time offsets. In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a system, computer readable medium, wireless device, and method reduce the peak-to-average power of a transmitter by creating at least two sampled carrier data streams, running each carrier through a separate delay block, mixing each carrier over in frequency an appropriate amount, resulting in at least two frequency division multiplexed signals, and combining the at least two frequency division multiplexed signals together. The at least two sampled carrier data streams may each have a bandwidth of 25 kHz. Each separate delay block may be less than approximately 20% of its corresponding symbol time. The transmitter may be used to transmit wideband integrated digitally enhanced network (WiDEN) signals.","The preferred embodiments of the present invention are advantageous because they improve the peak-to-average power ratio (PAR) of a transmitted signal without degrading the adjacent channel power level performance (increasing splatter). The sync and pilot symbols associated with each of the subcarriers of the transmitted signal are designed to have large amplitudes to aid in their detection. These sync and pilot symbols are typically transmitted at the same time on all of the subcarriers. When the individual mixer phases associated with each of the subcarriers align, the large amplitudes associated with the sync and pilot symbols produce peaks in the composite signal. Since, in the present invention, the subcarrier symbols are slightly delayed in time relative to each other, the mixed sync\/pilot symbols on each of the subcarriers do not add together to form as many peaks. Thus, a composite signal with fewer peaks would require less peak reduction, resulting in less splatter (ACCPR). This allows for more aggressive peak reduction processing while meeting the same splatter requirement (ACCPR), resulting in a transmit signal with improved PAR.","As required, detailed embodiments of the present invention are disclosed herein; however, it is to be understood that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which can be embodied in various forms. Therefore, specific structural and functional details disclosed herein are not to be interpreted as limiting, but merely as a basis for the claims and as a representative basis for teaching one skilled in the art to variously employ the present invention in virtually any appropriately detailed structure. Further, the terms and phrases used herein are not intended to be limiting; but rather, to provide an understandable description of the invention.","The terms \u201ca\u201d or \u201can\u201d, as used herein, are defined as one or more than one. The term plurality, as used herein, is defined as two or more than two. The term another, as used herein, is defined as at least a second or more. The terms including and\/or having, as used herein, are defined as comprising (i.e., open language). The term coupled, as used herein, is defined as connected, although not necessarily directly, and not necessarily mechanically. The terms program, software application, and the like as used herein, are defined as a sequence of instructions designed for execution on a computer system. A program, computer program, or software application may include a subroutine, a function, a procedure, an object method, an object implementation, an executable application, an applet, a servlet, a source code, an object code, a shared library\/dynamic load library and\/or other sequence of instructions designed for execution on a computer system.","The present invention, according to a preferred embodiment, advantageously overcomes problems with the prior art by delaying one of the subcarriers in time relative to the other. As long as the delays are kept small with respect to the symbol timing, the overall effect on the system is minimal. For example, a 50 kHz WiDEN transmitter utilizing this invention will look identical to two separate 25 kHz iDEN transmitters each transmitting at slightly different time. The delays are small with respect to the symbol timing and are within current system specifications for 50 kHz WiDEN transmissions.","For example, simulations discussed below delay one subcarrier 27 usecs relative to the other. The symbol time for either subcarrier is 250 usecs. This time delay has the effect of lowering the PAR of the combined signal since the syncs and pilot symbols no longer sum together at exactly the same time instant.","Referring to , a preferred embodiment of the present invention consists of at least one wireless mobile subscriber device (or wireless device) , operating within range of a cellular base station . A block diagram of an exemplary mobile subscriber device  is shown in . The wireless device  contains an antenna , at least one transceiver , having a transmitter  and a receiver , and a decoder\/encoder  designed to transmit, receive, encode and decode wireless signals for the frequencies and characteristics of its corresponding system.","The mobile subscriber unit  also includes one or more processor\/controllers , which processes instructions, performs calculations, and manages the flow of information through the SU .

Furthermore, the computer-readable medium may comprise computer-readable information in a transitory state medium such as a network link and\/or a network interface, including a wired network or a wireless network, that allow a computer to read such computer-readable information.","Various software embodiments are described in terms of this exemplary system.
