No. 61\/412,888 filed Nov. 12, 2010 and is a continuation-in-part application to co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/792,466 filed Jun. 2, 2010 and titled \u201cSystem, Apparatus and Method for Saving Game State and for Utilizing Game States on Different Gaming Devices\u201d.","A portion of the disclosure of this patent document contains material that is subject to copyright protection. The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent document or the patent disclosure, as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent files or records, but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever.","1. Field of the Invention","The field of the invention relates to systems and methods for issuing bonuses to players of gaming terminals.","2. Description of the Related Art","Modernly gaming terminals include not only a base or primary game but one or more bonus games and\/or special features. These features may be triggered randomly or may be triggered by the player obtaining one or more outcomes from the base game. For example a player may receive a special symbol(s) triggering a feature of free games, a bonus game or some other feature. These bonus features are designed into the game and the award structure for the bonus or feature is accounted for when determining the theoretical payback percentage for the game, i.e. the theoretical payback to the player for each unit wagered. For example the base game may have a theoretical payback of 80% with the bonus feature having a theoretical payback (equivalent value based upon payback and bonus feature hit frequency) contributing another 15% yielding a game having an overall payback percentage of 95%. Bonus features such as sets of free games, or a \u201cpick a prize\u201d bonus or a spinning wheel game have equivalent values which contribute to the payback percentage for the game. Depending upon the base game payback, the hit frequency for the feature game, i.e. the probability that during any spin of the base game the feature game will be triggered, and the feature game payback the overall payback percentage for the game can be crafted as desired or required.","Players tend to gravitate toward their favorite games. Perhaps a player likes the game theme or has had past success with the game or enjoys the various feature games. The player becomes familiar with the game features and understands the play characteristics of their favorite games.","In regards to casino play, and in the future it is anticipated Internet or mobile telephone or personal data assistant (PDA) wagering, operators drive player loyalty in one respect through system-provided bonusing. The casino (or gaming network) includes a communication network by which an operator can monitor player activity such as wagers, jackpots, games played and the like. Players are identified typically thought the player's use of a loyalty card having a machine readable stripe. For a brick and mortar casino an example of such a system is the Bally CMS\u00ae system sold by Bally Technologies, Inc. of Las Vegas, Nev. These systems interface with card readers at gaming terminals and table game input devices to provide the aforesaid tracking functions. Based upon the data collected the casino can provide benefits and incentives to retain a player's loyalty by, for example, awarding \u201ccomps\u201d in the form of cash back, discounts for goods and services and gifts. The tracking can be restricted to a single venue or can be on a national basis such as described in Boushy, U.S. Pat. No. 7,419,427 issued Sep. 2, 2008 and titled \u201cNATIONAL CUSTOMER RECOGNITION SYSTEM AND METHOD\u201d, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference. The level of \u201ccomps\u201d available to the player is related to the player's rating which quantifies the value of the player to the casino. A higher rated player is one who spends and gambles more than a lower rated player. A higher rated player is entitled to more valuable or additional comps.","Using the network system-provided bonusing can be crafted using the network to assemble funds by allocation of a percentage of player wagers at gaming terminals connected to the network to a pool. When the pool reaches a trigger amount, for example, all or a portion of the pool is awarded awarding to the player whose contribution caused the trigger value to be met or exceeded. These types of bonuses are often referred to a \u201cMystery jackpots\u201d since they are awarded typically as a result of a system configuration and the basis for the award is a mystery to the player since it has nothing to do with the outcome received on the player's gaming terminal.","The system-provided bonuses have heretofore been delivered by directly awarding cash or credits to the player at the gaming terminal or to the player's electronic account from which the player may download credits for play. Thus the bonus is delivered as cash or its equivalent. It would be advantageous if the system-provided, bonus could be delivered through a feature, enhanced feature or additional feature of the game being played by the player. This would increase the entertainment value of the bonus as well as enhance the player's loyalty to the game they are playing. It would also be advantageous if different funds could be sourced for the system-provided bonus such as comps or points earned from food and beverage, lodging, gift shop, spa or golf purchases as well as funds donated from other sources. In this regard it would be advantageous if the casino or a third party could brand the bonus to provide an additional form of advertising. It would further be advantageous if a player, who is entitled to a bonus of a certain value, could elect to receive the bonus as an additional or enhanced feature of the game they are playing.","There is provided according to embodiments of the present invention a system and method for funding and issuing a bonus to a user of a gaming terminal such as a gaming machine presenting a game having play and award features. The system and method includes the funding of a plurality of fund pools having values V-V. These fund pools may have various sources throughout the system enterprise. For example, where the enterprise is a casino-resort enterprise of one or more venues, a server may be provided which communicates with the casino slot accounting and player tracking system to fund a pool as a percentage of the money wagered at the gaming machines. Other servers may be configured to generate pools as contributions from spending for food and beverages, lodging, casino services such as golf or spa or the spending at gift shops as well as a pool derived from a contribution of marketing dollars by the casino or a third party. These pools may be represented by currency value, e.g. dollars, or may be represented by \u201cpoints\u201d (a value related scalar subject to redemption for value according to certain rules). Points or dollars available for bonusing may come from other sources within or outside the enterprise such as from a third party marketing partner or the like.","A server is provided which accesses the various pool server sources to convert all or a portion of the funds into a common bonus \u201centerprise currency\u201d amount available for bonusing according to predetermined rules. For example, if the patron has earned 100 points based upon their gift shop spending, those points may be converted to have an enterprise currency value of $20 for bonusing. Another rule is that the player, based upon their \u201crating\u201d, may only be entitled to a certain bonus during any period, e.g. limited to one or aggregate bonuses of a certain value such a $100 per day.","Based upon satisfaction of established bonus triggering criteria a bonus is made available to the player of a gaming machine. The bonus triggering criteria may be when the bonus pool(s) reach an amount, random triggering of the bonus, pseudo-random triggering of the bonus, random triggering of the bonus where probabilities are weighted in favor of the player's favorite games or favorite machines, a command by the system operator to issue a bonus or the like. When the bonus is triggered the available bonus value in enterprise currency dollars is made available for the gaming terminal. For example, the gaming terminal may have a feature that where the player obtains certain symbol combinations in the base game the player is entitled to ten free spins. When the free spin feature is triggered the gaming terminal may query the system to determine if a bonus has been made available. If not the gaming terminal plays the ten free spins according to the normal, configuration of the terminal. If a bonus is available the gaming terminal may dispense the bonus by (1) adding a number of free games having an expected value related to the bonus value, (2) or providing a multiplier for the ten free games or (3) providing the free spins where the distribution of symbols on one or more reels is altered (or wild symbols added or substituted for symbols) to increase the expected value from the free spins to in effect configure the gaming terminal to render the awarded bonus to the player through the player recognized game play base game, bonus or game feature. Since the outcomes of the bonus rendering features cannot be determined, the expected value for the feature configuration is selected so that the award of the bonus is mathematically supported. In other words, a bonus of $10 may be delivered though a feature where the player selects from a set of icons representing undisclosed features and that on average the expected return to the player would be $10. In practice the player may select a $5 prize or a $20 prize but based upon probabilities and over time the selected bonus amount will be awarded to players.","The bonus may also be delivered through the base game by providing play based upon reels where the symbol distribution is altered from the base game configuration to increase the expected value of one or more successive spins for the player or to increase the probabilities of winning by, for example, using reconfigured reels, e.g. substituting wild symbols, additional scatter symbols or the like. Additionally or alternatively the bonus may be delivered by, where the player has triggered a feature from the base game, an additional feature game that is offered through which the player may receive the bonus.","The delivery of the bonus through the game may be branded. For example where a provider or third party wishes to advertise they may fund a pool. When the bonus is triggered, a new feature game may be presented to the player with the game branded or having a theme which advertises the provider's goods or services. Where, for example, a third party airline company provides bonusing funds, the feature game may have a travel theme with aircraft bearing the company's logo.","After the bonus is issued it is deducted from the pool(s). The deduction from the pools may be based upon a configured hierarchy or protocol.","The bonus may be delivered through configuration of the gaming terminal or through the system. Upon triggering of the bonus the system may deliver content to the gaming terminal in the form of a game which is displayed at the gaming terminal display or auxiliary display.","Where the gaming terminal (or system) has game features through which the bonus will be delivered with different expected values e.g. EVand EVand the bonus value calls for an expected value between EVand EVthe system and method also provides for selection of the feature though which the bonus will be delivered so that overall the expected value and feature characteristics over time delivers the desired bonus amount to the player.","Other features and numerous advantages of the various embodiments will become apparent from the following detailed description when viewed in conjunction with the corresponding drawings.","The present invention is broadly directed to providing one or more bonuses to players of gaming terminals which can be funded from one or a plurality of funding sources. These funding sources may be in different unitary values meaning that their redemption value available for bonusing may be different for different fund sources. The present invention normalizes these funding sources into a common enterprise value for bonusing. This feature provides a resort with the ability to construct a resort-wide accrual and redemption criteria based upon the commercial activity of a player-user as well as pools funded from sources such as donations, marketing dollars or third party funding. Additionally it permits the casino resort to add new funding sources without overhauling their existing system.","The present invention is also directed to a system and method for the delivery of a bonus to a user. The delivery is through the use or enhancement of an in-game feature or bonus with which a player is familiar and\/or a branded feature. For example, if a player playing a base or primary slot machine terminal game which triggers a free game feature, the player may normally be entitled to ten free games paid at a 1\u00d7 multiplier. If the player is entitled to a bonus according to the present invention the player may now instead be awarded fifteen free games or the same ten free games at a 2\u00d7 pay multiplier. Thus a system derived bonus is delivered by incorporating the bonus into recognized or enhanced features of the game rather than simply a credit award. It is thought that such a technique increases the entertainment value of the game as well as fostering a favorable player impression about the game. To develop loyalty with the casino the bonus may be branded as being provided by the casino (or a third party who may be at least partially funding the bonus).","Other features and advantages of the present invention will be described including, but not limited to, bonus triggering, bonus configuration, bonus timing and renditions of the bonus award at the gaming terminal.","Gaming Terminal","Turning to the drawings  illustrates an example of a gaming terminal  which may be utilized according to the various embodiments of the present invention. While the gaming terminal  is shown as a video based game it should be understood that the terminal  could be an electro-mechanical stepper game, video Poker game, video Keno game, Class II gaming terminal, a sports wagering terminal for making wagers on sporting events such as horse racing or football, a terminal for server based gaming or a terminal supporting the downloading of games to the terminal  or a stand-alone multi-game terminal, a PC terminal or mobile device for providing gaming content and player interaction to make a wager upon a proposition, receive or report an outcome and to issue an award to the player in the event the outcome is favorable.","The gaming terminal  includes a cabinet  housing the various components. The terminal  includes a top box  as well. A topper  includes lights and backlit printed panels to attract players to the terminal . The cabinet  supports a main game display  which may be a CRT, LCD, OLED or other electronic video display. Alternatively the main game display  may be a window for viewing electro-mechanical stepper reels as is known in the art. The cabinet  and more particularly its top box  support a secondary display . The secondary display  may be a backlit printed glass or plastic panel or may be a display of the type described in reference to the main game display . The main game display  is positioned to display primary content to the player such as a game. The secondary display  typically displays additional content such as information about the game, e.g. game name and associated graphics and pay table but may also display other content such as a bonus game or, in combination with the main game display , a common game or bonus game display. It should be understood that the displays could display other content such as advertising, sports or other programming or the like. It should be understood that the main game display  and secondary display  could be embraced by a single display position in a portrait mode or the like.","The gaming device  also includes a gaming system interface  which has a display  and the slot  for receiving and reading a player identification instrument such as a machine readable player tracking card. The interface  includes a device of the player to interface with the system such as a keypad or touch sensitive input display.","A user interface  is provided to enable the player to interact with the gaming device . The interface  includes one or more displaceable buttons . The interface  may include a touch screen panel  to display gesture activated buttons (not shown) in addition to any displaceable buttons . By a \u201cdisplaceable\u201d button  what is meant is a mechanical button which can be physically displaced by sliding, rotating, rocking, depressing or the like to enter an interface input. As part of the interface  or as a separate component a cushioned hand rest  may also be provided.","The gaming terminal  is configured to have a base game such as a video spinning reel game. Based upon the symbol distribution (virtual or actual) and the award schedule for designated winning outcomes the base game will have a certain payback. By that what is meant is that for every dollar theoretically wagered the player should receive back in winnings a certain percentage, e.g. 85%. The game for the gaming terminal  may also have certain bonus features triggered for example by the player receiving one or more triggering symbols during the play of the base game. The feature may consist of (i) free spins of the game, (ii) free spins of the game with winning outcomes multiplied by a multiplier, (iii) a feature game such as offering the player selections to reveal a prize, (iv) play of a secondary game such as one where a game piece is moved to reveal prizes, (v) the random selection of one or more awards or (vi) play or another game such as a roulette, dice or card game to reveal a prize. The type of feature games which can be incorporated are only limited by the imagination of the game designers and the desired performance parameters for the game such as the minimum and maximum payback percentages. If a base game has an 85% payback percentage, the feature hit (trigger) frequency and payback from the bonus features must also be taken into account to determine the overall payback percentage for the game. Thus it should be understood for the purposes of the present invention that the game features have equivalent values (EV) which are the expected (theoretical) return for a unit wagered. Expected value (or expectation) for the purposes of this invention should be understood to mean sum of the probability of each possible outcome of the experiment multiplied by its payoff (\u201cvalue\u201d). In many respects the equivalent value is the same as the expected payback percentage. For example, if the game had a roulette game feature having 38 numbers and if the unit of wager is $1 and the winning pay if the player has the randomly selected number is 35:1 then the expected value for the feature is 1\u2212[(\u2212$1\u00d7odds of losing= 37\/38)+($35\u00d7odds of winning of 1\/38)]=0.9474. Thus the expected value for the Roulette game is, for each unit wagered, 0.9474. This expected value is known for the base game (payback percentage) as well as for each feature game. If the base game has a payback percentage of 85% (0.85) and the feature game is the roulette game described above but it is only triggered theoretically on 5% of the base game spins then the overall payback for the game is 85%+(5%\u00d70.9474)=85%+4.737%\u224889.7% game. Based upon the foregoing it should be understood that each of the base game and its various features has an expected value (payback percentage) and for a feature or bonus a probability of being triggered. It should also be understood that a feature game can be triggered by base game symbols or by a non-symbol based trigger such as described in Olive, U.S. Pat. No. 7,056,215 (a lottery approach is used to trigger a feature prize) the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference.","The gaming terminal  is connected to and in communication with one or more systems . As hereinafter described the systems may be include slot management and player loyalty functionalities as are known in the art. For example the slot management system may be the Bally CMS\u00ae system sold by Bally Technologies, Inc. of Las Vegas, Nev.","Turning to  and B the gaming device  hardware  for its various controller(s) is shown for purposes of illustration. The hardware  includes base game integrated circuit board  (EGM Processor Board) connected through serial bus  to game monitoring unit (GMU)  (such as a Bally MC300 or ACSC NT), and player interface integrated circuit board (PIB)  connected to player system interface devices  over buses , , , , . Gaming voucher ticket printer  (for printing player cash out tickets) is connected to PIB  and GMU  over buses , . EGM Processor Board , PIB , and GMU  connect to Ethernet switch  over buses , , . Ethernet switch  connects to a slot management system (SMS) and a casino management system (CMS) network over bus . Ethernet switch  may also connect to a server based gaming server or a downloadable gaming server. GMU  also may connect to the SMS and CMS network over bus . Speakers  produce sounds related to the game or according to the present invention connect through audio mixer  and buses ,  to EGM Processor Board  and PIB .","Peripherals  connect through bus  to EGM Processor Board . The peripherals  include, but are not limited to the following and may include individual processing capability: bill\/ticket acceptor to validate and accept currency and ticket vouchers, player loyalty card reader, the player interfaces including features to support the touch screen\/gesture functionality such as user interface , main game display , secondary display  (with or without touch screen functionality), monitors and lights, reel control units where the gaming terminal  is a stepper game and biometric reading (capturing) devices such as the digital camera . For example, a bill\/ticket acceptor is typically connected to the game input-output board of the EGM processing board  (which is, in turn, connected to a conventional central processing unit (\u201cCPU\u201d) board), such as an Intel Pentium microprocessor mounted on a gaming motherboard. The I\/O board may be connected to CPU processor board by a serial connection such as RS-232 or USB or may be attached to the processor by a bus such as, but not limited to, an ISA bus. The gaming motherboard may be mounted with other conventional components, such as are found on conventional personal computer motherboards, and loaded with a game program which may include a gaming machine operating system (OS), such as a Bally Alpha OS. EGM processor board  executes a game program that causes the gaming terminal  to display and play a game. The various components and included devices may be installed with conventionally and\/or commercially available components, devices, and circuitry into a conventional and\/or commercially available gaming terminal cabinet , examples of which are described above.","When a player has inserted a form of currency such as, for example and without limitation, paper currency, coins or tokens, cashless tickets or vouchers, electronic funds transfers or the like into the currency acceptor, a signal is sent by way of bus  to the I\/O board and to EGM processor board  which, in turn, assigns an appropriate number of credits for play in accordance with the game program. The player may further control the operation of the gaming terminal  by way of other peripherals , for example, to select the amount to wager via a player interface such as the button panel . The game starts in response to the player operating a start mechanism such as a handle, button such as a SPIN\/RESET button touch screen icon or depressing button . The game program includes a random number generator to provide a display of randomly selected indicia on one or more of the main and\/or secondary displays , . In some embodiments, the random number generator may be physically separate from gaming terminal ; for example, it may be part of a central determination host system which provides random game outcomes to the game program. Finally, processor board  under control of the game program and OS compares the final display of indicia to a pay table. The set of possible game outcomes may include a subset of outcomes related to the triggering of a feature or bonus game. In the event the displayed outcome is a member of this subset, processor board , under control of the game program and by way of I\/O Board , may cause feature game play to be presented on the main\/secondary display(s) , .","Predetermined payout amounts for certain outcomes, including feature game outcomes, are stored as part of the game program. Such payout amounts are, in response to instructions from processor board , provided to the player in the form of coins, credits or currency via I\/O board and a pay mechanism, which may be one or more of a credit meter, a coin hopper, a voucher printer, an electronic funds transfer protocol or any other payout means known or developed in the art.","In various embodiments, the game program is stored in a memory device (not shown) connected to or mounted on the gaming motherboard. By way of example, but not by limitation, such memory devices include external memory devices, hard drives, CD-ROMs, DVDs, and flash memory cards. In an alternative embodiment, the game programs are stored in a remote storage device. In one embodiment, the remote storage device is housed in a remote server such as a downloadable gaming server. The gaming terminal  may access the remote storage device via a network connection, including but not limited to, a local area network connection, a TCP\/IP connection, a wireless connection, or any other means for operatively networking components together. Optionally, other data including graphics, sound files and other media data for use with the gaming terminal  are stored in the same or a separate memory device (not shown). Some or all of the game program and its associated data may be loaded from one memory device into another, for example, from flash memory to random access memory (RAM).","In one or more embodiments, peripherals may be connected to the system over Ethernet connections directly to the appropriate server or tied to the system controller inside the gaming terminal  using USB, serial or Ethernet connections. Each of the respective devices may have upgrades to their firmware utilizing these connections.","GMU  includes an integrated circuit board and GMU processor and memory including coding for network communications, such as the G2S (game-to-system) protocol from the Gaming Standards Association, Las Vegas, Nev., used for system communications over the network. As shown, GMU  may connect to a player card reader  through bus  and may thereby obtain player card information and transmit the information over the network through bus . Gaming activity information may be transferred by the EGM Processor Board  to GMU  where the information may be translated into a network protocol, such as S2S, for transmission to a server, such as a player tracking server, where information about a player's playing activity may be stored in a designated server database.","PID  includes an integrated circuit board, PID processor, and memory which includes an operating system, such as Windows CE, a player interface program which may be executable by the PID processor together with various input\/output (I\/O) drivers for respective devices which connect to PID , such as player interface devices , and which may further include various games or game components playable on PID  or playable on a connected network server and PID  is operable as the player interface. PID  connects to card reader  through bus , player system interface display  through video decoder  and bus , such as an LVDS or VGA bus.","As part of its programming, the PID processor executes coding to drive system interface display  and provide messages and information to a player. Touch screen circuitry  interactively connects display  and video decoder  to PID ; such that a player may input information and cause the information to be transmitted to PID  either on the player's initiative or responsive to a query by PID . Additionally soft keys  connect through bus  to PID  and operate together with the display  to provide information or queries to a player and receive responses or queries from the player. PID , in turn, communicates over the CMS\/SMS network through Ethernet switch  and busses ,  and with respective servers, such as a player tracking server.","Player interface devices  are linked into the virtual private network of the system components in gaming terminal . The system components include the iVIEW\u00ae device (\u2018iView\u201d is a registered trademark of Bally Gaming, Inc.) processing board and game monitoring unit (GMU) processing board. These system components may connect over a network to the slot management system (such as a commercially available Bally SDS\/SMS) and\/or casino management system (such as a commercially available Bally CMP\/CMS).","The GMU system component has a connection to the base game through a serial SAS connection and is connected to various servers using, for example, HTTPs over Ethernet. Through this connection, firmware, media, operating system software, gaming machine configurations can be downloaded to the system components from the servers. This data is authenticated prior to install on the system components.","In an alternative embodiment the player system interface including the display  may instead be presented, upon command or request by the player, as a portion of the main display . Where the main display  has touch screen functionality, upon command or requests the content at the main game display  such as a video reel game display is sized to accommodate a player interface display panel at the main game display . The touch screen functionality for the main game display  is configured to enable the player to interface with the interface through touch screen controls (buttons, sliders, arrows, etc.).","Turning to  is a functional block diagram of a gaming kernel  of a game program under control of processor board , uses gaming kernel  by calling into application programming interface (API) , which is part of game manager . The components of game kernel  as shown in  are only illustrative, and should not be considered limiting. For example, the number of managers may be changed, additional managers may be added or some managers may be removed without deviating from the scope and spirit of the invention.","As shown in the example, there are three layers: a hardware layer ; an operating system layer , such as, but not limited to, Linux; and a game kernel layer  having game manager  therein. In one or more embodiments, the use of a standard operating system , such a UNIX-based or Windows-based operating system, allows game developers interfacing to the gaming kernel to use any of a number of standard development tools and environments available for the operating systems. This is in contrast to the use of proprietary, low level interfaces which may require significant time and engineering investments for each game upgrade, hardware upgrade, or feature upgrade. The game kernel layer  executes at the user level of the operating system , and itself contains a major component called the I\/O Board Server . To properly set the bounds of game application software (making integrity checking easier), all game applications interact with gaming kernel  using a single API  in game manager . This enables game applications to make use of a well-defined, consistent interface, as well as making access points to gaming kernel  controlled, where overall access is controlled using separate processes.","For example, game manager  parses an incoming command stream and, when a command dealing with I\/O comes in (arrow ), the command is sent to an applicable library routine . Library routine  decides what it needs from a device, and sends commands to I\/O Board Server  (see arrow ). A few specific drivers remain in operating system 's kernel, shown as those below line . These are built-in, primitive, or privileged drivers that are (i) general (ii) kept to a minimum and (iii) are easier to leave than extract. In such cases, the low-level communications is handled within operating system  and the contents passed to library routines .","Thus, in a few cases library routines may interact with drivers inside operating system , which is why arrow  is shown as having three directions (between library utilities  and I\/O Board Server , or between library utilities  and certain drivers in operating system ). No matter which path is taken, the logic needed to work with each device is coded into modules in the user layer of the diagram. Operating system  is kept as simple, stripped down, and common across as many hardware platforms as possible. The library utilities and user-level drivers change as dictated by the game cabinet or game machine in which it will run. Thus, each game cabinet or game machine may have an industry standard processor board  connected to a unique, relatively dumb, and as inexpensive as possible I\/O adapter board, plus a gaming kernel  which will have the game-machine-unique library routines and I\/O Board Server  components needed to enable game applications to interact with the gaming machine cabinet. Note that these differences are invisible to the game application software with the exception of certain functional differences (i.e., if a gaming cabinet has stereo sound, the game application will be able make use of API  to use the capability over that of a cabinet having traditional monaural sound).","Game manager  provides an interface into game kernel , providing consistent, predictable, and backwards compatible calling methods, syntax, and capabilities by way of game application API . This enables the game developer to be free of dealing directly with the hardware, including the freedom to not have to deal with low-level drivers as well as the freedom to not have to program lower level managers , although lower level managers  may be accessible through game manager 's interface  if a programmer has the need. In addition to the freedom derived from not having to deal with the hardware level drivers and the freedom of having consistent, callable, object-oriented interfaces to software managers of those components (drivers), game manager  provides access to a set of high level managers  also having the advantages of consistent callable, object-oriented interfaces, and further providing the types and kinds of base functionality required in casino-type games. Game manager , providing all the advantages of its consistent and richly functional interface  as supported by the rest of game kernel , thus provides a game developer with a multitude of advantages.","Game manager  may have several objects within itself, including an initialization object (not shown). The initialization object performs the initialization of the entire game machine, including other objects, after game manager  has started its internal objects and servers in appropriate order. In order to carry out this function, the kernel's configuration manager  is among the first objects to be started; configuration manager  has data needed to initialize and correctly configure other objects or servers.","The high level managers  of game kernel  may include game event log manager  which provides, at the least, a logging or logger base class, enabling other logging objects to be derived from this base object. The logger object is a generic logger; that is, it is not aware of the contents of logged messages and events. The log manager's  job is to log events in non-volatile event log space. The size of the space may be fixed, although the size of the logged event is typically not. When the event space or log space fills up, one embodiment will delete the oldest logged event (each logged event will have a time\/date stamp, as well as other needed information such as length), providing space to record the new event. In this embodiment, the most recent events will thus be found in the log space, regardless of their relative importance. Further provided is the capability to read the stored logs for event review.","In accordance with one embodiment, meter manager  manages the various meters embodied in the game kernel . This includes the accounting information for the game machine and game play. There are hard meters (counters) and soft meters; the soft meters may be stored in non-volatile storage such as non-volatile battery-backed RAM to prevent loss. Further, a backup copy of the soft meters may be stored in a separate non-volatile storage such as EEPROM. In one embodiment, meter manager  receives its initialization data for the meters, during start-up, from configuration manager . While running, the cash in  and cash out  managers call the meter manager's  update functions to update the meters. Meter manager  will, on occasion, create backup copies of the soft meters by storing the soft meters' readings in EEPROM. This is accomplished by calling and using EEPROM manager .","Progressive manager  manages progressive games playable from the game machine. Event manager  is generic, like log manager , and is used to manage various gaming device events. Focus manager  correlates which process has control of various focus items. Tilt manager  is an object that receives a list of errors (if any) from configuration manager  at initialization, and during game play from processes, managers, drivers, etc. that may generate errors. Random number generator manager  is provided to allow easy programming access to a random number generator (RNG), as a RNG is required in virtually all casino-style (gambling) games. RNG manager  includes the capability of using multiple seeds.","A credit manager object (not shown) manages the current state of credits (cash value or cash equivalent) in the game machine, including any available winnings, and further provides denomination conversion services. Cash out manager  has the responsibility of configuring and managing monetary output devices. During initialization, cash out manager , using data from configuration manager , sets the cash out devices correctly and selects any selectable cash out denominations. During play, a game application may post a cash out event through the event manager  (the same way all events are handled), and using a call back posted by cash out manager , cash out manager  is informed of the event. Cash out manager  updates the credit object, updates its state in non-volatile memory, and sends an appropriate control message to the device manager that corresponds to the dispensing device. As the device dispenses dispensable media, there will typically be event messages being sent back and forth between the device and cash out manager  until the dispensing finishes, after which cash out manager , having updated the credit manager and any other game state (such as some associated with meter manager ) that needs to be updated for this set of actions, sends a cash out completion event to event manager  and to the game application thereby. Cash in manager  functions similarly to cash out manager , only controlling, interfacing with, and taking care of actions associated with cashing in events, cash in devices, and associated meters and crediting.","In a further example, in accordance with one or more embodiments, I\/O server  may write data to the gaming machine EEPROM memory, which is located in the gaming machine cabinet and holds meter storage that must be kept even in the event of power failure. Game manager  calls the I\/O library functions to write data to the EEPROM. The I\/O server  receives the request and starts a low priority EEPROM thread  within I\/O server  to write the data. This thread uses a sequence of 8 bit command and data writes to the EEPROM device to write the appropriate data in the proper location within the device. Any errors detected will be sent as IPC messages to game manager . All of this processing is asynchronous.","In accordance with one embodiment, button module  within I\/O server , polls (or is sent) the state of buttons at the user interface  every two milliseconds. These inputs are debounced by keeping a history of input samples. Certain sequences of samples are required to detect a button was pressed, in which case the I\/O server  sends an inter-process communication event to game manager  that a button was pressed or released. In some embodiments, the gaming machine may have intelligent distributed I\/O which debounces the buttons, in which case button module  may be able to communicate with the remote intelligent button processor to get the button events and simply relay them to game manager  via IPC messages. In still another embodiment, the I\/O library may be used for pay out requests from the game application. For example, hopper module  (where a coin\/token hopper is provided) must start the hopper motor, constantly monitor the coin sensing lines of the hopper, debounce them, and send an IPC message to the game manager  when each coin is paid.","Further details, including disclosure of lower level fault handling and\/or processing, are included in U.S. Pat.

The network bridge  connects to a back end system . Optionally, the gaming terminals  may connect to the network via a network rack , which provides for a few numbers of connections to the back end system . Both, network bridge  and network rack  may be classified as middleware, and facilitate communications between the back end system  and the GMUs . The network bridges  and network rack  may comprise data repositories for storing network performance data. Such performance data may be based on network traffic and other network related information. Optionally, the network bridge  and the network rack  may be interchangeable components. For example, in one embodiment, a casino gaming system may comprise only network bridges and no network racks. Alternatively, in another embodiment, a casino gaming system may comprise only network racks and no network bridges. Additionally, in an alternative embodiment, a casino gaming system may comprise any combination of one or more network bridges and one or more network racks.","The back end system  may be configured to comprise one or more servers as hereinafter described.

In one embodiment, as illustrated in , the back end system  is configured to include three servers: a slot floor controller , a casino management server  and a casino database . As described with reference to  the casino resort enterprise may include other servers. The slot floor controller  is a part of the player tracking system for gathering accounting, security and player specific information. The casino management server  and casino database  work together to store and process information specific to both employees and players. Player specific information includes, but is not limited to, passwords, biometric identification, player card identification, and biographic data. Additionally, employee specification information may include biographic data, biometric information, job level and rank, passwords, authorization codes and security clearance levels.","Overall, the back end system  performs several functions. For example, the back end system  can collect data from the slot floor as communicated to it from other network components, and maintain the collected data in its database. The back end system  may use slot floor data to generate a report used in casino operation functions. Examples of such reports include, but are not limited to, accounting reports, security reports, and usage reports. The back end system  may also pass data to another server for other functions. Alternatively, the back end system  may pass data stored on its database to floor hardware for interaction with a game or game player. For example, data such as a game player's name or the amount of a ticket being redeemed at a game may be passed to the floor hardware. Additionally, the back end system  may comprise one or more data repositories for storing data. Examples of types of data stored in the system server data repositories include, but are not limited to, information relating to individual player play data, individual game accounting data, gaming terminal accounting data, cashable ticket data, sound data, and optimal display configurations for one or more displays for one or more system game.","Of course, one will appreciate that a gaming system  may also comprise other types of components, and the above illustrations are meant only as examples and not as limitations to the types of components or games used in a casino gaming system.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0073","num":"0072"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["720","700","700"]},"The enterprise may also have a hotel loyalty server  which is configured to accrue a bonus pool value based upon the player's hotel \u201cspend\u201d such as for lodging.

The processor, such as a processor associated with the loyalty exchange server , at  makes a determination if the available bonus is greater than a threshold value of a tier, such as the tiers of the structure of Table 2 above. If the response is in the affirmative at  the probability factor Fis at  increased to correspond to the next tier value. If the value of the available bonus(es) has not reached the next tier a determination is made at  if a bonus request has been made by a gaming terminal  or by a system or local bonus controller. If there is no pending bonus request the method\/system resumes the aggregation of the bonus pool values and determination of the applicable probability factor F.","If there is a pending bonus request at  the determination is made as to whether or not to award the bonus. This determination is made as described above based upon PF, the probability factor Fand the random number generator. As stated above the determination to issue a bonus can be by other means such as a coin-in mystery bonus, lottery-type bonus or the like. At  the bonus is either awarded or not based upon the determination. If no bonus is to be awarded the system and method resumes the aggregation of the bonus pool values and determination of the applicable probability factor Fat . If the determination is made to award the bonus at  the amount is selected as, for example, by the technique described above and is sent or made available to the game. For example, in a \u201cpull\u201d arrangement the EGM may request is a bonus is available such as when it triggers a feature. In a \u201cpush\u201d arrangement the bonus may be pushed by the system to the game for implementation at the first opportunity, i.e. not interrupt normal play. At  the delivered bonus amount is subtracted from the available bonus pool(s) according to the configured protocol. At  the available bonus amount is compared to the threshold value tier amounts for the probability factor to determine whether the available bonus amount has dropped the value to a lower tier warranting the application of a lower F. If the value has decreased into a lower tier the probability factor for the lower tier is selected at .

In one embodiment, the bonus may be delivered as enhanced pays for winning combinations for the base game on a gaming terminal . Accordingly, in one embodiment when the player receives a winning combination the gaming terminal would query the system to determine if a system bonus according to the present invention is available. If so and where the gaming terminal and system are configured to provide for delivery of the bonus though the base game, the terminal would \u201cpull\u201d the bonus from the system and reconfigure its award schedule to increase the awards for one or more winning outcomes or provide for additional winning outcomes for which a pay is received. This is referred to as a \u201cpull\u201d configuration since the available bonus is held by the system until the gaming terminal requests, i.e. pulls, the bonus to the terminal for distribution. The periods by which the system recalculates the available bonus may be configured, e.g. every 30 minutes, or the recalculation may be continuous until delivered. When the delivered bonus amount has been exhausted the base game returns to its original configuration. Exhaustion may be determined by delivery of the entire available bonus award or, as hereinafter described, completion of the determined bonus intervention in the game. In an alternative embodiment when the bonus award according to the present invention is authorized the amount of the bonus is \u201cpushed\u201d to the gaming terminal to be delivered to the player as increased awards for winning outcomes. By pushing what is meant is that when an event occurs making a system bonus available the bonus amount is \u201cpushed\u201d down to the gaming terminal for distribution.","In another embodiment the bonus may be delivered (in a push or pull configuration) as an enhancement to the feature games of the gaming terminal such as by adding free games, increasing prizes, increasing the player's chances of winning a feature prize, providing additional features or the like. For example, when the player playing a base game has triggered a feature game of 10 free spins, the gaming terminal would query the system to determine if a bonus is available. If so, the bonus may be delivered to the player as a multiplier for the free games, as additional free games, as free games using reels with different symbols or symbol combinations, i.e. adding \u201cwild\u201d symbols, expanding \u201cwild\u201d symbols or the like. When a feature is triggered the bonus may be delivered through an additional feature or an existing feature with enhanced play features or awards.","As but an example, a gaming terminal may have the awards and symbol distribution to define a base game EV=0.90 (90%). Thus for a wager of $1 there would be an expected return to the player of $0.90. This game also has a free spin feature triggered by one or more base game symbol combinations. If the available bonus is $15 and the player triggers the free game bonus, the player may normally be expected to receive 5 free spins. Excluding the bonus for the $1 wager the player would mathematically expect to receive a bonus of $1\u00d75 (free spins)\u00d70.90 (EV)=$4.50. Of course the actual award may be more or less determined by the random outcomes (i.e. luck) of play. Now, with the bonus, the projected return to the player should be $4.50+$15=19.50. To accommodate the new amount the bonus may control the gaming terminal to either add free spins to the allotted 5 free spins or apply a multiplier. The number of free spins can be determined by: Award\/(RTP\u00d7Multiplier). For example if the award is added as free spins the number of addition free spins to deliver the bonus with no multiplier would be $15\/(RTP)=16.67 additional spins for a total of 21.67 free spins. Inasmuch as the total is not a whole number a random number generator could be used randomly select a number Z between 0 and 1 and if Z\u22660.67 then the system would award 22 free spins otherwise the player would receive 21 free spins.","Alternatively the bonus may be configured to include a multiplier or 2\u00d7 to the additional free spins resulting in a configuration of 5 free spins at 1\u00d7 pay plus $15\/0.9\u00d72=8.33 free spins at 2\u00d7 pay. Again since 8.33 is not a whole number of spins a random number generator could select between 8 and 9 free spins in the manner described above, i.e. if Z\u22660.33 the system would award 9 additional free spins at 2\u00d7 pay otherwise the player would receive 8 free spins.","The foregoing demonstrates a feature by which the system and method can accommodate issuing the bonus where the EV does not result in a whole number of free spins or where the bonus does not match a configuration of a feature. For example the game may have a feature where the player selects icons to reveal prizes. The game may have two features which differ by the award structure (AS) they offer. For example one feature may have a prize structure weighed to produce an expected prize for each $1 wagered of EV=$10 and another may have a structure where the expected value EVis $50. During normal play the game randomly (or pseudo-randomly) selects between these features. If the determined bonus award is $23, the gaming terminal  or processor associated with the loyalty exchange server  would randomly select a number Z between EVand EVand in this example if Z\u226623 then the feature having EVwould be used to deliver the bonus. In this manner a gaming terminal having varying feature awards or base game configurations of different equivalent values can be used. Stated broadly where EV\u2266B\u2266EVwhere B=the bonus amount, EVrepresents a feature having and award structure ASwith a first equivalent value and EVrepresents a feature having an award structure ASwith a second equivalent value greater than the first (i.e. EV>EV) the feature selected is determined by randomly choosing between one of EV and EV. Preferably where the selected random number Z is expressed EV\u2266Z\u2266B or EV\u2266Z<B then the feature associated with EVis employed otherwise the feature associated with EVis used. By equivalent value what is meant is the expected pay as a result of a spin of a set of gaming terminal reels, the play of a Poker, Keno or Bingo hand or the expected value related to a feature offering a set of values to award to the player.","In still an additional embodiment when a bonus is triggered the bonus may be delivered to the terminal by a special game which is presented to the player at the conclusion of the base game play (with any triggered features) and which may be branded by a provider or other advertiser. This embodiment is shown in  and B. When a system bonus is triggered by any suitable means as herein described the award is either delivered to the gaming terminal (\u2018pushed\u201d) or held in queue to be \u201cpulled\u201d by the terminal when the current base game is concluded. For example a player playing a base game may have triggered one or more features such as a free spin set. During the play of the base game or the free game set the bonus may be triggered. In a \u201cpush\u201d arrangement the bonus may be sent to the gaming terminal and\/or its gaming system interface  and held in queue until completion of the base game and features. When the base game concludes the bonus is delivered to the player by a branded game. As shown in  the main game display  or secondary display  or the display  of the gaming system interface  displays the bonus game with a branding banner  indicating the sponsor of the bonus or other advertising or branding. This enables a third party, e.g. a national airline company for example, to provide funds and brand the bonus for advertising purposes. The third party may provide not only funds but prizes such as airline ticket vouchers or the like. Where the bonus is provided by the casino the branding drives player loyalty. After display of the branding banner  the bonus game is played as shown in  and any bonus awarded to the player. The bonus may be through a series of spins or by another game such as picking a hidden prize, playing a card or wheel or roulette game.","It should be understood that where a bonus amount have been triggered and derived the delivery of the bonus through the game will not necessarily deliver the precise bonus amount. It is intended to deliver approximately the bonus amount. For example where the bonus is delivered through extra free games, the player may receive less than the calculated bonus amount or more than the calculated amount. Any bonus allocated funds not awarded are returned to their pools or to another pool. Any amounts dispensed over the calculated amount are deducted from the pools either on an even basis or based upon a predetermined deduction protocol. Whatever the amount that is actually delivered to the player, it is deducted from the bonus pool(s). The deduction may be based upon a predetermined protocol, i.e. the first 50% deducted from one pool (if there are funds available), then 20% from another pool and so forth. Alternatively the awarded funds may be deducted evenly across the pools.","The foregoing description, for purposes of explanation, uses specific nomenclature and formula to provide a thorough understanding of the invention.
