{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATION","STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENTAL INTEREST","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61\/583,782, filed on Jan. 6, 2012, the entirety of which is hereby incorporated by reference.","This invention was made with Government support under Contract No. NNC08CA87C awarded by the NASA\/Glenn Research Center in Cleveland, Ohio. The Government has certain rights in the invention.","The present invention generally relates to an electrochemical cell with improved water or gas management, and in one exemplary embodiment relates to a fuel cell that utilizes high bubble point polymeric porous media.","Electrochemical cell devices are typically made up of a plurality of electrochemical cells, arranged in groups or stacks, and commonly serve to: electrolytically disassociate water or another liquid (with or without dissolved constituents) into its components (i.e., electrolysis cells), or catalytically combine hydrogen or other fuel and an oxidizer (i.e., fuel cells), with electricity being either supplied or generated, respectively. Other related functions for electrochemical cell devices include their use as compressors, separation and\/or purification means, sensors, and combinations of these functions.","Within arranged groups or stacks, each electrochemical cell includes a cathode, an electrolyte (e.g., a membrane), and an anode. In Proton Exchange Membrane or PEM cells, where the electrolyte is a cation exchange membrane, the cathode\/membrane\/anode assembly (i.e., \u201cmembrane electrode assembly\u201d or \u201cMEA\u201d) is typically supported on both sides by flow fields made up of screen packs or channeled plates. Flow fields, usually in the form of expanded metal or woven screens, or adhesive-bonded, laminated, or machined assemblies, facilitate fluid movement, removal of product water or product gas, and also serve to provide in, for example, PEM cells, mechanical support for the MEA.","Electrochemical cells, when operated as fuel cells or water electrolyzers, are desirable for various applications. Fuel cells, for example, have been proposed for many applications including as an energy source for supplying an aircraft with electric energy.","In specific regard to fuel cells with in-cell static water removal capabilities, such cells utilize conductive metal or metallic porous media that functions to remove fuel cell product water via a pressure differential. Unfortunately, this approach, which attempts to balance bubble point with acceptable water transport rates, is usually limited to low, approximately 0.01-0.06 Megapascals (MPa), bubble pressure.","Bubble point is used as a measure of the resistance of the flow of gas phase fluids through pores of filter or filter-like materials. The bubble point value is determined by observing when bubbles first begin to emerge on the permeate side or downstream side of a fully-wetted membrane filter or filter-like material when pressurized with a gas on the feed (upstream) side of the material.","High bubble point materials with excellent water transport exist and are commercially available but when compared to metal or metallic porous media are typically less electrically conductive or non-conductive.","In view of the above, what is needed is a fuel cell that utilizes high bubble point polymeric porous media with excellent water transport capability that has the ability to conduct electrical current.","Generally speaking, the present invention fulfills this need by providing an electrochemical cell that comprises a water\/gas porous separator prepared from a polymeric material, and one or more conductive cell components that pass through, or are located in close proximity to, the water\/gas porous separator, the electrochemical cell providing a high level of in-cell electrical conductivity.","In an exemplary embodiment, the inventive electrochemical cell operates as an in-cell static water removal fuel cell, wherein the water\/gas porous separator is prepared from a high bubble point polymeric material.","The water\/gas porous separator employed in this exemplary embodiment has a bubble point of greater than 0.06 MPa, preferably, from about 0.07 to about 0.55 MPa, which provides excellent water removal.","The inventive fuel cell demonstrates an area specific resistance (ASTM # B193-02 (2008) Standard Test Method for Resistivity of Electrical Conductor Materials) of less than or equal to about 100 mohms-cm, preferably less than about 20 mohm-cm.","Other features and advantages of the invention will be apparent to one of ordinary skill from the following detailed description and accompanying drawings. Unless otherwise defined, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. All publications, patent applications, patents and other references mentioned herein are incorporated by reference in their entirety. In case of conflict, the present specification, including definitions, will control. In addition, the materials, methods, and examples are illustrative only and not intended to be limiting.","As noted above, the electrochemical cell of the present invention comprises a water\/gas porous separator. In the case of a fuel cell, the water\/gas porous separator is prepared from a high bubble point polymeric material, and the inventive fuel cell further comprises one or more conductive cell components that pass through, or are located in close proximity to, the water\/gas porous separator. The inventive fuel cell provides a high level of in-cell electrical conductivity.","The inventive fuel cell may be manufactured using carbon, composite, or metal based materials, with assembled stacks using either bipolar current or edge current collection design.","The water\/gas porous separator used with the inventive fuel cell offers excellent water transport while preventing gas cross-over from the oxygen chamber to the water chamber. In an exemplary embodiment, the porous separator allows water to pass at low pressures ranging from at least about 0.001 MPa, while providing a gas bubble point of greater than 0.06 MPa, preferably, from about 0.07 to about 0.55 MPa.","Contemplated water\/gas porous separators include separators in the form of plate-like structures that have a diameter ranging from about 2.54 to about 76.2 centimeters (cm) (preferably, from about 7.62 to about 38.1 cm), and a thickness ranging from about 0.05 to about 0.25 millimeters (mm) (preferably, from about 0.10 to about 0.20 mm).","The pore size or diameter of the pores of the water\/gas porous separator ranges from about 0.03 to about 0.2 microns. The interior surface of the pores is wettable to water, which may be an inherent property of the material used to prepare the separator. Additionally, as noted above, the open pores of the separator are capable of providing a bubble pressure sufficient to prevent gas cross over from the oxygen chamber to the water chamber.","In an exemplary embodiment, the water\/gas porous separator is prepared from a polyethersulfone (PES) membrane filter medium (0.1 micron pore size, rated flow=2.8 to 7.4 milliliters (ml)\/min\/cmat 0.7 Bar), that is sold under the brand name \u201cSUPOR\u201d by the PALL Specialty Materials company, of Port Washington, New York, N.Y. 11050, U.S.A. PES is an inherently hydrophilic membrane that wets out quickly and completely resulting in superior flow rates and high throughputs.","In another exemplary embodiment, the water\/gas porous separator is another PES membrane (0.03 micron pore size, rated flow=5.5 ml\/min\/cmat 0.07 MPa), that is sold under the brand name \u201cSTERILITECH\u201d by GE Osmonics, 5951 Clearwater Drive, Minnetonka, Minn. 55343.","In a first preferred embodiment, the porous separator contains a number of through-holes. The through-holes allow for physical contact between conductive mating structures (i.e., conductive tongue and groove structures) located on opposing sides of the porous separator.","Referring now to  in detail, reference numeral  has been used to generally designate one embodiment of the fuel cell or fuel cell stack of the present invention, while reference numeral  has been used to generally designate one embodiment of the water\/gas porous separator. The porous separator  is shown with a series of parallel, elongate, oval-shaped through-holes . A water chamber or flowfield  (with a mating structure) is located on one side of separator , while an oxygen screen\/frame assembly  (with a complimentary mating structure) is located on an opposing side, thereby forming a so-called water transport assembly. Generally speaking, the water chamber or flowfield  and the oxygen screen\/frame assembly  both include a central portion  having a multitude of fluid-flow spaces and a frame portion  integral with and circumferentially surrounding the central portion . The diameter of porous separator  is slightly larger than the diameter of the central portions  of the water chamber or flowfield  and the oxygen screen\/frame assembly . An MEA  is shown on an opposing side of the oxygen screen\/frame assembly , while a solid separator sheet  is shown on an opposing side of the water chamber or flowfield .","The oxygen screen\/frame assembly  shown in , which is preferably a diffusion bonded laminar assembly, has a series of bonded (e.g., diffusion bonded) conductive tongue extensions  along an upper surface that mate with a series of conductive strips  bonded (e.g., diffusion bonded) onto a lower surface of the central portion  of the water chamber or flowfield . As best shown in , upon assembly of the inventive fuel cell or fuel cell stack, these mating structures ,  will physically contact each other through the through-holes  provided in the porous separator , thereby forming an electrical pathway between the conductive oxygen screen\/frame assembly  and the conductive water chamber or flowfield . In this embodiment, current flows through the active area of the cell.","An insulating sealing gasket  (e.g., a TEFLON\u00ae gasket) (not shown) is positioned between the frame portion  of the oxygen screen\/frame assembly  and the frame portion  of the water chamber or flowfield  to insure a uniform fit and seal between these components.","A top planar view of the oxygen screen\/frame assembly  is shown in . Here, the insulating sealing gasket  is shown extending around the perimeter of assembly .","A two-cell 50 cm\u201cbipolar current collection\u201d hybrid test stack was prepared in accordance with the teachings of the present invention and tested. One cell in the test stack utilized gold conductive tongue extensions  while the other cell utilized carbon conductive tongue extensions . The MEA  for each cell employed a NAFION 117 PFSA membrane. A humidifier-degasser cell (H\/D cell) was installed, but the degasser was disabled to allow bubble detection. Stack test conditions were as follows: temperature=70\u00b0 C.; Opressure=0.21 MPa; Hpressure=0.21 MPa; HO pressure=0 MPa (approximately 0.21 MPa Oto HO differential).
