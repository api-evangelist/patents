No. 11\/657,787 entitled A System and Method to Create a Collaborative Web-based Multimedia Layered Platform, filed Jan. 24, 2007 now U.S. Pat. No. 9,933,956, and additionally claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. 119 (e) of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60\/761,529, A System And Method To Create A Collaborative Web-Based Multimedia Layered Platform, filed on Jan. 24, 2006, each of the entire disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference herein.","This invention generally relates to the field of asynchronous and synchronous web conferencing methods and systems.","In the last few years, there has been an explosion in new forms of web based communication within a shared space. The synchronous form is most commonly practiced as Online Chat. With synchronous communication, like Online Chat for example, text is exchanged in real-time between participants. Although images can be provided to a limited extent, links to images or other multimedia is more commonly used. Another common form of synchronous communication is with web conferencing services. These services provide a discrete state synchronicity such that only one image can be shared at one time. Typically, once the session has ended, the images shared are lost. Many of the current online collaboration systems are beginning to record the sessions. However, these recording are only recoding a series of images for play back.","The most common asynchronous forms of collaboration are Forums, blogs and WIKIs. In the asynchronous case, visitors can upload text or images so that all subsequent visitors can browse and see the text or images. Blogs and Forums have an advantage over Chat in that conversations can be linked into \u2018threads\u2019. This allows the user to follow a set of contributions in a linear and\/or nested fashion. Lacking is the real-time aspect as well as the ability to layer media. Currently even if you can upload an image or multimedia clip into a chat room or blog, it is not known for visitors to alter, manipulate or annotate over the original posting. What is common to these forms of shared communication is that they are linear. All information whether text or image, is accessed in order. A comment in a blog about an image does not appear on top of the image, but instead next to it as with \u2018threads\u2019. The same holds true for a chat box. Users must cut and paste to refer to a past event.","Lacking is a system that will allow both synchronous and asynchronous communication using discrete media layers such that information can be organized by time and space which in turn can allow for a variety of organizational metaphors.","It will be desirable that multiple users are able to interact with one another and perform a plurality of multimedia tasks in a virtual and synchronized shared environment; or to be able to access and review the performed tasks from local or remote sources at will in any order. It will also be desirable to allow users to set control or restrict the viewing of media layers in the same shared environment through different filtering algorithms. It is also desirable that an original image can seemed to be altered or manipulated by overlaying various media-layers together.","The following terminologies used in the application are selectively defined by an online dictionary such as Wikipedia to help understanding:","Web based shared space\u2014This describes a single point of reference for multiple users to access and add and modify information from a web browser for viewing by others via that same point of reference.","Media (multi)\u2014Multimedia is the use of several different media to convey information (text, audio, graphics, animation, video, and interactivity).","Medium\u2014defined as the singular of multimedia. For example, text, a media, is a singular example of multimedia.","API\u2014An application programming interface (API) is the interface that a computer system or application provides in order to allow requests for service to be made of it by other computer programs, and\/or to allow data to be exchanged between them.","Plug-in\u2014A plug-in is a computer program that can, or must, interact with another program to provide a certain, usually very specific, function. Typical examples are plug-in to display specific graphic formats (e.g., SVG if the browser doesn't support this format natively), to play multimedia files, to encrypt\/decrypt email (e.g., PGP), or to filter images in graphic programs. The main program (a web browser or an email client, for example) provides a way for plug-in to register themselves with the program, and a protocol by which data is exchanged with plug-in. Plug-ins are slightly different from extensions, which modify or add to existing functionality. The main difference is that plug-in generally run within a sandbox, rely on the main program's user interface, and have a well-defined boundary to their possible set of actions.","Media-layer (media layer) (layer)\u2014A media-layer is defined as a container that supports the display and modification of media and plug-ins. Media-layers have meta information, or attributes, such as; author, time\/date created, its parent media-container, a list of children media-containers, position within 3D space, stacking order relative to the parent media-layer, size, reference to media or a plug-in that is assigned to the media-layer, etc.","Images\u2014defined as photographs, drawings (vector and raster), diagrams, etc.","Annotation\u2014Extra information associated with a particular point in a document or other piece of information.","Common Web Browser\u2014A web browser is a software application, technically a type of HTTP client, that enables a user to display and interact with HTML documents hosted by web servers or held in a file system. Popular browsers available for personal computers include Microsoft Internet Explorer.\u00ae., Mozilla Firefox.\u00ae., Opera.\u00b0., Netscape.\u00ae., Apple Safar.\u00ae.i and Konqueror.\u00ae.. A browser is the most commonly used kind of user agent. The largest networked collection of linked documents is known as the World Wide Web. It is assumed that all common web browser will have Macromedia Flash.\u00ae. installed or will support the installation and proper execution of Flash.\u00ae. applications.","Account Owner (creator)\u2014The person who owns, creates or maintains or provided stewardship over a particular session and all options, rights relevant to that session.","Space Creator\u2014The User creates an account to which a \u2018space\u2019 is allocated where other individuals also using a browser can engage in the synchronized or unsynchronized viewing and annotating of images.","Blog\u2014A blog is a website in which journal entries are posted on a regular basis and displayed in reverse chronological order. The term blog is a shortened form of web log or web log. Authoring a blog, maintaining a blog or adding an article to an existing blog is called \u201cblogging\u201d. Individual articles on a blog are called \u201cblog posts,\u201d \u201cposts\u201d or \u201centries\u201d. A person who posts these entries is called a \u201cblogger\u201d. A blog comprises hypertext, images, and links (to other WebPages and to video, audio and other files). Blogs use a conversational documentation style. Often blogs focus on a particular \u201carea of interest\u201d, such as Washington, D.C.'s political goings-on. Some blogs discuss personal experiences.","Threads\u2014Threads in a forum are either flat (posts are listed in chronological order) or threaded (each post is made in reply to a parent post). Sometimes, community members have a choice on how to display threads.","Online Chat\u2014Online chat can refer to any kind of communication over the internet, but is primarily meant to refer to direct 1 on 1 chat or chat rooms, using tools such as instant messenger applications-computer programs, Internet Relay Chat, talkers and possibly MUDs, MUCKs, MUSHes and MOOes.","Room\u2014A Room is a common reference to a \u2018shared space\u2019. A room contains default tools, rules and permissions that are set and controlled by the room administrator.","Space\u2014A shared virtual reference point where as multiple users can interact in real-time upon shared objects.","Stage\u2014A reference coordinate system that informs where media should be displayed. The most typical stage is a two dimensional Cartesian coordinate system where 0,0 is position in the upper right of the display area.","Session State\u2014The state of all objects, GUI tools and controls, and media-layers, at any given time.","Collection\u2014One or more media-layers that have an organizational structure. Typically this is stored as an XML file.","Tools\u2014GUI applications that affect the state of other tools and media-layers.","Tool: scene manager\u2014specific GUI applications that affect the overall display of the stage.","Event\u2014A set of codes that describe the modification of a media-layer.","WIKI\u2014A website that allows the visitors themselves to easily add, remove, and otherwise edit and change available content, and typically without the need for registration.","Network\u2014A computer network is two or more computers connected together using a telecommunication system for the purpose of communicating and sharing resources. Examples include but are not limited to a WAN or LAN connection or an internet, intranet or extranet connection","A sidebar is a panel within a browser such as Windows\u00ae desktop (Windows is a registered trademark of Microsoft Corporation). Sidebars often perform various tasks, such as displaying the time and date and showing the CPU usage.","A whiteboard is a drawing utility, commonly supplied as part of a collaboration framework to allow distributed users to share a common drawing space.","The present invention relates to the field of collaborative computing, and more particularly, to a method to collaborate, interact with and perform multimedia tasks in a shared space within a network including the steps of: logging in from one or more user machines to a shared space in a network from a user application to a host, wherein the shared space is created by interaction of executable codes in the host and the user application and the shared space is described by a session attribute list; loading a media application with a plurality of tools into one or more user machines; inputting graphical content; and displaying the graphical content by other user machines in the shared space in one of synchronous or asynchronous mode including user message exchange including anchoring a sidebar panel to a region of a browser; creating one or more messages in the sidebar panel; displaying graphical content on a whiteboard within a browser; highlighting points of interest within the graphical content; and associating said user messages to the points of interest by one or more lines.","The invention further relates to a method of filtering one or more messages according to one of author of the message, message content, date or time. In one embodiment filtering allows users within the shared space to filter user inputs such as media-layers, user comments, notes, and drawings. In yet another embodiment filtering by a user would temporarily hide all other media-layer content except for the selected user or filtering a selected date range.","The invention further relates to a method of producing a write up on a log or a page illustrating a summary of all inputs into the user space.","The invention further relates to a method for tracking of all user inputs for the purpose of producing the log of all logins, inputs and interactions by all users within the shared space.","The invention further relates to a method of moving highlighted of points of interest within the graphical content in accordance with the intentions of a user.","The invention further relates to a system to collaborate, interact with and perform multimedia task inputs in a shared space within a network including: a host server for communicating with a database and a file storage through a network; one or more user machines with associated user applications for logging onto the host server to join a shared space session with other user machines running user applications, wherein the shared space session is generated by interaction of executable codes in the host and the user applications and the shared space session is described by a session attribute list; a media application with a plurality of tools loaded into the user machines; at least one user provided graphical content installed into the media-layers; and a stage manager to facilitate the display of media-layer updates to other users in the shared space in on of synchronous or asynchronous mode that includes a message exchange including one or more user messages contained in a sidebar panel anchored to a region of a browser of a user machine, whereby at least a portion of the message relates to graphical content displayed on a whiteboard within a browser, and whereby points of interest within the graphical content are highlighted and associated to said message by one or more lines.","The invention further relates to a means for moving highlighted of points of interest within the graphical content in accordance with the intentions of a user of the system.","The invention further relates to one or more message threads based upon a message existing in the sidebar.","The invention further relates to a graphic depicting digital content presented in the form of one of a document, waveform, or multidimensional graphic.","The following description includes the best mode of carrying out the invention. The detailed description is made for the purpose of illustrating the general principles of the invention and should not be taken in a limiting sense. The scope of the invention is determined by reference to the claims. Each part is assigned, even if structurally identical to another part, a unique reference number wherever that part is shown in the drawing figures.","The present invention, relates to the field of collaborative computing, and more particularly, to a system and method for providing a browser-based program to create, and configure a shared space whereby multiple users can access this shared space to perform tasks and interact such as input, modify text and delete images, drawings and other multimedia via media-layers in a real-time synchronous manner. A shared space is defined as a virtual reference point whereas multiple users can interact in real-time upon shared objects. It is a conceptual construct created by processing executable machine codes from a plurality of programs or plug-ins typically using Flash Virtual Machine (VM) or Java VM. A session is defined as the state of all objects, GUI tools and controls, and media-layers, at any given time within the shared space. Each media-layer can serve as a container for shapes and objects as well as other programs such as a text editor, thumbnail viewer, MP3 player, games, etc. The invention also allows which media-layer(s) to display via organization metaphors and filtering criteria. The invention also allows for offline or unsynchronized interaction with objects of a session. Offline events are recorded for later integration with the session.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"figref":["FIG. 1A","FIG. 1A"],"b":["100","140","140","140","141","141","112","100","130","134","170","104","108","106","150","160","104","108","170","170"],"i":["a ","c ","a ","c "]},"Server  also may be configured in a distributed architecture, wherein databases and processors are housed in separate units or locations. Some such servers perform primary processing functions and contain at a minimum, a RAM, a ROM, and a general controller or processor. In such an embodiment, each of these servers is attached to a communications hub or port that serves as a primary communication link with other servers such as web server , or user computers (e.g., , , ) and other related devices. The communications hub or port may have minimal processing capability itself, serving primarily as a communications router establishing a corresponding link  with the web server . A variety of communications protocols may be part of the system, including but not limited to: Ethernet, SAP, SAS.\u2122., ATP, Bluetooth, GSM and TCP\/IP.","Data storage devices such as file storage  may include a hard magnetic disk drive, optical storage units, CD-ROM drives, or flash memory. Data storage devices contain databases such as database  used in processing transactions and\/or calculations in accordance with the present invention, including at least a user subscriber database and a user content database. In one embodiment, database software creates and manages these databases. Conference related calculations and\/or algorithms of the present invention are stored in storage device and executed by the corresponding CPU.","The controller comprises a processor, such as one or more conventional microprocessors and one or more supplementary co-processors such as math co-processors. The processor is in communication with a communication port through which the processor communicates with other devices such as other servers, user terminals or devices. The communication port may include multiple communication channels for simultaneous communication with, for example, other processors, servers or client terminals. As stated, devices in communication with each other need not be continually transmitting to each other. On the contrary, such devices need only transmit to each other as necessary, may actually refrain from exchanging data most of the time, and may require several steps to be performed to establish a communication link between the devices.","The processor also is in communication with a data storage device. The data storage device may comprise an appropriate combination of magnetic, optical and\/or semiconductor memory, and may include, for example, RAM, ROM, flash drive, an optical disc such as a compact disc and\/or a hard disk or drive. The processor and the data storage device each may be, for example, located entirely within a single computer or other computing device; or connected to each other by a communication medium, such as a USB port, serial port cable, a coaxial cable, a Ethernet type cable, a telephone line, a radio frequency transceiver or other similar wireless or wired medium or combination of the foregoing.","The data storage device may store, for example, (i) a program (e.g., computer program code and\/or a computer program product) adapted to direct the processor in accordance with the present invention, and particularly in accordance with the processes described in detail hereinafter; (ii) a database adapted to store information that may be utilized to store information required by the program. The database includes multiple records, each record including fields specific to the present invention such as membership rates, subscribers, sessions, etc.","The program may be stored, for example, in a compressed, an uncompiled and\/or an encrypted format, and may include computer program code. The instructions of the program may be read into a main memory of the processor from a computer-readable medium other than the data storage device, such as from a ROM or from a RAM. While execution of sequences of instructions in the program causes the processor to perform the process steps described herein, hard-wired circuitry may be used in place of, or in combination with, software instructions for implementation of the processes of the present invention. Thus, embodiments of the present invention are not limited to any specific combination of hardware and software.","Suitable computer program code may be provided for performing numerous functions such as alternative steps of invention.

Such a medium may take many forms, including but not limited to, non-volatile media, volatile media, and transmission media. Non-volatile media include, for example, optical or magnetic disks, such as memory. Volatile media include dynamic random access memory (DRAM), which typically constitutes the main memory. Common forms of computer-readable media include, for example, a floppy disk, a flexible disk, hard disk, magnetic tape, any other magnetic medium, a CD-ROM, DVD, any other optical medium, punch cards, paper tape, any other physical medium with patterns of holes, a RAM, a PROM, an EPROM or EEPROM (electronically erasable programmable read-only memory), a FLASH-EEPROM, any other memory chip or cartridge, a carrier wave as described hereinafter, or any other medium from which a computer can read.","Various forms of computer readable media may be involved in carrying one or more sequences of one or more instructions to the processor (or any other processor of a device described herein) for execution. For example, the instructions may initially be borne on a magnetic disk of a remote computer. The remote computer can load the instructions into its dynamic memory and send the instructions over an Ethernet connection, cable line, or even telephone line using a modem. A communications device local to a computing device (or, e.g., a server) can receive the data on the respective communications line and place the data on a system bus for the processor. The system bus carries the data to main memory, from which the processor retrieves and executes the instructions. The instructions received by main memory may optionally be stored in memory either before or after execution by the processor. In addition, instructions may be received via a communication port as electrical, electromagnetic or optical signals, which are exemplary forms of wireless communications or data streams that carry various types of information.","Server  of the present invention may also interact and\/or control one or more user devices or terminals (e.g., , , ).

C is an embodiment of a system C illustrating the process of establishing and operating a session within a user application such as a web browser using various tools in Flash application When a user  logs onto the system C via the internet, LAN or WAN the user  is registered in a shared virtual environment (session ) based on user's credentials and other parameters supplied at log on. In this exemplary example, the flash application is loaded on to the client's machine  by the client's web browser This flash application in turn, loads a communication synchronizer application  that contacts the Host's server synchronization service and requests to be registered with a particular shared space for a session. Once this connection has been established, all communication between the client application and the host sync service happen between these two applications.","Based on user credentials and other parameters supplied, a list of tools and their location(s) on the file storage server(s) is generated. This list is passed to the flash application The flash application then loads a stage manager tool into the buffer memory from the web server This tool creates and manages the stage Once this is done, the flash application then sends a message back to the file storage server via sync application .","One of the tools that are loaded is the stage manager This tool once loaded, looks at the attribute list of the current room for the session. One item on that list is the type of layout to be used on the stage. If any other layout is defined besides \u2018default\u2019, additional tools are downloaded to support the additional features. The stage manager is then provided a list of media-layers to Those media-layers that are listed as \u2018active\u2019 should be currently displayed. Active media-layers and are accessed, loaded and displayed on the stage Once complete, non-active media-layer(s) are downloaded and stored in cache memory in a prescribed order if this option was selected.

C illustrates another embodiment of various components of the Flash application interacting with the user's media-layers  to  on the stage Although there are a number of possible combinations of tools that can be loaded, the one tool that is always loaded is the stage manager . The stage manager tool , among other things, established the coordinate system and layout format that will be populated by media-layers  to . The most typical configuration of the stage  is a two dimensional cardinal system where 0,0 is located on the upper left most side of the application window placed just under the displays for session and user information and controls. These controls are typically displayed at the top of the application window. The list of active media-layers ,  are passed to the stage manager . The media-layers  and  that are tagged as \u2018visible\u2019 are loaded first and then displayed in a stage .","A media-layer is a container that serves as a reference point for media as well as other media-layers. Since media-layers , can be attached to another media-layer , nesting of media-layers can occur. For example, a \u2018parent\u2019 media-layer  contains an image of a human face on it. A \u2018child\u2019 media-layer  is nested on top with a mustache drawn over the face, and another \u2018child\u2019 media-layer  is nested on top with eye glasses drawn. When the parent media-layer's  object is moved or hidden, the two child media-layer's   objects will also move or be hidden, thus maintaining their visual relationship. Each child however can have its visibility setting changed by a parent or another media-layer in the patriarchy. A media-layer from outside the patriarchy cannot modify a media-layer unless such functionality is support by the system's API.","The issue of concurrent users in making an annotation to the media layer is addressed next. Unique to this invention is that ability to share in real-time, near real-time as well as maintaining persistence, the ability to create, modify and delete media-layers and the media elements associated with those media-layers and regulate access to those media-layers. In addition, all tools and User Interface (UI) elements can be controlled at runtime based on commands from the stage manager. As such, not all users logged into a shared space will see that same thing if such modifications are selected. For example, the administrator of the shared space may wish to have all the tools made available to him or her. However, all other users who are of type \u2018guest\u2019 will not see any tools. Those users who are of type=\u2018invited\u2019 may see only a subset of tools that the administrator sees.","When a user is logged into the system, actions that are performed on the media or changes to the media-layer's attributes are tracked and sent to the server. The server maintains a log of the actions and the resulting status of media-layers and their media. The server then repeats the actions to all users who are logged into the same session. When users enter in to a session, they immediately load all active media-layers, media and plug-ins. In this way, every user who is logged into the system has a copy of the media elements and only has to execute the actions that were sent by the server. Since all users can (if allowed by the administrator) have their action communicated back to the server, everyone's actions within the space is reflected on the display of all concurrent users. If the administer allows more then one user access to a media-layer, then only one action may occur at one time within a media-layer. In other words, if a user initiates an action, no other actions can take place until the first action is complete. Concurrent actions can occur on separate media-layers. The administrator can selected that all actions on media-layers are NOT locked. This means that if two users click on the same media-layers media, then whomever's event is sent last, will have said event respected unless the object is deleted or somehow unable to execute the later event.","A whiteboard tools perform the unique function of creating a new media-layer every time a line is started and then stopped. Each line and\/or shape in the whiteboard tool library is treated like an individual object on its own media-layer.","For whatever metaphor employed, the information required to create and support an ordering construct is managed by the stage manager. All rights to what media-layers and tools are loaded, seen and how they function is controlled by the user or administrator who created the space (account). The administrator can pass the rights of a media-layers and tools to anyone(s) or to everyone.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0092","num":"0091"},"figref":"FIG. 1G","b":["004","001","002","001","002","147","149","1100","1100","1","1","001","002","1102","110","001","001","1","30","1","30","0","100","100","100","0","43","30","30","002","40","40","1","001","002","137","138","137","138"],"i":["a ","b ","a ","f "]},"Interacting with media objects in a synchronized mode is discussed next. The stage manager tool of the system insures that all changes in state of a media-layer or actions that are passed to the media-layer from that media-layer's contents, is communicated to the host server to either be recorded, or sent to some or all of the other client machines  and . This is accomplished by the host server maintaining a list of all subscribed client machines  to . As an event is received from a client machine , that event is logged and stored either on the host server and\/or on the database This event is then passed to the rest of the client machines ,  on the subscriber list. The event is then replicated on all client machines , , however, in rare cases, an exception rule can intercept the event and then follow a defined action which may or may not mimic the original event. For example, a client machine  may click on an object in a media-layer  thus making that object interactive. The client  then moves the object  from one location to another, thus creating an event. The changed media-layer attribute  information, in this case Position X, Position Y, Date last modified, to the host server as an event. The host server records this new information and then sends this event information to all subscribed client machines  to .
