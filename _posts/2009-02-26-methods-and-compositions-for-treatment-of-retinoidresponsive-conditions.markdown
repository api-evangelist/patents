Substantially similar analogs of human NGAL or mouse NGAL have at least 80%, or at least 85%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or greater, amino acid sequence identity to human NGAL or mouse NGAL. An NGAL analog can be encoded by a nucleic acid sequence having substantial similarity to nucleic acid sequences encoding human NGAL and mouse NGAL disclosed herein. A nucleic acid sequence having substantial similarity to a nucleic acid sequence encoding human NGAL or mouse NGAL has at least 70%, at least 75%, or at least 85%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or greater, nucleic acid sequence identity to nucleic acid sequences encoding human NGAL or mouse NGAL.","In embodiments of the present invention, a substantially similar nucleic acid sequence is characterized as having a complementary nucleic acid sequence capable of hybridizing to a nucleic acid sequence encoding human NGAL or mouse NGAL under high stringency hybridization conditions.","The term \u201cnucleic acid\u201d as used herein refers to RNA or DNA molecules having more than one nucleotide in any form including single-stranded, double-stranded, oligonucleotide or polynucleotide. The term \u201cnucleotide sequence\u201d is used to refer to the ordering of nucleotides in an oligonucleotide or polynucleotide in a single-stranded form of nucleic acid.","The term \u201ccomplementary\u201d as used herein refers to Watson-Crick base pairing between nucleotides and specifically refers to nucleotides hydrogen bonded to one another with thymine or uracil residues linked to adenine residues by two hydrogen bonds and cytosine and guanine residues linked by three hydrogen bonds. In general, a nucleic acid includes a nucleotide sequence described as having a \u201cpercent complementarity\u201d to a specified second nucleotide sequence. For example, a nucleotide sequence may have 80%, 90%, or 100% complementarity to a specified second nucleotide sequence, indicating that 8 of 10, 9 of 10 or 10 of 10 nucleotides of a sequence are complementary to the specified second nucleotide sequence. For instance, the nucleotide sequence 3\u2032-TCGA-5\u2032 is 100% complementary to the nucleotide sequence 5\u2032-AGCT-3\u2032. Further, the nucleotide sequence 3\u2032-TCGA- is 100% complementary to a region of the nucleotide sequence 5\u2032-TTAGCTGG-3\u2032.","The terms \u201chybridization\u201d and \u201chybridizes\u201d refer to pairing and binding of complementary nucleic acids. Hybridization occurs to varying extents between two nucleic acids depending on factors such as the degree of complementarity of the nucleic acids, the melting temperature, Tm, of the nucleic acids and the stringency of hybridization conditions, as is well known in the art. The term \u201cstringency of hybridization conditions\u201d refers to conditions of temperature, ionic strength, and composition of a hybridization medium with respect to particular common additives such as formamide and Denhardt's solution. Determination of particular hybridization conditions relating to a specified nucleic acid is routine and is well known in the art, for instance, as described in J. Sambrook and D. W. Russell, Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press; 3rd Ed., 2001; and F. M. Ausubel, Ed., Short Protocols in Molecular Biology, Current Protocols; 5th Ed., 2002. High stringency hybridization conditions are those which only allow hybridization of substantially complementary nucleic acids. Typically, nucleic acids having about 85-100% complementarity are considered highly complementary and hybridize under high stringency conditions. Intermediate stringency conditions are exemplified by conditions under which nucleic acids having intermediate complementarity, about 50-84% complementarity, as well as those having a high degree of complementarity, hybridize. In contrast, low stringency hybridization conditions are those in which nucleic acids having a low degree of complementarity hybridize.","The terms \u201cspecific hybridization\u201d and \u201cspecifically hybridizes\u201d refer to hybridization of a particular nucleic acid to a target nucleic acid without substantial hybridization to nucleic acids other than the target nucleic acid in a sample.","Stringency of hybridization and washing conditions depends on several factors, including the Tm of the probe and target and ionic strength of the hybridization and wash conditions, as is well-known to the skilled artisan. Hybridization and conditions to achieve a desired hybridization stringency are described, for example, in Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 2001; and Ausubel, F. et al., (Eds.), Short Protocols in Molecular Biology, Wiley, 2002.","An example of high stringency hybridization conditions is hybridization of nucleic acids over about 100 nucleotides in length in a solution containing 6\u00d7SSC, 5\u00d7Denhardt's solution, 30% formamide, and 100 micrograms\/ml denatured salmon sperm at 37\u00b0 C. overnight followed by washing in a solution of 0.1\u00d7SSC and 0.1% SDS at 60\u00b0 C. for 15 minutes. SSC is 0.15M NaCl\/0.015M Na citrate. Denhardt's solution is 0.02% bovine serum albumin\/0.02% FICOLL\/0.02% polyvinylpyrrolidone. Under highly stringent conditions, SEQ ID No. 3 or SEQ ID No. 4 will hybridize to the complement of substantially identical targets and not to unrelated sequences. In preferred embodiments, under highly stringent conditions, at least the coding region of SEQ ID No. 3 (nucleotides 74-670) or SEQ ID No. 4 (nucleotides 23-625) will hybridize to the complement of substantially identical targets and not to unrelated sequences.","Mutations can be introduced using standard molecular biology techniques, such as site-directed mutagenesis and PCR-mediated mutagenesis. One of skill in the art will recognize that one or more amino acid mutations can be introduced without altering the functional properties of NGAL. For example, one or more amino acid substitutions, additions, or deletions can be made without altering the functional properties of NGAL.","Conservative amino acid substitutions can be made in NGAL proteins to produce NGAL analogs. Conservative amino acid substitutions are art recognized substitutions of one amino acid for another amino acid having similar characteristics. For example, each amino acid may be described as having one or more of the following characteristics: electropositive, electronegative, aliphatic, aromatic, polar, hydrophobic and hydrophilic. A conservative substitution is a substitution of one amino acid having a specified structural or functional characteristic for another amino acid having the same characteristic. Acidic amino acids include aspartate, glutamate; basic amino acids include histidine, lysine, arginine; aliphatic amino acids include isoleucine, leucine and valine; aromatic amino acids include phenylalanine, glycine, tyrosine and tryptophan; polar amino acids include aspartate, glutamate, histidine, lysine, asparagine, glutamine, arginine, serine, threonine and tyrosine; and hydrophobic amino acids include alanine, cysteine, phenylalanine, glycine, isoleucine, leucine, methionine, proline, valine and tryptophan; and conservative substitutions include substitution among amino acids within each group. Amino acids may also be described in terms of relative size, alanine, cysteine, aspartate, glycine, asparagine, proline, threonine, serine, valine, all typically considered to be small.","NGAL analogs can include synthetic amino acid analogs, amino acid derivatives and\/or non-standard amino acids, illustratively including, without limitation, alpha-aminobutyric acid, citrulline, canavanine, cyanoalanine, diaminobutyric acid, diaminopimelic acid, dihydroxy-phenylalanine, djenkolic acid, homoarginine, hydroxyproline, norleucine, norvaline, 3-phosphoserine, homoserine, 5-hydroxytryptophan, 1-methylhistidine, 3-methylhistidine, and ornithine.","Embodiments of methods and compositions of the present invention include NGAL proteins having at least 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% amino acid sequence identity to SEQ ID No. 1 or SEQ ID No.2.","To determine the percent identity of two amino acid sequences or of two nucleic acid sequences, the sequences are aligned for optimal comparison purposes (e.g., gaps can be introduced in the sequence of a first amino acid or nucleic acid sequence for optimal alignment with a second amino acid or nucleic acid sequence). The amino acid residues or nucleotides at corresponding amino acid positions or nucleotide positions are then compared. When a position in the first sequence is occupied by the same amino acid residue or nucleotide as the corresponding position in the second sequence, then the molecules are identical at that position. The percent identity between the two sequences is a function of the number of identical positions shared by the sequences (i.e., % identity=number of identical overlapping positions\/total number of positions\u00d7100%). In one embodiment, the two sequences are the same length.","The determination of percent identity between two sequences can also be accomplished using a mathematical algorithm. A preferred, non limiting example of a mathematical algorithm utilized for the comparison of two sequences is the algorithm of Karlin and Altschul, 1990, PNAS 87:2264 2268, modified as in Karlin and Altschul, 1993, PNAS. 90:5873 5877. Such an algorithm is incorporated into the NBLAST and XBLAST programs of Altschul et al., 1990, J. Mol. Biol. 215:403. BLAST nucleotide searches are performed with the NBLAST nucleotide program parameters set, e.g., for score=100, wordlength=12 to obtain nucleotide sequences homologous to a nucleic acid molecules of the present invention. BLAST protein searches are performed with the XBLAST program parameters set, e.g., to score 50, wordlength=3 to obtain amino acid sequences homologous to a protein molecule of the present invention. To obtain gapped alignments for comparison purposes, Gapped BLAST are utilized as described in Altschul et al., 1997, Nucleic Acids Res. 25:3389 3402. Alternatively, PSI BLAST is used to perform an iterated search which detects distant relationships between molecules (Id.). When utilizing BLAST, Gapped BLAST, and PSI Blast programs, the default parameters of the respective programs (e.g., of XBLAST and NBLAST) are used (see, e.g., the NCBI website). Another preferred, non limiting example of a mathematical algorithm utilized for the comparison of sequences is the algorithm of Myers and Miller, 1988, CABIOS 4:11 17. Such an algorithm is incorporated in the ALIGN program (version 2.0) which is part of the GCG sequence alignment software package. When utilizing the ALIGN program for comparing amino acid sequences, a PAM120 weight residue table, a gap length penalty of 12 and a gap penalty of 4 is used.","The percent identity between two sequences is determined using techniques similar to those described above, with or without allowing gaps.

It is expected that any anionic polymer exhibiting a pH-dependent solubility profile is readily used as an enteric coating in the practice of the present invention to achieve delivery of the active agent to the lower gastrointestinal tract. The selection of the specific enteric coating material depends on properties such as resistance to disintegration in the stomach; impermeability to gastric fluids and active agent diffusion while in the stomach; ability to dissipate at the target intestine site; physical and chemical stability during storage; non-toxicity; and ease of application.","Suitable enteric coating materials illustratively include cellulosic polymers such as hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, methyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose, cellulose acetate, cellulose acetate phthalate, cellulose acetate trimellitate, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose phthalate, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose succinate and carboxymethylcellulose sodium; acrylic acid polymers and copolymers, preferably formed from acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, methyl acrylate, ammonium methylacrylate, ethyl acrylate, methyl methacrylate and\/or ethyl; vinyl polymers and copolymers such as polyvinyl pyrrolidone, polyvinyl acetate, polyvinylacetate phthalate, vinylacetate crotonic acid copolymer, and ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymers; shellac; and combinations thereof.

In particular, a coating composed of an anionic carboxylic acrylic polymer typically contains approximately 10% to 25% by weight of a plasticizer, particularly dibutyl phthalate, polyethylene glycol, triethyl citrate and triacetin. The coating can also contain other coating excipients such as detackifiers, antifoaming agents, lubricants (e.g., magnesium stearate), and stabilizers (e.g. hydroxypropylcellulose, acids or bases) to solubilize or disperse the coating material, and to improve coating performance and the coated product.","Liquid dosage forms for oral administration include one or more active agents and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier formulated as an emulsion, solution, suspension, syrup, or elixir.

DNase I treatment of positive and negative controls (without terminal transferase) were included as assay controls according to manufacturer's instructions. Results were analyzed and quantified by counting positive stained cells per total number of cells in 3 representative fields per well for each of the treatments done in duplicate. Four independent rhNGAL experiments were performed whereas treatment with actin was performed once. Statistical analyses were performed between control and each treatment concentration using ANOVA Two Factor with Replication and considered significant if p<0.05.","As noted above, SEB-1 sebocytes were treated with vehicle as a control, 1 pg\/mL, 10 pg\/mL, 100 pg\/mL, 1 ng\/mL or 10 ng\/mL of purified recombinant human NGAL protein (R&D Systems) or the same concentrations of human actin protein for 24 hours.

Program T-20 with solution T was chosen for future experiments. Efficiency of nucleofection was determined by GFP expression quantified by flow cytometry with mock-nucleofected SEB-1 sebocyte controls.
