title: Interface between a resource manager and a scheduler in a process
abstract: An interface between a resource manager and schedulers in a process executing on a computer system allows the resource manager to manage the resources of the schedulers. The resource manager communicates with the schedulers using the interface to access statistical information from the schedulers. The statistical information describes the amount of use of the resources by the schedulers. The resource manager also communicates with the schedulers to dynamically allocate and reallocate resources among the schedulers in the same or different processes or computer systems in accordance with the statistical information.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Processes executed in a computer system often have tasks with different processing demands and priorities. In order to operate as desired, a process may expend significant overhead to ensure that suitable resources are allocated to tasks based on the demands and priorities of the tasks. This overhead may include the use of one or more schedulers that schedule tasks of the process for execution in the computer system. The execution of tasks with schedulers may vary based on the processing capabilities and\/or processing demands of the computer system at any given time. As a result, resource allocations to schedulers may not be optimal for some processing conditions.","This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.","An interface between a resource manager and schedulers in a process executing on a computer system allows the resource manager to manage the resources of the schedulers. The resource manager communicates with the schedulers using the interface to access statistical information from the schedulers. The statistical information describes the amount of use of the resources by the schedulers. The resource manager also communicates with the schedulers to dynamically allocate and reallocate resources among the schedulers in the same or different processes or computer systems in accordance with the statistical information.","In the following Detailed Description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings, which form a part hereof, and in which is shown by way of illustration specific embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. In this regard, directional terminology, such as \u201ctop,\u201d \u201cbottom,\u201d \u201cfront,\u201d \u201cback,\u201d \u201cleading,\u201d \u201ctrailing,\u201d etc., is used with reference to the orientation of the Figure(s) being described. Because components of embodiments can be positioned in a number of different orientations, the directional terminology is used for purposes of illustration and is in no way limiting. It is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and structural or logical changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention. The following detailed description, therefore, is not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present invention is defined by the appended claims.","It is to be understood that the features of the various exemplary embodiments described herein may be combined with each other, unless specifically noted otherwise.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["22","1","22","12","10","22","22"]},"Runtime environment  represents a runtime mode of operation in a computer system, such as a computer system  shown in  and described in additional detail below, where the computer system is executing instructions. The computer system generates runtime environment  from a runtime platform such as a runtime platform  shown in  and described in additional detail below.","Runtime environment  includes an least one invoked process , an operating system (OS) , a set of hardware threads ()-(M), where M is an integer that is greater than or equal to one and denotes the Mth hardware thread (M), and a resource manager . Runtime environment  allows tasks from process  to be executed, along with tasks from any other processes (e.g., additional processes  shown in ) that co-exist with process , using OS , resource manager , and hardware threads ()-(M). Runtime environment  operates in conjunction with OS  and\/or resource manager  to allow process  to obtain processing and other resources of the computer system (e.g., hardware threads ()-(M), execution contexts, memory, and\/or network bandwidth).","Runtime environment  includes a scheduler function that generates each scheduler . In one embodiment, the scheduler function is implemented as a scheduler application programming interface (API). In other embodiments, the scheduler function may be implemented using other suitable programming constructs. When invoked, the scheduler function creates a scheduler  in process  where the scheduler  operates to schedule tasks of process  for execution by one or more hardware threads ()-(M). Runtime environment  may exploit fine grained concurrency that application or library developers express in their programs (e.g., process ) using accompanying tools that are aware of the facilities that the scheduler function provides.","Process  includes an allocation of processing and other resources that host one or more execution contexts (viz., threads, fibers (i.e., lightweight threads), or child processes). Process  obtains access to the processing and other resources in the computer system such as hardware threads ()-(M), execution contexts, memory, and\/or network bandwidth from OS  and\/or resource manager . Process  causes tasks to be executed using the processing and other resources. In the embodiment of , the processing resources include virtual processors ()-(N) where N is an integer greater than or equal to two and denotes the Nth virtual processor (N).","Process  generates work in tasks of variable length where each task is associated with an execution context in a scheduler . More than one task may be associated with a given execution context. Each task includes a sequence of instructions that perform a unit of work when executed by the computer system. Each execution context forms a thread, fibre (i.e., a lightweight thread), or analogous OS concept such as child process that executes associated tasks on allocated processing resources. Each execution context includes program state and machine state information. Execution contexts may terminate when there are no more tasks left to execute. For each task, runtime environment  and\/or process  either assign the task to a scheduler  to be scheduled for execution or otherwise cause the task to be executed without using a scheduler .","Process  may be configured to operate in one or more computer systems based on any suitable execution model, such as a stack model or an interpreter model, and may represent any suitable type of code, such as an application, a library function, or an operating system service. Process  has a program state and machine state associated with a set of allocated resources that include a defined memory address space. Process  executes autonomously or substantially autonomously from any co-existing processes in runtime environment . Accordingly, process  does not adversely alter the program state of co-existing processes or the machine state of any resources allocated to co-existing processes. Similarly, co-existing processes do not adversely alter the program state of process  or the machine state of any resources allocated to process .","OS  manages processing and other resources of the computer system and provides a set of functions that allow process  and other processes in the computer system to access and use the components. In addition, OS  offers execution contexts to each scheduler  and process  and allocates memory from a memory system, such as a memory system  shown in  and described in additional detail below, to each scheduler  and process . OS  may allocate memory from the memory system in any suitable fixed or variable sizes (e.g., pages of 4 kilobytes (KB) to 19 KB).","Hardware threads  reside in execution cores of a set or one or more processor packages (e.g., processor packages  shown in  and described in additional detail below) of the computer system. Each hardware thread  is configured to execute instructions independently or substantially independently from the other execution cores and includes a machine state. Hardware threads  may be included in a single processor package or may be distributed across multiple processor packages. Each execution core in a processor package may include one or more hardware threads .","Resource manager  allocates processing resources to process  by assigning one or more hardware threads  to process . Resource manager  creates a set of virtual processor roots  and a set of thread proxies  for each scheduler . Each virtual processor root  manages a corresponding virtual processor  in a scheduler , forms an abstraction of a hardware thread , and executes a corresponding thread proxy . Each thread proxy  forms an abstraction of an execution context from OS  and executes a set of execution contexts of a scheduler  on a corresponding virtual processor root . The execution contexts of a scheduler  execute on thread proxies  which in turn execute on execution contexts from OS  on hardware threads . Resource manager  exists separately from OS  in the embodiment of . In other embodiments, resource manager  or some or all of the functions thereof may be included in OS .","Process  implicitly or explicitly causes each scheduler  to be created via the scheduler function provided by runtime environment . An instance of scheduler  may be implicitly created when process  uses APIs available in the computer system or programming language features. In response to the API or programming language features, runtime environment  creates a scheduler  with a default policy. To explicitly create a scheduler , process  may invoke the scheduler function provided by runtime environment  and specifies a policy for the scheduler .","Each scheduler  interacts with OS  and resource manager  to negotiate processing and other resources of the computer system in a manner that is transparent to process . OS  and\/or resource manager  initially allocates memory to each scheduler  in response to requests from one or more memory allocators (not shown) in each scheduler  and may dynamically adjust the memory allocations as described below. OS  and\/or resource manager  also initially allocates hardware threads , execution contexts, and\/or network bandwidth to each scheduler  based on supply and demand and any policies of each scheduler  may dynamically adjust these resources as described below.","In the embodiment shown in , each scheduler  manages the processing resources by creating virtual processors  that form an abstraction of underlying virtual processor roots  and hardware threads . Resource manager  maps the virtual processors  onto virtual processor roots . Resource manager  multiplexes virtual processor roots  onto hardware threads  by mapping each virtual processor root  to a hardware thread . Resource manager  may map more than one virtual processor root  onto a particular hardware thread  but maps only one hardware thread  to each virtual processor root . In other embodiments, resource manager  manages processing resources in other suitable ways to cause instructions of process  to be executed by hardware threads .","Prior to executing tasks, each scheduler  obtains execution contexts  and  from runtime environment , resource manager , and\/or OS . Available virtual processors  locate and execute execution contexts  and  to begin executing tasks. The set of execution contexts in each scheduler  includes a set of execution contexts ()-(N) with respective, associated tasks ()-(N) that are being executed by respective virtual processors ()-(N), a set of zero or more runnable execution contexts , and a set of zero or more blocked (i.e., wait-dependent) execution contexts . Each execution context ,  and  includes state information that indicates whether an execution context ,  and  is executing, runnable (e.g., in response to becoming unblocked or added to scheduler ), or blocked. Execution contexts  that are executing have been attached to a virtual processor  and are currently executing. Execution contexts  that are runnable include an associated task  and are ready to be executed by an available virtual processor . Execution contexts  that are blocked include an associated task  and are waiting for data, a message, or an event that is being generated or will be generated by another execution context , , or .","Each execution context  executing on a virtual processor  may generate, in the course of its execution, additional tasks , which are organized in any suitable way (e.g., added to work queues (not shown in )). Work may be created by using either application programming interfaces (APIs) provided by runtime environment  or programming language features and corresponding tools in one embodiment. When processing resources are available to a scheduler , tasks are assigned to execution contexts  or  that execute them to completion or a blocking point (e.g. waiting for a message or a stolen child task to complete) on virtual processors  before picking up new tasks. An execution context  executing on a virtual processor  may also unblock other execution contexts  by generating data, a message, or an event that will be used by another execution context .","Each task in a scheduler  may be realized (e.g., realized tasks  and ), which indicates that an execution context  or  has been or will be attached to the task and the task is ready to execute. Realized tasks typically include light weight tasks and agents and may be associated with an execution context  or  just before executing or in advance of execution. A task that is not realized is termed unrealized. Unrealized tasks (e.g., tasks ) may be created as child tasks generated by the execution of parent tasks and may be generated by parallel constructs (e.g., parallel, parallel for, begin, and finish). Each scheduler  may be organized into a synchronized collection (e.g., a stack and\/or a queue) for logically independent tasks with execution contexts (i.e., realized tasks) along with a list of workstealing queues for dependent tasks (i.e., unrealized tasks) as illustrated in the embodiment of  described below.","Upon completion, blocking, or other interruption (e.g., explicit yielding or forced preemption) of a task  associated with an execution context  running on a virtual processor , the virtual processor  becomes available to execute another realized task  or unrealized task . A scheduler  searches for a runnable execution context , a realized task , or an unrealized task  to attach to the available virtual processor  for execution in any suitable way. For example, a scheduler  may first search for a runnable execution context  to execute before searching for a realized task  or an unrealized task  to execute. A scheduler  continues attaching execution contexts  to available virtual processors  for execution until all execution contexts  of the scheduler  have been executed. In other embodiments, runnable execution contexts  and realized tasks  may be merged into single concept from the perspective of schedulers .","Each scheduler  includes one or more memory allocators that cause memory to be allocated for internal data structures of scheduler  (not shown) and tasks  of execution contexts  executing on virtual processors . The memory allocators request and receive access to pages of memory from OS  and\/or resource manager  and allocate objects or other suitable portions of memory from the pages to tasks  executing on virtual processors . OS  and\/or resource manager  may provide pages in predefined sizes of memory such as page sizes of 4 kilobytes (KB) to 19 KB to the memory allocators.","The process of dynamically allocating processing resources to schedulers  will now be described with reference to  which is a block diagram illustrating an embodiment of an interface between each scheduler  and resource manager . Upon being created by process , a scheduler  registers with resource manager  as indicated by an arrow  and requests processing resources from resource manager  as indicated by an arrow .","Resource manager  responds to the request by obtaining policy information about the scheduler  from the scheduler  as indicated in by an arrow . The policy information may include minimum and maximum numbers of processing resources desired by the scheduler  and an oversubscription factor of the scheduler . The oversubscription factor indicates a desired number of virtual processor roots  and thread proxies  assigned to each hardware thread  for the scheduler . Resource manager  determines a number of processing resources to provide to the scheduler using the policy information, the number of processing resources available, and the numbers of processing resources assigned to other schedulers .","After determining the number of processing resources to provide to the scheduler , resource manager  adds the processing resources to the scheduler  as indicated by an arrow . To do so, resource manager  provides an array of interfaces to virtual processor roots  and a count of the number of array elements to the scheduler . The interfaces include information about the topology of the hardware threads  corresponding to the virtual processor roots .","Scheduler  creates a virtual processor  for each interface to a virtual processor root  and maps each virtual processor  to a corresponding virtual processor root . Scheduler  activates each virtual processor  by causing a thread proxy  to be initiated on a corresponding virtual processor root  and specifying an execution context  for execution as indicated by an arrow . Once initiated, each thread proxy  dispatches the execution context  specified by the scheduler  to begin execution of the execution context  as indicated by an arrow . Subsequent to each initial execution context  being dispatched, virtual processors  execute tasks as described above until no tasks are found to execute, until being removed from scheduler , or until scheduler  shuts down.","Resource manager  may periodically or continuously monitor the amount of use of processing resources by each scheduler  and add processing resources to or remove processing resources from one or more schedulers . Resource manager  monitors the amount of use of processing resources by a scheduler  by providing a request for statistics to scheduler  as indicated by an arrow . In response to the request, scheduler  provides statistical information that describes the amount of processing performed by the processing resources of scheduler .","In one embodiment, the statistical information includes the number of tasks that have arrived in scheduler  since the last request for statistics, the number of tasks that have been completed by scheduler  since the last request for statistics, and a total number of uncompleted tasks in scheduler . Each virtual processor  maintains a current arrived count and a current completed count to track the numbers of tasks that arrive and complete on each virtual processor . Each virtual processor  also stores the current arrived count as a previous arrived count and the current completed count as a previous completed after each request for statistics. Each virtual processor  may store the counts in virtual processor local storage that is writeable only by a corresponding virtual processor and maintain the counts without resetting any of the counts in respond to the requests. If a virtual processor  is removed from scheduler , scheduler  stores the counts from the removed virtual processor  and includes the stored counts in the statistical information gathered in response to the next request from resource manager .","Scheduler  accesses the counts from each virtual processor . Scheduler  generates the number of tasks that have arrived in scheduler  since the last request for statistics as a sum of all of the current arrived counts minus a sum of all of the previous arrived counts. Scheduler  generates the number of tasks that have been completed by scheduler  since the last request for statistics as a sum of all of the current completed counts minus a sum of all of the previous completed counts. Scheduler  generates the total number of uncompleted tasks in scheduler  as a sum of all of the current arrived counts minus a sum of all of the current completed counts.","In some embodiments, scheduler  may allow external execution contexts from process  to be inducted into scheduler  to execute tasks of the scheduler . In these embodiments, each external execution context also stores current arrived and current completed counts and previous arrived and previous completed counts in thread local storage (not shown) similar to the way each virtual processor  stored the counts in virtual processor local storage as described above. For each request for statistics, scheduler  reads the current arrived and current completed counts and previous arrived and previous completed counts from the thread local storage of each external count and includes these counts into the generated statistics.","External execution contexts may exit the scheduler  at any time. When external execution contexts exit the scheduler , the exiting external execution contexts store corresponding indicators with the corresponding counts in the thread local storages. Each indicator indicates that a corresponding external execution context has exited the scheduler . On each request for statistics, scheduler  detects any indicators that indicate that an external execution context has exited the scheduler  and deletes the counts of all external execution contexts that exited the scheduler  after reading the counts and including the counts in the generated statistics.","In other embodiments, each scheduler  may use other mechanisms to track the amount of processing of the processing resources of scheduler  and\/or may provide other types of statistical information that describes the amount of processing of the processing resources to resource manager .","Resource manager  may adjust the number of processing resources in a scheduler by adding processing resources to or removing processing resources from the scheduler  in accordance with the statistical information from the scheduler , the combined statistical information from all schedulers , the policy information of the scheduler , and\/or the policy information of the remaining schedulers  as indicated by an arrow . Resource manager  may attempt to balance the amounts of processing performed by each scheduler  by allocating and reallocating processing resources between schedulers . For example, resource manager  may add one or more processing resources to one or more schedulers  with the most tasks to execute, the highest rates of arrived tasks, or the lowest rates of completed tasks. Likewise, resource manager  may remove one or more processing resources from one or more schedulers  with the fewest tasks to execute, the lowest rates of arrived tasks, or the highest rates of completed tasks.","Resource manager  adds processing resources to a scheduler  by providing an array of interfaces to virtual processor roots  and a count of the number of array elements to the scheduler  as described above. Scheduler  creates a virtual processor  for each interface to a virtual processor root , maps each virtual processor  to a corresponding virtual processor root , and activates each virtual processor  as described above.","Resource manager  removes processing resources from a scheduler  by providing an array of interfaces to virtual processor roots  that are to be removed and a count of the number of array elements to the scheduler . Scheduler  causes execution contexts  that are executing on the virtual processors  that correspond to the virtual processor roots  that are to be removed to exit and removes the virtual processors . The execution contexts  that exited may block and resume execution on other virtual processors  in scheduler . Resource manager  may reallocate the removed processing resources to other schedulers .","A scheduler  may shut down at any time as indicated by an arrow . The scheduler  notifies resource manager  of the shut down, and resource manager  reclaims all processing resources allocated to the scheduler . Resource manager  may reallocate the processing resources to other schedulers .","Resource manager  may also dynamically allocate or manage the allocation of other resources including execution contexts, memory, and network bandwidth to schedulers . As with processing resources, resource manager  may make resource allocation decisions based on policy information from one or more schedulers . Resource manager  provides or causes the resources to be provided to schedulers  and may periodically or continuously monitor the use of these resources by each scheduler .","For execution context allocations, OS , resource manager  and\/or scheduler  may track a number of execution contexts allocated to a scheduler . Resource manager  may use the statistics described above for processing resources to determine an amount of use of the execution contexts and decide whether to adjust (i.e., increase or decrease) the number of execution contexts in a scheduler  based on the amount of use.","For memory allocations, OS , resource manager  and\/or scheduler  may track an amount of memory allocated to process  and\/or each scheduler  in process . Resource manager  may use the statistics described above for processing resources to determine an amount of use of the memory and decide whether to adjust (i.e., increase or decrease) the amount of memory allocated to each scheduler  based on the amount of use.","For network bandwidth allocations, OS , resource manager  and\/or scheduler  may track an amount of network bandwidth used by process  and\/or each scheduler  in process . Resource manager  may use the statistics described above for processing resources to determine an amount of network bandwidth use and decide whether to adjust (i.e., increase or decrease) the amount of network bandwidth allocated to each scheduler  based on the amount of use.","Any set or subset of schedulers  in process  may be configured into one or more scheduler bundles  in resource manager  as shown in the embodiments of .  are block diagrams illustrating embodiments of a scheduler bundle  with virtual processor roots ()-(R) and thread proxies ()-(R) in runtime environment  where R is an integer that is greater than or equal to one. In the embodiments of , each thread proxy  provides quanta of execution of a corresponding virtual processor root  to execution contexts  on corresponding virtual processors  across a set of schedulers ()-(Q) of the scheduler bundle , where Q is an integer that is greater than or equal to one.","In the embodiment of , runtime environment  includes a scheduler bundle function that generates scheduler bundle  with virtual processor roots  and thread proxies  in addition to the scheduler function that generates schedulers  for inclusion in scheduler bundle . In one embodiment, the scheduler bundle function is implemented as an application programming interface (API). In other embodiments, the scheduler bundle function may be implemented using other suitable programming constructs. When invoked, the scheduler bundle function creates scheduler bundle  to manage one or more schedulers  in scheduler bundle . The scheduler function creates a scheduler  in scheduler bundle , where each scheduler  operates to schedule execution contexts of process  for execution on virtual processors  of the scheduler . The execution contexts execute on thread proxies  which in turn execute on execution contexts on hardware threads .","Resource manager  includes the scheduler bundle function in one embodiment and thus, creates and manages scheduler bundle , a set of virtual processor roots ()-(R), where each virtual processor root  manages a corresponding set of virtual processors  across the schedulers  in scheduler bundle , and a set of thread proxies ()-(R), where each thread proxy  executes a corresponding set of scheduler execution contexts across the schedulers  in scheduler bundle  on a corresponding virtual processor root . Resource manager  causes thread proxies ()-(R) on corresponding virtual processor roots ()-(R) to be executed on underlying execution contexts obtained from the OS on hardware threads .","Process  implicitly or explicitly causes scheduler bundle , virtual processor roots ()-(R), thread proxies ()-(R), and schedulers ()-(Q) to be created via the corresponding functions provided by runtime environment  and\/or resource manager . Scheduler bundle , virtual processor roots , thread proxies , and schedulers  may be implicitly created when process  uses APIs available in the computer system or programming language features. In response to the API or programming language features, runtime environment  creates scheduler bundle , virtual processor roots , thread proxies , and schedulers  that inherit the policies of scheduler bundle . To explicitly create scheduler bundle , virtual processor roots , thread proxies , and schedulers , process  may invoke the scheduler bundle and scheduler functions provided by runtime environment  and specify one or more policies for scheduler bundle , virtual processor roots , thread proxies , and schedulers .","Scheduler bundle  manages virtual processor roots  and corresponding thread proxies  to share virtual processor roots  and thread proxies  among all schedulers ()-(Q) in scheduler bundle . Scheduler bundle  may share virtual processor roots  and thread proxies  among schedulers ()-(Q) cooperatively, preemptively, or with another suitable type of time slicing. As part of creating scheduler bundle , resource manager  allocates virtual processor roots  and thread proxies  to scheduler bundle  based on supply and demand and any policies of scheduler bundle . In one embodiment, scheduler bundle  creates each scheduler ()-(Q). In other embodiments, one or more of scheduler ()-(Q) that are external to scheduler bundle  may invoke a programming API or other suitable programming construct to attach to scheduler bundle .","In one embodiment, process  adds each scheduler ()-(Q) to scheduler bundle  with the same set of scheduler policies. In another embodiment, process  adds each scheduler ()-(Q) to scheduler bundle  with a different set of scheduler policies. Each scheduler  receives virtual processors ()-(R) where each virtual processor  forms an abstraction of underlying virtual processor roots  and hardware threads .

Each thread proxy  switches between execution of execution contexts  on virtual processors  on the corresponding virtual processor root . Each thread proxy  causes a single execution context  to be executed at any given time but periodically performs context switches between execution of execution contexts  to execute each of the set of execution contexts  on virtual processors  that correspond to the virtual processor root  of the thread proxy . Each thread proxy  provides a quantum of execution upon dispatching an execution context  of a scheduler . The quantum of execution may be expressed in time (e.g., 50 ms), by a number of tasks to be executed, or by any other suitable metric. The quantum of execution may be the same or different for each dispatched execution context .","As shown in , thread proxy () switches between execution of execution contexts ()()-(Q)() from respective schedulers ()-(Q), thread proxy () switches between execution of execution contexts ()()-(Q)() from respective schedulers ()-(Q), and so on. As shown by an arrow , for example, thread proxy () dispatches execution context ()() for a quantum of execution on virtual processor root () and, once execution context ()() detects that quantum has expired and yields back to thread proxy (), thread proxy () dispatches execution context ()() for a quantum of execution on virtual processor root (). Thread proxy () continues the process of dispatching a next one of the set of execution contexts ()()-(Q)() each time a current one of the set of execution context ()()-(Q)() yields back to thread proxy ().
