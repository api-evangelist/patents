There are the following three Embodiments (Embodiments A to C).","A polyester resin for a toner, obtained by polycondensing a carboxylic acid component and an alcohol component, wherein the carboxylic acid component and\/or the alcohol component contains an aromatic compound represented by the formula (Ia):",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0038"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00005","num":"00005"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00005","he":"27.35mm","wi":"69.85mm","file":"US08614042-20131224-C00005.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"wherein Ris a hydrogen atom, a hydroxyl group, or a methoxy group; and Xis a hydrogen atom, an aldehyde group, an allyl group, a vinyl group, a methoxy group, or a hydroxyl group or carboxyl group which may have a linking group.","A polyester resin for a toner, obtained by polycondensing","a reaction product (reaction product (i)) of one or more aromatic compounds themselves, represented by the formula (Ib):",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0042"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00006","num":"00006"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00006","he":"27.77mm","wi":"69.85mm","file":"US08614042-20131224-C00006.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"wherein Ris a hydrogen atom, a hydroxyl group, or a methoxy group; and Xis a hydroxyl group or carboxyl group which may have a linking group, and","at least one of the carboxylic acid component and the alcohol component.","A polyester resin for a toner obtained by polycondensing:","a reaction product (reaction product (ii)) obtained by reacting an aromatic compound represented by the formula (Ic):",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0047"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00007","num":"00007"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00007","he":"27.35mm","wi":"69.85mm","file":"US08614042-20131224-C00007.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"wherein Ris a hydrogen atom, a hydroxyl group or a methoxy group; and Xis an unsaturated hydrocarbon group which may have a hydroxyl group or carboxyl group, and a carboxylic acid having an unsaturated reactive group,","a carboxylic acid component, and","an alcohol component.","The polyester resin for a toner of the present invention has excellent initial rise in triboelectric charging, while maintaining low-temperature fixing ability and storage property of the toner. Though the details of the reasons therefor are unclear, it is presumably as described below. Since the aromatic compound used in the present invention has an aromatic ring, in a case where the compound is used as a monomer for a polyester, a glass transition temperature can be increased, while having a low softening point. Besides, as compared with conventional phthalic acid and isophthalic acid, since a methoxy group having an electron donating property is bound an aromatic ring at a position adjacent to a hydroxyl group, a monomer having a phenolic hydroxyl group has a higher pKa (isoelectric point), so that electrons are stored in the aromatic ring, thereby increasing electron density in the aromatic ring, whereby consequently initial rise in triboelectric charging is improved. The number of the methoxy groups on the carbon atom positioned adjacent to the carbon atom to which a hydroxyl group is bound may be at least one to improve initial rise in triboelectric charging of the toner, or the number may be two.","First, the polyester resin of Embodiment A will be described.","A major feature of Embodiment A resides in that the resin is obtained by polycondensing a carboxylic acid component and an alcohol component, wherein the carboxylic acid component and\/or the alcohol component contains an aromatic compound represented by the formula (Ia):",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0053"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00008","num":"00008"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00008","he":"27.35mm","wi":"69.85mm","file":"US08614042-20131224-C00008.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"wherein Ris a hydrogen atom, a hydroxyl group, or a methoxy group; and Xis a hydrogen atom, an aldehyde group, an allyl group, a vinyl group, a methoxy group, or a hydroxyl group or carboxyl group which may have a linking group.","In X, the linking group that the hydroxyl group or carboxyl group may have is preferably a divalent hydrocarbon group having an unsaturated bond, and desirably a divalent hydrocarbon group having preferably 2 to 4 carbon atoms, and more preferably 2 or 3 carbon atoms. In a case of without having a linking group, Xwould be a hydroxyl group or a carboxyl group. Specific examples of more preferred Xinclude a group represented by \u2014CH\u2550CH\u2014COOH or \u2014CH\u2550CH\u2014CHOH. Here, the carboxyl group may be an alkyl(1 to 3 carbon atoms) ester, provided that when Xis a carboxyl group, namely a carboxyl group without a linking group, Rpreferably is a methoxy group.","As preferable combinations of Rand X, in a case where Ris a hydrogen atom, it is preferable that Xis an aldehyde group, an allyl group, a vinyl group, a methoxy group, or a hydroxyl group or carboxyl group which may have a linking group. In a case where Ris a hydroxyl group, it is preferable that Xis a methoxy group, or a hydroxyl group or carboxyl group which may have a linking group. Also, in a case where Ris a methoxy group, it is preferable that Xis a hydrogen atom, an aldehyde group, or a hydroxyl group or carboxyl group which may have a linking group.","The aromatic compound has a molecular weight of preferably 1,000 or less, more preferably 800 or less, even more preferably 400 or less, and still even more preferably 300 or less, from the viewpoint of reactivity in the polycondensation. In addition, the lower limit is 124, which is the case where both of Rand Xare hydrogen atoms.","The aromatic compound represented by the formula (Ia) acts as any component of the carboxylic acid component and the alcohol component during the polycondensation, depending on the kinds of the functional group, as a raw material monomer for a polyester. A hydroxycarboxylic acid is polycondensed mainly as a carboxylic acid component; therefore, in the present invention, for the sake of convenience, in a case where the aromatic compound is a hydroxycarboxylic acid in which Xhas a carboxyl group, the aromatic compound is regarded as a carboxylic acid component, and in a case where the aromatic compound is an alcohol in which Xhas no carboxyl groups, the aromatic compound is regarded as an alcohol component, to be used in the calculation of the content or the molar ratio. In general, the reactivity of a hydroxyl group bound directly to an aromatic ring is low.

A specific example of the method (C) includes a method including the steps of thermally melting raw materials containing a resin binder, dispersing the raw materials in an aqueous medium without containing an organic solvent, while maintaining a molten state of the resin binder, and thereafter drying the dispersion (see JP-A-2001-235904), and the like.\n","The step (1) is a step of introducing an aqueous medium to a mixed solution prepared by dissolving or dispersing raw materials containing a resin binder in an organic solvent, and thereafter removing the organic solvent from the mixture, to provide an aqueous dispersion of primary particles containing a resin binder.","The organic solvent includes alcoholic solvents such as ethanol, isopropanol, and isobutanol; ketone-based solvents such as acetone, 2-butanone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone, and diethyl ketone; ether-based solvents such as dibutyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, and dioxane; ethyl acetate.","It is preferable that the organic solvent is used in an amount of from 100 to 1,000 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight of the resin binder. Water and further a neutralizing agent, as occasion demands, are mixed with the mixed solution while stirring, and thereafter the organic solvent is removed from the resulting dispersion, whereby an aqueous dispersion of primary particles of a self-dispersible resin can be obtained.","The aqueous medium is used in an amount of preferably from 100 to 1,000 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight of the organic solvent. Here, the aqueous medium usable in the process (1) and a step (1\u2032) described later may contain a solvent such as an organic solvent, and contains water in an amount of preferably 50% by weight or more, preferably 70% by weight or more, more preferably from 90% by weight or more, and even more preferably 99% by weight or more.","Upon stirring the mixture, a generally employed mixing agitator such as an anchor blade can be used.","The neutralizing agent includes an alkali metal of lithium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, or the like; and organic bases such as ammonia, trimethylamine, ethylamine, diethylamine, triethylamine, triethanolamine, and tributylamine.","In addition, the dispersion of primary particles containing a resin binder can be made into a dispersion, without using an organic solvent, as in the step (1\u2032).","The step (1\u2032) is a step of forming primary particles containing a resin binder in an aqueous medium in the presence of a nonionic surfactant.","According to the process of the step (1\u2032), a resin binder can be formed into fine particles even when water is used alone without using substantially any organic solvents.","In the step (1\u2032), a resin binder containing a polycondensation resin and a nonionic surfactant are mixed, whereby a dispersion can also be prepared without using an organic solvent. In this step, a viscosity of the mixture is lowered, so that a resin binder can be formed into fine particles. This is due to the fact that a nonionic surfactant is compatible to a resin binder and a viscosity of the mixture is lowered, which results in an apparent lowering of a softening point of the resin. Utilizing this phenomenon, an apparent softening point of a resin binder that is compatible with a nonionic surfactant can be lowered to a temperature of a boiling point of water or lower, so that a dispersion prepared by dispersing a resin binder can be obtained by adding water dropwise under a normal pressure, even with a resin binder having a melting point or softening point of 100\u00b0 C. or more for the resin alone. In this method, at least water and a nonionic surfactant would be needed, so that the method can be applied to a resin insoluble to an organic solvent, and that loads on the facilities for collecting an organic solvent and maintaining operating environments are unnecessary, and a specialized apparatus that is to be needed when utilizing a mechanical means is also unnecessary, thereby having an advantage that a resin dispersion can be produced economically.","The nonionic surfactant usable in the step (1\u2032) includes, for example, polyoxyethylene alkylaryl ethers or polyoxyethylene alkyl ethers such as polyoxyethylene nonylphenyl ether, polyoxyethylene oleyl ether, and polyoxyethylene lauryl ether; polyoxyethylene sorbitan esters such as polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate and polyoxyethylene sorbitan monostearate; polyoxyethylene fatty esters such as polyethylene glycol monolaurate, polyethylene glycol monostearate, polyethylene glycol monooleate; oxyethylene\/oxypropylene block copolymers, and the like. In addition, the nonionic surfactant may be used together with an anionic surfactant or a cationic surfactant.","It is preferable to select a nonionic surfactant which has excellent compatibility with a resin binder. In order to obtain a stable dispersion of a resin binder, the nonionic surfactant has an HLB of preferably from 12 to 20, and it is more preferable to use two or more members of nonionic surfactants having different HLB, depending on the members of the resin binders. For example, in a case where a resin has a high hydrophilicity, at least one member of a nonionic surfactant having an HLB of from 12 to 18 may be used. In a case of a resin having high hydrophobicity, it is preferable that a nonionic surfactant having a low HLB, for example, one having an HLB of 7 to 10 or so and a nonionic surfactant having a high HLB, for example, one having an HLB of 14 to 20, are used together, thereby adjusting a weighted average of HLB of both the nonionic surfactants to 12 to 20. In this case, it is presumed that primarily a nonionic surfactant having an HLB of 7 to 10 or so can be made compatible with the resin, and that a nonionic surfactant having a high HLB can serve to stabilize the dispersion of the resin in water.","In addition, in a case where a colorant is used, it is preferable that a nonionic surfactant is adsorbed to the colorant. By adjusting the HLB of the nonionic surfactant to the range mentioned above, the nonionic surfactant is likely to adsorb to the surface of the colorant, whereby the nonionic surfactant can be stably present in the resin binder.","When a resin binder is formed into fine particles in water under a normal pressure, the nonionic surfactant has a cloud point of preferably from 70\u00b0 to 105\u00b0 C., and more preferably from 80\u00b0 to 105\u00b0 C.","The nonionic surfactant is used in an amount of preferably 5 parts by weight or more, based on 100 parts by weight of the resin binder from the viewpoint of lowering a melting point of the resin binder, and the nonionic surfactant is used in an amount of preferably 80 parts by weight or less, from the viewpoint of controlling the nonionic surfactant remaining in the toner. Therefore, the nonionic surfactant is used in an amount of preferably from 5 to 80 parts by weight, more preferably from 10 to 70 parts by weight, and even more preferably from 20 to 60 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight of the resin binder, from the viewpoint of satisfying both of these.","In the step (1\u2032), upon the formation of primary particles containing a resin binder in an aqueous medium in the presence of a nonionic surfactant, it is desirable that the temperature inside the system is kept within a temperature calculated from a cloud point of the nonionic surfactant plus or minus 10\u00b0 C., preferably plus or minus 8\u00b0 C., more preferably plus or minus 5\u00b0 C., from the viewpoint of dispersibility of the nonionic surfactant and prevention of the lowering of dispersion efficiency.","In the step (1\u2032), for example, it is preferable that an aqueous medium (preferably deionized water or distilled water) is added dropwise to a system in a state where a mixture of a resin binder and a nonionic surfactant is stirred and homogeneously mixed. In a case where a colorant is used, it is preferable that a resin binder containing a colorant being made compatible with a nonionic surfactant does not separate from water.","The aqueous medium in the step (1\u2032) is used in an amount of preferably from 100 to 3,000 parts by weight, more preferably from 400 to 3,000 parts by weight, and even more preferably from 800 to 3,000 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight of the resin binder, from the viewpoint of obtaining homogeneous aggregated particles in the subsequent steps.","The particle size of the primary particles containing a resin binder containing a polycondensation resin can be controlled by an amount of the nonionic surfactant, an extent of stirring, a rate of adding water, or the like. In the step (1\u2032), the rate of adding an aqueous medium to a mixture containing at least a resin binder and a nonionic surfactant is preferably from 0.1 to 50 g\/min, more preferably from 0.5 to 40 g\/min, and even more preferably from 1 to 30 g\/min, per 100 g of the mixture, from the viewpoint of obtaining homogenous primary particles.","In a case where a resin binder has an acidic group such as a carboxyl group or a sulfonate group, water may be added after a part or all of the resin binder is neutralized, or while neutralizing. In a case where a resin binder having an acidic group is used, in addition to the factors of the nonionic surfactant, self-emulsifiability would be a controlling factor for the particle size of the primary particles.","A dispersant can be used for the purposes of lowering a melt viscosity and a melting point of the resin binder, and improving dispersibility of the formed primary particles. The dispersant includes, for example, water-soluble polymers such as polyvinyl alcohol, methyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose, sodium polyacrylate, and sodium polymethacrylate; anionic surfactants such as sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate, sodium octadecyl sulfate, sodium oleate, sodium laurate, and potassium stearate; cationic surfactants such as laurylamine acetate, stearylamine acetate, and lauryl trimethylammonium chloride; amphoteric surfactants such as lauryl dimethylamine oxide; and inorganic salts such as tricalcium phosphate, aluminum hydroxide, calcium sulfate, calcium carbonate, and barium carbonate.

The solid content includes non-volatile components such as a resin and a nonionic surfactant.","The primary particles have an average particle size of preferably from 0.05 to 3 \u03bcm, more preferably from 0.05 to 1 and even more preferably from 0.05 to 0.8 \u03bcm, from the viewpoint of homogeneously aggregating the primary particles in the subsequent steps. In the present invention, the average particle size of the primary particles refers to a volume-median particle size (D), which can be measured with a laser diffraction particle size analyzer or the like.","Subsequently, the step of aggregating and unifying the primary particles obtained in the step (1) or the step (1\u2032) (step (2)) will be explained.","In the step (2), the solid content of the system in the aggregating step of aggregating the primary particles obtained in the step (1) or the step (1\u2032) can be adjusted by adding water to a dispersion of a resin binder, and the solid content is preferably from 5 to 50% by weight, more preferably from 5 to 30% by weight, and even more preferably from 5 to 20% by weight, in order to cause homogeneous aggregation.","The pH inside the system in the aggregating step is preferably from 2 to 10, more preferably from 2 to 9, and even more preferably from 3 to 8, from the viewpoint of satisfying both dispersion stability of a mixed solution and aggregating property of the fine particles made of a resin binder or the like.","It is preferable that the temperature inside the system in the aggregating step is a temperature equal to or higher than a temperature calculated from a softening point of a resin binder minus 70\u00b0 C. or more and equal to or lower than a softening point, from the same viewpoint.","In addition, an additive such as a colorant or a charge control agent may be previously mixed with a resin binder upon the preparation of primary particles, or each additive may be separately dispersed in a dispersion medium such as water to prepare a dispersion, and the dispersion is mixed with primary particles, and subjected to the aggregating step. In a case where an additive is previously mixed with a resin binder upon the preparation of primary particles, it is preferable that the resin binder and the additive are previously melt-kneaded. In the melt-kneading, it is preferable to use an open roller-type twin-screw kneader. The open-roller twin-screw kneader is a kneader containing two rollers arranged in parallel closely to each other, wherein a heating function or a cooling function can be provided by passing a heating medium through each roller. Therefore, the open-roller type twin-screw kneader contains a melt-kneading part that is open, and also is equipped with a heat roller and a cooling roller, so that the open-roller type twin-screw kneader can easily dissipate the kneading heat generated during the melt-kneading, which is different from twin-screw extruders conventionally used.","In the aggregating step, in order to effectively carry out the aggregation, an aggregating agent can be added. As the aggregating agent, a cationic surfactant in the form of a quaternary salt, polyethyleneimine, or the like may be used as an organic aggregating agent, and an inorganic metal salt, a divalent or higher polyvalent metal complex or the like may be used as an inorganic aggregating agent. The inorganic metal salt includes, for example, metal salts such as sodium sulfate, sodium chloride, calcium chloride, calcium nitrate, barium chloride, magnesium chloride, zinc chloride, aluminum chloride, and aluminum sulfate; and inorganic metal salt polymers such as poly(aluminum chloride), poly(aluminum hydroxide), and poly(calcium sulfide).","The amount of the aggregating agent used is preferably 30 parts by weight or less, more preferably 20 parts by weight or less, and even more preferably 10 parts by weight or less, based on 100 parts by weight of the resin binder, from the viewpoint of the environmental resistance of the toner.","Subsequently, the aggregated particles containing at least a resin binder obtained in the above-mentioned aggregating step are heated to unify (unifying step).","The temperature inside the system in the unifying step is preferably equal to or higher than a temperature calculated from the softening point of the resin binder \u2212(minus) 50\u00b0 C. and equal to or lower than a temperature calculated from the softening point of the resin binder +(plus) 10\u00b0 C., more preferably equal to or higher than the softening point of the resin binder minus 45\u00b0 C. and equal to or lower than a temperature calculated from the softening point plus 10\u00b0 C., and even more preferably equal to or higher than the softening point of the resin binder minus 40\u00b0 C. and equal to or lower than a temperature calculated from the softening point of the resin binder plus 10\u00b0 C., from the viewpoint of controlling particle sizes, particle size distribution, and shapes of the intended toner, and fusibility of the aggregate particles. In addition, it is preferable that the stirring rate is a rate at which the aggregate particles are not precipitated. In the present invention, in a case where two or more kinds of resins are mixed and used as a resin binder, a weighted average of softening points of mixed resins is regarded as a softening point of the resin binder.","The unified particles obtained in the step (2) are subjected through the steps such as liquid-solid separation step such as filtration, washing step, and drying step, whereby a toner can be obtained.","In the washing step, it is preferable that an acid is used for removing metal ions on the toner surface, in order to secure satisfactory triboelectric charging properties and reliability as a toner.
