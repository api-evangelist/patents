{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The present invention relates generally to billing services and more particularly to billing services that are provided as web services in distributed network environments.","Commercial service providers have made available to individual computing users a plethora of computing applications designed to perform a wide variety of tasks, referred to collectively as commercial services. In some instances, these commercial services may be made available to users without charge. However, many commercial service providers charge users for using their commercial services, or have a desire to do so. Commercial services made available by commercial service providers that charge for their usage are referred to herein as \u201cbillable services\u201d.","Billing systems are designed to perform a variety of billing functions. These billing systems are commonly used by commercial service providers to, for example, perform billing functions that facilitate the charging of users for the use of billable services. Billing systems are typically adapted to manage billing account information, charges, and billing account balances relating to the use of a billable service. These billing systems are also typically adapted to generate and present invoices (i.e. \u201cbills\u201d) to users of the billable service. Since the billing functions of a billing system can themselves be made available for use (e.g. to commercial service providers in the above scenario), these billing functions may be referred to collectively as a \u201cbilling service\u201d.","Different types of services may be classified as billing services. For example, a billing account service and a rating service may each be considered as a billing service. A billing account service will typically provide various billing functions related to the management of user and billing account information, the calculation of billing account charges, the maintenance of invoice information, and the generation and presentation of invoices to users of a billable service, for example. On the other hand, a rating service will typically provide various other billing functions, including receiving incoming messages related to events that may be subject to billing, determining what billing rate should be charged for those events, calculating corresponding usage charges, and converting those events into chargeable billing events, for example. A billing rate defines the cost of a billable service (i.e. the commercial service being made available by a commercial service provider for which usage is charged) under a specific set of circumstances, and indicates how much a user should be charged per unit consumption of that billable service. The actual billing functions provided by different billing services can differ from service to service, and any given billing account service or rating service may not provide all of the respective billing functions specified above, which are provided only as examples.","The popularity of conducting transactions over the Internet has led to an increasing demand for businesses to integrate their computing systems, applications and services, with those of other businesses. These applications are often implemented using proprietary software written in differing programming languages. One known solution for integrating heterogeneous Internet-based applications or services introduced the concept of a \u201cweb service\u201d. A web service is a well-defined, self-contained component that encapsulates specific functionality, and makes that functionality available to other computing applications over the Internet (or an Intranet or other network) by invocation (also referred to herein as a \u201cweb service invocation\u201d) using a protocol. One example of a protocol that may be used in this context is the Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP), which may be used by Internet-based application servers (also known as web servers), to provide web services. SOAP is a protocol that is often used in the exchange of information in decentralized, distributed network environments.","Recent developments in web services have imposed a greater need for software applications that are both modular and fit for use in distributed computing environments. Typical traditional billing systems, however, have not been designed in a manner that would allow them to be easily modified for providing web services.","Accordingly, there is a need for a means that would permit a billing service to be provided as a web service in distributed network environments.","The present invention relates to web service interfaces used to provide billing services in distributed network environments.","According to a first aspect of the invention, there is provided a web service interface defined for a billing service, wherein a plurality of first billing functions is provided by the billing service to computing applications residing on one or more computing devices in a distributed network, and wherein: the web service interface is adapted for coupling to a billing engine; the billing engine resides on a computing device in the distributed network and is adapted to perform the plurality of first billing functions; the web service interface comprises a plurality of application programming interfaces; each of the application programming interfaces is associated with a first billing function; and each of the application programming interfaces can be implemented such that the first billing function associated therewith is performed after a web service invocation that commands performance of the first billing function is received by the web service interface; whereby the web service interface is used to provide the billing service as a web service that can be invoked by the computing applications in the distributed network.","According to another aspect of the invention, there is provided a software system for use in designing a web service interface for a billing service, wherein a plurality of first billing functions is provided by the billing service to computing applications residing on one or more computing devices in a distributed network, the software system comprising: a web service interface defined for a billing service, wherein the web service interface is adapted for coupling to a billing engine, wherein the billing engine resides on a computing device in the distributed network and is adapted to perform the plurality of first billing functions, wherein the web service interface comprises a plurality of application programming interfaces,\n\n","Software components of the software system may be stored on computer-readable media.","The present invention is directed to a web service interface used to provide a billing service as a web service that can be invoked by computing applications (e.g. those that provide commercial services) in distributed network environments. The web service interface comprises a set of application programming interfaces, where each application programming interface is associated with a billing function provided by the billing service.","In an embodiment of the invention, the web service interface is defined using an object-oriented programming language. In an embodiment of the invention, there is also provided a set of object classes that define objects for storing data utilized by a billing engine and for communicating the data to the billing engine through at least one implemented application programming interface of the web service interface.","By providing billing services as web services, the billing services can themselves be hosted, and accordingly, commercial service providers can be charged for their use. The present invention may also facilitate the offering of different implementations of billing services as web services, which can be subsequently discovered by service requesters in a Universal Description, Discovery and Integration (UDDI) registry. This may promote the sharing of computing resources within and among enterprises over the Internet.","The present invention is directed to a web service interface used to provide billing services as web services that can be invoked by computing applications in distributed network environments. In one embodiment of the invention, a web service interface is provided for each of two billing services: a billing account service and a rating service. The web service interfaces are defined using an object-oriented language, and different implementations of different billing systems can be designed by extending the web service interfaces.","Referring to , a schematic diagram illustrating a typical flow of messages between services in a distributed network and components of a billing system in an embodiment of the present invention is shown generally as .","Billing system  provides different billing functions (referred to herein collectively as a billing service) as a web service that can be invoked by computing applications [not shown], which provide commercial services made available by commercial service providers. Accordingly, billing system  can be utilized by a commercial service provider to bill users for use of the commercial services that the commercial service provider makes available. As indicated earlier, commercial services made available by commercial service providers that charge for their usage can be referred to as billable services. The types of charges that may arise from usage of a billable service may include, for example:\n\n","While the billing functions of billing system  are provided as a web service in accordance with the present invention, some of the billable services may themselves be services that are being provided as web services. The computing applications that provide billable services reside on computing devices in a distributed network to which billing system  is coupled.","Billing system  may operate behind a firewall [not shown] for security reasons.","Billing system  makes available two billing services: a billing account service  and a rating service . Each provides a set of billing functions as a web service to commercial service providers. Billing account service  maintains user and billing account information associated with a billable service. Billing account service  also maintains invoice information (i.e. bill information), including invoice charges, invoice line details, and payment status. Furthermore, billing account service  generates and presents invoices to users. Billing account service  may receive billing requests for invoices through a workspace graphical user interface (GUI) , and can communicate data to a payment service  for handling online payment of invoices, for example. Billing account service  may also be coupled to a subscription service , from which it may receive billing requests to create records associated with new users and billing accounts. User and billing account information is stored by billing account service  in a billing account service database .","In general, rating service  calculates charges to be applied to a user's billing account for the consumption of a specific, user-subscribed billable service made available by a commercial service provider. To facilitate these calculations, rating service  keeps track of subscription information. A subscription associates a billable service and a billing rate or package of billing rates with a user. A billing rate package defines the applicable charges under a specific set of circumstances (e.g. a billing rate of $1\/hour for using a billable service that provides users with access to the Internet in the morning, a billing rate of $2\/hour in the afternoon, and a billing rate of $3\/hour in the evening). The commercial service provider may also make available multiple billable services (e.g. an \u201coffer\u201d), with which a billing rate or package of billing rates is associated. When the user subscribes to a specific billable service, the user is permitted to use that billable service subject to the charges as defined by the relevant billing rate or billing rate package.","Rating service  is coupled to subscription service , from which it receives billing requests to generate subscriptions. Subscription information and user information may also be received by rating service  from billing account service . Billing requests received by rating service  may include requests to process billing events (i.e. events for which a user of a billable service may be charged) from a logging service , a metering service  (either directly, or indirectly through logging service  as shown in ), or from other applications  (either directly, possibly via application adapters where appropriate, or indirectly through logging service  as shown in , for example). For example, a scheduler [not shown] may be used to extract metering events from metering service , and to convert the metering events into billing events to be communicated to rating service  for processing. After a billing request is received, rating service  calculates charges to be applied to a user's billing account, and communicates the information to billing account service . Rating service  can also coordinate with an offer service  that is used to define available billable services and associated billing rates or billing rate packages.","Data utilized by rating service  is stored in a rating service database . In different configurations of billing system , the data in rating service database  and the data in billing account service database  may be stored in a common database, or may alternatively be distributed across multiple databases or storage means. Furthermore, in different configurations of billing system , the data in rating service database  and the data in billing account service database  may be stored in one or more databases residing on a computing device that is remotely located from the computing device(s) [not shown in ] on which billing account service  and\/or rating service  reside.","Referring to , a schematic diagram is shown illustrating components of billing system , which includes web service interfaces designed in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0041"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["20","22","52","54","52","54","20","22","52","54"]},"Billing account service web service interface  provides an interface to a billing account engine , which is a billing engine that has been programmed to perform at least a pre-defined set of billing functions that billing account service  is to provide. While billing account engine  may be a proprietary engine, in variant embodiments of the invention, it may also be a third party billing account engine. Billing account service web service interface  may be directly coupled to billing account engine , or indirectly coupled to billing account engine  through a billing account service adapter  that translates function calls between billing account service web service interface  and billing account engine , where required. As billing account service web service interface  makes billing functions available as a web service, computing applications can command performance of these billing functions by communicating an appropriate web service invocation or call to billing account service web service interface .","Billing account service web service interface  comprises a number of application programming interfaces that must first be implemented before billing account service  is made accessible for use by other computing applications. Each of these application programming interfaces is associated with a specific billing function of billing account engine . Each application programming interface is to be implemented by a software developer so that the corresponding billing function can be performed after a web service invocation that commands performance of the billing function is received by the billing account service web service interface .

Other computing applications  can then invoke the web services over a distributed network (e.g. the Internet).","Referring to , a schematic diagram illustrating individual implementations of a billing account service web service interface and a rating service web service interface in an embodiment of the present invention is provided. In this embodiment of the invention, two billing services are implemented: a billing account service  and a rating service . In this case, a billing account service web service interface  is coupled to a first billing engine, which is specifically a billing account engine . Optionally, in implementing billing account service , a billing account service adaptor  may be used where required, coupled to both billing account service web service interface  and billing account engine . Similarly, a rating service web service interface  is coupled to a separate, second billing engine, which is specifically a rating engine . Optionally, in implementing rating service , a rating service adaptor  may be used where required, coupled to both rating service web service interface  and rating engine . In this embodiment, both billing account service web service interface  and rating service web service interface  are implemented for coupling to individual billing engines to provide a billing service, as was also illustrated in . Each individual billing engine ,  may either be a proprietary engine or a third party billing engine. In some uses of billing account service  and rating service , a computing application  to which billing account service  is provided may itself provide a rating service, and a computing application  to which rating service  is provided may itself provide a billing account service.","Referring to , a schematic diagram illustrating a common implementation of a billing account service web service interface and a rating service web service interface in another embodiment of the present invention is provided. In this embodiment, a billing service  is implemented that provides both billing functions that would typically be provided by a billing account service, and also billing functions that would typically be provided by a rating service. In , both a billing account service web service interface  and a rating service web service interface  are coupled to the same billing engine, which is specifically a billing account and rating engine . Optionally, in this implementation, a billing account and rating service adaptor  may be used where required, coupled to billing account service web service interface , rating service web service interface , and billing account and rating engine . In this embodiment of the invention, both billing account service web service interface  and rating service web service interface  are implemented for coupling to a common billing engine (e.g. billing account and rating engine ) to provide a billing service, and the common billing engine may either be a proprietary engine or a third party billing engine.","Referring to , a schematic diagram illustrating an implementation of a billing account service web service interface and a rating service web service interface in another embodiment of the present invention is provided. In this embodiment, a billing service  is implemented that provides both billing functions that would typically be provided by a billing account service, and also billing functions that would typically be provided by a rating service. In , both a billing account service web service interface  and a rating service web service interface  are coupled to the same billing engine, which is specifically a lightweight billing engine . Optionally, in this implementation, an appropriate adaptor [not shown] may be used, where required. The embodiment of the invention shown in  is similar to that shown in , except that the common billing engine in  is specifically a \u201clightweight billing engine\u201d. A lightweight billing engine is a simple billing engine that can perform a basic set of billing functions. The lightweight billing engine can itself, be implemented as a web service. The lightweight billing engine offers sufficient functionality for use in small to medium-sized service hosting platforms. The lightweight billing engine is designed for easy installation and configuration, and to be highly customizable.","Referring to , a schematic diagram illustrating an implementation of a billing account service web service interface and a rating service web service interface in another embodiment of the present invention is provided in each Figure. In these embodiments, both a billing account service web service interface  and a rating service web service interface  are coupled to a common billing interface , through which data is communicated to its underlying billing engine(s) and\/or system(s). In , the underlying billing engine is a billing account and rating engine  (e.g. as shown in ), and in , the underlying billing engine is a lightweight billing engine  (e.g. as shown in ). The use of a common billing interface  may be advantageous in that a software designer would not need to change the implementation of a billing account service web service interface  and a rating service web service interface  when there is a change in an underlying billing engine or system, since all the relevant implementation details are encapsulated by the common billing interface .","In other words, the embodiments shown in  employ the use of a common billing interface , such that a web services interface (e.g. , ) need only be implemented in a generic way (i.e. not specific to any billing engine or system) in order to make the necessary calls to common billing interface . In contrast, the embodiments shown in  require that a web service interface (e.g. , ) be implemented with regard to the specific billing engine or system to which it is coupled (i.e. customized to that specific billing engine or system).","As indicated earlier, since the present invention allows a billing service to be provided as a web service, as a web service, the billing service may itself be hosted and provided as a billable service.
