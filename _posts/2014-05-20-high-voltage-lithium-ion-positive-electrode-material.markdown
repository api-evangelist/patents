title: High voltage lithium ion positive electrode material
abstract: A positive electrode material having a nominal stoichiometry LiCoSiFeMM′(PO)where M is a trivalent cation selected from at least one of Cr, Ti, Al, Mn, Ni, V, Sc, La and/or Ga, M′ is a divalent cation selected from at least one of Mn, Ni, Zn, Sr, Cu, Ca and/or Mg, y is within a range of 0<y≦0.10 and x is within a range of 0≦x≦0.2. The use of double compositional modification to LiCoPOincreases the discharge capacity from ˜100 mAh/g to about 130 mAh/g while retaining the discharge capacity retention of the singly Fe-substituted LiCoPO. Additional compositional modification to include Si increases the cycle life and greatly improved the coulombic efficiency to between 97-100% at a C/3 cycle rate.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD OF INTEREST","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61\/911,700 filed on 4 Dec. 2013, the complete disclosures of which, in their entirety, are herein incorporated by reference.","The invention described herein may be manufactured, used, and licensed by or for the United States Government.","The present invention relates in general to a positive electrode material, and in particular to a high voltage lithium ion positive electrode material.","LiFePOis a Li-ion positive electrode material that has been favored for its strong abuse tolerance which in turn has been attributed to the nature of the oxygen bonding in the phosphate group. Also, it is desirable to harness the abuse tolerance of a phosphate based cathode in a material that stores more energy. One possibility is to look to higher voltage olivines such as LiMnPO4.1 V, LiCoPO4.8 V or LiNiPO5.1V since the stored energy is proportional to the voltage. LiCoPOin particular has the potential to increase energy \u02dc40% compared to LiFePO. Furthermore, its electronic structure is more favorable than LiMnPOand LiNiPOin terms of polaronic conductivity and ability to form polarons, respectively.","However, and even though initial research on LiCoPOled to improvements in the rate of discharge, capacity fade has blocked further progress. As such, an improved Li-ion positive electrode material with a high discharge capacity and low capacity fade would be desirable.","A Li-ion positive electrode material is provided. The material has a nominal stoichiometry of LiCoSiFeMM\u2032(PO)where M is a trivalent cation such as Cr, Ti, Al, Mn, Ni, V, Sc, La and\/or Ga, M\u2032 is a divalent cation such as Mn, Ni, Zn, Sr, Cu, Ca and\/or Mg, y is within a range of 0<y\u22660.10, x is within a range of 0\u2266x\u22660.2, z is within a range of 0\u2266z\u22660.1 and d is within a range of 0\u2266d\u22660.20. In some instances, d is within the range of 0\u2266d\u22660.10, and preferably within the range of 0\u2266d\u22660.05. The Li-ion positive electrode material has an initial capacity of at least 120 mAh\/g and a discharge capacity of at least 100 mAh\/g after 500 cycles.","In some instances, the positive electrode material has a composition where y is within the range of 0.02\u2266y\u22660.08, x is within the range of 0.05\u2266x\u22660.15 and M=Cr or Ti. In other instances, y is within the range of 0.04\u2266y\u22660.06, x is within the range of 0.08\u2266x\u22660.12 and M=Cr or Ti. In still other instances, y=0.05, x=0.10 and M=Cr or Ti.","In one embodiment, z and d are equal to zero, and the Li-ion positive electrode material has a nominal stoichiometry of LiCoFeCr(PO), an initial capacity of at least 125 mAh\/g and a discharge capacity of at least 105 mAh\/g after 500 cycles.","In another embodiment, d is equal to zero, z is not equal to zero, the positive electrode material contains Si and the Li-ion positive electrode material has a nominal stoichiometry of LiCoSiFeM(PO)where x and y have the values given above and z is within a range of 0<z\u22660.1, preferably within a range of 0<z\u22660.05, and more preferably within a range of 0<z\u22660.02. In some instances z=0.01. Also, the addition of Si improves the coulombic efficiency of the material and in some instances the coulombic efficiency is between 97-100% at a C\/3 cycle rate.","An improved Li-ion positive electrode material with an initial capacity of at least 120 mAh\/g and a discharge capacity of at least 100 mAh\/g after 500 cycles is provided. In some instances, the improved Li-ion positive electrode material has initial capacity of at least 125 mAh\/g and a discharge capacity of at least 105 mAh\/g after 500 cycles. In addition, the material can contain Si which provides an coulombic efficiency to between 97-100% at a C\/3 cycle rate.","It is appreciated that the improved capacity and dramatically reduced capacity fade is striking relative to LiCoPO. The use of a double compositional modification increases the discharge capacity from \u02dc100 mAh\/g to about 130 mAh\/g in the most favorable cases for Ti and Fe or Cr and Fe modification of LiCoPO, while retaining the discharge capacity retention of the singly Fe-substituted LiCoPO. Additional compositional modification to include Si increases the cycle life and greatly improves the coulombic efficiency to between 97-100% at a C\/3 cycle rate.","The material has a nominal stoichiometry of LiCoSiFeMM\u2032(PO)where M is a trivalent cation such as Cr, Ti, Al, Ni, V, Sc, La and\/or Ga, M\u2032 is a covalent cation such as Mn, Ni, Zn, Sr, Cu, Ca and\/or Mg, y is within a range of 0<y\u22660.10, x is within a range of 0\u2266x\u22660.2, z is within the range of 0\u2266z\u22660.1 and d is within the range of 0\u2266d\u22660.20. In some instances, y is within the range of 0.02\u2266y\u22660.08, x is within the range of 0.05\u2266x\u22660.15 and M=Cr or Ti. In other instances, y is within the range of 0.04\u2266y\u22660.06, x is within the range of 0.08\u2266x\u22660.12 and M=Cr or Ti. In still other instances, y=0.05, x=0.10 and M=Cr or Ti.","The positive electrode material can also contain Si and the Li-ion positive electrode material can have a nominal stoichiometry of LiCoSiFeM(PO)where x and y have the values given above and z is within a range of 0<z\u22660.1, preferably within a range of 0<z\u22660.05, and more preferably within a range of 0<z\u22660.02. In some instances z=0.01.","In order to better teach the invention but not limit its scope in any way, a solid state synthesis method for making the LiCoSiFeMM\u2032(PO)material and one or more examples of the inventive material are discussed below.","Samples of LiCoFeM(PO)with M=Cr Ti, Al and\/or Ga, 0<y\u22660.10 and 0\u2266x\u22660.2 were prepared via a solid state route. Stoichiometric amounts of Co(OH), LiHPO, CrO, TiO, Al(OH), GaO, FeCO.2HO and\/or acetylene black (5 wt. % of final product) were ball-milled for 90 minutes. The mixture was then heated at a heating rate of 10\u00b0 C. minto 700\u00b0 C. under flowing Nand then the reactant mixture was held at this temperature for 12 h. Samples of LiCoSiFeM(PO)with M=Cr or Ti were prepared via the same method using Si(OOCCH)as the Si source.","The resulting crystalline phase(s) were identified using X-ray powder diffraction, X-ray data were collected using a Rigaku Ultima III diffractometer, Lattice constants were calculated from peak positions using Rietveld refinement of the pattern collected in a parallel beam geometry. For electrochemical testing, a composite electrode was fabricated by a slurry coating method. Using N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) as solvent, a slurry was used to coat an Al foil substrate to produce a composite electrode of ca. 80 wt. % active material, 10 wt. % polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), 8 wt. % super-P carbon and 2 wt. % conductive carbon nanotube composite (CheapTubes.com). The electrode film was cut into small discs with an area of 0.97 cmand dried under an infrared lamp in air before use. In a dry room (Dew point <\u221250\u00b0 C.), Li\/active coin cells (Hohsen CR2032) were assembled using 3 layers of Celgard\u00ae 2400 as the separator and a 1.0 molal LiPFsolution in a 3:7 (wt. %) mixture of ethylene carbonate (EC) and ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC) electrolyte with 1 wt. % HFiP. Also, 100-150 \u03bcL of electrolyte was used per coin cell and electrochemical testing was performed using a Maccor Series 4000 tester. For calculation of C-rate, a capacity of \u02dc150 mA h gwas assumed.","Substitution of elements in addition to Fe for Co, including Cr, Ti, Al and Ga, increased the discharge capacity of Fe-substituted LiCoPOwhile maintaining long cycle life. Not being bound by theory, a nominal stoichiometry, LiCoFeM(PO)(M=Cr, Ti, Al and\/or Ga) that favors substitution on the Co site and cation vacancies exhibited favorable performance since substitution on the Li site blocks Li-ion conduction. In addition, the above stoichiometry favors the presence of cation vacancies that might enhance Li-ion conductivity.","Turning now to , capacity as a function of cycle for a number of different compositions are shown. The Ti,Fe and Cr,Fe double modifications exhibited the most favorable discharge capacity and cycle life. Furthermore, a composition level was discovered to be 0.10 for Fe and 0.05 for Ti or Cr. All samples exhibited superior cycle life compared to LiCoPOand increased discharge capacity relative to singly Fe-substituted LiCoPO\u2014labeled 20Fe(ARL) in the figure and corresponds to nominal stoichiometry of LiCoFePO).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 2","sub":["4 ","6 "]},"As shown in , the un-substituted LiCoPOcontrol sample exhibited severe capacity fade. However, the Fe-substitution into LiCoPO(nominal LiCoFePO) had a significant reduction in capacity fade relative to the un-substituted LiCoPO. Also, increasing the discharge capacity by further composition modification with another element in addition to Fe is shown. For example, the LiCoFeCr(PO)sample showed better capacity retention with cycling despite having a slightly smaller initial discharge capacity than LiCoFeTi(PO).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 3","sub":["1.025","0.85","0.10","0.05","4","1.025 ","0.8","0.2","4","4 ","4 ","4"],"sup":["\u22121 ","th ","\u22121 "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 4","sub":["1+y\/2","0.90\u00b7y","0.10","y","4","1+y\/2 ","1.025","0.85","0.10","0.05","4","1.025 ","1.025","0.85","0.10","0.05","4","1.025 ","4 ","0.9","0.1","4 ","4 ","0.9","0.1","4 ","1.025","0.85","0.10","0.05","4","1.025 ","4 "],"sup":["3","3 ","3","3+ ","2+ ","2+ "]},"Not being bound by theory, improved discharge electrochemical performance may likely result from increased electronic and\/or ionic conductivity. The Li-ion conductivity is, of course, a function of the Li-ion concentration and the Li-ion mobility. Since there is little difference in the Li-ion concentration between the modified LiCoPOand the unmodified LiCoPO, the increased Li-ion mobility is a likely hypothesis for the improvement in discharge capacity and rate capability (rate shown in ) of Cr,Fe-substituted LiCoPOrelative to LiCoPO.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"119pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 1"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Nominal composition","a (\u212b)","b (\u212b)","c (\u212b)","V (\u212b)"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["LiCoPO","10.2048","5.9245","4.7017","284.3"]},{"entry":["LiCoFePO","10.2175","5.9335","4.7025","285.1"]},{"entry":["LiCoFeCr(PO)","10.1703","5.9204","4.6991","282.9"]},{"entry":["LiCoFeTi(PO)","10.2019","5.9299","4.6976","284.2"]},{"entry":["LiCoSiFeCr(PO)","10.2009","5.9314","4.6999","284.4"]},{"entry":["LiCoSiFeTi(PO)","10.2060","5.9308","4.6986","284.4"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"When a higher Cr content was prepared, LiCoFeCr(PO), the XRD pattern showed an extra peak around 25 degrees two-theta which matches LiCrPO.

As previously discussed, at a 0.05 Cr substitution level, a bulk substitution for Co is obtained. In contrast, the Ti, Fe modified LiCoPOsamples all contain a small fraction of a LiTi(PO)-like phase and we therefore suggest that the improvement in electrochemical performance for Ti,Fe modified LiCoPOmay result from the beneficial effect this phase has on the Li-ion conductivity of the substituted LiCoPO.","The LiTi(PO)-like phase has the NASICON structure and it is known to be an excellent Li-ion conductor as a result of the structural characteristics of the NASICON structure which favor high Li-ionic conductivity. Furthermore, the interface of two Li-ion conducting materials can lead to orders of magnitude increased Li-ion conductivity on both sides of the interface through a synergistic effect.","Having shown the improvements in capacity fade because of double compositional modifications of LiCoPO, the favorable effects of composition modification on the capacity of LiCoFeCr(PO)as a function of rate are shown in . Typical discharge curves at three rates, C\/10, C\/2 and C are plotted. The capacity at C\/10 is about 132 mAh\/g. At a 1C rate the capacity is about 126 mAh\/g, thus the material shows an excellent rate capability. The improvements are suggested to result from enhanced Li-ion conduction.","In addition to the above, the coulombic efficiency of the nominal composition of LiCoSiFeM(PO)with M=Cr or Ti was improved by adding Si. The discharge capacity as a function of cycle and cycle life is shown in  for LiCoSiFeCr(PO)relative to its Si free analog. As shown in the figure, a significant improvement in the coulombic efficiency and cycle life was observed. LiCoSiFeTi(PO)showed a similar improvement in coulombic efficiency and an even greater improvement in cycle life as shown in .","The x-ray diffraction pattern of the nominal composition LiCoSiFeCr(PO)is shown in . There is a peak around 25 degrees which does not correspond to the phospho-olivine structure. This might either be Si related or LiCrPOas previously discussed. The lattice constants (see Table 1) show a decrease in the unit cell volume relative to LiFeCoPO, but the unit cell volume is larger than LiCoFeCr(PO), and suggests that inclusion of Si in the starting composition reduces the amount of Cr that can be substituted into LiCoPO. However the reduced unit cell volume relative to LiFeCoPOindicates that some substitution on the Co lattice site is still occurring. From a crystal chemistry perspective, Cr (effective radius=0.615 \u212b [13]) is more likely to substitute for Co (effective ionic radius of 0.745 \u212b [13]) than Si (effective ionic radius of 0.40 \u212b [13]). The x-ray diffraction pattern of nominal composition LiCoSiFeTi(PO)is shown in . There is a peak around 24.6 degrees two-theta which does not correspond to the phospho-olivine structure. This peak might be attributed to a LiSiO, but a definitive assignment was not made since only 1 peak is evident and it falls within the same region as the LiTi(PO)-like phase discussed earlier for Ti containing samples. The unit cell volume (Table 1) for this sample was found to be 284.41 \u212b, indicating no change from the Si free analog within the uncertainty of the measurement.","Changes and modifications to the teachings disclosed herein will be obvious to those skilled in the art and yet fall within the scope of the present invention.
