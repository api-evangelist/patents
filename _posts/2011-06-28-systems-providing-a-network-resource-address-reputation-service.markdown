title: Systems providing a network resource address reputation service
abstract: An exemplary system for providing a network resource address reputation service may comprise a server computer configured to determine whether an event associated with a network resource address matches event signature(s) in network security device(s). If the event matches a signature, a reputation score for the network resource address may be generated. If the network resource address is not present in a first malicious network resource address database, the network resource address in association with the reputation score may be stored in a second malicious network resource address database. If the network resource address is present in the first malicious network resource address database, the reputation score may be modified to indicate a more negative reputation for the network resource address. The network resource address may then be stored in association with the modified reputation score in a second malicious network resource address database.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED PATENT APPLICATIONS","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This patent application is related to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13\/170,535 entitled: \u201cNETWORK RESOURCE ADDRESS REPUTATION SERVICE\u201d concurrently filed herewith and also assigned to Go Daddy Operating Company, LLC.","The present inventions generally relate to network security and, more particularly, systems, methods, and other tools for providing a network resource address reputation service.","An example embodiment of a system for providing a network resource address reputation service may comprise one or more network security device (communicatively coupled to a network) storing a plurality of event signatures and being configured to determine whether an event associated with a network resource having a network resource address matches one or more of the plurality of event signatures, a first malicious network resource address database (communicatively coupled to the network) storing a plurality of malicious network resource addresses determined to be malicious by one or more external feeds, and one or more server (communicatively coupled to the network) configured to (upon a determination that the event matches one or more of the plurality of event signatures) generate a reputation score for the network resource address and determine whether the network resource address is present in the first malicious network resource address database. If the network resource address is present in the external malicious network resource address database, the one or more server may modify the reputation score to indicate a more negative reputation for the network resource address and store (in a second malicious network resource address database communicatively coupled to the network) the network resource address in association with the reputation score.","An example embodiment of a method of providing a network resource address reputation service may comprise the steps of determining whether an event associated with a network resource address matches one or more of a plurality of event signatures in one or more network security device. If the event associated with the network resource address matches one or more of the plurality of event signatures, the example method further may comprise the steps of generating a reputation score for the network resource address and determining whether the network resource address is present in a first malicious network resource address database. If the network resource address is not present in the first malicious network resource address database, the method further may comprise the step of storing, in a second malicious network resource address database, the network resource address in association with the reputation score. If the network resource address is present in the first malicious network resource address database, the method further may comprise the steps of modifying the reputation score to indicate a more negative reputation for the network resource address and storing, in a second malicious network resource address database, the network resource address in association with the reputation score.","The above features and advantages of the present inventions will be better understood from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.","The present inventions will now be discussed in detail with regard to the attached drawing figures, which were briefly described above. In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth illustrating the Applicant's best mode for practicing the inventions and enabling one of ordinary skill in the art to make and use the inventions. It will be obvious, however, to one skilled in the art that the present inventions may be practiced without many of these specific details. In other instances, well-known machines, structures, and method steps have not been described in particular detail in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the present inventions. Unless otherwise indicated, like parts and method steps are referred to with like reference numerals.","A network is a collection of links and nodes (e.g., multiple computers and\/or other devices connected together) arranged so that information may be passed from one part of the network to another over multiple links and through various nodes. Examples of networks include the Internet, the public switched telephone network, the global Telex network, computer networks (e.g., an intranet, an extranet, a local-area network, or a wide-area network), wired networks, and wireless networks.","The Internet is a worldwide network of computers and computer networks arranged to allow the easy and robust exchange of information between computer users. Hundreds of millions of people around the world have access to computers connected to the Internet via Internet Service Providers (ISPs). Content providers (e.g., website owners or operators) place multimedia information (e.g., text, graphics, audio, video, animation, and other forms of data) at specific locations on the Internet referred to as webpages. Websites comprise a collection of connected, or otherwise related, webpages. The combination of all the websites and their corresponding webpages on the Internet is generally known as the World Wide Web (WWW) or simply the Web.","Prevalent on the Web are multimedia websites, some of which may offer and sell goods and services to individuals and organizations. Websites may consist of a single webpage, but typically consist of multiple interconnected and related webpages. Menus and links may be used to move between different webpages within the website or to move to a different website as is known in the art. The interconnectivity of webpages enabled by the Internet can make it difficult for Internet users to tell where one website ends and another begins. Websites may be created using HyperText Markup Language (HTML) to generate a standard set of tags that define how the webpages for the website are to be displayed. Such websites may comprise a collection of HTML and subordinate documents (i.e., files) stored on the Web that are typically accessible from the same Uniform Resource Locator (URL) and reside on the same server, although such files may be distributed in numerous servers.","Users of the Internet may access content providers' websites using software known as an Internet browser, such as MICROSOFT INTERNET EXPLORER or MOZILLA FIREFOX. After the browser has located the desired webpage, it requests and receives information from the webpage, typically in the form of an HTML document, and then displays the webpage content for the user. The user then may view other webpages at the same website or move to an entirely different website using the browser.","Browsers are able to locate specific websites because each website, resource, and computer on the Internet has a unique Internet Protocol (IP) address. Presently, there are two standards for IP addresses. The older IP address standard, often called IP Version 4 (IPv4), is a 32-bit binary number, which is typically shown in dotted decimal notation, where four 8-bit bytes are separated by a dot from each other (e.g., 64.202.167.32). The notation is used to improve human readability. The newer IP address standard, often called IP Version 6 (IPv6) or Next Generation Internet Protocol (IPng), is a 128-bit binary number. The standard human readable notation for IPv6 addresses presents the address as eight 16-bit hexadecimal words, each separated by a colon (e.g., 2EDC:BA98:0332:0000:CF8A:000C:2154:7313).","IP addresses, however, even in human readable notation, are difficult for people to remember and use. A URL is much easier to remember and may be used to point to any computer, directory, or file on the Internet. A browser is able to access a website on the Internet through the use of a URL. The URL may include a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) request combined with the website's Internet address, also known as the website's domain. An example of a URL with a HTTP request and domain is: http:\/\/www.companyname.com. In this example, the \u201chttp\u201d identifies the URL as a HTTP request and the \u201ccompanyname.com\u201d is the domain.","Domains are much easier to remember and use than their corresponding IP addresses. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) approves some Generic Top-Level Domains (gTLD) and delegates the administrative responsibility to a particular organization (a \u201cregistry\u201d) for maintaining an authoritative source for the registered domains within a TLD and their corresponding IP addresses. Such a registry may comprise any registry or other entity under contract (or other agreement) with ICANN to administer one or more TLDs, a registry operator that may comprise any entity sub-contracted with the registry to administer the TLD on behalf of the registry and make the TLD available to registrars for registration, and\/or any agent operating on behalf of a registry to carry out the registries' contractual obligations with ICANN. For certain TLDs (e.g., .biz, .info, .name, and .org) the registry is also the authoritative source for contact information related to the domain and is referred to as a \u201cthick\u201d registry. For other TLDs (e.g., .com and .net) only the domain, registrar identification, and name server information is stored within the registry, and a registrar is the authoritative source for the contact information related to the domain. Such registries are referred to as \u201cthin\u201d registries. Most gTLDs are organized through a central domain Shared Registration System (SRS) based on their TLD.","The process for registering a domain with .com, .net, .org, or other TLDs allows an Internet user to use an ICANN-accredited registrar to register their domain. For example, if an Internet user, John Doe, wishes to register the domain \u201cmycompany.com,\u201d John Doe may initially determine whether the desired domain is available by contacting a domain registrar. The Internet user may make this contact using the registrar's website and typing the desired domain into a field on the registrar's webpage created for this purpose.","Upon receiving the request from the Internet user, the registrar may ascertain whether \u201cmycompany.com\u201d has already been registered by checking the SRS database associated with the TLD of the domain. The results of the search then may be displayed on the registrar's website to thereby notify the Internet user of the availability of the domain. If the domain is available, the Internet user may proceed with the registration process. If the domain is not available for registration, the Internet user may keep selecting alternative domains until an available domain is found. When a domain is registered, the registrar may pay a registration fee to the registry responsible for administering the TLD used by the registered domain. Continuing with the previous paragraph's example, upon registration of the domain \u201cmycompany.com,\u201d although the registrar may have collected a fee from the domain registrant, it also may have paid the registry the appropriate registration fee for the allocated .com TLD.","Websites, unless extremely large and complex or have unusual traffic demands, typically reside on a single server and are prepared and maintained by a single individual or entity. Some Internet users, typically those that are larger and more sophisticated, may provide their own hardware, software, and connections to the Internet. But many Internet users either do not have the resources available or do not want to create and maintain the infrastructure necessary to host their own websites. To assist such individuals (or entities), hosting companies exist that offer website hosting services. These hosting service providers typically provide the hardware, software, and electronic communication means necessary to connect multiple websites to the Internet. A single hosting service provider may literally host thousands of websites on one or more hosting servers.","Hosting providers often sell website hosting services based upon the content provider's anticipated memory and bandwidth needs. For example, a content provider may pay a lower monthly fee for 100 gigabytes (GB) of server disk space and 1000 GB of bandwidth than another content provider whose website may require 500 GB and 5000 GB of server disk space and bandwidth, respectively. Content providers must carefully evaluate their website's anticipated storage and bandwidth needs and select their hosting plan accordingly.","Content providers also need to design their websites with security in mind. If not properly designed, the files (and\/or databases) that provide the website's functionality may be hacked, and perhaps altered or even overtaken, by unscrupulous or malicious Internet users. For example, some interactive websites may be configured (perhaps by having File Transfer Protocol (FTP) or Web search functionality) to allow users to upload data or files (e.g., photographs, videos, documents, search strings, etc.) to the website, its directories, or databases, thereby exposing the website backend to Internet users.","Such security vulnerabilities may be exploited by many known hacking techniques including SQL injection, Remote File Inclusion (RFI), Local File Inclusion (LFI), or Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). These (and other similar hacking techniques) may cause the uploading of unwanted and potentially malicious files and\/or result in the corruption of the files or databases that provide the website's functionality, perhaps rendering the website inoperable.","Similarly, Internet users who access such website content also must keep security in mind. By accessing compromised websites, the Internet user may inadvertently download (perhaps from a hacked hosting server) malware such as viruses, or worms, spyware to their client device (e.g., computer, smartphone, etc.).","Applicant has determined that presently-existing website hosting systems and methods do not provide optimal means for identifying malicious websites, protecting hosting servers against attacks on websites, and\/or protecting Internet users from inadvertently downloading malware. Specifically, there is a need for the systems, method for providing a network resource address reputation service described herein.","Systems for Providing an Network Resource Address Reputation Service",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","101","102","103","104","102","105","101","106","107","108","101","102","104","104","105","104","105","108","104","112","101","104"]},"The example embodiments illustrated herein place no limitation on network  configuration or connectivity. Thus, as non-limiting examples, the network  could comprise the Internet, the public switched telephone network, the global Telex network, computer networks (e.g., an intranet, an extranet, a local-area network, or a wide-area network), wired networks, wireless networks, or any combination thereof.","System components (e.g., servers , network resources , external feeds , network security devices , databases  and , and\/or any other component) may be communicatively coupled to the network  via any method of network connection known in the art or developed in the future including, but not limited to wired, wireless, modem, dial-up, satellite, cable modem, Digital Subscriber Line (DSL), Asymmetric Digital Subscribers Line (ASDL), Virtual Private Network (VPN), Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN), X.25, Ethernet, token ring, Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI), IP over Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM), Infrared Data Association (IrDA), wireless, WAN technologies (T1, Frame Relay), Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet (PPPoE), and\/or any combination thereof.","Network security device(s)  may comprise any network  security system, software, or appliance that monitors the activity of network-coupled components (e.g., clients, servers, network storage devices, databases, and\/or any other network resource) for malicious activity and, perhaps, identify, log information about, block, and\/or report such malicious activity. As non-limiting examples, network security devices  may comprise a distributed denial of service (DDoS) mitigation device, an intrusion detection system, an intrusion prevention system, a host-based intrusion prevention system, or a web application firewall.","In a DDoS attack, numerous compromised systems attack a single target and thereby deny service to users of the targeted system. The multitude of incoming traffic to the targeted system effectively shuts it down (or causes a substantial slowdown), thereby denying access to legitimate users. DDoS attacks often are controlled by a master computer that obtained control of numerous client computers by installing backdoor agent, client, or zombie software on the client computers. A DDoS mitigation device may comprise any system, software, or appliance that detects a potential DDoS attack and blocks related malicious traffic, optimally without affecting the flow of legitimate traffic. As non-limiting examples, the illustrated embodiment may be achieved with either commercially-available (e.g., CISCO GUARD or ARBOR PRAVAIL) or proprietary DDoS mitigation systems.","Intrusion detection may comprise monitoring network use and analyzing it for violations of network security, acceptable use policies, or standard security practices. Intrusion prevention may comprise performing intrusion detection and attempting to stop detected violations. Intrusion detection and prevention systems therefore may comprise any system, software, or appliance that identifies violations, logs related information, attempts to stop violations, and reports violations to security administrators. Any type of intrusion detection and prevention system may be used including, but not limited to Network-based Intrusion Prevention Systems (NIPS), Wireless Intrusion Prevention Systems (WIPS), Network Behavior Analysis (NBA), or Host-based Intrusion Prevention (HIPS) (e.g., installed software that monitors a single host for suspicious activity by analyzing events occurring within that host). As non-limiting examples, the illustrated embodiment may be achieved with either commercially-available (e.g., CISCO INTRUSION DETECTION AND PREVENTION, HEWLETT PACKARD TIPPING POINT, or MCAFEE IPS) or proprietary intrusion detection and prevention systems.","A firewall may comprise any system, software, or appliance that permits or denies network traffic based upon a set of rules. A firewall is commonly used to protect networks from unauthorized access while permitting legitimate traffic. A web application firewall is a network-based application layer firewall that operates at the application layer of a protocol stack. Because it acts on the application layer, it may inspect traffic content and block specified content, such as that originating from malicious websites or software. As non-limiting examples, the illustrated embodiment may be achieved with either commercially-available (e.g., CISCO ACE WEB APPLICATION FIREWALL or BARRACUDA NETWORKS WEB APPLICATION FIREWALL) or proprietary firewall devices.","Network security device(s)  may detect malicious activity according to any known detection method including, but not limited to, signature-based, statistical anomaly-based, and stateful protocol analysis methods. As a non-limiting example, a signature-based network security device  may store, or otherwise have access to (e.g., stored in another network-coupled storage device), a plurality of event signatures  and monitor network  traffic for matches to these signatures .","Such signature-based network security devices  may utilize signatures , which are simply known attack patterns. Such systems may intercept network  packets and collect a stream of transmitted bytes. The stream then may be analyzed to identify strings of characters in the data, known as signatures , which may comprise particular strings that have been discovered in known malicious activity. As a non-limiting example, the signatures  may be exploit-based or vulnerability-based. Such signatures  may be written, perhaps by a network resource reputation service provider , based upon prior known attacks.","As non-limiting examples, event signatures  may comprise a plurality of malware signatures including, but not limited to a virus signature, a worm signature, a trojan horse signature, a rootkit signature, a backdoor signature, a spyware signature, a keystroke logger signature, or a phishing application signature.","Alternatively, event signatures  may comprise a plurality of attack signatures including, but not limited to one or more signatures identifying a botnet attack, a shell code attack, a cross site scripting attack, a SQL injection attack, a directory reversal attack, a remote code execution attack, a distributed denial of service attack, a brute force attack, a remote file inclusion attack, a script injection attack, or an iFrame injection attack.","Network security device(s)  also may be configured (perhaps by installing software and\/or scripts on the device  containing appropriate instructions) to determine whether an event associated with a network resource  having a network resource address  matches one or more of the event signatures . An \u201cevent\u201d may comprise any malicious or unwanted activity, perhaps performed by or via a network resource  having a network resource address . The network resource  may comprise any network  coupled device (e.g., a hardware and\/or software component) having a network resource address.","As non-limiting examples, the network resource  may comprise a server (perhaps hosting a website and\/or its content), a client computing device, a database, or any network storage device. The network resource address  may comprise any address that identifies a network-coupled component, such as the network resource . As non-limiting examples, the network resource address may comprise an IP address, a URL, or a domain (e.g., domain name) for the network resource .","As non-limiting examples, the event may comprise any of the incidents described above with respect to event signatures . In an example embodiment, the event may be matched with an event signature  by intercepting network  packets, collecting a stream of transmitted data, analyzing the stream to identify strings of characters in the data, and comparing the identified strings with the event signatures . Alternatively, any method of determining an event\/event signature  match known in the art or developed in the future may be used.","The illustrated embodiment also may comprise a first malicious network resource address database  (communicatively coupled to the network ) storing a plurality of malicious network resource addresses  determined to be malicious by one or more external feeds . As non-limiting examples, the database  (and\/or any other database described herein) may comprise a local database, online database, desktop database, server-side database, relational database, hierarchical database, network database, object database, object-relational database, associative database, concept-oriented database, entity-attribute-value database, multi-dimensional database, semi-structured database, star schema database, XML database, file, collection of files, spreadsheet, or other means of data storage located on a computer, client, server, or any other storage device known in the art or developed in the future.","The plurality of malicious network resource addresses  stored it the first malicious network resource address database  may comprise any network resource address determined to be associated with any malicious or unwanted activity, such as those listed in detail above, by one or more external feeds . As non-limiting examples the external feeds  may comprise third-party network security services that transmit, perhaps to subscribers, data identifying one or more network resource addresses that have been associated with any malicious or unwanted activity. An external feed  may comprise a malware domain list feed, a malware URL list feed, an emerging threat feed, an intrusion detection feed, a botnet tracking feed, a phishing tracking feed, a spam tracking feed, or a compromised network feed. INTERNET STORM CENTER DSHIELD, ZEUS TRACKER, TEAM CYMRU, ARBOR NETWORKS ACTIVE THREAT FEED SECURITY SERVICE, PHISHTANK, and SPAMHAUS all comprise example external feeds  that may be used with the illustrated embodiments.","The illustrated embodiment also may comprise one or more server  (communicatively coupled to the network ) configured to (upon a determination that the event matches one or more of the plurality of event signatures ) generate a reputation score for the network resource address . Each of the at least one servers  (and\/or any other server described herein) could be any computer or program that provides services to other computers, programs, or users either in the same computer or over a computer network . As non-limiting examples, the one of more server  could be application, communication, mail, database, proxy, fax, file, media, web, peer-to-peer, standalone, software, or hardware servers (i.e., server computers) and may use any server format known in the art or developed in the future (possibly a shared hosting server, a virtual dedicated hosting server, a dedicated hosting server, or any combination thereof).","As further illustrated in , the server  may comprise a computer-readable storage media  storing instructions  that, when executed by a microprocessor , cause the server  to perform the steps for which it is configured. The computer-readable media  may comprise any data storage medium capable of storing instructions  for execution by a computing device. It may comprise, as non-limiting examples, magnetic, optical, semiconductor, paper, or any other data storage media, a database or other network storage device, hard disk drives, portable disks, CD-ROM, DVD, RAM, ROM, flash memory, and\/or holographic data storage. The instructions  may, as non-limiting examples, comprise software and\/or scripts stored in the computer-readable media  that may be stored locally in the server  or, alternatively, in a highly-distributed format in a plurality of computer-readable media  accessible via the network , perhaps via a grid or cloud-computing environment.","As a non-limiting example, the server  may be configured to generate a reputation score for the network resource address  by having instructions  installed in computer readable media  causing the microprocessor  to generate such a reputation score. The reputation score may comprise any score indicating the reputation for the network resource address  and may comprise any rating or ranking scale known in the art or developed in the future. As non-limiting examples, the link match score may range from 0 to 1, 1 to 10, 0% to 100%, and\/or A+ to F\u2212 (e.g., grades). Alternatively, it may comprise a star rating system or a color rating system (e.g., red indicates a poor reputation, yellow indicates an average reputation, and green indicates a good reputation).","As one non-limiting example, the range for reputation scores may have a minimum value of 0% and a maximum value of 100%, and may indicate a transition from a negative to a positive reputation when the score exceeds a score 50%. The server  may calculate such a reputation score, perhaps by determining a quantity of event signature  matches associated with each of a plurality of network resource addresses, determining a quantity of event signature  matches associated with the subject network resource's  network resource address , determining a percentage of the plurality of network resource addresses having a quantity of event signature  matches that are higher than the quantity of event signature  matches associated with the subject network resource's  network resource address , and assigning that percentage as the reputation score.","For example, the server  may determine that IP address A has 0 signature matches, IP address B has 10 signature matches, IP address C has 20 signature matches, and IP address D has 30 signature matches. If the subject network resource's  IP address  is determined to have 25 signature matches, then only 25% of the IP addresses would have a higher score than the subject IP address . A 25% reputation score then may be assigned to the subject IP address , indicating a relatively low quality reputation.","In yet another example embodiment, the server  may calculate the reputation score, perhaps by determining a quantity of event signature  matches associated with each of a plurality of network resource addresses (wherein the plurality of network resource addresses includes the network resource address ), sequencing each of the plurality of network resource addresses according to the quantity of event signature  matches associated with each network resource address, grouping the quantity of event signature  matches according to a common quantity of event signature  matches, generating a rolling count for each grouping of the common quantity of event signature  matches, assigning a percentile score to each of the quantity of event signature  matches according to the rolling count, and assigning the percentile score assigned to the quantity of event signature  matches associated with the network resource address as the reputation score for the network resource address .","For example, the server  may determine that IP address A has 125 signature matches, IP address B has 5 signature matches, IP address C has 5 signature matches, IP address D has 1400 signature matches, and IP address E has 110000 signature matches. The IP addresses then may be sequenced amongst each other according to the quantity of event signature  matches associated with each IP addresses, perhaps as
