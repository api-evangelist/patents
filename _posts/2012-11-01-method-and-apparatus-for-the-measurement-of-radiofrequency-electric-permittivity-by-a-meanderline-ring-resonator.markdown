No. 61\/586,160, filed Jan. 13, 2012, which is herein incorporated by reference.","Governmental Interest\u2014The invention described herein may be manufactured, used and licensed by or for the U.S. Government.","Embodiments of the present invention generally relate to a method and apparatus to measure the electromagnetic properties of materials. Specifically, the use of a radio frequency (RF) meander-line ring resonator to measure the permittivity of a material.","It is critical that military personnel timely identify enemy objects and combatants, and even more so as modern warfare occurs more frequently in urban areas. The urban environment presents situations where it becomes increasingly necessary to identify objects hidden behind walls and underfoot. In recent years, ground penetrating radar (GPR) has been crucial in the identification of subterranean objects such as improvised explosive devices (IEDs).","In order for the aforementioned radar to operate properly, modeling of the radar environment needs to accurately represent the materials encountered in-theater. Electromagnetic properties of materials in the environment determine the depth at which objects can be detected by the radar. One such property is permittivity (\u2208), which indicates the transmission, reflection, and absorption of EM radiation by a dielectric material. Since permittivity is an intrinsic material property that depends on temperature and water content, the \u2208 for sand, soil, and vegetation varies by location and time-of-day. Thus, to accurately model the behavior of radar pulses in a test environment, permittivity must be measured as near to the radar test area as possible.","Several techniques exist for measuring the permittivity of dielectric samples. At radio frequencies (RF), two popular techniques are reflectometry and scatterometry. Reflectometry disadvantageously requires disturbing the sample by inserting probes. Also, a reflectometer, such as a pulse generator and oscilloscope, must be brought to the radar experiment site. Scatterometry disadvantageously requires that the measurement must be taken in the far-field, at a distance of at least several wavelengths from the sample. At this far-field distance, the sample must be several wavelengths in length and width for the measurement to be valid. An alternative method is to use ring resonators, which requires that a scalar network analyzer (or equivalent circuit) and a microstrip ring are brought to the experiment site. The ring-resonator measurement can be taken without disturbing the dielectric sample.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["125","130","125","100","120","115","130","125","100","120","105","120","110","115","130"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["205","230","235","200","210","220","230","225","215"]},"Given that the test sample  must be flush against the ring surface , it is increasingly difficult to ensure a flush fit at relatively low (e.g. below GHz) frequencies as the corresponding area of the ring and sample size increases. Thus, a traditional circular ring resonator is impractical for measuring permittivity below 1 GHz as the ring becomes prohibitively large (e.g. several feet across). These lower frequencies are used by GPR, though, because they offer deeper ground penetration using relatively low transmit power. Since accurate radar modeling must account for frequencies under 1 GHz, the permittivity of materials in the radar environment must be measured at such frequencies; thus, improved techniques are needed to measure permittivity.","A portable system may be useful to measure permittivity quickly in the field, with minimal disturbance of the dielectric sample, at ground penetrating frequencies.","A method, system, and apparatus for a meander-line ring resonator are described herein. Specifically, the meander-line ring resonator for measuring permittivity comprises: a meander-line ring, which may be disposed on a substrate proximate to and separated from input and output couplers thereon; the resonator further including a continuous conductive material on the substrate with at least two turns forming a single congruent pattern, symmetrical along at least one axis.","In some embodiments, an apparatus for the meander-line ring resonator includes electronics for detecting the permittivity of responses from an electric field applied to a dielectric sample. Other and further embodiments of the present invention are described below.","To facilitate understanding, identical reference numerals have been used, where possible, to designate identical elements that are common to the figures. The figures are not drawn to scale and may be simplified for clarity. It is contemplated that elements and features of one embodiment may be beneficially incorporated in other embodiments without further recitation.","Embodiments of the present invention relates to a meander-line ring resonator. One embodiment of the meander-line ring resonator measures permittivity of a dielectric sample such as soil. Profiling of moist soils and sands most notably aids in the design and implementation of ground penetrating radar. However, sampling dielectric materials may aid in the design of other radar applications.","The meander-line ring resonator includes a series of turns (i.e. at least two) in the meander-line ring to reduce the overall area occupied on the substrate by the ring while maintaining the same continuous length of the ring. The turns of the ring are congruent in at least one axis such that there is efficient resonance of the fields across the ring structure from one end to another. The at least one axis may be defined between the at least two turns, such as, for example, an axis coincident with input and output lines of input and output couplers to the ring. By contrast, the traditional ring resonator might be thought of as being substantially circular having only one continuous turn. Further embodiments may include elongated couplers conforming to a percentage of the shape of the ring at either side of the ring that facilitate coupling and decreases transmission loss.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["365","325","330","320","300","325","315","330","320","300","325","315","330","300","305","320","320","310","315","325","330"]},"The couplers  and  are arcuate to conform to the resonating structure of the ring . As will be discussed below, further embodiments may include couplers that are conformal to resonators that are not of a circular ring shape. The conformal embodiments will have couplers greater in size than the connected feed lines, and such that the length is a substantial percentage of the resonator ring shape.","Capacitive coupling is enhanced by adding elongated couplers ( and ) to the ends of the input line  and output line  closest to the resonating ring . In the illustrated embodiment, the couplers ( and ) form shapes similar to the edges of the resonating element , and in this example the couplers ( and ) are arcs of substantially the same width (arrow ) as the resonating ring . The arc length of the couplers ( and ) may be expressed as a percentage of the inner diameter of the ring . For impedance matching, input and output lines and couplers (, , , and ) to the ring  have substantially the same thickness (arrow ). In other embodiments, the thickness and\/or width of the ring  may be different from the thickness and\/or width of the couplers ( and ).","The resonating ring  comprises a conductive material with a continuous inner radius r(shown as ) and a continuous outer radius r(shown as ) on an exemplary Rogers 4350B substrate , with a height h (shown as ). Insertion loss from input line  to the ring  and to output line  is reduced by decreasing the spatial separation of the coupling gaps (arrows  and ) while increasing the size the input and output couplers ( and ). Excessive loss for a ring resonator will cause the input output characteristic to fall below the noise floor of the network analyzer and the resonant peak will be lost. Coupling gaps (arrows  and ) have been exaggeratedly separated from the ring  to facilitate understanding.","To determine microstrip dimensions necessary to form an exemplary 50-\u03a9 line that resonates at the desired frequency f, the following relationships are
