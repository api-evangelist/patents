No. 12\/271,477, filed Nov. 14, 2008 now U.S. Pat. No. 8,486,208, which is a continuation-in-part of co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/186,310, filed Jul. 21, 2005 now abandoned, which is itself a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/633,943, filed Aug. 4, 2003 now abandoned. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/271,477, filed Nov. 14, 2008, also claims the benefit of priority to U.S. Patent Application No. 60\/988,676, filed Nov. 16, 2007. Each of the applications identified above is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.","Pavement marking was an early method used for directing motor and foot traffic. In the era of brick roads, different colored bricks were used to convey safety information. Later, paint was used; however, early paints had poor durability under the demanding conditions of foot and motorized traffic and the environment. In addition, pavement painting was usually a time consuming and disruptive task. Paint required drying time and traffic had to be kept off the painted surface until drying was complete. Rain, cold and heat adversely affected the drying time and the success of the operation. Once paint was dry and in use, it was often difficult to remove when changes in the traffic pattern were required.","More recently, pavement tapes have been used for marking pavement, for example, to delineate pedestrian crossings and lane markings. Although pavement tapes could be applied more quickly than paint, reducing traffic disruptions, early pavement marking tapes had limited visibility and poor durability under many road conditions. Improved tapes permitted long-term or temporary application and provided skid resistance, low-temperature durability, high-temperature durability and reflectivity.","Despite advances in pavement-marking tapes, motorists and pedestrians have been provided with minimal information, such as sidewalk and crosswalk delineation, centerlines and other road markings, at best. On the other hand, Applicant's information-conveying pavement tape may provide, for example, information of a commercial nature, and in a manner that is efficient, effective and safe. \u201cCommercial information\u201d, as used herein, may include the following: commercial advertising, for example, advertising of available real-estate, tourist attractions and businesses such as home improvement stores, hardware stores, department stores and other shops, restaurants, bars, beer, liquor, grocery stores, gas stations, hotels, motels, entertainment venues and the like; event advertising, such as advertising for sales, concerts, theater productions, festivals and other events; directional information, for example, maps, compass points, mile markers and directions to area businesses or tourist attractions; tourist information such as interesting area facts, things to do in the area, operating hours of area attractions and the like; solicitations, for example, by community agencies or charitable institutions; and\/or public safety information, including information about traffic conditions, road conditions, detour requirements, turn requirements, the presence of pedestrians, and safety reminders such as \u201cbe a designated driver,\u201d and the like.","The claims at the end of this specification set forth a full and accurate description of Applicant's information-conveying pavement tape, which may illustratively include one or more of the following embodiments.","In one embodiment, a paving advertisement comprises an elongated flexible tape body having a base substrate layer with front and rear faces, the front face comprising at least one text message that conveys information where the base substrate layer is treated with a cold crack additive for increasing strength and flexibility.","In one embodiment, a method of conveying information from pavement includes treating a base substrate layer of an elongated flexible tape with cold crack additive; printing at least one text message conveying information on a front face; combining an upper substrate layer with the front face of the base substrate layer; and bonding a rear face of the base substrate layer to a section of pavement.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","101","102","101","102","102","102","100","100","101","101"]},"Pavement tape  may serve as a pavement sign conveying commercial information, based on the letters of a language. For example, pavement tape  may serve to convey information to people traversing the pavement, or to motorists. Pavement signs based on the letters of a language may serve a variety of purposes, including delineating parking spaces in a parking lot, advertising and directing consumers to businesses proximate the parking lot, conveying traffic conditions, road conditions, detour requirements, turn requirements and\/or the presence of pedestrians. Lettered pavement signs may, for example, delineate parking areas for the disabled or advertise goods or services of local, national or international purveyors. In other contexts, lettered pavement signs may convey solicitations by community agencies or charitable institutions, directions to community landmarks, public safety reminders, such as \u201cknow when to say when,\u201d \u201cbe a designated driver,\u201d and the like. When sponsored by a company or business, such signs may also include the name of the sponsor, allowing the sponsoring company, for example, to leverage their charitable support by advertising and associating their company name with the charity.","Pavement tape  may convey commercial information of a particular interest to out of town motorists and pedestrians. For example, pavement tape  may include symbols  that convey information about and\/or directions to tourist attractions; restaurants; bars; hotels; coffee shops; grocery stores; gas stations; entertainment venues; and commercial establishments such as home improvement stores, hardware stores, department stores and malls. Symbols  may also convey advertisements for area real-estate and\/or special events including concerts, plays, sales, and festivals, for example.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["100","101","101","103","104","105","103","105","104","103","103"],"sup":"2"},"Thus, symbols  may be printed upon front face  of base substrate layer . Symbols  may be digitally printed upon front face , for example using a solvent-based ink jet printer. For outdoor applications, a long-lasting outdoor ink, for example a Scitex\u00ae vision 200 series five year outdoor ink, may be used in combination with a Scitex\u00ae printer for printing symbols  upon front face .","A first adhesive layer A is for example a pressure sensitive adhesive that couples with rear face . The pressure sensitive adhesive may be a weather- and solvent-resistant acrylic adhesive having the following specifications:","thickness\u22480.05 mm;","basic weight\u2248130 g\/m;","initial tack\u22674;","holding power\u22678;","solvent retention\u22661.5;","temperature range\u2248\u221225\u00b0 C. to 80\u00b0 C.; and","release force 15 kg\/25 mm.","First adhesive layer A may alternatively be a 0.005 inch rubber adhesive; Ritrama Duramark\u00ae part number 3-8590-10000 (also known as VYW-3.25-M-86-50G) may serve as tape body  and adhesive layer A, for example.","An upper substrate layer  protects front face  of base substrate layer . Upper substrate layer  includes a second adhesive layer  at least partially covered by a protective layer , for example, a vinyl film. Upper substrate layer  is for example a pressure sensitive, weather-resistant acrylic adhesive covered with an 18 mm, 235 g\/mvinyl PVC film. The acrylic adhesive layer  may thus have the following specifications:","thickness\u22480.028 mm;","basic weight\u224828 g\/m;","initial tack\u22679;","holding power\u226748 hours;","temperature range\u2248\u221225\u00b0 C. to 50\u00b0 C.;","180\u00b0 C. peel adhesive\u22480.005 kg\/inch; and","release force\u22480.0045 kg\/25 mm.","A smooth, transparent PVC film having a matte finish may provide for easy viewing of symbols  while reducing glare from sunlight, streetlights or headlights, for example.","Protective layer  may be a suitable protective material, for example a siliconized paper layer, and adhesive layer  may be a suitably strong, weather resistant adhesive. Upper substrate layer  is for example a plasticized embossed polyvinyl chloride, poly-acrylic ester based adhesive covered with siliconized paper, such as 7.4 mil vinyl GBC Arctic\u2122. Grain produced by GBC Industrial and Print Finishing Group.","Upper substrate layer  joins with base substrate layer  at front face . For example, upper substrate layer  may be joined with base substrate layer  by placing upper substrate layer  atop base substrate layer  such that second adhesive layer  contacts and adheres to front face . The joined substrate layers ,  may be fixed together, for example, by laminating (e.g., cold laminating) upper substrate layer  to base substrate layer .","Upper substrate layer may include a release tape for protecting second adhesive layer . For example, Kraft paper coated with polyethylene (PE) and silicon, such as a 120\u00b16 g\/mPE lame paper may be releasably bonded to second adhesive layer . Such a release tape is removed from second adhesive layer  prior to placing upper substrate layer  atop base substrate layer .","As shown in the perspective view of , tape body  is relatively thick, and not necessarily to scale. And there is no requirement for this particular thickness. The thickness of tape body  is a matter of design choice, depending on the intended application. The size and orientation of symbols  is also a matter of design choice. As shown in , symbols  of pavement tape  are approximately half the width of tape body , and are positioned in a line with the vertical axis of the symbols perpendicular to an edge of tape body . This size, position and orientation of symbols  is not a requirement, but rather is application dependent. At one extreme, the symbols may take up close to the entire width of the tape. At the other extreme, the symbols may be as small as permitted by the application. For example, smaller symbols may be required where symbols are stacked on top of one another across the width of the tape. Depending upon the application, the symbols may also vary in height as compared to one another. Furthermore, symbols  may vary in position and orientation. For example, there is no requirement that a symbol or symbols be oriented with a vertical axis perpendicular to an edge of tape body . Depending on the application, a symbol may have a broad range of angular orientations relative to one or both edges of tape body . Additionally, symbols may have a broad range of angular orientations relative to one another. For example, the vertical axis of one symbol may be perpendicular to the vertical axis of another symbol.","As illustrated by , the symbols of pavement tape  also may be non-language symbols.  depicts a top view of a section of another continuous pavement tape . The symbols  of this pavement tape are fanciful, comprising a star, a snowman and a snowflake. Symbols  also could relate to motorist activity or safety. Thus, symbols  could be turn arrows, stop indicators, road condition indicators, detour indicators, pedestrian or crosswalk indicators, bicycle lane indicators and\/or disabled indicators. Beyond this, symbols  may be graphic representations or photographs depicting commercial establishments such as hotels, motels, bars, eating establishments, shopping centers, gas stations and\/or other services of interest to motorists, cyclists and\/or pedestrians. As used herein, the term \u201cmotorist\u201d includes operators and passengers of vehicles, including cars, trucks, buses, motorcycles and other known vehicles. Symbols  may thus include both language-based symbols to form a composite message and\/or advertisement for the motorist, cyclist or pedestrian.","As shown in , the bases of symbols  are disposed along the horizontal axis of tape body . However, as previously noted, symbols  may have a broad range of angular orientations relative to one or both edges of tape body . For example,  shows alpha-numeric symbols  with their sides oriented along the horizontal axis of tape body , such that a motorist, cyclist or pedestrian approaching tape body  and moving in the direction of arrow  may easily read symbols . Continuous pavement tape  may be made, integrated or provided as a roll , for example as shown in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0072","num":"0071"},"figref":"FIG. 4A","b":["100","102","102","102","102","100"]},"Pavement tape  may be placed at or before an intersection, such that approaching motorists, cyclists and pedestrians may read the composite advertisement while approaching the intersection. Pavement tape  may also be placed in the center of an intersection, thus allowing motorists, cyclists and pedestrians the opportunity to read pavement tape  while stopped at a traffic light. As shown in , the composite advertisement formed by symbols A-C is oriented along the long, horizontal axis of tape body . However, as shown in , the composite advertisement may also be oriented along the vertical axis of tape body  such that pedestrians approaching a pavement tape placed at a crosswalk are able to easily read the tape. Other orientations of the composite advertisement (e.g., symbols A-C) are within the scope of this disclosure.","Alpha-numeric symbols  may be printed onto tape body  in a color or colors contrasting with the color or colors of tape body . For example, symbols  may be digitally printed onto tape body  using a palette of outdoor inks that contrast with the colors of tape body . In a specific example, tape body  may be red and black; symbols  may be printed in red and white ink upon the black portion or portions of tape body , and printed in black and white ink upon the red portion or portions of tape body .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0075","num":"0074"},"figref":["FIG. 4B","FIG. 4C"],"b":["100","150","152","106","101","150","154","152","154","156","154","152","101","152","150","154","150","154"]},"Further, it should be apparent that switch  may also connect to audio storage and playback circuitry , which then also connects to speaker  by wires . Audio storage and playback circuitry  may include a recorder A, to record and\/or store audible information for playback, and\/or a memory (not shown), to store recorded audible information; it may also be digitally programmable. Where amplification of the played audible information is desired, for example at a busy intersection, an amplifier B may also be included in circuitry . Audio storage and playback circuitry  is also shown attached to light post ; however, as with speaker , audio storage and playback circuitry  may be positioned at any convenient location (e.g., within tape body , such as when circuitry  is configured as an ASIC), and may not require wires  when in wireless communication with switch .","Switch  may be pressure-activated, such that pressure applied to switch  triggers play of pre-recorded information at speaker . In the embodiment of , the pre-recorded information may be commercial information, such as an advertisement for a home improvement store sale; however, pre-recorded information may also include music, public safety announcements, tourist information, event advertising and\/or directional information. Switch  may also activate lights  disposed within, atop, below or remote from tape body . In one embodiment, lights  with tape body  are LEDs. As shown in , lights  surround a message composed of symbols B. Lights  may also form symbols A-C, provide a border for tape body  and\/or be otherwise placed so as to draw attention to part or all of tape body .","In an example of operation, a person's footstep upon switch  triggers lights  and\/or play of pre-recorded information relating to one or more of symbols A-C, forming a composite audiovisual advertisement. Since one or more lights (e.g., light A) may be proximate to tape body , such a light A may be a streetlight, a light mounted on an adjacent building or structure, and\/or one or more lights disposed elsewhere upon a section of pavement. Thus, lights  may delineate a crosswalk in a street or parking lot, or a curb. A timer (not shown) may also be incorporated into pavement tape  such that lights  remain illuminated for a selected time following activation of switch .

As shown in , sound chip  is connected to pressure-activated switch . Pressure upon switch , for example, by foot , initiates play of the pre-recorded information from sound chip . Multiple sound chips  and switches  may be included in one pavement tape, such that a person \u201cplays\u201d a composite advertisement including a variety of pre-recorded information while traversing the pavement tape and activating switches . Pressure activated switches  may likewise activate lights , such that wires  are not needed. Switches  may include electrodes (e.g., electrodes A, B of switch ) that complete a circuit upon contacting one another, thus activating sound chip , for example.","Pavement tape  may also be wholly or partly reflective. For example, symbols  may also be printed, in whole or in part, with a reflective ink, such that at least a portion of a symbol  is reflective. Alternately or additionally, at least a portion of base substrate layer  or upper substrate layer  of tape body  may be wholly or partially reflective, thus lending a reflective quality to at least a portion of tape body .

Reflective paint may be used in place of reflective glass beads . Alternately, other materials that contrast with symbols  may accomplish the same or a comparable result, especially when pavement tape  is viewed in daylight. In daylight applications, reflective glass beads may be replaced by alternative contrast materials such as bright paints and\/or plastics impregnated with bright pigments. Such alternative contrast materials may be superior to reflective glass beads in daylight applications. For example, tape body  may usefully be coated on its top surface with a bright paint or plastic rather than reflective glass beads , or simply be formed of an appropriately bright material. On the other hand, symbols  may be formed of glass beads  or other alternative contrast material, leaving tape body  relatively dark.","There is no requirement that reflective glass beads  or other alternative contrast materials be placed over the entire front surface of tape body . Reflective glass beads  may be placed over a smaller area of tape body  if the application so dictates. Other materials may be used in areas where reflective glass beads  are not present. For example, a bright paint might be used to create a pavement tape that is useful in both day and night applications, or a different type of reflective glass bead might be used to enhance night performance.

Its bottom surface B is coated with an adhesive of the same type used to bond perforated pavement tape  to pavement  (e.g., as used in first adhesive layer A) although this is not a requirement. Mask tape  is perforated by mask perforation  with boundaries  and , which exceed boundaries  and  of perforated pavement tape  at all points, as depicted in .","When mask tape  is bonded to perforated pavement tape  so that mask perforation  is aligned directly above symbol perforation , as illustrated in , a viewer will observe the green surface of mask tape body  interrupted by the star-shaped mask perforation . Behind mask perforation , the viewer will observe the smaller, circular symbol perforation  of perforated pavement tape . That symbol will be as black as the pavement beneath it and surrounded by the red of tape body  up to the boundaries imposed by mask perforation  of mask tape body . The visual result will be a red star with a black center in a green backdrop.","It is to be understood and appreciated that alternate configurations of perforated pavement tape  and mask tape  may also be implemented. For example, base substrate layer  (e.g., ) may be a perforated pavement tape and upper substrate layer  may be a mask tape.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0117","num":"0116"},"figref":["FIG. 21","FIG. 16","FIG. 21"],"b":["109","110","110","109","216"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0118","num":"0117"},"figref":["FIG. 22","FIG. 23","FIG. 22"],"b":["200","201","217","217","218","200"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0119","num":"0118"},"figref":["FIG. 24","FIG. 25","FIG. 25"],"b":["2500","2501","2502","2500","2501","2500","2501","2503","2504","2505","2503","2905","2905","2905"]},"Text message  may be printed upon front face  of base substrate layer . Text message  may be digitally printed upon front face . For outdoor applications, a long-lasting outdoor ink may be used for printing text message  upon front face . Text message  prompts the consumers to interact directly with the advertiser such as to retrieve a message or a discount, for example.","First adhesive layer A, applied to the rear face , may be a pressure sensitive adhesive. The pressure sensitive adhesive may be a weather- and solvent-resistant acrylic adhesive having similar specifications to those described above. In one embodiment, first adhesive layer A may be a rubber adhesive that serves as both tape body  and adhesive layer A at the same time.","An upper substrate layer , including a second adhesive layer , protects front face  of base substrate layer . Upper substrate layer  is, for example, a pressure sensitive, weather-resistant acrylic adhesive covered with an 18 mm, 235 g\/mvinyl PVC film. The acrylic adhesive layer  may thus have similar specifications as to those adhesive layers described above. A smooth, transparent PVC film having a matte finish may provide be added to for easy viewing of text message , while reducing glare from sunlight, streetlights, or headlights, for example. Protective layer , partially covering the upper substrate layer , may be a suitable protective material, such as a siliconized paper layer, and adhesive layer  may be a suitably strong, weather resistant adhesive.","Upper substrate layer  joins with base substrate layer  at front face . For example, upper substrate layer  may be joined with base substrate layer  by placing upper substrate layer  atop base substrate layer  such that second adhesive layer  contacts and adheres to front face .
