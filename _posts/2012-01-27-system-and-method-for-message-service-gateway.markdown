{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates generally to telecommunications services. More particularly, the present invention relates to capabilities that enhance substantially the value and usefulness of various communication paradigms including, inter alia, Short Message Service (SMS), Multimedia Message Service (MMS), Internet Protocol (IP) Multimedia Subsystem (IMS), Wireless Application Protocol (WAP), Electronic Mail (E-Mail), Instant Messaging (IM), Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD), etc.","2. Background of the Invention","As the \u2018wireless revolution\u2019 continues to march forward through various flavors of 2G, 3G, 4G, and beyond, the importance to a Mobile Subscriber (MS)\u2014for example a user of a Wireless Device (WD) that is serviced by possibly inter alia a Wireless Carrier (WC)\u2014of their WD grows substantially. Examples of WDs include, possibly inter alia, mobile telephones, smart phones, handheld computers, Internet-enabled phones, pagers, radios, TVs, audio devices, car audio (and other) systems, recorders, text-to-speech devices, bar-code scanners, net appliances, mini-browsers, personal data assistants (PDAs), etc.","One consequence of such a growing importance is the resulting ubiquitous nature of WDs\u2014i.e., MSs carry them at almost all times and use them for an ever-increasing range of activities. For example, MSs employ their WDs to, possibly inter alia:","1) Exchange messages with other MSs (e.g., \u201cLet's meet for dinner at 6\u201d) through Peer-to-Peer, or P2P, messaging.","2) Secure information (such as, for example, weather updates, travel alerts, news updates, sports scores, etc.), participate in voting initiatives (such as, for example, with the television show American Idol\u00ae), interact with social networking sites, etc. through an Application-to-Peer, or A2P, campaign, initiative, etc. as offered by a Content Provider (CP).","3) Engage in for example Mobile Commerce (which, broadly speaking, encompasses the buying and selling of merchant-supplied products, goods, and services through a WD) and Mobile Banking (which, broadly speaking, encompasses performing various banking activities through a WD).","During participation in a CP A2P campaign, initiative, etc. a MS may need to complete one or more opt-in and\/or opt-out activities. For example:","1) An opt-in process may among other things confirm, ensure, etc. that a MS does indeed wish to participate in a CP campaign, initiative, etc. and among other things receive, and possibly pay for, any (SMS, MMS, IMS, etc.) messages that may be sent to their WD in connection with the campaign, initiative, etc.","2) An opt-out process may among other things confirm, ensure, etc. that a MS does indeed wish to end their participation in a CP campaign, initiative, etc. to which the MS had previously opted-in.","Opt-in and opt-out processes can be complicated, involved, etc. and among other things may necessitate an understanding of, involvement by, etc. a CP in the technical aspects of the world of (SMS, MMS, IMS, etc.) messaging. This can represent a significant challenge for a CP since CPs frequently do not have such technical expertise.","What is needed is a flexible, extensible, dynamically configurable, etc. message service gateway that offers inter alia a fa\u00e7ade through which a CP, among others, may simply and easily complete among other things opt-in and opt-out activities. Such a fa\u00e7ade may inter alia hide various of the complexities, technical aspects, etc. of (SMS, MMS, IMS, etc.) messaging.","Aspects of the present invention fills the lacuna that was noted above by (1) providing aspects of a message service gateway while (2) addressing, in new and innovatory ways, various of the not insubstantial challenges that are associated with same.","In one embodiment of the present invention there is provided a server-based method for transiting an SMS message comprising (1) receiving, via a first protocol, a service invocation (i.e., an invocation of one of a plurality of services that is offered through a fa\u00e7ade) including among other things one or more service arguments and (2) completing a plurality of processing steps including at least (a) validating aspects of the service arguments, (b) examining aspects of the service arguments to at least identify a destination WC, and (c) transiting at least aspects of the SMS message, via a second protocol that is different than the first protocol, towards the destination WC.","In another embodiment of the present invention there is provided a processor-based system on a server that is configured to transit an SMS message, the processor-based system comprising (1) a fa\u00e7ade through which one or more services is offered, via a first protocol, with each of the offered services accepting one or more arguments, (2) workflow modules configured to perform a plurality of processing steps, responsive to invocation of one of the offered services, including at least (a) validating aspects of the service arguments and (b) examining aspects of the service arguments to at least identify a destination WC, and (3) a gateway for transiting at least aspects of the SMS message, via a second protocol that is different that the first protocol, towards the destination WC.","Further features and advantages of the present invention, as well as the structure and operation of various embodiments thereof, are described in detail below with reference to the accompanying drawings.

Reference is made to U.S. Pat. No. 7,154,901 entitled \u201cINTERMEDIARY NETWORK SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR FACILITATING MESSAGE EXCHANGE BETWEEN WIRELESS NETWORKS,\u201d and its associated continuations, for a discussion of the concept of a MICV, a summary of various of the services\/functions\/etc. that may be performed by a MICV, and a discussion of various of the advantages that may arise from same.","A MICV may, for example, be realized through any combination of, possibly inter alia, any one or more of (1) an element of a WC, an element of a landline carrier, or multiple such elements working together; (2) a Third-Party (3P) such as possibly inter alia a merchant, a CP, a financial institution, a Service Provider (SP, such as for example a hosting firm, etc.), etc.; (3) multiple 3P entities working together; (4) a service bureau; (5) a message service provider, and\/or (6) other entities.","Consider for a moment the exemplary MICV  that is depicted (albeit only partially, at a high-level, and from a logical perspective) in  and reference numeral . The illustrated MICV  is disposed between, possibly inter alia, multiple WCs (WC, WC, WC) on one side and multiple CPs (CP . . . CP) and SPs (SP . . . SP) on the other side and is, in effect, a horizontally and vertically scalable \u2018hub\u2019 that may among other things \u2018bridge\u2019 all of the connected entities and inter alia facilitate the ubiquitous exchange of traffic (including, inter alia, data, SMS messages, MMS messages, IMS messages, USSD-based data, etc.) between various of the connected participants. A MICV  thus, as one simple example, may offer various routing, formatting, delivery, value-add, etc. capabilities that provide, possibly inter alia:","1) A WC WC . . . WC (and, by extension, all of the MSs (MS . . . MS, MS . . . MS, MS . . . MS) that are serviced by WC . . . WC) with ubiquitous access to a broad universe of CPs (such as CP . . . CP) and SPs (such as SP . . . SP), and","2) A CP (such as CP . . . CP) or a SP (such as SP . . . SP) with ubiquitous access to a broad universe of WCs WC . . . WC (and, by extension, to all of the MSs (MS . . . MS, MS . . . MS, MS . . . MS) that are serviced by WC . . . WC).","Generally speaking a MICV may have varying degrees of visibility (e.g., access, etc.) to the (MS-MS, MS-CP, MS-SP, etc.) messaging traffic. For example:","1) A WC may elect to route just their out-of-network messaging traffic to a MICV. Under this approach the MICV would have visibility (e.g., access, etc.) to just the portion of the WC's messaging traffic that was directed to the MICV by the WC.","2) A WC may elect to route all of their messaging traffic to a MICV. The MICV may, possibly among other things, subsequently return to the WC that portion of the messaging traffic that belongs to (i.e., that is destined for a MS of) the WC. Under this approach the MICV would have visibility (e.g., access, etc.) to all of the WC's messaging traffic.","While the discussion below will include a MICV, it will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the relevant art that numerous other arrangements are equally applicable and indeed are fully within the scope of the present invention.","As just one example of an alternative arrangement, aspects of the present invention may be offered by a SP.

Thus, unless otherwise indicated, it will be understood that reference to a particular message generally includes that particular message as conveyed at any stage between an origination source, such as for example a MS, and an end receiver, such as for example a CP. As such, reference to a particular message generally includes a series of related communications between, for example, a MS and a WC; a WC and a MICV; a MICV and a CP; etc. The series of related communications may, in general, contain substantially the same information, or information may be added or subtracted in different communications that nevertheless may be generally referred to as a same message.
