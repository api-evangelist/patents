{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present invention relates generally to a reception display device and a reception display method for receiving digital broadcasts. More specifically, the invention relates to a receiver (IRD: integrated receiver decoder) for receiving and decoding digital broadcasts containing interactive user guides.","In digital broadcasting systems today, video data and audio data for a channel is compression-coded using an MPEG (Motion Picture Experts Group) algorithm and formed into packets, commonly referred to as a TS (transport stream) packet. TS packets for a plurality of channels are multiplexed to generate a transport stream and then transmitted as a digital broadcasting signal via a communication medium such as a cable or an air interface for wireless communication.","In a digital broadcasting system, a receiver extracts compressed video data and compressed audio data for a desired channel from the TS packets which are included in the transport stream received as a digital broadcasting signal, and decodes them to reproduce the video data and audio data.","Normally, in such a receiver, reproduced images are displayed on a monitor which is integrally provided or is connected with a cable.","The receiver typically has a function called a resident GUI (Graphical User Interface) and stores software for performing the display processing of the resident GUI in an internal memory as an application program. A CPU executes the software for the resident GUI in response to a user's operations. A graphic section controlled by this software generates a resident GUI screen and performs display processing so as to superimpose and display it on a program screen being received.","The resident GUI screen usually includes a display of the selected channel (a channel banner), a setting menu for the receiver, a list of favorite channels, an EPG (electronic program guide), and various messages for users.","In recent years, in addition to conventional video broadcasts, a variety of data broadcasting services, such as broadcasting music, game software, and the like, have been offered. Such a data broadcasting service is interactive, allowing a user to obtain desired information and to download music and game software by his operations.","An interactive program is a program which does not relate to and is independent of television programs. In the interactive program, a software program for displaying an operation screen (hereinafter, referred to as an interactive GUI) is also transmitted from a broadcasting station in addition to various data such as a motion picture, a still picture, a sound, or a letter, so that a user can perform various operations while watching a screen. Languages such as an MHEG (Multimedia and Hypermedia information coding Experts Group) and XML (extensible Markup Language) are used for the description of the software program for displaying this interactive GUI. A CPU of the receiver, receiving such an interactive program, reads a language such as MHEG and XML, to perform processing operations in accordance with the received program.","The resident GUI screen and the interactive GUI screen may be displayed at the same time on the same monitor. As shown in , it is possible to display a screen having a resident GUI screen F superimposed on a program picture FO and further, an interactive GUI screen F superimposed on them. It is also possible to display a screen having an interactive GUI screen superimposed on the program picture FO and further, a resident GUI screen superimposed on them.","Such cases present a problem in that the front GUI can be seen but parts of the underlying GUI can not be seen where the resident GUI screen and the interactive GUI screen overlap. Setting menus of the resident GUI or operation buttons of the interactive GUI may be hidden and desired operations can not be performed.","One prior art method of solving such a problem changes a display position of the resident GUI to simultaneously display the resident GUI screen and the interactive GUI screen on the same monitor. However, new software must be developed for the resident GUI which must then take into account all interactive GUI formats and increases development time and cost.","The present invention has been made in view of the aforementioned problems, and is intended to provide a receiver and a method of controlling graphic display which solve the aforementioned problems.","The present invention provides a control section, a first display processing section for performing graphic display processing based on a program stored in a memory connected to the control section, under the control of the control section, and a second display processing section for performing graphic display processing based on a control signal included in a signal for a channel being received, under the control of the control section. The control section performs control so as to display a graphic screen display-processed by either first or second display processing section.","Further, according to the present invention, in a method of controlling graphic display of the receiver which provides the first display processing section for performing graphic display processing based on a program previously stored in a memory and the second display processing section for performing graphic display processing based on a control signal included in a signal for a channel being received, control is performed so as to display a graphic screen display-processed by either first or second display processing section.","As a result, it is possible to prevent a graphic screen display-processed by the first display processing section and a graphic screen display-processed by the second display processing section from being overlapped and moreover, to utilize a conventional control program for the first display processing section as it is.","An embodiment of the present invention will be hereinafter described with reference to the drawings.","(1) Construction of the Receiver","In , numeral  shows a receiver to which the present invention is applied, and a digital broadcast S in which video data, audio data and the like for plural channels transmitted from broadcasting stations (not shown) are multiplexed, is received by a tuner  in the receiver  via an antenna .","In this receiver , an input section  (various buttons, an infrared sensor for a remote commander and so on) is connected to a CPU  with a bus  so that a user can control the CPU  with various commands such as a channel selection, with the input section . A memory  is connected to this CPU  with the bus . This memory stores software programs for performing various processing. The CPU  loads a software program from the memory  in response to the given command and executes it.","In this way, the CPU  selects a channel specified by the user and returns a transport stream D through demodulation by a prescribed method, by controlling the tuner  based on the command given by the user.","Then, a descramble section , receiving the enciphered (scrambled) transport stream D, sequentially descrambles the scrambled transport stream and transmits the resultant transport stream D to a demultiplexer .","The demultiplexer  extracts TS packets D including video data and audio data for the channel specified by the user, from the transport stream D, and transmits these to an audio\/video (AV) decoder . In addition, the demultiplexer , when receiving TS packets including information necessary for the channel selection and a software program for performing display processing on an interactive GUI, extracts and transmits these to the CPU  through the bus .","The AV decoder  decodes the compressed video data and the compressed audio data included in the TS packets transmitted from the demultiplexer , to produce original video data D and audio data. The decoded video data D is transmitted to a first graphic section  and moreover, the decoded audio data is changed into an analog audio signal by a digital\/analog converting circuit not shown and then transmitted to an external monitor or television through an audio cable.","The first graphic section  and a second graphic section  are circuits to respectively produce a resident GUI and an interactive GUI and superimpose the GUI screens on a video signal. If it is not necessary to display the GUI screens, the supplied video data is output as it is. Note that, the first graphic section  and the second graphic section  can be constructed as two function blocks or can be integrally constructed as one function block. In the case where they are constructed as one block, a first work memory and a second work memory are also integrally constructed as one block.","When a channel which is selected does not include an interactive program and a user directs that the number of the selected channel, a setting menu for the receiver, a list of favorite channels, or an EPG should be displayed, the first graphic section  produces the desired resident GUI under the control of the CPU . Further, the first graphic section  uses the first work memory  to superimpose the produced resident GUI onto the video data D supplied from the AV decoder , and transmits the first superimposed video data D to an NTSC (National Television System Committee) encoder  through the second graphic section  as it is.","The NTSC encoder  converts the supplied first superimposed video data D into an NTSC standard video signal, and outputs this signal to an external monitor or television as an analog video signal S. In this way, the monitor or television displays pictures of broadcast based on the obtained analog video signal S.","When a channel being selected includes an interactive program, the CPU  executes a software program for the display processing of the received interactive GUI and performs control so as to make the second graphic section  produce the interactive GUI screen. The second graphic section , under the control of the CPU , produces the interactive GUI, and superimposes the produced interactive GUI on the video data D supplied from the first graphic section  by using the second work memory , and then transmits the result to the NTSC encoder  as second superimposed video data D.","The NTSC encoder  converts the given second superimposed video data D into an NTSC standard video signal and outputs this signal to the external monitor or television as an analog video signal S. Thus, the monitor or the television displays the interactive GUI screen based on the obtained analog video signal S.","(2) Display State on Screen of Monitor","(2-1) Processing at the time of Switching Channels","When a user directs that the number of the channel which is now selected is displayed as a resident GUI while the channel which does not include an interactive program is displayed, the display screen of the monitor shows the images of the broadcast based on the video data obtained from the received digital broadcast S and also shows the number of the channels superimposed at the upper side of the screen of the broadcast, as shown in . Note that, in the case of , not only the channel number \u201c700\u201d but also the name of the channel \u201cNATIVE CH\u201d and the logo of the channel \u201cnch\u201d are simultaneously displayed. The display of channel information is executed by the first graphic section . This information on a channel is referred to as a channel banner in the following description.","When the user intends to select another channel (for example, channel \u201c123\u201d) with the input section  or the remote commander, the number of the channel input by manipulating the input section  or the remote commander is displayed at the position where the channel banner is displayed as shown in . This display processing is performed by the first graphic section .","During selection of a new desired channel, the whole screen of the monitor is changed to a mute screen which is, for example, only blue and the channel number to be selected \u201c123\u201d is displayed, as shown in . The display processing of the blue mute screen and the channel number is performed by the first graphic section . When finishing the channel selection, the mute screen is changed to the screen of the broadcast of the new selected channel and moreover, the channel banner is displayed at the upper side of the screen of the broadcast, as shown in . As the channel banner, the channel number \u201c123\u201d, the name of the channel \u201cSPORTS CH\u201d, and the logo of the channel \u201c0\u201d are displayed. The display processing of this channel banner is performed by the first graphic section .","When the selected channel \u201c123\u201d is a channel including an interactive program, the resident GUI screen (channel banner) which has been displayed is deleted and the interactive GUI screen is superimposed and displayed on the screen of the broadcast instead, as shown in . The display processing of the interactive GUI screen is performed by the second graphic section . Note that four operation buttons are displayed as the interactive GUI screen shown in , as an example.","On the other hand, while a channel including the interactive program is now selected, the interactive GUI screen is superimposed and displayed on the screen of the broadcast based on the video data obtained from the received digital broadcast S on the display screen of the monitor, as shown in . This display processing of the interactive GUI screen is performed by the second graphic section .","Then, when the user inputs the number of another channel by manipulating the input section  or the remote commander, the number of the input channel is displayed as shown in . The display of the channel number is performed by the second graphic section . In general, the second graphic section  is controlled by the CPU  which reads a software program for displaying the interactive GUI which is transmitted from a broadcasting station. However, only when an order to change channels is made while the interactive GUI is displayed does the second graphic section  act for performing the display processing of the resident GUI, irrespective of the software program for the display processing of the interactive GUI transmitted from the broadcasting station. And during selection of the new ordered channel, the interactive GUI screen and the screen of the broadcast which have been displayed are deleted and changed to the mute screen which is, for example, only blue and the channel number to be selected \u201c700\u201d is displayed, as shown in . This display processing of the blue mute screen and the channel number is performed by the first graphic section .","If the selected channel is not broadcasted now, a message \u201cthis channel is not broadcasted\u201d is shown on the display screen of the monitor, as shown in . The display processing of this message is performed by the first graphic section .","On the other hand, when finishing the selection of the new channel, the mute screen is deleted, and the screen of the broadcast based on the video data obtained from the digital broadcast S is displayed and the channel banner is superimposed and displayed on the screen of the broadcast as shown in . The display processing of this channel banner is performed by the first graphic section .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 5","FIG. 2","FIG. 3"],"b":"6"},"In , the processing starts in step , and in step  it is repeatedly judged whether an order to select a new channel has been made. When it is judged that the order to select a new channel has been made, the processing proceeds to step  to judge whether the channel which has been received includes an interactive program. When the channel being received does not include the interactive program, the processing proceeds to step  to control the first graphic section  so as to display the number of the new ordered channel. Then, in step , the tuner  is controlled to start the selection operation, and the first graphic section  is controlled to perform the display processing of the mute screen and the channel number. It is judged in step  whether the channel selection has been finished. When it is judged that the channel selection has been finished, the processing proceeds to step  to judge whether the new selected channel is broadcasted. When it is judged that the new selected channel is broadcasted, the processing proceeds to step  to make the first graphic section  display the channel banner under control. Then, the processing proceeds to step  to judge whether the new selected channel includes the interactive program. When the interactive program is detected, the processing proceeds to step  to make the second graphic section  perform the display processing of the interactive GUI under control. When the interactive program is not detected and it is judged in step  that the prescribed time has passed, the first graphic section  is controlled to cancel the display of the channel banner. Further, when it is judged in step  that the new selected channel is not broadcasted, the processing proceeds to step  to make the first graphic section  display a message indicating that the channel is not broadcasted, under control.","Further, when it is judged in step  that the channel being received includes the interactive program, the processing proceeds to step  in  to judge whether the interactive GUI has been displayed. If the interactive GUI has not been displayed, the processing proceeds to step  and the following steps in . On the other hand, if the interactive GUI has been displayed, the processing proceeds to step  in  to perform the display processing of the number of the new selected channel by the second graphic section . After that, the selection operation is started by controlling the tuner  in step  and the display processing of the mute screen and the channel number is performed by controlling the first graphic section . Then, in step , it is judged whether the channel selection has been finished. If it is judged that the channel selection has been finished, the processing proceeds to step  to judge whether the new selected channel is broadcasted. When it is judged that the new selected channel is broadcasted, the processing proceeds to step  to make the first graphic section  display the channel banner under control. After that, the processing proceeds to step  to judge whether the new selected channel includes the interactive program. When the interactive program is detected, the processing proceeds to step  to make the second graphic section  display the interactive GUI under control. When the interactive program is not detected and it is judged in step  that the prescribed time has passed, the first graphic section  is controlled to cancel the display of the channel banner. Further, when it is judged in step  that the new selected channel is not broadcasted, the processing proceeds to step  to make the first graphic section  display a message indicating that the channel is not broadcasted, under control.","(2-2) Display State at the Time of Turning Power on","Next, the processing at the time of turning power on by manipulating the input section  by a user will be described. When the power is turned on, the display screen of the monitor is changed from the no-displaying state shown in  to the state where the channel which was selected at the last power-off is displayed.","When the interactive program is not detected in the selected channel of this time, the images of the broadcast based on the video data obtained from the received digital broadcasting S are normally displayed and the channel banner and the network logo \u201cSTV\u201d are also displayed. The display processing of the channel banner and the network logo is performed by the graphic section .","Then, after about three minutes passes, only the network logo is deleted and only the channel banner is superimposed and displayed on the screen of the broadcast, as shown in . The display processing of the channel banner is performed by the first graphic section .","On the other hand, when it is detected that the selected channel is a channel including the interactive program, the display screen of the monitor becomes a mute screen which is, for example, only gray and moreover, the channel banner and the network logo are superimposed and displayed, as shown in . Here, the display processing of the mute screen, the channel banner, and the network logo is performed by the first graphic section .","Then, after three minutes passes, the channel banner and the network logo are deleted from the display screen of the monitor and the images of the broadcast and the interactive GUI are displayed, as shown in . The display processing of the interactive GUI is performed by the second graphic section .","Further, in the state shown in  or in , when it is detected that the selected channel is a channel including the interactive program, the display screen of the monitor is changed to the display screen shown in  or in , respectively. That is, when the interactive program is detected in the state shown in , the first graphic section  performs the display processing of generating a gray mute screen and superimposing the channel banner and the network logo on this mute screen. On the other hand, when the interactive program is detected in the state shown in , the first graphic section  finishes the display processing of the channel banner and the second graphic section  newly performs the display processing of the interactive GUI.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0062"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 6"],"b":"6"},"At first, the processing starts in step , and in step , it is detected that the power is turned on.

When it is judged the interactive program is included, the processing proceeds to step  to make the first graphic section  display the mute screen, the channel banner, and the network logo on the screen under control. Then, after the prescribed time (for example, three minutes) passes, the first graphic section  is controlled to delete the channel banner and the network logo. And in step , the second graphic section  is controlled to display the interactive GUI.","On the other hand, in step , when it is detected that the interactive program is not included, the processing proceeds to step  to make the first graphic section display the channel banner and the network logo under control. Then, it is judged in step  whether the prescribed time has passed. When it has not passed, it is judged in step  whether the interactive program is detected. And when the interactive program is detected, the processing proceeds to step  and the following steps which were described. On the other hand, when the interactive program is not detected, the processing returns to step . Then, when it is judged in step  that the prescribed time has passed, the processing proceeds to step  to delete the network logo and it is repeatedly judged in step  whether the interactive program is detected. When the interactive program is detected in step , the processing proceeds to step  to make the second graphic section  display the interactive GUI under control.","The reason the detection of the interactive program is performed in step  and step  though it is performed in step  in  is because the time is required for the detection of the interactive program.","(2-3) Processing for the Case Where an Order to Display a List of Favorite Channels or Resident GUI such as EPG is made during Interactive GUI is Displayed","Next, the processing for the case where an order to display a list of favorite channels or resident GUI such as EPG is made during an interactive GUI is displayed will be described.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0069","num":"0068"},"figref":"FIG. 8(A)","b":"13"},"In this case, the background is, for example, only gray, and the list of favorite channels or EPG desired is superimposed and displayed.
