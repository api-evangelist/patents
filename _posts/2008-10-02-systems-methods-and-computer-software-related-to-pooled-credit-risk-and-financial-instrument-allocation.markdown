The figures constitute a part of this specification and include illustrative embodiments of the present invention and illustrate various objects and features thereof.","Detailed embodiments of the present invention are disclosed herein; however, it is to be understood that the disclosed embodiments are merely illustrative of the invention that may be embodied in various forms. In addition, each of the examples given in connection with the various embodiments of the invention is intended to be illustrative, and not restrictive. Further, the figures are not necessarily to scale, some features may be exaggerated to show details of particular components (and any size, material and similar details shown in the figures are, of course, intended to be illustrative and not restrictive). Therefore, specific structural and functional details disclosed herein are not to be interpreted as limiting, but merely as a representative basis for teaching one skilled in the art to variously employ the present invention.","As described herein, various embodiments of the present invention relate to a pooled credit risk warehouse. In one example, credit risk may be pooled (e.g., by an entity, a system, a method, and\/or a computer algorithm) amongst all participants (the entity may be subsequently delta neutral\u2014meaning that the entity has no exposure to the change in value or price of contracts offered).","In another example, the entity that is delta neutral is not a party to the transaction(s).","In another example, the participants may have exposure to interest rates and to each other.","In another example, positions amongst participants may be held (e.g., temporarily held) in this pool, whereby the reporting of account balances, risk, and profits and losses are managed (e.g., by the entity, the system, the method, and\/or the computer algorithm) so that participants are ultimately assigned their positions vs. other participants within the predefined limits between participants (in other examples, other functions such as administrative and non-administrative may be carried out (e.g., by the entity, the system, the method, and\/or the computer algorithm)).","In another example, participants may have two different accounts: Margin and Collateral. These accounts may be employed entering positions (whereby insufficient balances may prevent participants from posting orders or entering trades).","In one specific example, Margin Accounts may be as follows: Represent the cash or cash equivalent securities pledged to the pooled trade matching engine (e.g., computer hardware and\/or software platform) that dictates what positions a participant may purchase or sell. A concrete example (which example is, of course, intended to be illustrative and not restrictive) is as follows: If the contractual obligation has a value of \u2212$5,000 (in other words, negative five thousand) and a participant wants to sell 5 of these contracts, that participant has to have $25,000 (in other words, positive twenty five thousand) in their margin account to pay to the entity to ultimately be credited to the participant(s) who purchased these contractual obligations at a negative price. Similarly if a participant wants to purchase contracts that have a positive valuation, they must have sufficient margin to purchase such contractual obligations.","In one specific example, Collateral Accounts may be as follows: Represent the cash or securities pledged to the pooled trade matching engine (e.g., computer hardware and\/or software platform) that dictates the total notional amount of the participants' positions. A concrete example (which example is, of course, intended to be illustrative and not restrictive) is as follows: Participant A wants to enter into $10,000,000 USD of contracts, and there is a 10% collateral requirement for that type of contract traded, for that type of participant, the participant must have pledged $1,000,000 USD of cash or securities into the matching engine. In one example, this helps mitigate marking to market moves.","In another example, Accelerated Delivery may be triggered by: (1) In the event that the entity (e.g., the entity operating the pooled trade matching engine) fails to perform its reporting or other duties; (2) the failure of a participant to perform to its contractual obligations; and\/or (3) if there is a material change to what the contract's value is based upon (e.g., credit event of a reference obligation, dissolution of a currency, a successor event etc.\u2014typically all outlined in the contract).","In another example, Accelerated Delivery may result in: Participants are delivered their contracts at the contract rate defined by the last time participants' accounts tied out. In one example, this may be the previous business day or a longer period. In this example, by having the contract value dictate the contract rate, accelerated delivery has no economic effect on participants (a true-up).","In another example, the present invention may utilize an investment bank, broker, broker dealer, other financial institution and\/or Special Purpose Entity (e.g., a Structured Investment Vehicle) to intermediate these contracts (e.g., for other non-participant entities that wish to enter contracts).","In another example, the present invention may utilize a CTFC, SEC and\/or Foreign Equivalent registered clearing house to stand between participants until these participants no longer employ pooled credit in whole or in part for these contractual obligations between participants. In another example, a CTFC, SEC and\/or Foreign Equivalent registered clearing house may utilize an investment bank, broker, broker dealer, other financial institution and\/or Special Purpose Entity (e.g., Structured Investment Vehicle) to enter into these contracts upon delivery vs. other participants (e.g., for the purpose of clearing).","Reference will now be made to Tables 1 and 2, below. These tables provide an example (which example is intended to be illustrative and not restrictive) of credit extended between parties according to an embodiment of the present invention. Of note, this table provides values at one point in time (e.g., at an initial point in time)\u2014as discussed herein, the values will, of course, change, as credit limits are changed, parties enter and exit the pool, etc. Of further note, credit extended by a counterparty is listed down a column in Table 1 and credit received by a counterparty is listed across the rows of Table

In one example, in order to facilitate the Allocation Procedure upon Accelerated Settlement, all participants (without regard to whether they maintained a position in an affected Reference Entity) agree to accept assignment (or assumption) and release of Derivatives Position facing any other Participant, in accordance with predefined Counterparty Exposure Limits with the sole provision that their delta remains unchanged through the delivery process (e.g., as predefined and listed below).

In one specific example, each x may be weighted the same. In another specific example, at least one x may be weighted differently from at least one other x. In another specific example, x may be weighted based on the underlying financial instrument (e.g., emerging market note may count more towards a limit than a corporate note), and\/or the parties involved, and\/or other factors.","In another example, a notional size of each position or other obligation may be the same for each position or other obligation.","In another example, a notional size of one position or other obligation may vary or differ from a notional size of at least one other position or other obligation.","In another example, a notional size of each position or other obligation may be weighted.
