Namely, in the present invention, data may be transmitted or received from a unicast address of a source transmitting a message to an anycast address of a destination receiving the message.","For this, a connector of the communication network system according to the present invention may function to register services in a broker and to make at least one portion of the registered services join an anycast group or a multicast group according to a function of a corresponding service. A broker in an MRS network may function to route a message received from a particular service and transmit\/receive data between the service and a registered service in the anycast group or the multicast group. Also, the broker is registered with a unicast address of each service and also with the anycast address or the multicast address of the service registered in the anycast address or the multicast address.","As an example, when a service A providing a GOSTOP game service is generated, a connector may initially register a unicast address of the service A in a broker, and subsequently make the service A join a multicast group associated with providing of the GOSTOP game service. When a service B transmits a packet asking how many users are using a game with respect to GOSTOP game services, a broker may receives the packet and transmit the same to the service A and a multicast address of all the services registered in the multicast group. The service A receives a response to the query via the broker.","As described above, in the present invention, each service may be grouped into an anycast or multicast group according to its properties.
