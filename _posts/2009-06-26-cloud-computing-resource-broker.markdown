Each of the data centers may include a plurality of servers that provide computing resources, as well as data storage and retrieval capabilities. Users of cloud computing generally do not need knowledge regarding or control over the underlying data center infrastructure of the \u201ccloud\u201d. Rather, the users may access the computing resources and data storage capabilities on an as-needed basis.","This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that is further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.","Described herein are embodiments of various techniques for using cloud computing resource brokers to facilitate the acquisition and use of cloud computing services from cloud computing providers by customers. As used herein, \u201ccloud computing resource brokers\u201d may also be referred to as \u201cresource brokers.\u201d The resource brokers may assist customers in obtaining the most cost-effective and simplified use of cloud computing services so that the benefit of cloud computing may be maximized for the customers.","In at least one embodiment, a resource broker receives a request for a computing task that is to be performed from a customer. The resource broker selects one of the cloud computing providers to perform at least a part of the computing task.

Other embodiments will become more apparent from the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.","This disclosure is directed to services provided by cloud computing resource brokers to ensure that computing tasks received from customers, i.e., users, are performed in a time and cost efficient manner by cloud computing providers.","\u201cCloud computing\u201d refers to the access of computing resources and data via a network infrastructure, such as the Internet. The computing resources and data storage may be provided by linked data centers of the \u201ccloud,\u201d i.e., network. Each of the data centers may include a plurality of servers that provide computing resources, as well as data storage and retrieval capabilities. Further, \u201ccloud computing providers\u201d refer to the owners or operators of the data centers that makeup the \u201ccloud.\u201d","As cloud computing data centers proliferate due to increased reliance by customers, and with the commoditization of cloud computing service capabilities, customers desiring to use cloud computing services have an ever expanding array of choices in cloud computing providers and associated data centers. Thus, cloud computing resource brokers, alternatively referred to herein as \u201cresource brokers,\u201d may assist customers in selecting, negotiating with, and contracting with cloud computing providers to obtain cost effective and reliable cloud computing services. Moreover, the resource brokers may also take into consideration additional concerns of the customers (e.g., environmental impact) when choosing a cloud computing provider. In some instances, the resource brokers may provide assurance, in the form of insurance, that customers are compensated when the cloud computing providers fail to meet the expectation of the customers. In addition, customers may further rely on a resource agent to select an appropriate resource broker that will, in turn, choose a suitable cloud computing providers.","In some embodiments, the resource brokers may provide a computing task received from a customer to one or more cloud computing providers to ensure that the task will be efficiently performed in an economical manner. In other embodiments, the resource brokers may abstract a computing task received from a customer into smaller computing tasks so that the smaller computing tasks may be performed by various cloud computing providers. In further embodiments, the resource broker may provide insurance that a computing task received from the customer is processed according to predetermined metrics by the cloud computing providers. In yet other embodiments, the resource brokers may provide additional services as they act as liaisons between customers and cloud computing providers.

For example, but not as a limitation, the customers  may include businesses, charitable organizations, private individuals, government organizations, and educational institutions. The customers  may desire to use the service capabilities of the data centers maintained by the cloud computing providers on on-demand basis, without the desire to control the provider or understand the origin of the computing resources.","The resource broker  may be an entity that facilitates interactions between one or more of the cloud computing resource providers ()-() and the customers . Thus, the customers  may obtain the use of computing resources without dealing directly with the cloud computing providers ()-(). For example, but not as a limitation, the resource broker  may locate and obtain the most cost-effective service capability from one or more of cloud computing providers ()-(). In various embodiments, as further described below, the resource broker  may negotiate for computing resources from one or more of the cloud computing providers ()-(), provide computing tasks to selected ones of the cloud computing providers ()-() on behalf of the customers , provide results for the customers , collect payments from the customers, and provide compensation to the utilized ones of cloud computing providers ()-(). In at least some embodiments, the resource broker  may perform these actions via the use of data  (e.g., prior performance and cost history) on one or more of the cloud computing providers ()-().
