The processing circuit  may employ an edge detection or edge discrimination algorithm to identify points in the image. The purpose of detecting sharp changes in image brightness is to capture important events and changes in properties of the scene. Under assumptions for an image formation model, discontinuities in image brightness are likely to correspond to: discontinuities in depth, discontinuities in surface orientation, changes in material properties and variations in scene illumination. One effect of using an edge detection\/edge discrimination algorithm is enhancing the accuracy for device  to recognize what geographic element device  is pointed at. For example, when a user points device  at a restaurant versus the one right next to it, device  can discriminate which restaurant device  is pointed at with greater accuracy.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0081","num":"0080"},"figref":"FIG. 10","b":["101","1001","101","108","124","132","1002","101","1003","101","1001","1002"]},"Personal data can be any data related to the user. Examples of personal data include, names of the users, addresses of the users, photos that the user previously stored, memberships and affiliations of the users in any entities, PIM (personal information management) data, financial data, any personal information of the user, etc. Personal data may comprise an employee identification or other corporate identification information which indicates a user has one or more levels of access within a corporate campus. Personal data can also be configured to be geographic element data. For example, after a photo of a friend is stored by the user, when a user drives by the friend's house, the picture of the friend can be shown as geographic element data together with the image of the house.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0083","num":"0082"},"figref":"FIG. 13","b":"100"},"The process of determining orientation of the device using the processing circuit is shown in , according to an exemplary embodiment. When the application is turned on or enabled, processing circuit  checks whether magnetic-detecting device  is working properly. If processing circuit  determines that magnetic-detecting device  is not working properly based on information from magnetic-detecting device , it will receive orientation information from non-magnetic-detecting device . For example, processing circuit  may decide that the magnetic field detected by magnetic-detecting device  is too weak, or changing too fast from the orientation measured by non-magnetic-detecting-device  and conclude that the orientation information from magnetic-device  is not reliable. If processing circuit  determines that magnetic-detecting device  is working properly, processing circuit  will use magnetic-detecting device  to determine orientation. Processing circuit  may check the status of magnetic-detecting device  periodically or constantly to decide whether to switch the orientation measuring device.","In one exemplary embodiment, processing circuit  is configured to determine current location and display what geographic elements are around the current location.
