The fate of many individual cells, e.g., proliferation, migration, differentiation, or interaction with other cells, is typically governed by information received from other cells and\/or the immediate environment. This information is often transmitted by secreted polypeptides (for instance, mitogenic factors, survival factors, cytotoxic factors, differentiation factors, neuropeptides, and hormones) which are, in turn, received and interpreted by diverse cell receptors or membrane-bound proteins. These secreted polypeptides or signaling molecules normally pass through the cellular secretory pathway to reach their site of action in the extracellular environment.","Secreted proteins have various industrial applications, including as pharmaceuticals, diagnostics, biosensors and bioreactors. Most protein drugs available at present, such as thrombolytic agents, interferons, interleukins, erythropoietins, colony stimulating factors, and various other cytokines, are secretory proteins. Their receptors, which are membrane proteins, also have potential as therapeutic or diagnostic agents. Efforts are being undertaken by both industry and academia to identify new, native secreted proteins. Many efforts are focused on the screening of mammalian recombinant DNA libraries to identify the coding sequences for novel secreted proteins. Examples of screening methods and techniques are described in the literature [see, for example, Klein et al., 93:7108-7113 (1996); U.S. Pat. No. 5,536,637)].","Membrane-bound proteins and receptors can play important roles in, among other things, the formation, differentiation and maintenance of multicellular organisms. The fate of many individual cells, e.g., proliferation, migration, differentiation, or interaction with other cells, is typically governed by information received from other cells and\/or the immediate environment. This information is often transmitted by secreted polypeptides (for instance, mitogenic factors, survival factors, cytotoxic factors, differentiation factors, neuropeptides, and hormones) which are, in turn, received and interpreted by diverse cell receptors or membrane-bound proteins. Such membrane-bound proteins and cell receptors include, but are not limited to, cytokine receptors, receptor kinases, receptor phosphatases, receptors involved in cell-cell interactions, and cellular adhesion molecules like selectins and integrins. For instance, transduction of signals that regulate cell growth and differentiation is regulated in part by phosphorylation of various cellular proteins. Protein tyrosine kinases, enzymes that catalyze that process, can also act as growth factor receptors. Examples include fibroblast growth factor receptor and nerve growth factor receptor.","Membrane-bound proteins and receptor molecules have various industrial applications, including as pharmaceutical and diagnostic agents. Receptor immuno-adhesions, for instance, can be employed as therapeutic agents to block receptor-ligand interactions. The membrane-bound proteins can also be employed for screening of potential peptide or small molecule inhibitors of the relevant receptor\/ligand interaction.","Efforts are being undertaken by both industry and academia to identify new, native receptor or membrane-bound proteins. Many efforts are focused on the screening of mammalian recombinant DNA libraries to identify the coding sequences for novel receptor or membrane-bound proteins.","Given the importance of secreted and membrane-bound proteins in biological and disease processes, in vivo studies and characterizations may provide valuable identification and discovery of therapeutics and\/or treatments useful in the prevention, amelioration or correction of diseases or dysfunctions. In this regard, genetically engineered mice have proven to be invaluable tools for the functional dissection of biological processes relevant to human disease, including immunology, cancer, neuro-biology, cardiovascular biology, obesity and many others. Gene knockouts can be viewed as modeling the biological mechanism of drug action by presaging the activity of highly specific antagonists in vivo. Knockout mice have been shown to model drug activity; phenotypes of mice deficient for specific pharmaceutical target proteins can resemble the human clinical phenotype caused by the corresponding antagonist drug. Gene knockouts enable the discovery of the mechanism of action of the target, the predominant physiological role of the target, and mechanism-based side-effects that might result from inhibition of the target in mammals. Examples of this type include mice deficient in the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) [Esther, C. R. et al., 74:953-965 (1996)] and cyclooxygenase-1 (COX1) genes [Langenbach, R. et al., 83:483-492 (1995)]. Conversely, knocking the gene out in the mouse can have an opposite phenotypic effect to that observed in humans after administration of an agonist drug to the corresponding target. Examples include the erythropoietin knockout [Wu, C. S. et al., 83:59-67 (1996)], in which a consequence of the mutation is deficient red blood cell production, and the GABA(A)-R-\u03b23 knockout [DeLorey, T. M., 18:8505-8514 (1998)], in which the mutant mice show hyperactivity and hyper-responsiveness. Both these phenotypes are opposite to the effects of erythropoietin and benzodiazepine administration in humans. A striking example of a target validated using mouse genetics is the ACC2 gene. Although the human ACC2 gene had been identified several years ago, interest in ACC2 as a target for drug development was stimulated only recently after analysis of ACC2 function using a knockout mouse. ACC2 mutant mice eat more than their wild-type littermates, yet burn more fat and store less fat in their adipocytes, making this enzyme a probable target for chemical antagonism in the treatment of obesity [Abu-Elheiga, L. et al., 291:2613-2616 (2001)].","In the instant application, mutated gene disruptions have resulted in phenotypic observations related to various disease conditions or dysfunctions including: CNS\/neurological disturbances or disorders such as anxiety; eye abnormalities and associated diseases; cardiovascular, endothelial or angiogenic disorders including atherosclerosis; abnormal metabolic disorders including diabetes and dyslipidemias associated with elevated serum triglycerides and cholesterol levels; immunological and inflammatory disorders; oncological disorders; bone metabolic abnormalities or disorders such as arthritis, osteoporosis and osteopetrosis; or a developmental disease such as embryonic lethality.","The invention provides an

The ALIGN-2 program is publicly available through Genentech, Inc., South San Francisco, Calif. or may be compiled from the source code provided in Table 1 below.

An isolated polypeptide-encoding nucleic acid molecule is other than in the form or setting in which it is found in nature. Isolated polypeptide-encoding nucleic acid molecules therefore are distinguished from the specific polypeptide-encoding nucleic acid molecule as it exists in natural cells. However, an isolated polypeptide-encoding nucleic acid molecule includes polypeptide-encoding nucleic acid molecules contained in cells that ordinarily express the polypeptide where, for example, the nucleic acid molecule is in a chromosomal location different from that of natural cells.","The term \u201ccontrol sequences\u201d refers to DNA sequences necessary for the expression of an operably linked coding sequence in a particular host organism. The control sequences that are suitable for prokaryotes, for example, include a promoter, optionally an operator sequence, and a ribosome binding site. Eukaryotic cells are known to utilize promoters, polyadenylation signals, and enhancers.","Nucleic acid is \u201coperably linked\u201d when it is placed into a functional relationship with another nucleic acid sequence. For example, DNA for a presequence or secretory leader is operably linked to DNA for a polypeptide if it is expressed as a preprotein that participates in the secretion of the polypeptide; a promoter or enhancer is operably linked to a coding sequence if it affects the transcription of the sequence; or a ribosome binding site is operably linked to a coding sequence if it is positioned so as to facilitate translation. Generally, \u201coperably linked\u201d means that the DNA sequences being linked are contiguous, and, in the case of a secretory leader, contiguous and in reading phase. However, enhancers do not have to be contiguous. Linking is accomplished by ligation at convenient restriction sites. If such sites do not exist, the synthetic oligonucleotide adaptors or linkers are used in accordance with conventional practice.","\u201cStringency\u201d of hybridization reactions is readily determinable by one of ordinary skill in the art, and generally is an empirical calculation dependent upon probe length, washing temperature, and salt concentration. In general, longer probes require higher temperatures for proper annealing, while shorter probes need lower temperatures. Hybridization generally depends on the ability of denatured DNA to reanneal when complementary strands are present in an environment below their melting temperature. The higher the degree of desired homology between the probe and hybridizable sequence, the higher the relative temperature which can be used. As a result, it follows that higher relative temperatures would tend to make the reaction conditions more stringent, while lower temperatures less so.

This would include indications that stimulate angiogenesis and\/or cardiovascularization, and those that inhibit angiogenesis and\/or cardiovascularization. Such disorders include, for example, arterial disease, such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, inflammatory vasculitides, Reynaud's disease and Reynaud's phenomenon, aneurysms, and arterial restenosis; venous and lymphatic disorders such as thrombophlebitis, lymphangitis, and lymphedema; and other vascular disorders such as peripheral vascular disease, cancer such as vascular tumors, e.g., hemangioma (capillary and cavernous), glomus tumors, telangiectasia, bacillary angiomatosis, hemangioendothelioma, angiosarcoma, haemangiopericytoma, Kaposi's sarcoma, lymphangioma, and lymphangiosarcoma, tumor angiogenesis, trauma such as wounds, burns, and other injured tissue, implant fixation, scarring, ischemia reperfusion injury, rheumatoid arthritis, cerebrovascular disease, renal diseases such as acute renal failure, or osteoporosis. This would also include angina, myocardial infarctions such as acute myocardial infarctions, cardiac hypertrophy, and heart failure such as CHF.","\u201cHypertrophy\u201d, as used herein, is defined as an increase in mass of an organ or structure independent of natural growth that does not involve tumor formation. Hypertrophy of an organ or tissue is due either to an increase in the mass of the individual cells (true hypertrophy), or to an increase in the number of cells making up the tissue (hyperplasia), or both. Certain organs, such as the heart, lose the ability to divide shortly after birth. Accordingly, \u201ccardiac hypertrophy\u201d is defined as an increase in mass of the heart, which, in adults, is characterized by an increase in myocyte cell size and contractile protein content without concomitant cell division. The character of the stress responsible for inciting the hypertrophy, (e.g., increased preload, increased afterload, loss of myocytes, as in myocardial infarction, or primary depression of contractility), appears to play a critical role in determining the nature of the response. The early stage of cardiac hypertrophy is usually characterized morphologically by increases in the size of myofibrils and mitochondria, as well as by enlargement of mitochondria and nuclei. At this stage, while muscle cells are larger than normal, cellular organization is largely preserved. At a more advanced stage of cardiac hypertrophy, there are preferential increases in the size or number of specific organelles, such as mitochondria, and new contractile elements are added in localized areas of the cells, in an irregular manner. Cells subjected to long-standing hypertrophy show more obvious disruptions in cellular organization, including markedly enlarged nuclei with highly lobulated membranes, which displace adjacent myofibrils and cause breakdown of normal Z-band registration. The phrase \u201ccardiac hypertrophy\u201d is used to include all stages of the progression of this condition, characterized by various degrees of structural damage of the heart muscle, regardless of the underlying cardiac disorder. Hence, the term also includes physiological conditions instrumental in the development of cardiac hypertrophy, such as elevated blood pressure, aortic stenosis, or myocardial infarction.","\u201cHeart failure\u201d refers to an abnormality of cardiac function where the heart does not pump blood at the rate needed for the requirements of metabolizing tissues. The heart failure can be caused by a number of factors, including ischemic, congenital, rheumatic, or idiopathic forms.","\u201cCongestive heart failure\u201d (CHF) is a progressive pathologic state where the heart is increasingly unable to supply adequate cardiac output (the volume of blood pumped by the heart over time) to deliver the oxygenated blood to peripheral tissues. As CHF progresses, structural and hemodynamic damages occur. While these damages have a variety of manifestations, one characteristic symptom is ventricular hypertrophy. CHF is a common end result of a number of various cardiac disorders.","\u201cMyocardial infarction\u201d generally results from atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries, often with superimposed coronary thrombosis. It may be divided into two major types: transmural infarcts, in which myocardial necrosis involves the full thickness of the ventricular wall, and subendocardial (nontransmural) infarcts, in which the necrosis involves the subendocardium, the intramural myocardium, or both, without extending all the way through the ventricular wall to the epicardium. Myocardial infarction is known to cause both a change in hemodynamic effects and an alteration in structure in the damaged and healthy zones of the heart. Thus, for example, myocardial infarction reduces the maximum cardiac output and the stroke volume of the heart. Also associated with myocardial infarction is a stimulation of the DNA synthesis occurring in the interstice as well as an increase in the formation of collagen in the areas of the heart not affected.","As a result of the increased stress or strain placed on the heart in prolonged hypertension due, for example, to the increased total peripheral resistance, cardiac hypertrophy has long been associated with \u201chypertension\u201d. A characteristic of the ventricle that becomes hypertrophic as a result of chronic pressure overload is an impaired diastolic performance. Fouad et al., 4: 1500-1506 (1984); Smith et al., 5: 869-874 (1985). A prolonged left ventricular relaxation has been detected in early essential hypertension, in spite of normal or supranormal systolic function. Hartford et al., 6: 329-338 (1984). However, there is no close parallelism between blood pressure levels and cardiac hypertrophy. Although improvement in left ventricular function in response to antihypertensive therapy has been reported in humans, patients variously treated with a diuretic (hydrochlorothiazide), a \u03b2-blocker (propranolol), or a calcium channel blocker (diltiazem), have shown reversal of left ventricular hypertrophy, without improvement in diastolic function. Inouye et al., 53: 1583-7 (1984).","Another complex cardiac disease associated with cardiac hypertrophy is \u201chypertrophic cardiomyopathy\u201d. This condition is characterized by a great diversity of morphologic, functional, and clinical features (Maron et al., 316: 780-789 (1987); Spirito et al., 320: 749-755 (1989); Louie and Edwards, 36: 275-308 (1994); Wigle et al., 92: 1680-1692 (1995)), the heterogeneity of which is accentuated by the fact that it afflicts patients of all ages. Spirito et al., 336: 775-785 (1997). The causative factors of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy are also diverse and little understood. In general, mutations in genes encoding sarcomeric proteins are associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Recent data suggest that \u03b2-myosin heavy chain mutations may account for approximately 30 to 40 percent of cases of familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Watkins et al., 326: 1108-1114 (1992); Schwartz et al, 91: 532-540 (1995); Marian and Roberts, 92: 1336-1347 (1995); Thierfelder et al., 77: 701-712 (1994); Watkins et al., 11: 434-437 (1995). Besides \u03b2-myosin heavy chain, other locations of genetic mutations include cardiac troponin T, alpha topomyosin, cardiac myosin binding protein C, essential myosin light chain, and regulatory myosin light chain. See, Malik and Watkins, 12: 295-302 (1997).","Supravalvular \u201caortic stenosis\u201d is an inherited vascular disorder characterized by narrowing of the ascending aorta, but other arteries, including the pulmonary arteries, may also be affected. Untreated aortic stenosis may lead to increased intracardiac pressure resulting in myocardial hypertrophy and eventually heart failure and death. The pathogenesis of this disorder is not fully understood, but hypertrophy and possibly hyperplasia of medial smooth muscle are prominent features of this disorder. It has been reported that molecular variants of the elastin gene are involved in the development and pathogenesis of aortic stenosis. U.S. Pat. No. 5,650,282 issued Jul. 22, 1997.","\u201cValvular regurgitation\u201d occurs as a result of heart diseases resulting in disorders of the cardiac valves. Various diseases, like rheumatic fever, can cause the shrinking or pulling apart of the valve orifice, while other diseases may result in endocarditis, an inflammation of the endocardium or lining membrane of the atrioventricular orifices and operation of the heart. Defects such as the narrowing of the valve stenosis or the defective closing of the valve result in an accumulation of blood in the heart cavity or regurgitation of blood past the valve. If uncorrected, prolonged valvular stenosis or insufficiency may result in cardiac hypertrophy and associated damage to the heart muscle, which may eventually necessitate valve replacement.","The term \u201cimmune related disease\u201d means a disease in which a component of the immune system of a mammal causes, mediates or otherwise contributes to a morbidity in the mammal.

The term \u201cimmunoglobulin\u201d (Ig) is used interchangeable with antibody herein.","An \u201cisolated antibody\u201d is one which has been identified and separated and\/or recovered from a component of its natural environment. Contaminant components of its natural environment are materials which would interfere with diagnostic or therapeutic uses for the antibody, and may include enzymes, hormones, and other proteinaceous or nonproteinaceous solutes. The invention provides that the antibody will be purified (1) to greater than 95% by weight of antibody as determined by the Lowry method, and most preferably more than 99% by weight, (2) to a degree sufficient to obtain at least 15 residues of N-terminal or internal amino acid sequence by use of a spinning cup sequenator, or (3) to homogeneity by SDS-PAGE under reducing or nonreducing conditions using Coomassie blue or, preferably, silver stain. Isolated antibody includes the antibody in situ within recombinant cells since at least one component of the antibody's natural environment will not be present. Ordinarily, however, isolated antibody will be prepared by at least one purification step.","The basic 4-chain antibody unit is a heterotetrameric glycoprotein composed of two identical light (L) chains and two identical heavy (H) chains (an IgM antibody consists of 5 of the basic heterotetramer unit along with an additional polypeptide called J chain, and therefore contain 10 antigen binding sites, while secreted IgA antibodies can polymerize to form polyvalent assemblages comprising 2-5 of the basic 4-chain units along with J chain). In the case of IgGs, the 4-chain unit is generally about 150,000 daltons. Each L chain is linked to a H chain by one covalent disulfide bond, while the two H chains are linked to each other by one or more disulfide bonds depending on the H chain isotype. Each H and L chain also has regularly spaced intrachain disulfide bridges. Each H chain has at the N-terminus, a variable domain (V) followed by three constant domains (C) for each of the \u03b1 and \u03b3 chains and four Cdomains for \u03bc and \u03b5 isotypes. Each L chain has at the N-terminus, a variable domain (V) followed by a constant domain (C) at its other end. The Vis aligned with the Vand the Cis aligned with the first constant domain of the heavy chain (C1). Particular amino acid residues are believed to form an interface between the light chain and heavy chain variable domains. The pairing of a Vand Vtogether forms a single antigen-binding site. For the structure and properties of the different classes of antibodies, see, e.g., 8th edition, Daniel P. Stites, Abba I. Terr and Tristram G. Parslow (eds.), Appleton & Lange, Norwalk, Conn., 1994, page 71 and Chapter 6.","The L chain from any vertebrate species can be assigned to one of two clearly distinct types, called kappa and lambda, based on the amino acid sequences of their constant domains. Depending on the amino acid sequence of the constant domain of their heavy chains (C), immunoglobulins can be assigned to different classes or isotypes. There are five classes of immunoglobulins: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM, having heavy chains designated \u03b1, \u03b4, \u03b5, \u03b3, and \u03bc, respectively. The \u03b3 and \u03b1 classes are further divided into subclasses on the basis of relatively minor differences in Csequence and function, e.g., humans express the following subclasses: IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgA1, and IgA2.","The term \u201cvariable\u201d refers to the fact that certain segments of the variable domains differ extensively in sequence among antibodies. The V domain mediates antigen binding and define specificity of a particular antibody for its particular antigen. However, the variability is not evenly distributed across the 110-amino acid span of the variable domains. Instead, the V regions consist of relatively invariant stretches called framework regions (FRs) of 15-30 amino acids separated by shorter regions of extreme variability called \u201chypervariable regions\u201d that are each 9-12 amino acids long. The variable domains of native heavy and light chains each comprise four FRs, largely adopting a \u03b2-sheet configuration, connected by three hypervariable regions, which form loops connecting, and in some cases forming part of, the \u03b2-sheet structure. The hypervariable regions in each chain are held together in close proximity by the FRs and, with the hypervariable regions from the other chain, contribute to the formation of the antigen-binding site of antibodies (see Kabat et al., 5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md. (1991)). The constant domains are not involved directly in binding an antibody to an antigen, but exhibit various effector functions, such as participation of the antibody in antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC).","The term \u201chypervariable region\u201d when used herein refers to the amino acid residues of an antibody which are responsible for antigen-binding. The hypervariable region generally comprises amino acid residues from a \u201ccomplementarity determining region\u201d or \u201cCDR\u201d (e.g. around about residues 24-34 (L1), 50-56 (L2) and 89-97 (L3) in the V, and around about 1-35 (H1), 50-65 (H2) and 95-102 (H3) in the V; Kabat et al., 5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md. (1991)) and\/or those residues from a \u201chypervariable loop\u201d (e.g. residues 26-32 (L1), 50-52 (L2) and 91-96 (L3) in the V, and 26-32 (H1), 53-55 (H2) and 96-101 (H3) in the V; Chothia and Lesk 196:901-917 (1987)).","The term \u201cmonoclonal antibody\u201d as used herein refers to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, i.e., the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally occurring mutations that may be present in minor amounts. Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific, being directed against a single antigenic site. Furthermore, in contrast to polyclonal antibody preparations which include different antibodies directed against different determinants (epitopes), each monoclonal antibody is directed against a single determinant on the antigen. In addition to their specificity, the monoclonal antibodies are advantageous in that they may be synthesized uncontaminated by other antibodies. The modifier \u201cmonoclonal\u201d is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method. For example, the monoclonal antibodies useful in the present invention may be prepared by the hybridoma methodology first described by Kohler et al., 256:495 (1975), or may be made using recombinant DNA methods in bacterial, eukaryotic animal or plant cells (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567). The \u201cmonoclonal antibodies\u201d may also be isolated from phage antibody libraries using the techniques described in Clackson et al., 352:624-628 (1991) and Marks et al., 222:581-597 (1991), for example.","The monoclonal antibodies herein include \u201cchimeric\u201d antibodies in which a portion of the heavy and\/or light chain is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass, while the remainder of the chain(s) is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass, as well as fragments of such antibodies, so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity (see U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567; and Morrison et al., 81:6851-6855 (1984)). Chimeric antibodies of interest herein include \u201cprimatized\u201d antibodies comprising variable domain antigen-binding sequences derived from a non-human primate (e.g. Old World Monkey, Ape etc), and human constant region sequences.","An \u201cintact\u201d antibody is one which comprises an antigen-binding site as well as a Cand at least heavy chain constant domains, C1, C2 and C3. The constant domains may be native sequence constant domains (e.g. human native sequence constant domains) or amino acid sequence variant thereof. Preferably, the intact antibody has one or more effector functions.","\u201cAntibody fragments\u201d comprise a portion of an intact antibody, preferably the antigen binding or variable region of the intact antibody. Examples of antibody fragments include Fab, Fab\u2032, F(ab\u2032), and Fv fragments; diabodies; linear antibodies (see U.S. Pat. No. 5,641,870, Example 2; Zapata et al., 8(10): 1057-1062 [1995]); single-chain antibody molecules; and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments.","Papain digestion of antibodies produces two identical antigen-binding fragments, called \u201cFab\u201d fragments, and a residual \u201cFc\u201d fragment, a designation reflecting the ability to crystallize readily. The Fab fragment consists of an entire L chain along with the variable region domain of the H chain (V), and the first constant domain of one heavy chain (C1). Each Fab fragment is monovalent with respect to antigen binding, i.e., it has a single antigen-binding site. Pepsin treatment of an antibody yields a single large F(ab\u2032)fragment which roughly corresponds to two disulfide linked Fab fragments having divalent antigen-binding activity and is still capable of cross-linking antigen. Fab\u2032 fragments differ from Fab fragments by having additional few residues at the carboxy terminus of the C1 domain including one or more cysteines from the antibody hinge region. Fab\u2032-SH is the designation herein for Fab\u2032 in which the cysteine residue(s) of the constant domains bear a free thiol group. F(ab\u2032)antibody fragments originally were produced as pairs of Fab\u2032 fragments which have hinge cysteines between them. Other chemical couplings of antibody fragments are also known.","The Fc fragment comprises the carboxy-terminal portions of both H chains held together by disulfides. The effector functions of antibodies are determined by sequences in the Fc region, which region is also the part recognized by Fc receptors (FcR) found on certain types of cells.","\u201cFv\u201d is the minimum antibody fragment which contains a complete antigen-recognition and -binding site. This fragment consists of a dimer of one heavy- and one light-chain variable region domain in tight, non-covalent association. From the folding of these two domains emanate six hypervariable loops (3 loops each from the H and L chain) that contribute the amino acid residues for antigen binding and confer antigen binding specificity to the antibody. However, even a single variable domain (or half of an Fv comprising only three CDRs specific for an antigen) has the ability to recognize and bind antigen, although at a lower affinity than the entire binding site.","\u201cSingle-chain Fv\u201d also abbreviated as \u201csFv\u201d or \u201cscFv\u201d are antibody fragments that comprise the Vand Vantibody domains connected into a single polypeptide chain. Preferably, the sFv polypeptide further comprises a polypeptide linker between the Vand Vdomains which enables the sFv to form the desired structure for antigen binding. For a review of sFv, see Pluckthun in , vol. 113, Rosenburg and Moore eds., Springer-Verlag, New York, pp. 269-315 (1994); Borrebaeck 1995, infra.","The term \u201cdiabodies\u201d refers to small antibody fragments prepared by constructing sFv fragments (see preceding paragraph) with short linkers (about 5-10 residues) between the Vand Vdomains such that inter-chain but not intra-chain pairing of the V domains is achieved, resulting in a bivalent fragment, i.e., fragment having two antigen-binding sites. Bispecific diabodies are heterodimers of two \u201ccrossover\u201d sFv fragments in which the Vand Vdomains of the two antibodies are present on different polypeptide chains. Diabodies are described more fully in, for example, EP 404,097; WO 93\/11161; and Hollinger et al., 90:6444-6448 (1993).","\u201cHumanized\u201d forms of non-human (e.g., rodent) antibodies are chimeric antibodies that contain minimal sequence derived from the non-human antibody. For the most part, humanized antibodies are human immunoglobulins (recipient antibody) in which residues from a hypervariable region of the recipient are replaced by residues from a hypervariable region of a non-human species (donor antibody) such as mouse, rat, rabbit or non-human primate having the desired antibody specificity, affinity, and capability. In some instances, framework region (FR) residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non-human residues. Furthermore, humanized antibodies may comprise residues that are not found in the recipient antibody or in the donor antibody. These modifications are made to further refine antibody performance. In general, the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains, in which all or substantially all of the hypervariable loops correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FRs are those of a human immunoglobulin sequence. The humanized antibody optionally also will comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin. For further details, see Jones et al., 321:522-525 (1986); Riechmann et al., 332:323-329 (1988); and Presta, 2:593-596 (1992).","A \u201cspecies-dependent antibody,\u201d e.g., a mammalian anti-human IgE antibody, is an antibody which has a stronger binding affinity for an antigen from a first mammalian species than it has for a homologue of that antigen from a second mammalian species. Normally, the species-dependent antibody \u201cbind specifically\u201d to a human antigen (i.e., has a binding affinity (Kd) value of no more than about 1\u00d710M, preferably no more than about 1\u00d710and most preferably no more than about 1\u00d710M) but has a binding affinity for a homologue of the antigen from a second non-human mammalian species which is at least about 50 fold, or at least about 500 fold, or at least about 1000 fold, weaker than its binding affinity for the human antigen. The species-dependent antibody can be of any of the various types of antibodies as defined above, but preferably is a humanized or human antibody.","A \u201cPRO224, PRO9783, PRO1108, PRO34000, PRO240, PRO943, hu A33, PRO230, PRO178, PRO1199, PRO4333, PRO1336, PRO19598, PRO1083, hu TRPM2 or PRO1801 binding oligopeptide\u201d is an oligopeptide that binds, preferably specifically, to a PRO224, PRO9783, PRO1108, PRO34000, PRO240, PRO943, hu A33, PRO230, PRO178, PRO1199, PRO4333, PRO1336, PRO19598, PRO1083, hu TRPM2 or PRO1801 polypeptide as described herein.

In this regard, it is noted that techniques for screening organic molecule libraries for molecules that are capable of binding to a polypeptide target are well known in the art (see, e.g., PCT Publication Nos. WO00\/00823 and WO00\/39585).","An antibody, oligopeptide or other organic molecule \u201cwhich binds\u201d an antigen of interest, e.g. a tumor-associated polypeptide antigen target, is one that binds the antigen with sufficient affinity such that the antibody, oligopeptide or other organic molecule is preferably useful as a diagnostic and\/or therapeutic agent in targeting a cell or tissue expressing the antigen, and does not significantly cross-react with other proteins. The extent of binding of the antibody, oligopeptide or other organic molecule to a \u201cnon-target\u201d protein will be less than about 10% of the binding of the antibody, oligopeptide or other organic molecule to its particular target protein as determined by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis or radioimmunoprecipitation (RIA). With regard to the binding of an antibody, oligopeptide or other organic molecule to a target molecule, the term \u201cspecific binding\u201d or \u201cspecifically binds to\u201d or is \u201cspecific for\u201d a particular polypeptide or an epitope on a particular polypeptide target means binding that is measurably different from a non-specific interaction. Specific binding can be measured, for example, by determining binding of a molecule compared to binding of a control molecule, which generally is a molecule of similar structure that does not have binding activity. For example, specific binding can be determined by competition with a control molecule that is similar to the target, for example, an excess of non-labeled target. In this case, specific binding is indicated if the binding of the labeled target to a probe is competitively inhibited by excess unlabeled target. The term \u201cspecific binding\u201d or \u201cspecifically binds to\u201d or is \u201cspecific for\u201d a particular polypeptide or an epitope on a particular polypeptide target as used herein can be exhibited, for example, by a molecule having a Kd for the target of at least about 10M, alternatively at least about 10M, alternatively at least about 10M, alternatively at least about 10M, alternatively at least about 10M, alternatively at least about 10M, alternatively at least about 10M, alternatively at least about 10M, alternatively at least about 10M, or greater. The term \u201cspecific binding\u201d refers to binding where a molecule binds to a particular polypeptide or epitope on a particular polypeptide without substantially binding to any other polypeptide or polypeptide epitope.","An antibody, oligopeptide or other organic molecule that \u201cinhibits the growth of tumor cells expressing a PRO224, PRO9783, PRO1108, PRO34000, PRO240, PRO943, hu A33, PRO230, PRO178, PRO1199, PRO4333, PRO1336, PRO19598, PRO1083, hu TRPM2 or PRO1801\u201d or a \u201cgrowth inhibitory\u201d antibody, oligopeptide or other organic molecule is one which results in measurable growth inhibition of cancer cells expressing or overexpressing the appropriate PRO224, PRO9783, PRO1108, PRO34000, PRO240, PRO943, hu A33, PRO230, PRO178, PRO1199, PRO4333, PRO1336, PRO19598, PRO1083, hu TRPM2 or PRO1801 polypeptide. The PRO224, PRO9783, PRO1108, PRO34000, PRO240, PRO943, hu A33, PRO230, PRO178, PRO1199, PRO4333, PRO1336, PRO19598, PRO1083, hu TRPM2 or PRO1801 polypeptide may be a transmembrane polypeptide expressed on the surface of a cancer cell or may be a polypeptide that is produced and secreted by a cancer cell. Preferred growth inhibitory anti-PRO224, anti-PRO9783, anti-PRO1108, anti-PRO34000, anti-PRO240, anti-PRO943, anti-hu A33, anti-PRO230, anti-PRO178, anti-PRO1199, anti-PRO4333, anti-PRO1336, anti-PRO19598, anti-PRO1083, anti-hu TRPM2 or anti-PRO1801 antibodies, oligopeptides or organic molecules inhibit growth of PRO224-, PRO9783-, PRO1108-, PRO34000-, PRO240-, PRO943-, hu A33-, PRO230-, PRO178-, PRO1199-, PRO4333-, PRO1336-, PRO19598-, PRO1083-, hu TRPM2- or PRO1801-expressing tumor cells by or by greater than 20%, preferably from about 20% to about 50%, and even more preferably, by or by greater than 50% (e.g., from about 50% to about 100%) as compared to the appropriate control, the control typically being tumor cells not treated with the antibody, oligopeptide or other organic molecule being tested. Growth inhibition can be measured at an antibody concentration of about 0.1 to 30 \u03bcg\/ml or about 0.5 nM to 200 nM in cell culture, where the growth inhibition is determined 1-10 days after exposure of the tumor cells to the antibody. Growth inhibition of tumor cells in vivo can be determined in various ways. The antibody is growth inhibitory in vivo if administration of the anti-PRO224, anti-PRO9783, anti-PRO1108, anti-PRO34000, anti-PRO240, anti-PRO943, anti-hu A33, anti-PRO230, anti-PRO178, anti-PRO1199, anti-PRO4333, anti-PRO1336, anti-PRO19598, anti-PRO1083, anti-hu TRPM2 or anti-PRO1801 antibody at about 1 \u03bcg\/kg to about 100 mg\/kg body weight results in reduction in tumor size or tumor cell proliferation within about 5 days to 3 months from the first administration of the antibody, preferably within about 5 to 30 days.","An antibody, oligopeptide or other organic molecule which \u201cinduces apoptosis\u201d is one which induces programmed cell death as determined by binding of annexin V, fragmentation of DNA, cell shrinkage, dilation of endoplasmic reticulum, cell fragmentation, and\/or formation of membrane vesicles (called apoptotic bodies). The cell is usually one which overexpresses a PRO224, PRO9783, PRO1108, PRO34000, PRO240, PRO943, hu A33, PRO230, PRO178, PRO199, PRO4333, PRO1336, PRO19598, PRO1083, hu TRPM2 or PRO1801 polypeptide. Preferably the cell is a tumor cell, e.g., a prostate, breast, ovarian, stomach, endometrial, lung, kidney, colon, bladder cell. Various methods are available for evaluating the cellular events associated with apoptosis. For example, phosphatidyl serine (PS) translocation can be measured by annexin binding; DNA fragmentation can be evaluated through DNA laddering; and nuclear\/chromatin condensation along with DNA fragmentation can be evaluated by any increase in hypodiploid cells. Preferably, the antibody, oligopeptide or other organic molecule which induces apoptosis is one which results in or in about 2 to 50 fold, preferably in or in about 5 to 50 fold, and most preferably in or in about 10 to 50 fold, induction of annexin binding relative to untreated cell in an annexin binding assay.","Antibody \u201ceffector functions\u201d refer to those biological activities attributable to the Fc region (a native sequence Fc region or amino acid sequence variant Fc region) of an antibody, and vary with the antibody isotype. Examples of antibody effector functions include: C1q binding and complement dependent cytotoxicity; Fc receptor binding; antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC); phagocytosis; down regulation of cell surface receptors (e.g., B cell receptor); and B cell activation.","\u201cAntibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity\u201d or \u201cADCC\u201d refers to a form of cytotoxicity in which secreted Ig bound onto Fc receptors (FcRs) present on certain cytotoxic cells (e.g., Natural Killer (NK) cells, neutrophils, and macrophages) enable these cytotoxic effector cells to bind specifically to an antigen-bearing target cell and subsequently kill the target cell with cytotoxins. The antibodies \u201carm\u201d the cytotoxic cells and are absolutely required for such killing. The primary cells for mediating ADCC, NK cells, express Fc\u03b3RIII only, whereas monocytes express Fc\u03b3RI, Fc\u03b3RII and Fc\u03b3RIII. FcR expression on hematopoietic cells is summarized in Table 3 on page 464 of Ravetch and Kinet, 9:457-92 (1991). To assess ADCC activity of a molecule of interest, an in vitro ADCC assay, such as that described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,500,362 or 5,821,337 may be performed. Useful effector cells for such assays include peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and Natural Killer (NK) cells. Alternatively, or additionally, ADCC activity of the molecule of interest may be assessed in vivo, e.g., in a animal model such as that disclosed in Clynes et al. 95:652-656 (1998).","\u201cFc receptor\u201d or \u201cFcR\u201d describes a receptor that binds to the Fc region of an antibody. The preferred FcR is a native sequence human FcR. Moreover, a preferred FcR is one which binds an IgG antibody (a gamma receptor) and includes receptors of the Fc\u03b3RI, Fc\u03b3RII and Fc\u03b3RIII subclasses, including allelic variants and alternatively spliced forms of these receptors. Fc\u03b3RII receptors include Fc\u03b3RIIA (an \u201cactivating receptor\u201d) and Fc\u03b3RIIB (an \u201cinhibiting receptor\u201d), which have similar amino acid sequences that differ primarily in the cytoplasmic domains thereof. Activating receptor Fc\u03b3RIIA contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) in its cytoplasmic domain. Inhibiting receptor Fc\u03b3RIIB contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif (ITIM) in its cytoplasmic domain. (see review M. in Da\u00ebron, 15:203-234 (1997)). FcRs are reviewed in Ravetch and Kinet, 9:457-492 (1991); Capel et al., 4:25-34 (1994); and de Haas et al., 126:330-41 (1995). Other FcRs, including those to be identified in the future, are encompassed by the term \u201cFcR\u201d herein. The term also includes the neonatal receptor, FcRn, which is responsible for the transfer of maternal IgGs to the fetus (Guyer et al., 117:587 (1976) and Kim et al., 24:249 (1994)).","\u201cHuman effector cells\u201d are leukocytes which express one or more FcRs and perform effector functions. Preferably, the cells express at least Fc\u03b3RIII and perform ADCC effector function. Examples of human leukocytes which mediate ADCC include peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), natural killer (NK) cells, monocytes, cytotoxic T cells and neutrophils; with PBMCs and NK cells being preferred. The effector cells may be isolated from a native source, e.g., from blood.","\u201cComplement dependent cytotoxicity\u201d or \u201cCDC\u201d refers to the lysis of a target cell in the presence of complement. Activation of the classical complement pathway is initiated by the binding of the first component of the complement system (C1q) to antibodies (of the appropriate subclass) which are bound to their cognate antigen. To assess complement activation, a CDC assay, e.g., as described in Gazzano-Santoro et al., 202:163 (1996), may be performed.","The terms \u201ccancer\u201d and \u201ccancerous\u201d refer to or describe the physiological condition in mammals that is typically characterized by unregulated cell growth. Examples of cancer include but are not limited to, carcinoma, lymphoma, blastoma, sarcoma, and leukemia. More particular examples of such cancers include squamous cell cancer, lung cancer (including small-cell lung cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, adenocarcinoma of the lung, and squamous carcinoma of the lung), cancer of the peritoneum, hepatocellular cancer, gastric or stomach cancer (including gastrointestinal cancer), pancreatic cancer, glioblastoma, cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, liver cancer, bladder cancer, hepatoma, breast cancer, colon cancer, colorectal cancer, endometrial or uterine carcinoma, salivary gland carcinoma, kidney or renal cancer, liver cancer, prostate cancer, vulval cancer, thyroid cancer, hepatic carcinoma and various types of head and neck cancer, as well as B-cell lymphoma (including low grade\/follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL); small lymphocytic (SL) NHL; intermediate grade\/follicular NHL; intermediate grade diffuse NHL; high grade immunoblastic NHL; high grade lymphoblastic NHL; high grade small non-cleaved cell NHL; bulky disease NHL; mantle cell lymphoma; AIDS-related lymphoma; and Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia); chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL); acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL); Hairy cell leukemia; chronic myeloblastic leukemia; and post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD). Preferably, the cancer comprises a tumor that expresses an IGF receptor, more preferably breast cancer, lung cancer, colorectal cancer, or prostate cancer, and most preferably breast or prostate cancer.","A \u201cchemotherapeutic agent\u201d is a chemical compound useful in the treatment of cancer.

In one aspect of the invention, the cell proliferative disorder is cancer.","\u201cTumor\u201d, as used herein, refers to all neoplastic cell growth and proliferation, whether malignant or benign, and all pre-cancerous and cancerous cells and tissues.","An antibody, oligopeptide or other organic molecule which \u201cinduces cell death\u201d is one which causes a viable cell to become nonviable. The cell is one which expresses a PRO224, PRO9783, PRO1108, PRO34000, PRO240, PRO943, hu A33, PRO230, PRO178, PRO1199, PRO4333, PRO1336, PRO19598, PRO1083, hu TRPM2 or PRO1801 polypeptide, preferably a cell that overexpresses a PRO224, PRO9783, PRO1108, PRO34000, PRO240, PRO943, hu A33, PRO230, PRO178, PRO1199, PRO4333, PRO1336, PRO19598, PRO1083, hu TRPM2 or PRO1801 polypeptide as compared to a normal cell of the same tissue type.

Thus, the assay for cell death may be performed using heat inactivated serum (i.e., in the absence of complement) and in the absence of immune effector cells. To determine whether the antibody, oligopeptide or other organic molecule is able to induce cell death, loss of membrane integrity as evaluated by uptake of propidium iodide (PI), trypan blue (see Moore et al. 17:1-11 (1995)) or 7AAD can be assessed relative to untreated cells.

Structurally, the immunoadhesions comprise a fusion of an amino acid sequence with the desired binding specificity which is other than the antigen recognition and binding site of an antibody (i.e., is \u201cheterologous\u201d), and an immunoglobulin constant domain sequence. The adhesion part of an immunoadhesion molecule typically is a contiguous amino acid sequence comprising at least the binding site of a receptor or a ligand. The immunoglobulin constant domain sequence in the immunoadhesion may be obtained from any immunoglobulin, such as IgG-1, IgG-2, IgG-3, or IgG-4 subtypes, IgA (including IgA-1 and IgA-2), IgE, IgD or IgM.","The word \u201clabel\u201d when used herein refers to a detectable compound or composition which is conjugated directly or indirectly to the antibody so as to generate a \u201clabeled\u201d antibody. The label may be detectable by itself (e.g. radioisotope labels or fluorescent labels) or, in the case of an enzymatic label, may catalyze chemical alteration of a substrate compound or composition which is detectable.","\u201cReplication-preventing agent\u201d is an agent wherein replication, function, and\/or growth of the cells is inhibited or prevented, or cells are destroyed, no matter what the mechanism, such as by apoptosis, angiostasis, cytosis, tumoricide, mytosis inhibition, blocking cell cycle progression, arresting cell growth, binding to tumors, acting as cellular mediators, etc. Such agents include a chemotherapeutic agent, cytotoxic agent, cytokine, growth-inhibitory agent, or anti-hormonal agent, e.g., an anti-estrogen compound such as tamoxifen, an anti-progesterone such as onapristone (see, EP 616 812); or an anti-androgen such as flutamide, as well as aromidase inhibitors, or a hormonal agent such as an androgen.","The term \u201ccytotoxic agent\u201d as used herein refers to a substance that inhibits or prevents the function of cells and\/or causes destruction of cells.

Other cytotoxic agents are described below. A tumoricidal agent causes destruction of tumor cells.","Preferred cytotoxic agents herein for the specific tumor types to use in combination with the antagonists herein are as follows:\n\n","A \u201cgrowth inhibitory agent\u201d when used herein refers to a compound or composition which inhibits growth of a cell, especially a PRO224-, PRO9783-, PRO1108-, PRO34000-, PRO240-, PRO943-, hu A33-, PRO230-, PRO178-, PRO1199-, PRO4333-, PRO1336-, PRO19598-, PRO1083-, hu TRPM2- or PRO1801-expressing cancer cell, either in vitro or in vivo. Thus, the growth inhibitory agent may be one which significantly reduces the percentage of PRO224-, PRO9783-, PRO1108-, PRO34000-, PRO240-, PRO943-, hu A33-, PRO230-, PRO178-, PRO1199-, PRO4333-, PRO1336-, PRO19598-, PRO1083-, hu TRPM2- or PRO1801-expressing cells in S phase. Examples of growth inhibitory agents include agents that block cell cycle progression (at a place other than S phase), such as agents that induce G1 arrest and M-phase arrest. Classical M-phase blockers include the vincas (vincristine and vinblastine), taxanes, and topoisomerase II inhibitors such as doxorubicin, epirubicin, daunorubicin, etoposide, and bleomycin. Those agents that arrest G1 also spill over into S-phase arrest, for example, DNA alkylating agents such as tamoxifen, prednisone, dacarbazine, mechlorethamine, cisplatin, methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil, and ara-C. Further information can be found in , Mendelsohn and Israel, eds., Chapter 1, entitled \u201cCell cycle regulation, oncogenes, and antineoplastic drugs\u201d by Murakami et al. (WB Saunders: Philadelphia, 1995), especially p. 13. The taxanes (paclitaxel and docetaxel) are anticancer drugs both derived from the yew tree. Docetaxel (TAXOTERE\u00ae, Rhone-Poulenc Rorer), derived from the European yew, is a semisynthetic analogue of paclitaxel (TAXOL\u00ae, Bristol-Myers Squibb). Paclitaxel and docetaxel promote the assembly of microtubules from tubulin dimers and stabilize microtubules by preventing depolymerization, which results in the inhibition of mitosis in cells.","\u201cDoxorubicin\u201d is an anthracycline antibiotic.

Alternatively, sequence disruptions may be generated by nonspecific insertional inactivation using a gene trap vector (i.e. non-human transgenic animals containing and expressing a randomly inserted transgene; see for example U.S. Pat. No. 6,436,707 issued Aug. 20, 2002). These sequence disruptions or modifications may include insertions, missense, frameshift, deletion, or substitutions, or replacements of DNA sequence, or any combination thereof. Insertions include the insertion of entire genes, which may be of animal, plant, fungal, insect, prokaryotic, or viral origin. Disruption, for example, can alter the normal gene product by inhibiting its production partially or completely or by enhancing the normal gene product's activity.

The oligonucleotide is preferably labeled such that it can be detected upon hybridization to DNA in the library being screened. Methods of labeling are well known in the art, and include the use of radiolabels like P-labeled ATP, biotinylation or enzyme labeling.

The culture conditions, such as media, temperature, pH and the like, can be selected by the skilled artisan without undue experimentation. In general, principles, protocols, and practical techniques for maximizing the productivity of cell cultures can be found in , M. Butler, ed. (IPL Press, 1991) and Sambrook et al., supra.","Methods of eukaryotic cell transfection and prokaryotic cell transformation are known to the ordinarily skilled artisan, for example, CaCl, CaPO, liposome-mediated and electroporation. Depending on the host cell used, transformation is performed using standard techniques appropriate to such cells. The calcium treatment employing calcium chloride, as described in Sambrook et al., supra, or electroporation is generally used for prokaryotes. Infection with is used for transformation of certain plant cells, as described by Shaw et al., 23:315 (1983) and WO 89\/05859 published 29 Jun. 1989. For mammalian cells without such cell walls, the calcium phosphate precipitation method of Graham and van der Eb, 52:456-457 (1978) can be employed. General aspects of mammalian cell host system transfections have been described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,399,216. Transformations into yeast are typically carried out according to the method of Van Solingen et al., 130:946 (1977) and Hsiao et al., . (), 76:3829 (1979). However, other methods for introducing DNA into cells, such as by nuclear microinjection, electroporation, bacterial protoplast fusion with intact cells, or polycations, e.g., polybrene, polyornithine, may also be used. For various techniques for transforming mammalian cells, see Keown et al., 185:527-537 (1990) and Mansour et al., 336:348-352 (1988).","Suitable host cells for cloning or expressing the DNA in the vectors herein include prokaryote, yeast, or higher eukaryote cells. Suitable prokaryotes include but are not limited to eubacteria, such as Gram-negative or Gram-positive organisms, for example, Enterobacteriaceae such as . Various strains are publicly available, such as K12 strain MM294 (ATCC 31,446); X1776 (ATCC 31,537); strain W3110 (ATCC 27,325) and K5 772 (ATCC 53,635). Other suitable prokaryotic host cells include Enterobacteriaceae such as , e.g., , e.g., , e.g., , and , as well as such as and (e.g., 41P disclosed in DD 266,710 published 12 Apr. 1989), such as , and . These examples are illustrative rather than limiting. Strain W3110 is one particularly preferred host or parent host because it is a common host strain for recombinant DNA product fermentations. Preferably, the host cell secretes minimal amounts of proteolytic enzymes. For example, strain W3110 may be modified to effect a genetic mutation in the genes encoding proteins endogenous to the host, with examples of such hosts including W3110 strain 1A2, which has the complete genotype tonA; W3110 strain 9E4, which has the complete genotype tonA ptr3; W3110 strain 27C7 (ATCC 55,244), which has the complete genotype tonA ptr3 phoA E15 (argF-lac) 169 degP ompT kanW3110 strain 37D6, which has the complete genotype tonA ptr3 phoA E15 (argF-lac) 169 degP ompT rbs7 ilvG kanW3110 strain 40B4, which is strain 37D6 with a non-kanamycin resistant degP deletion mutation; and an strain having mutant periplasmic protease disclosed in U.S. Pat.

Alternatively, in vitro methods of cloning, e.g., PCR or other nucleic acid polymerase reactions, are suitable.","In addition to prokaryotes, eukaryotic microbes such as filamentous fungi or yeast are suitable cloning or expression hosts for PRO224-, PRO9783-, PRO1108-, PRO34000-, PRO240-, PRO943-, hu A33-, PRO230-, PRO178-, PRO1199-, PRO4333-, PRO1336-, PRO19598-, PRO1083-, hu TRPM2- or PRO1801-encoding vectors. is a commonly used lower eukaryotic host microorganism. Others include (Beach and Nurse, 290: 140 [1981]; EP 139,383 published 2 May 1985); hosts (U.S. Pat. No. 4,943,529; Fleer et al., 9:968-975 (1991)) such as, e.g., (MW98-8C, CBS683, CBS4574; Louvencourt et al., 154(2):737-742 [1983]), (ATCC 12,424), (ATCC 16,045), (ATCC 24,178), (ATCC 56,500), (ATCC 36,906; Van den Berg et al., 8:135 (1990)), , and (EP 402,226); (EP 183,070; Sreekrishna et al., 28:265-278 [1988]); (EP 244,234); (Case et al., 76:5259-5263 [1979]); such as (EP 394,538 published 31 Oct. 1990); and filamentous fungi such as, e.g., (WO 91\/00357 published 10 Jan. 1991), and hosts such as (Ballance et al., 112:284-289 [1983]; Tilburn et al., 26:205-221 [1983]; Yelton et al., 81: 1470-1474 [1984]) and (Kelly and Hynes, 4:475-479 [1985]). Methylotropic yeasts are suitable herein and include, but are not limited to, yeast capable of growth on methanol selected from the genera consisting of , and . A list of specific species that are exemplary of this class of yeasts may be found in C. Anthony, 269 (1982).","Suitable host cells for the expression of glycosylated PRO224, PRO9783, PRO1108, PRO34000, PRO240, PRO943, hu A33, PRO230, PRO178, PRO1199, PRO4333, PRO1336, PRO19598, PRO1083, hu TRPM2 or PRO1801 polypeptides are derived from multicellular organisms. Examples of invertebrate cells include insect cells such as S2 and Sf9, as well as plant cells. Examples of useful mammalian host cell lines include Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) and COS cells. More specific examples include monkey kidney CV1 line transformed by SV40 (COS-7, ATCC CRL 1651); human embryonic kidney line (293 or 293 cells subcloned for growth in suspension culture, Graham et al., 36:59 (1977)); Chinese hamster ovary cells\/\u2212DHFR (CHO, Urlaub and Chasin, 77:4216 (1980)); mouse sertoli cells (TM4, Mather, 23:243-251 (1980)); human lung cells (W138, ATCC CCL 75); human liver cells (Hep G2, HB 8065); and mouse mammary tumor (MMT 060562, ATCC CCL51). The selection of the appropriate host cell is deemed to be within the skill in the art.","3. Selection and Use of a Replicable Vector","The nucleic acid (e.g., cDNA or genomic DNA) encoding PRO224, PRO9783, PRO1108, PRO34000, PRO240, PRO943, hu A33, PRO230, PRO178, PRO1199, PRO4333, PRO1336, PRO19598, PRO1083, hu TRPM2 or PRO1801 polypeptides may be inserted into a replicable vector for cloning (amplification of the DNA) or for expression. Various vectors are publicly available. The vector may, for example, be in the form of a plasmid, cosmid, viral particle, or phage. The appropriate nucleic acid sequence may be inserted into the vector by a variety of procedures. In general, DNA is inserted into an appropriate restriction endonuclease site(s) using techniques known in the art. Vector components generally include, but are not limited to, one or more of a signal sequence, an origin of replication, one or more marker genes, an enhancer element, a promoter, and a transcription termination sequence. Construction of suitable vectors containing one or more of these components employs standard ligation techniques which are known to the skilled artisan.","The PRO224, PRO9783, PRO1108, PRO34000, PRO240, PRO943, hu A33, PRO230, PRO178, PRO1199, PRO4333, PRO1336, PRO19598, PRO1083, hu TRPM2 or PRO1801 polypeptide may be produced recombinantly not only directly, but also as a fusion polypeptide with a heterologous polypeptide, which may be a signal sequence or other polypeptide having a specific cleavage site at the N-terminus of the mature protein or polypeptide. In general, the signal sequence may be a component of the vector, or it may be a part of the PRO224-, PRO9783-, PRO1108-, PRO34000-, PRO240-, PRO943-, hu A33-, PRO230-, PRO178-, PRO199-, PRO4333-, PRO1336-, PRO19598-, PRO1083-, hu TRPM2- or PRO1801-encoding DNA that is inserted into the vector. The signal sequence may be a prokaryotic signal sequence selected, for example, from the group of the alkaline phosphatase, penicillinase, Ipp, or heat-stable enterotoxin II leaders. For yeast secretion the signal sequence may be, e.g., the yeast invertase leader, alpha factor leader (including and \u03b1-factor leaders, the latter described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,010,182), or acid phosphatase leader, the glucoamylase leader (EP 362,179 published 4 Apr. 1990), or the signal described in WO 90\/13646 published 15 Nov. 1990. In mammalian cell expression, mammalian signal sequences may be used to direct secretion of the protein, such as signal sequences from secreted polypeptides of the same or related species, as well as viral secretory leaders.","Both expression and cloning vectors contain a nucleic acid sequence that enables the vector to replicate in one or more selected host cells. Such sequences are well known for a variety of bacteria, yeast, and viruses. The origin of replication from the plasmid pBR322 is suitable for most Gram-negative bacteria, the 211 plasmid origin is suitable for yeast, and various viral origins (SV40, polyoma, adenovirus, VSV or BPV) are useful for cloning vectors in mammalian cells.","Expression and cloning vectors will typically contain a selection gene, also termed a selectable marker. Typical selection genes encode proteins that (a) confer resistance to antibiotics or other toxins, e.g., ampicillin, neomycin, methotrexate, or tetracycline, (b) complement auxotrophic deficiencies, or (c) supply critical nutrients not available from complex media, e.g., the gene encoding D-alanine racemase for ","An example of suitable selectable markers for mammalian cells are those that enable the identification of cells competent to take up the PRO224-, PRO9783-, PRO1108-, PRO34000-, PRO240-, PRO943-, hu A33-, PRO230-, PRO178-, PRO1199-, PRO4333-, PRO1336-, PRO19598-, PRO1083-, hu TRPM2- or PRO1801-encoding nucleic acid, such as DHFR or thymidine kinase. An appropriate host cell when wild-type DHFR is employed is the CHO cell line deficient in DHFR activity, prepared and propagated as described by Urlaub et al., 77:4216 (1980). A suitable selection gene for use in yeast is the trp1 gene present in the yeast plasmid YRp7 [Stinchcomb et al., 282:39 (1979); Kingsman et al., 7:141 (1979); Tschemper et al., 10:157 (1980)]. The trp1 gene provides a selection marker for a mutant strain of yeast lacking the ability to grow in tryptophan, for example, ATCC No. 44076 or PEP4-1 [Jones, 85:12 (1977)].","Expression and cloning vectors usually contain a promoter operably linked to the PRO224-, PRO9783-, PRO1108-, PRO34000-, PRO240-, PRO943-, hu A33-, PRO230-, PRO178-, PRO1199-, PRO4333-, PRO1336-, PRO19598-, PRO10837, hu TRPM2- or PRO1801-encoding nucleic acid sequence to direct mRNA synthesis. Promoters recognized by a variety of potential host cells are well known. Promoters suitable for use with prokaryotic hosts include the \u03b2-lactamase and lactose promoter systems [Chang et al., 275:615 (1978); Goeddel et al., 281:544 (1979)], alkaline phosphatase, a tryptophan (trp) promoter system [Goeddel, 8:4057 (1980); EP 36,776], and hybrid promoters such as the tac promoter [deBoer et al., 80:21-25 (1983)]. Promoters for use in bacterial systems also will contain a Shine-Dalgarno (S.D.) sequence operably linked to the DNA encoding PRO224, PRO9783, PRO1108, PRO34000, PRO240, PRO943, hu A33, PRO230, PRO178, PRO1199, PRO4333, PRO1336, PRO19598, PRO1083, hu TRPM2 or PRO1801 polypeptides.","Examples of suitable promoting sequences for use with yeast hosts include the promoters for 3-phosphoglycerate kinase [Hitzeman et al., 255:2073 (1980)] or other glycolytic enzymes [Hess et al., 7:149 (1968); Holland, Biochemistry, 17:4900 (1978)], such as enolase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, hexokinase, pyruvate decarboxylase, phosphofructokinase, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, 3-phosphoglycerate mutase, pyruvate kinase, triosephosphate isomerase, phosphoglucose isomerase, and glucokinase.","Other yeast promoters, which are inducible promoters having the additional advantage of transcription controlled by growth conditions, are the promoter regions for alcohol dehydrogenase 2, isocytochrome C, acid phosphatase, degradative enzymes associated with nitrogen metabolism, metallothionein, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and enzymes responsible for maltose and galactose utilization. Suitable vectors and promoters for use in yeast expression are further described in EP 73,657.","PRO224, PRO9783, PRO1108, PRO34000, PRO240, PRO943, hu A33, PRO230, PRO178, PRO1199, PRO4333, PRO1336, PRO19598, PRO1083, hu TRPM2 or PRO1801 transcription from vectors in mammalian host cells is controlled, for example, by promoters obtained from the genomes of viruses such as polyoma virus, fowlpox virus (UK 2,211,504 published 5 Jul. 1989), adenovirus (such as Adenovirus 2), bovine papilloma virus, avian sarcoma virus, cytomegalovirus, a retrovirus, hepatitis-B virus and Simian Virus 40 (SV40), from heterologous mammalian promoters, e.g., the actin promoter or an immunoglobulin promoter, and from heat-shock promoters, provided such promoters are compatible with the host cell systems.","Transcription of a DNA encoding the PRO224, PRO9783, PRO1108, PRO34000, PRO240, PRO943, hu A33, PRO230, PRO178, PRO1199, PRO4333, PRO1336, PRO19598, PRO1083, hu TRPM2 or PRO1801 polypeptide by higher eukaryotes may be increased by inserting an enhancer sequence into the vector. Enhancers are cis-acting elements of DNA, usually about from 10 to 300 bp, that act on a promoter to increase its transcription. Many enhancer sequences are now known from mammalian genes (globin, elastase, albumin, \u03b1-fetoprotein, and insulin). Typically, however, one will use an enhancer from a eukaryotic cell virus. Examples include the SV40 enhancer on the late side of the replication origin (bp 100-270), the cytomegalovirus early promoter enhancer, the polyoma enhancer on the late side of the replication origin, and adenovirus enhancers. The enhancer may be spliced into the vector at a position 5\u2032 or 3\u2032 to the PRO224, PRO9783, PRO1108, PRO34000, PRO240, PRO943, hu A33, PRO230, PRO178, PRO1199, PRO4333, PRO1336, PRO19598, PRO1083, hu TRPM2 or PRO1801 coding sequence, but is preferably located at a site 5\u2032 from the promoter.","Expression vectors used in eukaryotic host cells (yeast, fungi, insect, plant, animal, human, or nucleated cells from other multicellular organisms) will also contain sequences necessary for the termination of transcription and for stabilizing the mRNA. Such sequences are commonly available from the 5\u2032 and, occasionally 3\u2032, untranslated regions of eukaryotic or viral DNAs or cDNAs. These regions contain nucleotide segments transcribed as polyadenylated fragments in the untranslated portion of the mRNA encoding PRO224, PRO9783, PRO1108, PRO34000, PRO240, PRO943, hu A33, PRO230, PRO178, PRO1199, PRO4333, PRO1336, PRO19598, PRO1083, hu TRPM2 or PRO1801 polypeptides.","Still other methods, vectors, and host cells suitable for adaptation to the synthesis of PRO224, PRO9783, PRO1108, PRO34000, PRO240, PRO943, hu A33, PRO230, PRO178, PRO1199, PRO4333, PRO1336, PRO19598, PRO1083, hu TRPM2 or PRO1801 polypeptides in recombinant vertebrate cell culture are described in Gething et al., 293:620-625 (1981); Mantei et al., 281:40-46 (1979); EP 117,060; and EP 117,058.","4.

Such a fragment generally comprises at least about 14 nucleotides, preferably from about 14 to 30 nucleotides. The ability to derive an antisense or a sense oligonucleotide, based upon a cDNA sequence encoding a given protein is described in, for example, Stein and Cohen (48:2659, 1988) and van der Krol et al. (6:958, 1988).","Binding of antisense or sense oligonucleotides to target nucleic acid sequences results in the formation of duplexes that block transcription or translation of the target sequence by one of several means, including enhanced degradation of the duplexes, premature termination of transcription or translation, or by other means. The antisense oligonucleotides thus may be used to block expression of PRO224, PRO9783, PRO1108, PRO34000, PRO240, PRO943, hu A33, PRO230, PRO178, PRO1199, PRO4333, PRO1336, PRO19598, PRO1083, hu TRPM2 or PRO1801. Antisense or sense oligonucleotides further comprise oligonucleotides having modified sugar-phosphodiester backbones (or other sugar linkages, such as those described in WO 91\/06629) and wherein such sugar linkages are resistant to endogenous nucleases. Such oligonucleotides with resistant sugar linkages are stable in vivo (i.e., capable of resisting enzymatic degradation) but retain sequence specificity to be able to bind to target nucleotide sequences.","Other examples of sense or antisense oligonucleotides include those oligonucleotides which are covalently linked to organic moieties, such as those described in WO 90\/10048, and other moieties that increases affinity of the oligonucleotide for a target nucleic acid sequence, such as poly-(L-lysine). Further still, intercalating agents, such as ellipticine, and alkylating agents or metal complexes may be attached to sense or antisense oligonucleotides to modify binding specificities of the antisense or sense oligonucleotide for the target nucleotide sequence.","Antisense or sense oligonucleotides may be introduced into a cell containing the target nucleic acid sequence by any gene transfer method, including, for example, CaPO-mediated DNA transfection, electroporation, or by using gene transfer vectors such as Epstein-Barr virus. In a preferred procedure, an antisense or sense oligonucleotide is inserted into a suitable retroviral vector. A cell containing the target nucleic acid sequence is contacted with the recombinant retroviral vector, either in vivo or ex vivo. Suitable retroviral vectors include, but are not limited to, those derived from the murine retrovirus M-MuLV, N2 (a retrovirus derived from M-MuLV), or the double copy vectors designated DCT5A, DCT5B and DCT5C (see WO 90\/13641).","Sense or antisense oligonucleotides also may be introduced into a cell containing the target nucleotide sequence by formation of a conjugate with a ligand binding molecule, as described in WO 91\/04753. Suitable ligand binding molecules include, but are not limited to, cell surface receptors, growth factors, other cytokines, or other ligands that bind to cell surface receptors. Preferably, conjugation of the ligand binding molecule does not substantially interfere with the ability of the ligand binding molecule to bind to its corresponding molecule or receptor, or block entry of the sense or antisense oligonucleotide or its conjugated version into the cell.","Alternatively, a sense or an antisense oligonucleotide may be introduced into a cell containing the target nucleic acid sequence by formation of an oligonucleotide-lipid complex, as described in WO 90\/10448. The sense or antisense oligonucleotide-lipid complex is preferably dissociated within the cell by an endogenous lipase.","Antisense or sense RNA or DNA molecules are generally at least about 5 bases in length, about 10 bases in length, about 15 bases in length, about 20 bases in length, about 25 bases in length, about 30 bases in length, about 35 bases in length, about 40 bases in length, about 45 bases in length, about 50 bases in length, about 55 bases in length, about 60 bases in length, about 65 bases in length, about 70 bases in length, about 75 bases in length, about 80 bases in length, about 85 bases in length, about 90 bases in length, about 95 bases in length, about 100 bases in length, or more.","The probes may also be employed in PCR techniques to generate a pool of sequences for identification of closely related PRO224, PRO9783, PRO1108, PRO34000, PRO240, PRO943, hu A33, PRO230, PRO178, PRO1199, PRO4333, PRO1336, PRO19598, PRO1083, hu TRPM2 or PRO1801 coding sequences.","Nucleotide sequences encoding a PRO224, PRO9783, PRO1108, PRO34000, PRO240, PRO943, hu A33, PRO230, PRO178, PRO1199, PRO4333, PRO1336, PRO19598, PRO1083, hu TRPM2 or PRO1801 polypeptide can also be used to construct hybridization probes for mapping the gene which encodes that PRO224, PRO9783, PRO1108, PRO34000, PRO240, PRO943, hu A33, PRO230, PRO178, PRO1199, PRO4333, PRO1336, PRO19598, PRO1083, hu TRPM2 or PRO1801 polypeptide and for the genetic analysis of individuals with genetic disorders.

A transgenic animal (e.g., a mouse or rat) is an animal having cells that contain a transgene, which transgene was introduced into the animal or an ancestor of the animal at a prenatal, e.g., an embryonic stage. A transgene is a DNA which is integrated into the genome of a cell from which a transgenic animal develops.

Any technique known in the art may be used to introduce a target gene transgene into animals to produce the founder lines of transgenic animals. Such techniques include, but are not limited to pronuclear microinjection (U.S. Pat.

Such animals can be used as tester animals for reagents thought to confer protection from, for example, pathological conditions associated with its overexpression. In accordance with this facet of the invention, an animal is treated with the reagent and a reduced incidence of the pathological condition, compared to untreated animals bearing the transgene, would indicate a potential therapeutic intervention for the pathological condition.","Alternatively, non-human homologues of PRO224, PRO9783, PRO1108, PRO34000, PRO240, PRO943, hu A33, PRO230, PRO178, PRO1199, PRO4333, PRO1336, PRO19598, PRO1083, hu TRPM2 or PRO1801 polypeptides can be used to construct a PRO224, PRO9783, PRO1108, PRO34000, PRO240, PRO943, hu A33, PRO230, PRO178, PRO1199, PRO4333, PRO1336, PRO19598, PRO1083, hu TRPM2 or PRO1801 \u201cknockout\u201d animal which has a defective or altered gene encoding PRO224, PRO9783, PRO1108, PRO34000, PRO240, PRO943, hu A33, PRO230, PRO178, PRO1199, PRO4333, PRO1336, PRO19598, PRO1083, hu TRPM2 or PRO1801 proteins as a result of homologous recombination between the endogenous gene encoding PRO224, PRO9783, PRO1108, PRO34000, PRO240, PRO943, hu A33, PRO230, PRO178, PRO1199, PRO4333, PRO1336, PRO19598, PRO1083, hu TRPM2 or PRO1801 polypeptides and altered genomic DNA encoding PRO224, PRO9783, PRO1108, PRO34000, PRO240, PRO943, hu A33, PRO230, PRO178, PRO1199, PRO4333, PRO1336, PRO19598, PRO1083, hu TRPM2 or PRO1801 polypeptides introduced into an embryonic stem cell of the animal. Preferably the knock out animal is a mammal. More preferably, the mammal is a rodent such as a rat or mouse. For example, cDNA encoding PRO224, PRO9783, PRO1108, PRO34000, PRO240, PRO943, hu A33, PRO230, PRO178, PRO1199, PRO4333, PRO1336, PRO19598, PRO1083, hu TRPM2 or PRO1801 polypeptides can be used to clone genomic DNA encoding PRO224, PRO9783, PRO1108, PRO34000, PRO240, PRO943, hu A33, PRO230, PRO178, PRO1199, PRO4333, PRO1336, PRO19598, PRO1083, hu TRPM2 or PRO1801 polypeptides in accordance with established techniques. A portion of the genomic DNA encoding the PRO224, PRO9783, PRO1108, PRO34000, PRO240, PRO943, hu A33, PRO230, PRO178, PRO1199, PRO4333, PRO1336, PRO19598, PRO1083, hu TRPM2 or PRO1801 polypeptide can be deleted or replaced with another gene, such as a gene encoding a selectable marker which can be used to monitor integration. Typically, several kilobases of unaltered flanking DNA (both at the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends) are included in the vector [see e.g., Thomas and Capecchi, 51:503 (1987) for a description of homologous recombination vectors]. The vector is introduced into an embryonic stem cell line (e.g., by electroporation) and cells in which the introduced DNA has homologously recombined with the endogenous DNA are selected [see e.g., Li et al., 69:915 (1992)]. The selected cells are then injected into a blastocyst of an animal (e.g., a mouse or rat) to form aggregation chimeras [see e.g., Bradley, in , E. J. Robertson, ed. (IRL, Oxford, 1987), pp. 113-152]. A chimeric embryo can then be implanted into a suitable pseudopregnant female foster animal and the embryo brought to term to create a \u201cknock out\u201d animal. Progeny harboring the homologously recombined DNA in their germ cells can be identified by standard techniques and used to breed animals in which all cells of the animal contain the homologously recombined DNA. Knockout animals can be characterized for instance, for their ability to defend against certain pathological conditions and for their development of pathological conditions due to absence of the gene encoding the PRO224, PRO9783, PRO1108, PRO34000, PRO240, PRO943, hu A33, PRO230, PRO178, PRO1199, PRO4333, PRO1336, PRO19598, PRO1083, hu TRPM2 or PRO1801 polypeptide.","In addition, knockout mice can be highly informative in the discovery of gene function and pharmaceutical utility for a drug target, as well as in the determination of the potential on-target side effects associated with a given target. Gene function and physiology are so well conserved between mice and humans, since they are both mammals and contain similar numbers of genes, which are highly conserved between the species. It has recently been well documented, for example, that 98% of genes on mouse chromosome 16 have a human ortholog (Mural et al., 296:1661-71 (2002)).","Although gene targeting in embryonic stem (ES) cells has enabled the construction of mice with null mutations in many genes associated with human disease, not all genetic diseases are attributable to null mutations. One can design valuable mouse models of human diseases by establishing a method for gene replacement (knock-in) which will disrupt the mouse locus and introduce a human counterpart with mutation, Subsequently one can conduct in vivo drug studies targeting the human protein (Kitamoto et. Al., 222:742-47 (1996)).","Nucleic acid encoding the PRO224, PRO9783, PRO1108, PRO34000, PRO240, PRO943, hu A33, PRO230, PRO178, PRO1199, PRO4333, PRO1336, PRO19598, PRO1083, hu TRPM2 or PRO1801 polypeptides may also be used in gene therapy. In gene therapy applications, genes are introduced into cells in order to achieve in vivo synthesis of a therapeutically effective genetic product, for example for replacement of a defective gene. \u201cGene therapy\u201d includes both conventional gene therapy where a lasting effect is achieved by a single treatment, and the administration of gene therapeutic agents, which involves the one time or repeated administration of a therapeutically effective DNA or mRNA. Antisense RNAs and DNAs can be used as therapeutic agents for blocking the expression of certain genes in vivo. It has already been shown that short antisense oligonucleotides can be imported into cells where they act as inhibitors, despite their low intracellular concentrations caused by their restricted uptake by the cell membrane. (Zamecnik et al., 83:4143-4146 [1986]). The oligonucleotides can be modified to enhance their uptake, e.g. by substituting their negatively charged phosphodiester groups by uncharged groups.","There are a variety of techniques available for introducing nucleic acids into viable cells. The techniques vary depending upon whether the nucleic acid is transferred into cultured cells in vitro, or in vivo in the cells of the intended host. Techniques suitable for the transfer of nucleic acid into mammalian cells in vitro include the use of liposomes, electroporation, microinjection, cell fusion, DEAE-dextran, the calcium phosphate precipitation method, etc. The currently preferred in vivo gene transfer techniques include transfection with viral (typically retroviral) vectors and viral coat protein-liposome mediated transfection (Dzau et al., 11, 205-210 [1993]). In some situations it is desirable to provide the nucleic acid source with an agent that targets the target cells, such as an antibody specific for a cell surface membrane protein or the target cell, a ligand for a receptor on the target cell, etc. Where liposomes are employed, proteins which bind to a cell surface membrane protein associated with endocytosis may be used for targeting and\/or to facilitate uptake, e.g. capsid proteins or fragments thereof tropic for a particular cell type, antibodies for proteins which undergo internalization in cycling, proteins that target intracellular localization and enhance intracellular half-life. The technique of receptor-mediated endocytosis is described, for example, by Wu et al., 262, 4429-4432 (1987); and Wagner et al., 87, 3410-3414 (1990).

Such screening assays will include assays amenable to high-throughput screening of chemical libraries, making them particularly suitable for identifying small molecule drug candidates.","The assays can be performed in a variety of formats, including protein-protein binding assays, biochemical screening assays, immunoassays, and cell-based assays, which are well characterized in the art.","All assays for antagonists are common in that they call for contacting the drug candidate with a PRO224, PRO9783, PRO1108, PRO34000, PRO240, PRO943, hu A33, PRO230, PRO178, PRO1199, PRO4333, PRO1336, PRO19598, PRO1083, hu TRPM2 or PRO1801 polypeptide encoded by a nucleic acid identified herein under conditions and for a time sufficient to allow these two components to interact.","In binding assays, the interaction is binding and the complex formed can be isolated or detected in the reaction mixture. The PRO224, PRO9783, PRO1108, PRO34000, PRO240, PRO943, hu A33, PRO230, PRO178, PRO1199, PRO4333, PRO1336, PRO19598, PRO1083, hu TRPM2 or PRO1801 polypeptide encoded by the gene identified herein or the drug candidate is immobilized on a solid phase, e.g., on a microtiter plate, by covalent or non-covalent attachments. Non-covalent attachment generally is accomplished by coating the solid surface with a solution of the PRO224, PRO9783, PRO1108, PRO34000, PRO240, PRO943, hu A33, PRO230, PRO178, PRO1199, PRO4333, PRO1336, PRO19598, PRO1083, hu TRPM2 or PRO1801 polypeptide and drying. Alternatively, an immobilized antibody, e.g., a monoclonal antibody, specific for the PRO224, PRO9783, PRO1108, PRO34000, PRO240, PRO943, hu A33, PRO230, PRO178, PRO1199, PRO4333, PRO1336, PRO19598, PRO1083, hu TRPM2 or PRO1801 polypeptide to be immobilized can be used to anchor it to a solid surface. The assay is performed by adding the non-immobilized component, which may be labeled by a detectable label, to the immobilized component, e.g., the coated surface containing the anchored component. When the reaction is complete, the non-reacted components are removed, e.g., by washing, and complexes anchored on the solid surface are detected. When the originally non-immobilized component carries a detectable label, the detection of label immobilized on the surface indicates that complexing occurred. Where the originally non-immobilized component does not carry a label, complexing can be detected, for example, by using a labeled antibody specifically binding the immobilized complex.","If the candidate compound interacts with but does not bind to a particular PRO224, PRO9783, PRO1108, PRO34000, PRO240, PRO943, hu A33, PRO230, PRO178, PRO1199, PRO4333, PRO1336, PRO19598, PRO1083, hu TRPM2 or PRO1801 polypeptide encoded by a gene identified herein, its interaction with that polypeptide can be assayed by methods well known for detecting protein-protein interactions. Such assays include traditional approaches, such as, e.g., cross-linking, co-immunoprecipitation, and co-purification through gradients or chromatographic columns. In addition, protein-protein interactions can be monitored by using a yeast-based genetic system described by Fields and co-workers (Fields and Song, (), 340:245-246 (1989); Chien et al., 88:9578-9582 (1991)) as disclosed by Chevray and Nathans, 89: 5789-5793 (1991). Many transcriptional activators, such as yeast GAL4, consist of two physically discrete modular domains, one acting as the DNA-binding domain, the other one functioning as the transcription-activation domain. The yeast expression system described in the foregoing publications (generally referred to as the \u201ctwo-hybrid system\u201d) takes advantage of this property, and employs two hybrid proteins, one in which the target protein is fused to the DNA-binding domain of GAL4, and another, in which candidate activating proteins are fused to the activation domain. The expression of a GAL1-lacZ reporter gene under control of a GAL4-activated promoter depends on reconstitution of GAL4 activity via protein-protein interaction. Colonies containing interacting polypeptides are detected with a chromogenic substrate for \u03b2-galactosidase. A complete kit (MATCHMAKER\u2122) for identifying protein-protein interactions between two specific proteins using the two-hybrid technique is commercially available from Clontech. This system can also be extended to map protein domains involved in specific protein interactions as well as to pinpoint amino acid residues that are crucial for these interactions.","Compounds that interfere with the interaction of a gene encoding a PRO224, PRO9783, PRO1108, PRO34000, PRO240, PRO943, hu A33, PRO230, PRO178, PRO1199, PRO4333, PRO1336, PRO19598, PRO1083, hu TRPM2 or PRO1801 polypeptide identified herein and other intra- or extracellular components can be tested as follows: usually a reaction mixture is prepared containing the product of the gene and the intra- or extracellular component under conditions and for a time allowing for the interaction and binding of the two products. To test the ability of a candidate compound to inhibit binding, the reaction is run in the absence and in the presence of the test compound. In addition, a placebo may be added to a third reaction mixture, to serve as positive control. The binding (complex formation) between the test compound and the intra- or extracellular component present in the mixture is monitored as described hereinabove. The formation of a complex in the control reaction(s) but not in the reaction mixture containing the test compound indicates that the test compound interferes with the interaction of the test compound and its reaction partner.","To assay for antagonists, the PRO224, PRO9783, PRO1108, PRO34000, PRO240, PRO943, hu A33, PRO230, PRO178, PRO1199, PRO4333, PRO1336, PRO19598, PRO1083, hu TRPM2 or PRO1801 polypeptide may be added to a cell along with the compound to be screened for a particular activity and the ability of the compound to inhibit the activity of interest in the presence of the PRO224, PRO9783, PRO1108, PRO34000, PRO240, PRO943, hu A33, PRO230, PRO178, PRO1199, PRO4333, PRO1336, PRO19598, PRO1083, hu TRPM2 or PRO1801 polypeptide indicates that the compound is an antagonist to the PRO224, PRO9783, PRO1108, PRO34000, PRO240, PRO943, hu A33, PRO230, PRO178, PRO1199, PRO4333, PRO1336, PRO19598, PRO1083, hu TRPM2 or PRO1801 polypeptide.

The gene encoding the receptor can be identified by numerous methods known to those of skill in the art, for example, ligand panning and FACS sorting. Coligan et al., 1(2): Chapter 5 (1991). Preferably, expression cloning is employed wherein polyadenylated RNA is prepared from a cell responsive to the PRO224, PRO9783, PRO1108, PRO34000, PRO240, PRO943, hu A33, PRO230, PRO178, PRO1199, PRO4333, PRO1336, PRO19598, PRO1083, hu TRPM2 or PRO1801 polypeptide and a cDNA library created from this RNA is divided into pools and used to transfect COS cells or other cells that are not responsive to the PRO224, PRO9783, PRO1108, PRO34000, PRO240, PRO943, hu A33, PRO230, PRO178, PRO1199, PRO4333, PRO1336, PRO19598, PRO1083, hu TRPM2 or PRO1801 polypeptide.

Following fixation and incubation, the slides are subjected to autoradiographic analysis. Positive pools are identified and sub-pools are prepared and re-transfected using an interactive sub-pooling and re-screening process, eventually yielding a single clone that encodes the putative receptor.","As an alternative approach for receptor identification, the labeled PRO224, PRO9783, PRO1108, PRO34000, PRO240, PRO943, hu A33, PRO230, PRO178, PRO1199, PRO4333, PRO1336, PRO19598, PRO1083, hu TRPM2 or PRO1801 polypeptide can be photoaffinity-linked with cell membrane or extract preparations that express the receptor molecule. Cross-linked material is resolved by PAGE and exposed to X-ray film. The labeled complex containing the receptor can be excised, resolved into peptide fragments, and subjected to protein micro-sequencing. The amino acid sequence obtained from micro-sequencing would be used to design a set of degenerate oligonucleotide probes to screen a cDNA library to identify the gene encoding the putative receptor.","Another approach in assessing the effect of an antagonist to a PRO224, PRO9783, PRO1108, PRO34000, PRO240, PRO943, hu A33, PRO230, PRO178, PRO1199, PRO4333, PRO1336, PRO19598, PRO1083, hu TRPM2 or PRO1801 polypeptide, would be administering a PRO224, PRO9783, PRO1108, PRO34000, PRO240, PRO943, hu A33, PRO230, PRO178, PRO1199, PRO4333, PRO1336, PRO19598, PRO1083, hu TRPM2 or PRO1801 antagonist to a wild-type mouse in order to mimic a known knockout phenotype.

Antisense technology can be used to control gene expression through triple-helix formation or antisense DNA or RNA, both of which methods are based on binding of a polynucleotide to DNA or RNA. For example, the 5\u2032 coding portion of the polynucleotide sequence, which encodes the mature PRO224, PRO9783, PRO1108, PRO34000, PRO240, PRO943, hu A33, PRO230, PRO178, PRO1199, PRO4333, PRO1336, PRO19598, PRO1083, hu TRPM2 or PRO1801 polypeptides herein, is used to design an antisense RNA oligonucleotide of from about 10 to 40 base pairs in length. A DNA oligonucleotide is designed to be complementary to a region of the gene involved in transcription (triple helix\u2014see Lee et al., 6:3073 (1979); Cooney et al., 241: 456 (1988); Dervan et al., 251:1360 (1991)), thereby preventing transcription and the production of the PRO224, PRO9783, PRO1108, PRO34000, PRO240, PRO943, hu A33, PRO230, PRO178, PRO1199, PRO4333, PRO1336, PRO19598, PRO1083, hu TRPM2 or PRO1801 polypeptide.

When antisense DNA is used, oligodeoxyribonucleotides derived from the translation-initiation site, e.g., between about \u221210 and +10 positions of the target gene nucleotide sequence, are preferred.","Potential antagonists include small molecules that bind to the active site, the receptor binding site, or growth factor or other relevant binding site of the PRO224, PRO9783, PRO1108, PRO34000, PRO240, PRO943, hu A33, PRO230, PRO178, PRO1199, PRO4333, PRO1336, PRO19598, PRO1083, hu TRPM2 or PRO1801 polypeptide, thereby blocking the normal biological activity of the PRO224, PRO9783, PRO1108, PRO34000, PRO240, PRO943, hu A33, PRO230, PRO178, PRO1199, PRO4333, PRO1336, PRO19598, PRO1083, hu TRPM2 or PRO1801 polypeptide.

Exemplary antibodies include polyclonal, monoclonal, humanized, bispecific, and heteroconjugate antibodies.","1. Polyclonal Antibodies","Polyclonal antibodies are preferably raised in animals by multiple subcutaneous (sc) or intraperitoneal (ip) injections of the relevant antigen and an adjuvant. It may be useful to conjugate the relevant antigen (especially when synthetic peptides are used) to a protein that is immunogenic in the species to be immunized. For example, the antigen can be conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH), serum albumin, bovine thyroglobulin, or soybean trypsin inhibitor, using a bifunctional or derivatizing agent, e.g., maleimidobenzoyl sulfosuccinimide ester (conjugation through cysteine residues), N-hydroxysuccinimide (through lysine residues), glutaraldehyde, succinic anhydride, SOCl, or RN\u2550C\u2550NR, where R and Rare different alkyl groups.","Animals are immunized against the antigen, immunogenic conjugates, or derivatives by combining, e.g., 100 \u03bcg or 5 \u03bcg of the protein or conjugate (for rabbits or mice, respectively) with 3 volumes of Freund's complete adjuvant and injecting the solution intradermally at multiple sites. One month later, the animals are boosted with \u2155 to 1\/10 the original amount of peptide or conjugate in Freund's complete adjuvant by subcutaneous injection at multiple sites. Seven to 14 days later, the animals are bled and the serum is assayed for antibody titer. Animals are boosted until the titer plateaus. Conjugates also can be made in recombinant cell culture as protein fusions. Also, aggregating agents such as alum are suitably used to enhance the immune response.","2. Monoclonal Antibodies","Monoclonal antibodies may be made using the hybridoma method first described by Kohler et al., 256:495 (1975), or may be made by recombinant DNA methods (U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567).","In the hybridoma method, a mouse or other appropriate host animal, such as a hamster, is immunized as described above to elicit lymphocytes that produce or are capable of producing antibodies that will specifically bind to the protein used for immunization. Alternatively, lymphocytes may be immunized in vitro. After immunization, lymphocytes are isolated and then fused with a myeloma cell line using a suitable fusing agent, such as polyethylene glycol, to form a hybridoma cell (Goding, , pp. 59-103 (Academic Press, 1986)).","The hybridoma cells thus prepared are seeded and grown in a suitable culture medium which medium preferably contains one or more substances that inhibit the growth or survival of the unfused, parental myeloma cells (also referred to as fusion partner). For example, if the parental myeloma cells lack the enzyme hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT or HPRT), the selective culture medium for the hybridomas typically will include hypoxanthine, aminopterin, and thymidine (HAT medium), which substances prevent the growth of HGPRT-deficient cells.","Preferred fusion partner myeloma cells are those that fuse efficiently, support stable high-level production of antibody by the selected antibody-producing cells, and are sensitive to a selective medium that selects against the unfused parental cells. Preferred myeloma cell lines are murine myeloma lines, such as those derived from MOPC-21 and MPC-11 mouse tumors available from the Salk Institute Cell Distribution Center, San Diego, Calif. USA, and SP-2 and derivatives e.g., X63-Ag8-653 cells available from the American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, Va., USA. Human myeloma and mouse-human heteromyeloma cell lines also have been described for the production of human monoclonal antibodies (Kozbor, 133:3001 (1984); and Brodeur et al., , pp. 51-63 (Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, 1987)).","Culture medium in which hybridoma cells are growing is assayed for production of monoclonal antibodies directed against the antigen. Preferably, the binding specificity of monoclonal antibodies produced by hybridoma cells is determined by immunoprecipitation or by an in vitro binding assay, such as radioimmunoassay (RIA) or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).","The binding affinity of the monoclonal antibody can, for example, be determined by the Scatchard analysis described in Munson et al., 107:220 (1980).","Once hybridoma cells that produce antibodies of the desired specificity, affinity, and\/or activity are identified, the clones may be subcloned by limiting dilution procedures and grown by standard methods (Goding, , pp. 59-103 (Academic Press, 1986)). Suitable culture media for this purpose include, for example, D-MEM or RPMI-1640 medium. In addition, the hybridoma cells may be grown in vivo as ascites tumors in an animal e.g., by i.p. injection of the cells into mice.","The monoclonal antibodies secreted by the subclones are suitably separated from the culture medium, ascites fluid, or serum by conventional antibody purification procedures such as, for example, affinity chromatography (e.g., using protein A or protein G-Sepharose) or ion-exchange chromatography, hydroxylapatite chromatography, gel electrophoresis, dialysis, etc.","DNA encoding the monoclonal antibodies is readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures (e.g., by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of murine antibodies). The hybridoma cells serve as a preferred source of such DNA. Once isolated, the DNA may be placed into expression vectors, which are then transfected into host cells such as cells, simian COS cells, Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells, or myeloma cells that do not otherwise produce antibody protein, to obtain the synthesis of monoclonal antibodies in the recombinant host cells. Review articles on recombinant expression in bacteria of DNA encoding the antibody include Skerra et al., 5:256-262 (1993) and Pl\u00fcckthun, 130:151-188 (1992).","Monoclonal antibodies or antibody fragments can be isolated from antibody phage libraries generated using the techniques described in McCafferty et al., 348:552-554(1990). Clackson et al., 352:624-628 (1991) and Marks et al., 222:581-597 (1991) describe the isolation of murine and human antibodies, respectively, using phage libraries. Subsequent publications describe the production of high affinity (nM range) human antibodies by chain shuffling (Marks et al., 10:779-783 (1992)), as well as combinatorial infection and in vivo recombination as a strategy for constructing very large phage libraries (Waterhouse et al., 21:2265-2266 (1993)). Thus, these techniques are viable alternatives to traditional monoclonal antibody hybridoma techniques for isolation of monoclonal antibodies.","The DNA that encodes the antibody may be modified to produce chimeric or fusion antibody polypeptides, for example, by substituting human heavy chain and light chain constant domain (Cand C) sequences for the homologous murine sequences (U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567; and Morrison, et al., 81:6851 (1984)), or by fusing the immunoglobulin coding sequence with all or part of the coding sequence for a non-immunoglobulin polypeptide (heterologous polypeptide). The non-immunoglobulin polypeptide sequences can substitute for the constant domains of an antibody, or they are substituted for the variable domains of one antigen-combining site of an antibody to create a chimeric bivalent antibody comprising one antigen-combining site having specificity for an antigen and another antigen-combining site having specificity for a different antigen.","3. Human and Humanized Antibodies","The anti-PRO224, anti-PRO9783, anti-PRO1108, anti-PRO34000, anti-PRO240, anti-PRO943, anti-hu A33, anti-PRO230, anti-PRO178, anti-PRO1199, anti-PRO4333, anti-PRO1336, anti-PRO19598, anti-PRO1083, anti-hu TRPM2 or anti-PRO1801 antibodies of the invention may further comprise humanized antibodies or human antibodies. Humanized forms of non-human (e.g., murine) antibodies are chimeric immunoglobulins, immunoglobulin chains or fragments thereof (such as Fv, Fab, Fab\u2032, F(ab\u2032)or other antigen-binding subsequences of antibodies) which contain minimal sequence derived from non-human immunoglobulin. Humanized antibodies include human immunoglobulins (recipient antibody) in which residues from a complementary determining region (CDR) of the recipient are replaced by residues from a CDR of a non-human species (donor antibody) such as mouse, rat or rabbit having the desired specificity, affinity and capacity. In some instances, Fv framework residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non-human residues. Humanized antibodies may also comprise residues which are found neither in the recipient antibody nor in the imported CDR or framework sequences. In general, the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains, in which all or substantially all of the CDR regions correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FR regions are those of a human immunoglobulin consensus sequence. The humanized antibody optimally also will comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin [Jones et al., 321:522-525 (1986); Riechmann et al., 332:323-329 (1988); and Presta, 2:593-596 (1992)].","Methods for humanizing non-human antibodies are well known in the art. Generally, a humanized antibody has one or more amino acid residues introduced into it from a source which is non-human. These non-human amino acid residues are often referred to as \u201cimport\u201d residues, which are typically taken from an \u201cimport\u201d variable domain. Humanization can be essentially performed following the method of Winter and co-workers [Jones et al., 321:522-525 (1986); Riechmann et al., 332:323-327 (1988); Verhoeyen et al., 239:1534-1536 (1988)], by substituting rodent CDRs or CDR sequences for the corresponding sequences of a human antibody. Accordingly, such \u201chumanized\u201d antibodies are chimeric antibodies (U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567), wherein substantially less than an intact human variable domain has been substituted by the corresponding sequence from a non-human species. In practice, humanized antibodies are typically human antibodies in which some CDR residues and possibly some FR residues are substituted by residues from analogous sites in rodent antibodies.","The choice of human variable domains, both light and heavy, to be used in making the humanized antibodies is very important to reduce antigenicity and HAMA response (human anti-mouse antibody) when the antibody is intended for human therapeutic use. According to the so-called \u201cbest-fit\u201d method, the sequence of the variable domain of a rodent antibody is screened against the entire library of known human variable domain sequences. The human V domain sequence which is closest to that of the rodent is identified and the human framework region (FR) within it accepted for the humanized antibody (Sims et al., 151:2296 (1993); Chothia et al., 196:901 (1987)). Another method uses a particular framework region derived from the consensus sequence of all human antibodies of a particular subgroup of light or heavy chains. The same framework may be used for several different humanized antibodies (Carter et al., 89:4285 (1992); Presta et al., 151:2623 (1993)).","It is further important that antibodies be humanized with retention of high binding affinity for the antigen and other favorable biological properties. To achieve this goal, according to a preferred method, humanized antibodies are prepared by a process of analysis of the parental sequences and various conceptual humanized products using three-dimensional models of the parental and humanized sequences. Three-dimensional immunoglobulin models are commonly available and are familiar to those skilled in the art. Computer programs are available which illustrate and display probable three-dimensional conformational structures of selected candidate immunoglobulin sequences. Inspection of these displays permits analysis of the likely role of the residues in the functioning of the candidate immunoglobulin sequence, i.e., the analysis of residues that influence the ability of the candidate immunoglobulin to bind its antigen. In this way, FR residues can be selected and combined from the recipient and import sequences so that the desired antibody characteristic, such as increased affinity for the target antigen(s), is achieved. In general, the hypervariable region residues are directly and most substantially involved in influencing antigen binding.","Various forms of a humanized anti-PRO224, anti-PRO9783, anti-PRO1108, anti-PRO34000, anti-PRO240, anti-PRO943, anti-hu A33, anti-PRO230, anti-PRO178, anti-PRO1199, anti-PRO4333, anti-PRO1336, anti-PRO19598, anti-PRO1083, anti-hu TRPM2 or anti-PRO1801 antibody are contemplated. For example, the humanized antibody may be an antibody fragment, such as a Fab, which is optionally conjugated with one or more cytotoxic agent(s) in order to generate an immunoconjugate. Alternatively, the humanized antibody may be an intact antibody, such as an intact IgG1 antibody.","As an alternative to humanization, human antibodies can be generated. For example, it is now possible to produce transgenic animals (e.g., mice) that are capable, upon immunization, of producing a full repertoire of human antibodies in the absence of endogenous immunoglobulin production. For example, it has been described that the homozygous deletion of the antibody heavy-chain joining region (J) gene in chimeric and germ-line mutant mice results in complete inhibition of endogenous antibody production. Transfer of the human germ-line immunoglobulin gene array into such germ-line mutant mice will result in the production of human antibodies upon antigen challenge. See, e.g., Jakobovits et al., 90:2551 (1993); Jakobovits et al., 362:255-258 (1993); Bruggemann et al., 7:33 (1993); U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,545,806, 5,569,825, 5,591,669 (all of GenPharm); 5,545,807; and WO 97\/17852.","Alternatively, phage display technology (McCafferty et al., 348:552-553 [1990]) can be used to produce human antibodies and antibody fragments in vitro, from immunoglobulin variable (V) domain gene repertoires from unimmunized donors. According to this technique, antibody V domain genes are cloned in-frame into either a major or minor coat protein gene of a filamentous bacteriophage, such as M13 or fd, and displayed as functional antibody fragments on the surface of the phage particle. Because the filamentous particle contains a single-stranded DNA copy of the phage genome, selections based on the functional properties of the antibody also result in selection of the gene encoding the antibody exhibiting those properties. Thus, the phage mimics some of the properties of the B-cell. Phage display can be performed in a variety of formats, reviewed in, e.g., Johnson, Kevin S, and Chiswell, David J., 3:564-571 (1993). Several sources of V-gene segments can be used for phage display. Clackson et al., 352:624-628 (1991) isolated a diverse array of anti-oxazolone antibodies from a small random combinatorial library of V genes derived from the spleens of immunized mice. A repertoire of V genes from unimmunized human donors can be constructed and antibodies to a diverse array of antigens (including self-antigens) can be isolated essentially following the techniques described by Marks et al., 222:581-597 (1991), or Griffith et al., 12:725-734 (1993). See, also, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,565,332 and 5,573,905.","As discussed above, human antibodies may also be generated by in vitro activated B cells (see U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,567,610 and 5,229,275).","4. Antibody Fragments","In certain circumstances there are advantages of using antibody fragments, rather than whole antibodies. The smaller size of the fragments allows for rapid clearance, and may lead to improved access to solid tumors.","Various techniques have been developed for the production of antibody fragments. Traditionally, these fragments were derived via proteolytic digestion of intact antibodies (see, e.g., Morimoto et al., 24:107-117 (1992); and Brennan et al., 229:81 (1985)). However, these fragments can now be produced directly by recombinant host cells. Fab, Fv and ScFv antibody fragments can all be expressed in and secreted from , thus allowing the facile production of large amounts of these fragments. Antibody fragments can be isolated from the antibody phage libraries discussed above. Alternatively, Fab\u2032-SH fragments can be directly recovered from and chemically coupled to form F(ab\u2032)fragments (Carter et al., 10:163-167 (1992)). According to another approach, F(ab\u2032)fragments can be isolated directly from recombinant host cell culture. Fab and F(ab\u2032)fragment with increased in vivo half-life comprising a salvage receptor binding epitope residues are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,869,046. Other techniques for the production of antibody fragments will be apparent to the skilled practitioner. The antibody of choice is a single chain Fv fragment (scFv). See WO 93\/16185; U.S. Pat. No. 5,571,894; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,587,458. Fv and sFv are the only species with intact combining sites that are devoid of constant regions; thus, they are suitable for reduced nonspecific binding during in vivo use. sFv fusion proteins may be constructed to yield fusion of an effector protein at either the amino or the carboxy terminus of an sFv. See , ed. Borrebaeck, supra. The antibody fragment may also be a \u201clinear antibody\u201d, e.g., as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,641,870 for example. Such linear antibody fragments may be monospecific or bispecific.","5. Bispecific Antibodies","Bispecific antibodies are antibodies that have binding specificities for at least two different epitopes. Exemplary bispecific antibodies may bind to two different epitopes of a PRO224, PRO9783, PRO1108, PRO34000, PRO240, PRO943, hu A33, PRO230, PRO178, PRO1199, PRO4333, PRO1336, PRO19598, PRO1083, hu TRPM2 or PRO1801 protein as described herein. Other such antibodies may combine a PRO224, PRO9783, PRO1108, PRO34000, PRO240, PRO943, hu A33, PRO230, PRO178, PRO1199, PRO4333, PRO1336, PRO19598, PRO1083, hu TRPM2 or PRO1801 binding site with a binding site for another protein. Alternatively, an anti-PRO224, anti-PRO9783, anti-PRO1108, anti-PRO34000, anti-PRO240, anti-PRO943, anti-hu A33, anti-PRO230, anti-PRO178, anti-PRO1199, anti-PRO4333, anti-PRO1336, anti-PRO19598, anti-PRO1083, anti-hu TRPM2 or anti-PRO1801 arm may be combined with an arm which binds to a triggering molecule on a leukocyte such as a T-cell receptor molecule (e.g. CD3), or Fc receptors for IgG (Fc\u03b3R), such as Fc\u03b3RI (CD64), Fc\u03b3RII (CD32) and Fc\u03b3RIII (CD16), so as to focus and localize cellular defense mechanisms to the PRO224-, PRO9783-, PRO1108-, PRO34000-, PRO240-, PRO943-, hu A33-, PRO230-, PRO178-, PRO1199-, PRO4333-, PRO1336-, PRO19598-, PRO1083-, hu TRPM2- or PRO1801-expressing cell. Bispecific antibodies may also be used to localize cytotoxic agents to cells which express a PRO224, PRO9783, PRO1108, PRO34000, PRO240, PRO943, hu A33, PRO230, PRO178, PRO1199, PRO4333, PRO1336, PRO19598, PRO1083, hu TRPM2 or PRO1801 polypeptide. These antibodies possess a PRO224-, PRO9783-, PRO1108-, PRO34000-, PRO240-, PRO943-, hu A33-, PRO230-, PRO178-, PRO1199-, PRO4333-, PRO1336-, PRO19598-, PRO1083-, hu TRPM2- or PRO1801-binding arm and an arm which binds the cytotoxic agent (e.g., saporin, anti-interferon-\u03b1, vinca alkaloid, ricin A chain, methotrexate or radioactive isotope hapten). Bispecific antibodies can be prepared as full length antibodies or antibody fragments (e.g., F(ab\u2032)bispecific antibodies).","WO 96\/16673 describes a bispecific anti-ErbB2\/anti-Fc\u03b3RIII antibody and U.S. Pat. No. 5,837,234 discloses a bispecific anti-ErbB2\/anti-Fc\u03b3RI antibody. A bispecific anti-ErbB2\/Fc\u03b1 antibody is shown in WO98\/02463. U.S. Pat. No. 5,821,337 teaches a bispecific anti-ErbB2\/anti-CD3 antibody.","Methods for making bispecific antibodies are known in the art. Traditional production of full length bispecific antibodies is based on the co-expression of two immunoglobulin heavy chain-light chain pairs, where the two chains have different specificities (Millstein et al., 305:537-539 (1983)). Because of the random assortment of immunoglobulin heavy and light chains, these hybridomas (quadromas) produce a potential mixture of 10 different antibody molecules, of which only one has the correct bispecific structure. Purification of the correct molecule, which is usually done by affinity chromatography steps, is rather cumbersome, and the product yields are low. Similar procedures are disclosed in WO 93\/08829, and in Traunecker et al., 10:3655-3659 (1991).","According to a different approach, antibody variable domains with the desired binding specificity (antibody-antigen combining sites) are fused to immunoglobulin constant domain sequences. Preferably, the fusion is with an Ig heavy chain constant domain, comprising at least part of the hinge, C2, and C3 regions. It is preferred to have the first heavy-chain constant region (C1) containing the site necessary for light chain bonding, present in at least one of the fusions. DNAs encoding the immunoglobulin heavy chain fusions and, if desired, the immunoglobulin light chain, are inserted into separate expression vectors, and are co-transfected into a suitable host cell. This provides for greater flexibility in adjusting the mutual proportions of the three polypeptide fragments when unequal ratios of the three polypeptide chains used in the construction provide the optimum yield of the desired bispecific antibody. It is, however, possible to insert the coding sequences for two or all three polypeptide chains into a single expression vector when the expression of at least two polypeptide chains in equal ratios results in high yields or when the ratios have no significant affect on the yield of the desired chain combination.","The invention provides bispecific antibodies which are composed of a hybrid immunoglobulin heavy chain with a first binding specificity in one arm, and a hybrid immunoglobulin heavy chain-light chain pair (providing a second binding specificity) in the other arm. It was found that this asymmetric structure facilitates the separation of the desired bispecific compound from unwanted immunoglobulin chain combinations, as the presence of an immunoglobulin light chain in only one half of the bispecific molecule provides for a facile way of separation. This approach is disclosed in WO 94\/04690. For further details of generating bispecific antibodies see, for example, Suresh et al., 121:210 (1986).","According to another approach described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,731,168, the interface between a pair of antibody molecules can be engineered to maximize the percentage of heterodimers which are recovered from recombinant cell culture. The preferred interface comprises at least a part of the C3 domain. In this method, one or more small amino acid side chains from the interface of the first antibody molecule are replaced with larger side chains (e.g., tyrosine or tryptophan). Compensatory \u201ccavities\u201d of identical or similar size to the large side chain(s) are created on the interface of the second antibody molecule by replacing large amino acid side chains with smaller ones (e.g., alanine or threonine). This provides a mechanism for increasing the yield of the heterodimer over other unwanted end-products such as homodimers.","Bispecific antibodies include cross-linked or \u201cheteroconjugate\u201d antibodies. For example, one of the antibodies in the heteroconjugate can be coupled to avidin, the other to biotin. Such antibodies have, for example, been proposed to target immune system cells to unwanted cells (U.S. Pat. No. 4,676,980), and for treatment of HIV infection (WO 91\/00360, WO 92\/200373, and EP 03089). Heteroconjugate antibodies may be made using any convenient cross-linking methods. Suitable cross-linking agents are well known in the art, and are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,676,980, along with a number of cross-linking techniques.","Techniques for generating bispecific antibodies from antibody fragments have also been described in the literature. For example, bispecific antibodies can be prepared using chemical linkage. Brennan et al., 229:81 (1985) describe a procedure wherein intact antibodies are proteolytically cleaved to generate F(ab\u2032)fragments. These fragments are reduced in the presence of the dithiol complexing agent, sodium arsenite, to stabilize vicinal dithiols and prevent intermolecular disulfide formation. The Fab\u2032 fragments generated are then converted to thionitrobenzoate (TNB) derivatives. One of the Fab\u2032-TNB derivatives is then reconverted to the Fab\u2032-thiol by reduction with mercaptoethylamine and is mixed with an equimolar amount of the other Fab\u2032-TNB derivative to form the bispecific antibody. The bispecific antibodies produced can be used as agents for the selective immobilization of enzymes.","Recent progress has facilitated the direct recovery of Fab\u2032-SH fragments from , which can be chemically coupled to form bispecific antibodies. Shalaby et al., 175: 217-225 (1992) describe the production of a fully humanized bispecific antibody F(ab\u2032)molecule. Each Fab\u2032 fragment was separately secreted from and subjected to directed chemical coupling in vitro to form the bispecific antibody. The bispecific antibody thus formed was able to bind to cells overexpressing the ErbB2 receptor and normal human T cells, as well as trigger the lytic activity of human cytotoxic lymphocytes against human breast tumor targets. Various techniques for making and isolating bispecific antibody fragments directly from recombinant cell culture have also been described. For example, bispecific antibodies have been produced using leucine zippers. Kostelny et al., 148(5):1547-1553 (1992). The leucine zipper peptides from the Fos and Jun proteins were linked to the Fab\u2032 portions of two different antibodies by gene fusion. The antibody homodimers were reduced at the hinge region to form monomers and then re-oxidized to form the antibody heterodimers. This method can also be utilized for the production of antibody homodimers. The \u201cdiabody\u201d technology described by Hollinger et al., 90:6444-6448 (1993) has provided an alternative mechanism for making bispecific antibody fragments. The fragments comprise a Vconnected to a Vby a linker which is too short to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain. Accordingly, the Vand Vdomains of one fragment are forced to pair with the complementary Vand Vdomains of another fragment, thereby forming two antigen-binding sites. Another strategy for making bispecific antibody fragments by the use of single-chain Fv (sFv) dimers has also been reported. See Gruber et al., 152:5368 (1994).","Antibodies with more than two valencies are contemplated. For example, trispecific antibodies can be prepared. Tutt et al., 147:60 (1991).","6. Heteroconjugate Antibodies","Heteroconjugate antibodies are also within the scope of the present invention. Heteroconjugate antibodies are composed of two covalently joined antibodies. Such antibodies have, for example, been proposed to target immune system cells to unwanted cells [U.S. Pat. No. 4,676,980], and for treatment of HIV infection [WO 91\/00360; WO 92\/200373; EP 03089]. It is contemplated that the antibodies may be prepared in vitro using known methods in synthetic protein chemistry, including those involving crosslinking agents. For example, immunotoxins may be constructed using a disulfide exchange reaction or by forming a thioether bond. Examples of suitable reagents for this purpose include iminothiolate and methyl-4-mercaptobutyrimidate and those disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,676,980.","7. Multivalent Antibodies","A multivalent antibody may be internalized (and\/or catabolized) faster than a bivalent antibody by a cell expressing an antigen to which the antibodies bind. The antibodies of the present invention can be multivalent antibodies (which are other than of the IgM class) with three or more antigen binding sites (e.g. tetravalent antibodies), which can be readily produced by recombinant expression of nucleic acid encoding the polypeptide chains of the antibody. The multivalent antibody can comprise a dimerization domain and three or more antigen binding sites. The preferred dimerization domain comprises (or consists of) an Fc region or a hinge region. In this scenario, the antibody will comprise an Fc region and three or more antigen binding sites amino-terminal to the Fc region. The preferred multivalent antibody herein comprises (or consists of) three to about eight, but preferably four, antigen binding sites. The multivalent antibody comprises at least one polypeptide chain (and preferably two polypeptide chains), wherein the polypeptide chain(s) comprise two or more variable domains. For instance, the polypeptide chain(s) may comprise VD1-(X1)-VD2-(X2)-Fc, wherein VD1 is a first variable domain, VD2 is a second variable domain, Fc is one polypeptide chain of an Fc region, X1 and X2 represent an amino acid or polypeptide, and n is 0 or 1. For instance, the polypeptide chain(s) may comprise: VH-CH1-flexible linker-VH-CH1-Fc region chain; or VH-CH1-VH-CH1-Fc region chain. The multivalent antibody herein preferably further comprises at least two (and preferably four) light chain variable domain polypeptides. The multivalent antibody herein may, for instance, comprise from about two to about eight light chain variable domain polypeptides. The light chain variable domain polypeptides contemplated here comprise a light chain variable domain and, optionally, further comprise a CL domain.","8. Effector Function Engineering","It may be desirable to modify the antibody of the invention with respect to effector function, e.g., so as to enhance antigen-dependent cell-mediated cyotoxicity (ADCC) and\/or complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) of the antibody. This may be achieved by introducing one or more amino acid substitutions in an Fc region of the antibody. Alternatively or additionally, cysteine residue(s) may be introduced in the Fc region, thereby allowing interchain disulfide bond formation in this region. The homodimeric antibody thus generated may have improved internalization capability and\/or increased complement-mediated cell killing and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). See Caron et al., 176:1191-1195 (1992) and Shopes, B. 148:2918-2922 (1992). Homodimeric antibodies with enhanced anti-tumor activity may also be prepared using heterobifunctional cross-linkers as described in Wolff et al., 53:2560-2565(1993). Alternatively, an antibody can be engineered which has dual Fc regions and may thereby have enhanced complement lysis and ADCC capabilities. See Stevenson et al., -3:219-230 (1989). To increase the serum half life of the antibody, one may incorporate a salvage receptor binding epitope into the antibody (especially an antibody fragment) as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,739,277, for example. As used herein, the term \u201csalvage receptor binding epitope\u201d refers to an epitope of the Fc region of an IgG molecule (e.g., IgG, IgG, IgG, or IgG) that is responsible for increasing the in vivo serum half-life of the IgG molecule.","9. Immunoconjugates","The invention also pertains to immunoconjugates comprising an antibody conjugated to a cytotoxic agent such as a chemotherapeutic agent, a growth inhibitory agent, a toxin (e.g., an enzymatically active toxin of bacterial, fungal, plant, or animal origin, or fragments thereof), or a radioactive isotope (i.e., a radioconjugate).","Chemotherapeutic agents useful in the generation of such immunoconjugates have been described above. Enzymatically active toxins and fragments thereof that can be used include diphtheria A chain, nonbinding active fragments of diphtheria toxin, exotoxin A chain (from ), ricin A chain, abrin A chain, modeccin A chain, alpha-sarcin, proteins, dianthin proteins, proteins (PAPI, PAPII, and PAP-S), inhibitor, curcin, crotin, sapaonaria officinalis inhibitor, gelonin, mitogellin, restrictocin, phenomycin, enomycin, and the tricothecenes. A variety of radionuclides are available for the production of radioconjugated antibodies. Examples include Bi, I, In, Y, and Re. Conjugates of the antibody and cytotoxic agent are made using a variety of bifunctional protein-coupling agents such as N-succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithiol) propionate (SPDP), iminothiolane (IT), bifunctional derivatives of imidoesters (such as dimethyl adipimidate HCL), active esters (such as disuccinimidyl suberate), aldehydes (such as glutareldehyde), bis-azido compounds (such as his (p-azidobenzoyl) hexanediamine), bis-diazonium derivatives (such as bis-(p-diazoniumbenzoyl)-ethylenediamine), diisocyanates (such as tolyene 2,6-diisocyanate), and bis-active fluorine compounds (such as 1,5-difluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene). For example, a ricin immunotoxin can be prepared as described in Vitetta et al., 238: 1098 (1987). Carbon-14-labeled 1-isothiocyanatobenzyl-3-methyldiethylene triaminepentaacetic acid (MX-DTPA) is an exemplary chelating agent for conjugation of radionucleotide to the antibody. See WO94\/11026.","Conjugates of an antibody and one or more small molecule toxins, such as a calicheamicin, maytansinoids, a trichothene, and CC1065, and the derivatives of these toxins that have toxin activity, are also contemplated herein.","Maytansine and Maytansinoids","The invention provides an anti-PRO224, anti-PRO9783, anti-PRO1108, anti-PRO34000, anti-PRO240, anti-PRO943, anti-hu A33, anti-PRO230, anti-PRO178, anti-PRO1199, anti-PRO4333, anti-PRO1336, anti-PRO19598, anti-PRO1083, anti-hu TRPM2 or anti-PRO1801 antibody (full length or fragments) which is conjugated to one or more maytansinoid molecules.","Maytansinoids are mitototic inhibitors which act by inhibiting tubulin polymerization. Maytansine was first isolated from the east African shrub (U.S. Pat. No. 3,896,111). Subsequently, it was discovered that certain microbes also produce maytansinoids, such as maytansinol and C-3 maytansinol esters (U.S. Pat. No. 4,151,042). Synthetic maytansinol and derivatives and analogues thereof are disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,137,230; 4,248,870; 4,256,746; 4,260,608; 4,265,814; 4,294,757; 4,307,016; 4,308,268; 4,308,269; 4,309,428; 4,313,946; 4,315,929; 4,317,821; 4,322,348; 4,331,598; 4,361,650; 4,364,866; 4,424,219; 4,450,254; 4,362,663; and 4,371,533, the disclosures of which are hereby expressly incorporated by reference.","Maytansinoid-antibody Conjugates","In an attempt to improve their therapeutic index, maytansine and maytansinoids have been conjugated to antibodies specifically binding to tumor cell antigens. Immunoconjugates containing maytansinoids and their therapeutic use are disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,208,020, 5,416,064 and European Patent EP 0 425 235 B1, the disclosures of which are hereby expressly incorporated by reference. Liu et al., 93:8618-8623 (1996) described immunoconjugates comprising a maytansinoid designated DM1 linked to the monoclonal antibody C242 directed against human colorectal cancer. The conjugate was found to be highly cytotoxic towards cultured colon cancer cells, and showed antitumor activity in an in vivo tumor growth assay. Chari et al., 52:127-131 (1992) describe immunoconjugates in which a maytansinoid was conjugated via a disulfide linker to the murine antibody A7 binding to an antigen on human colon cancer cell lines, or to another murine monoclonal antibody TA.1 that binds the HER-2\/neu oncogene. The cytotoxicity of the TA.1-maytansonoid conjugate was tested in vitro on the human breast cancer cell line SK-BR-3, which expresses 3\u00d710HER-2 surface antigens per cell. The drug conjugate achieved a degree of cytotoxicity similar to the free maytansonid drug, which could be increased by increasing the number of maytansinoid molecules per antibody molecule. The A7-maytansinoid conjugate showed low systemic cytotoxicity in mice.","Anti-PRO224, Anti-PRO9783, Anti-PRO1108, Anti-PRO34000, Anti-PRO240, Anti-PRO943, Anti-hu A33, Anti-PRO230, Anti-PRO178, Anti-PRO1199, Anti-PRO4333, Anti-PRO1336, Anti-PRO19598, Anti-PRO1083, Anti-hu TRPM2 or Anti-PRO1801Antibody-Maytansinoid Conjugates (Immunoconjugates)","Anti-PRO224, anti-PRO9783, anti-PRO1108, anti-PRO34000, anti-PRO240, anti-PRO943, anti-hu A33, anti-PRO230, anti-PRO178, anti-PRO1199, anti-PRO4333, anti-PRO1336, anti-PRO19598, anti-PRO1083, anti-hu TRPM2 or anti-PRO1801 antibody-maytansinoid conjugates are prepared by chemically linking an anti-PRO224, anti-PRO9783, anti-PRO1108, anti-PRO34000, anti-PRO240, anti-PRO943, anti-hu A33, anti-PRO230, anti-PRO178, anti-PRO1199, anti-PRO4333, anti-PRO1336, anti-PRO19598, anti-PRO1083, anti-hu TRPM2 or anti-PRO1801 antibody to a maytansinoid molecule without significantly diminishing the biological activity of either the antibody or the maytansinoid molecule. An average of 3-4 maytansinoid molecules conjugated per antibody molecule has shown efficacy in enhancing cytotoxicity of target cells without negatively affecting the function or solubility of the antibody, although even one molecule of toxin\/antibody would be expected to enhance cytotoxicity over the use of naked antibody. Maytansinoids are well known in the art and can be synthesized by known techniques or isolated from natural sources. Suitable maytansinoids are disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,208,020 and in the other patents and nonpatent publications referred to hereinabove. Preferred maytansinoids are maytansinol and maytansinol analogues modified in the aromatic ring or at other positions of the maytansinol molecule, such as various maytansinol esters.","There are many linking groups known in the art for making antibody-maytansinoid conjugates, including, for example, those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,208,020 or EP Patent 0 425 235 B1, and Chari et al., 52:127-131 (1992). The linking groups include disulfide groups, thioether groups, acid labile groups, photolabile groups, peptidase labile groups, or esterase labile groups, as disclosed in the above-identified patents, disulfide and thioether groups being preferred.","Conjugates of the antibody and maytansinoid may be made using a variety of bifunctional protein coupling agents such as N-succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithio) propionate (SPDP), succinimidyl-4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate, iminothiolane (IT), bifunctional derivatives of imidoesters (such as dimethyl adipimidate HCL), active esters (such as disuccinimidyl suberate), aldehydes (such as glutareldehyde), bis-azido compounds (such as bis(p-azidobenzoyl) hexanediamine), bis-diazonium derivatives (such as bis-(p-diazoniumbenzoyl)-ethylenediamine), diisocyanatesc (such as toluene 2,6-diisocyanate), and bis-active fluorine compounds (such as 1,5-difluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene). Particularly preferred coupling agents include N-succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithio) propionate (SPDP) (Carlsson et al., 173:723-737 [1978]) and N-succinimidyl-4-(2-pyridylthio)pentanoate (SPP) to provide for a disulfide linkage.","The linker may be attached to the maytansinoid molecule at various positions, depending on the type of the link. For example, an ester linkage may be formed by reaction with a hydroxyl group using conventional coupling techniques. The reaction may occur at the C-3 position having a hydroxyl group, the C-14 position modified with hydroxymethyl, the C-15 position modified with a hydroxyl group, and the C-20 position having a hydroxyl group. The linkage is formed at the C-3 position of maytansinol or a maytansinol analogue.","Calicheamicin","Another immunoconjugate of interest comprises an anti-PRO224, anti-PRO9783, anti-PRO1108, anti-PRO34000, anti-PRO240, anti-PRO943, anti-hu A33, anti-PRO230, anti-PRO178, anti-PRO1199, anti-PRO4333, anti-PRO1336, anti-PRO19598, anti-PRO1083, anti-hu TRPM2 or anti-PRO1801 antibody conjugated to one or more calicheamicin molecules. The calicheamicin family of antibiotics are capable of producing double-stranded DNA breaks at sub-picomolar concentrations. For the preparation of conjugates of the calicheamicin family, see U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,712,374, 5,714,586, 5,739,116, 5,767,285, 5,770,701, 5,770,710, 5,773,001, 5,877,296 (all to American Cyanamid Company). Structural analogues of calicheamicin which may be used include, but are not limited to, \u03b3, \u03b1, \u03b1, N-acetyl-\u03b3, PSAG and \u03b8(Hinman et al., 53:3336-3342 (1993), Lode et al., 58:2925-2928 (1998) and the aforementioned U.S. patents to American Cyanamid). Another anti-tumor drug that the antibody can be conjugated is QFA which is an antifolate. Both calicheamicin and QFA have intracellular sites of action and do not readily cross the plasma membrane. Therefore, cellular uptake of these agents through antibody mediated internalization greatly enhances their cytotoxic effects.","Other Cytotoxic Agents","Other antitumor agents that can be conjugated to the anti-PRO224, anti-PRO9783, anti-PRO1108, anti-PRO34000, anti-PRO240, anti-PRO943, anti-hu A33, anti-PRO230, anti-PRO178, anti-PRO1199, anti-PRO4333, anti-PRO1336, anti-PRO19598, anti-PRO1083, anti-hu TRPM2 or anti-PRO1801 antibodies of the invention include BCNU, streptozoicin, vincristine and 5-fluorouracil, the family of agents known collectively LL-E33288 complex described in U.S. Pat.

A variety of radioactive isotopes are available for the production of radioconjugated anti-PRO224, anti-PRO9783, anti-PRO1108, anti-PRO34000, anti-PRO240, anti-PRO943, anti-hu A33, anti-PRO230, anti-PRO178, anti-PRO199, anti-PRO4333, anti-PRO1336, anti-PRO19598, anti-PRO1083, anti-hu TRPM2 or anti-PRO1801 antibodies. Examples include At, I, I, Y, Re, Re, Sm, Bi, P, Pband radioactive isotopes of Lu. When the conjugate is used for diagnosis, it may comprise a radioactive atom for scintigraphic studies, for example tcor I, or a spin label for nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging (also known as magnetic resonance imaging, mri), such as iodine-123 again, iodine-131, indium-111, fluorine-19, carbon-13, nitrogen-15, oxygen-17, gadolinium, manganese or iron.","The radio- or other labels may be incorporated in the conjugate in known ways. For example, the peptide may be biosynthesized or may be synthesized by chemical amino acid synthesis using suitable amino acid precursors involving, for example, fluorine-19 in place of hydrogen. Labels such as tcor I, Re, Reand Incan be attached via a cysteine residue in the peptide. Yttrium-90 can be attached via a lysine residue. The IODOGEN method (Fraker et al (1978) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 80: 49-57 can be used to incorporate iodine-123. \u201cMonoclonal Antibodies in Immunoscintigraphy\u201d (Chatal, CRC Press 1989) describes other methods in detail.","Conjugates of the antibody and cytotoxic agent may be made using a variety of bifunctional protein coupling agents such as N-succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithio)propionate (SPDP), succinimidyl-4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate, iminothiolane (IT), bifunctional derivatives of imidoesters (such as dimethyl adipimidate HCL), active esters (such as disuccinimidyl suberate), aldehydes (such as glutareldehyde), bis-azido compounds (such as bis(p-azidobenzoyl)hexanediamine), bis-diazonium derivatives (such as bis-(p-diazoniumbenzoyl)-ethylenediamine), diisocyanates (such as tolyene 2,6-diisocyanate), and bis-active fluorine compounds (such as 1,5-difluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene). For example, a ricin immunotoxin can be prepared as described in Vitetta et al., 238:1098 (1987). Carbon-14-labeled 1-isothiocyanatobenzyl-3-methyldiethylene triaminepentaacetic acid (MX-DTPA) is an exemplary chelating agent for conjugation of radionucleotide to the antibody. See WO94\/11026. The linker may be a \u201ccleavable linker\u201d facilitating release of the cytotoxic drug in the cell. For example, an acid-labile linker, peptidase-sensitive linker, photolabile linker, dimethyl linker or disulfide-containing linker (Chari et al., 52:127-131 (1992); U.S. Pat. No. 5,208,020) may be used.","Alternatively, a fusion protein comprising the anti-PRO224, anti-PRO9783, anti-PRO1108, anti-PRO34000, anti-PRO240, anti-PRO943, anti-hu A33, anti-PRO230, anti-PRO178, anti-PRO1199, anti-PRO4333, anti-PRO1336, anti-PRO19598, anti-PRO1083, anti-hu TRPM2 or anti-PRO1801 antibody and cytotoxic agent may be made, e.g., by recombinant techniques or peptide synthesis. The length of DNA may comprise respective regions encoding the two portions of the conjugate either adjacent one another or separated by a region encoding a linker peptide which does not destroy the desired properties of the conjugate.","The invention provides that the antibody may be conjugated to a \u201creceptor\u201d (such streptavidin) for utilization in tumor pre-targeting wherein the antibody-receptor conjugate is administered to the patient, followed by removal of unbound conjugate from the circulation using a clearing agent and then administration of a \u201cligand\u201d (e.g., avidin) which is conjugated to a cytotoxic agent (e.g., a radionucleotide).","10.

A \u201cliposome\u201d is a small vesicle composed of various types of lipids, phospholipids and\/or surfactant which is useful for delivery of a drug to a mammal. The components of the liposome are commonly arranged in a bilayer formation, similar to the lipid arrangement of biological membranes. Liposomes containing the antibody are prepared by methods known in the art, such as described in Epstein et al., 82:3688 (1985); Hwang et al., 77:4030 (1980); U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,485,045 and 4,544,545; and WO97\/38731 published Oct. 23, 1997. Liposomes with enhanced circulation time are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,013,556.","Particularly useful liposomes can be generated by the reverse phase evaporation method with a lipid composition comprising phosphatidylcholine, cholesterol and PEG-derivatized phosphatidylethanolamine (PEG-PE). Liposomes are extruded through filters of defined pore size to yield liposomes with the desired diameter. Fab\u2032 fragments of the antibody of the present invention can be conjugated to the liposomes as described in Martin et al., 257:286-288 (1982) via a disulfide interchange reaction.

However, lipofections or liposomes can also be used to deliver the antibody, or an antibody fragment, into cells. Where antibody fragments are used, the smallest inhibitory fragment that specifically binds to the binding domain of the target protein is preferred. For example, based upon the variable-region sequences of an antibody, peptide molecules can be designed that retain the ability to bind the target protein sequence. Such peptides can be synthesized chemically and\/or produced by recombinant DNA technology. See, e.g., Marasco et al., 90: 7889-7893 (1993). The formulation herein may also contain more than one active compound as necessary for the particular indication being treated, preferably those with complementary activities that do not adversely affect each other. Alternatively, or in addition, the composition may comprise an agent that enhances its function, such as, for example, a cytotoxic agent, cytokine, chemotherapeutic agent, or growth-inhibitory agent. Such molecules are suitably present in combination in amounts that are effective for the purpose intended.","The active ingredients may also be entrapped in microcapsules prepared, for example, by coacervation techniques or by interfacial polymerization, for example, hydroxymethylcellulose or gelatin-microcapsules and poly-(methylmethacylate) microcapsules, respectively, in colloidal drug delivery systems (for example, liposomes, albumin microspheres, microemulsions, nano-particles, and nanocapsules) or in macroemulsions. Such techniques are disclosed in ","The formulations to be used for in vivo administration must be sterile. This is readily accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration membranes.","Sustained-release preparations may be prepared. Suitable examples of sustained-release preparations include semipermeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing the antibody, which matrices are in the form of shaped articles, e.g., films, or microcapsules. Examples of sustained-release matrices include polyesters, hydrogels (for example, poly(2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate), or poly(vinylalcohol)), polylactides (U.S. Pat. No. 3,773,919), copolymers of L-glutamic acid and \u03b3 ethyl-L-glutamate, non-degradable ethylene-vinyl acetate, degradable lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymers such as the LUPRON DEPOT T\u2122 (injectable microspheres composed of lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymer and leuprolide acetate), and poly-D-(\u2212)-3-hydroxybutyric acid. While polymers such as ethylene-vinyl acetate and lactic acid-glycolic acid enable release of molecules for over 100 days, certain hydrogels release proteins for shorter time periods. When encapsulated antibodies remain in the body for a long time, they may denature or aggregate as a result of exposure to moisture at 37\u00b0 C., resulting in a loss of biological activity and possible changes in immunogenicity. Rational strategies can be devised for stabilization depending on the mechanism involved. For example, if the aggregation mechanism is discovered to be intermolecular S\u2014S bond formation through thio-disulfide interchange, stabilization may be achieved by modifying sulfhydryl residues, lyophilizing from acidic solutions, controlling moisture content, using appropriate additives, and developing specific polymer matrix compositions.","G.

Various diagnostic assay techniques known in the art may be used, such as competitive binding assays, direct or indirect sandwich assays and immunoprecipitation assays conducted in either heterogeneous or homogeneous phases [Zola, , CRC Press, Inc. (1987) pp. 147-158]. The antibodies used in the diagnostic assays can be labeled with a detectable moiety. The detectable moiety should be capable of producing, either directly or indirectly, a detectable signal. For example, the detectable moiety may be a radioisotope, such as H, C, P, S, or I, a fluorescent or chemiluminescent compound, such as fluorescein isothiocyanate, rhodamine, or luciferin, or an enzyme, such as alkaline phosphatase, beta-galactosidase or horseradish peroxidase. Any method known in the art for conjugating the antibody to the detectable moiety may be employed, including those methods described by Hunter et al., 144:945 (1962); David et al., 13:1014 (1974); Pain et al., 40:219 (1981); and Nygren, 30:407 (1982).","Anti-PRO224, anti-PRO9783, anti-PRO1108, anti-PRO34000, anti-PRO240, anti-PRO943, anti-hu A33, anti-PRO230, anti-PRO178, anti-PRO1199, anti-PRO4333, anti-PRO1336, anti-PRO19598, anti-PRO1083, anti-hu TRPM2 or anti-PRO1801 antibodies also are useful for the affinity purification of PRO224, PRO9783, PRO1108, PRO34000, PRO240, PRO943, hu A33, PRO230, PRO178, PRO1199, PRO4333, PRO1336, PRO19598, PRO1083, hu TRPM2 or PRO1801 polypeptides from recombinant cell culture or natural sources.

The source of those cells identified in the following examples, and throughout the specification, by ATCC accession numbers is the American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, Va.","The extracellular domain (ECD) sequences (including the secretion signal sequence, if any) from about 950 known secreted proteins from the Swiss-Prot public database were used to search EST databases. The EST databases included public databases (e.g., Dayhoff, GenBank), and proprietary databases (e.g. LIFESEQ\u2122, Incyte Pharmaceuticals, Palo Alto, Calif.). The search was performed using the computer program BLAST or BLAST-2 (Altschul et al., 266:460-480 (1996)) as a comparison of the ECD protein sequences to a 6 frame translation of the EST sequences. Those comparisons with a BLAST score of 70 (or in some cases 90) or greater that did not encode known proteins were clustered and assembled into consensus DNA sequences with the program \u201cphrap\u201d (Phil Green, University of Washington, Seattle, Wash.).","Using this extracellular domain homology screen, consensus DNA sequences were assembled relative to the other identified EST sequences using phrap. In addition, the consensus DNA sequences obtained were often (but not always) extended using repeated cycles of BLAST or BLAST-2 and phrap to extend the consensus sequence as far as possible using the sources of EST sequences discussed above.","Based upon the consensus sequences obtained as described above, oligonucleotides were then synthesized and used to identify by PCR a cDNA library that contained the sequence of interest and for use as probes to isolate a clone of the full-length coding sequence for a PRO polypeptide. Forward and reverse PCR primers generally range from 20 to 30 nucleotides and are often designed to give a PCR product of about 100-1000 bp in length. The probe sequences are typically 40-55 bp in length. In some cases, additional oligonucleotides are synthesized when the consensus sequence is greater than about 1-1.5 kbp. In order to screen several libraries for a full-length clone, DNA from the libraries was screened by PCR amplification, as per Ausubel et al., , with the PCR primer pair. A positive library was then used to isolate clones encoding the gene of interest using the probe oligonucleotide and one of the primer pairs.","The cDNA libraries used to isolate the cDNA clones were constructed by standard methods using commercially available reagents such as those from Invitrogen, San Diego, Calif. The cDNA was primed with oligo dT containing a NotI site, linked with blunt to SalI hemikinased adaptors, cleaved with NotI, sized appropriately by gel electrophoresis, and cloned in a defined orientation into a suitable cloning vector (such as pRKB or pRKD; pRK5B is a precursor of pRK5D that does not contain the SfiI site; see, Holmes et al., 253:1278-1280 (1991)) in the unique XhoI and NotI sites.","1. Preparation of Oligo dT Primed cDNA Library","mRNA was isolated from a human tissue of interest using reagents and protocols from Invitrogen, San Diego, Calif. (Fast Track 2). This RNA was used to generate an oligo dT primed cDNA library in the vector pRK5D using reagents and protocols from Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, Md. (Super Script Plasmid System). In this procedure, the double stranded cDNA was sized to greater than 1000 bp and the SalI\/NotI linkered cDNA was cloned into XhoI\/NotI cleaved vector. pRK5D is a cloning vector that has an sp6 transcription initiation site followed by an SfiI restriction enzyme site preceding the XhoI\/NotI cDNA cloning sites.","2. Preparation of Random Primed cDNA Library","A secondary cDNA library was generated in order to preferentially represent the 5\u2032 ends of the primary cDNA clones. Sp6 RNA was generated from the primary library (described above), and this RNA was used to generate a random primed cDNA library in the vector pSST-AMY.0 using reagents and protocols from Life Technologies (Super Script Plasmid System, referenced above). In this procedure the double stranded cDNA was sized to 500-1000 bp, linkered with blunt to NotI adaptors, cleaved with SfiI, and cloned into SfiI\/NotI cleaved vector. pSST-AMY.0 is a cloning vector that has a yeast alcohol dehydrogenase promoter preceding the cDNA cloning sites and the mouse amylase sequence (the mature sequence without the secretion signal) followed by the yeast alcohol dehydrogenase terminator, after the cloning sites. Thus, cDNAs cloned into this vector that are fused in frame with amylase sequence will lead to the secretion of amylase from appropriately transfected yeast colonies.","3. Transformation and Detection","DNA from the library described in paragraph 2 above was chilled on ice to which was added electrocompetent DH10B bacteria (Life Technologies, 20 ml). The bacteria and vector mixture was then electroporated as recommended by the manufacturer. Subsequently, SOC media (Life Technologies, 1 ml) was added and the mixture was incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for 30 minutes. The transformants were then plated onto 20 standard 150 mm LB plates containing ampicillin and incubated for 16 hours (37\u00b0 C.). Positive colonies were scraped off the plates and the DNA was isolated from the bacterial pellet using standard protocols, e.g. CsCl-gradient. The purified DNA was then carried on to the yeast protocols below.","The yeast methods were divided into three categories: (1) Transformation of yeast with the plasmid\/cDNA combined vector; (2) Detection and isolation of yeast clones secreting amylase; and (3) PCR amplification of the insert directly from the yeast colony and purification of the DNA for sequencing and further analysis.","The yeast strain used was HD56-5A (ATCC-90785). This strain has the following genotype: MAT alpha, ura3-52, leu2-3, leu2-112, his3-11, his3-15, MAL, SUC, GAL. Preferably, yeast mutants can be employed that have deficient post-translational pathways. Such mutants may have translocation deficient alleles in sec71, sec72, sec62, with truncated sec71 being most preferred. Alternatively, antagonists (including antisense nucleotides and\/or ligands) which interfere with the normal operation of these genes, other proteins implicated in this post translation pathway (e.g., SEC61p, SEC72p, SEC62p, SEC63p, TDJ1p or SSA1p-4p) or the complex formation of these proteins may also be preferably employed in combination with the amylase-expressing yeast.","Transformation was performed based on the protocol outlined by Gietz et al., 20:1425 (1992). Transformed cells were then inoculated from agar into YEPD complex media broth (100 ml) and grown overnight at 30\u00b0 C. The YEPD broth was prepared as described in Kaiser et al., , Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., p. 207 (1994). The overnight culture was then diluted to about 2\u00d710cells\/ml (approx. OD=0.1) into fresh YEPD broth (500 ml) and regrown to 1\u00d710cells\/ml (approx. OD=0.4-0.5).","The cells were then harvested and prepared for transformation by transfer into GS3 rotor bottles in a Sorval GS3 rotor at 5,000 rpm for 5 minutes, the supernatant discarded, and then resuspended into sterile water, and centrifuged again in 50 ml falcon tubes at 3,500 rpm in a Beckman GS-6KR centrifuge. The supernatant was discarded and the cells were subsequently washed with LiAc\/TE (10 ml, 10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA pH 7.5, 100 mM LiOOCCH), and resuspended into LiAc\/TE (2.5 ml).","Transformation took place by mixing the prepared cells (100 \u03bcl) with freshly denatured single stranded salmon testes DNA (Lofstrand Labs, Gaithersburg, Md.) and transforming DNA (1 \u03bcg, vol.<10 \u03bcl) in microfuge tubes. The mixture was mixed briefly by vortexing, then 40% PEG\/TE (600 \u03bcl, 40% polyethylene glycol-4000, 10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, 100 mM LiOOCCH, pH 7.5) was added. This mixture was gently mixed and incubated at 30\u00b0 C. while agitating for 30 minutes. The cells were then heat shocked at 42\u00b0 C. for 15 minutes, and the reaction vessel centrifuged in a microfuge at 12,000 rpm for 5-10 seconds, decanted and resuspended into TE (500 \u03bcl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA pH 7.5) followed by recentrifugation. The cells were then diluted into TE (1 ml) and aliquots (200 \u03bcl) were spread onto the selective media previously prepared in 150 mm growth plates (VWR).","Alternatively, instead of multiple small reactions, the transformation was performed using a single, large scale reaction, wherein reagent amounts were scaled up accordingly.","The selective media used was a synthetic complete dextrose agar lacking uracil (SCD-Ura) prepared as described in Kaiser et al, , Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., p. 208-210 (1994). Transformants were grown at 30\u00b0 C. for 2-3 days.","The detection of colonies secreting amylase was performed by including red starch in the selective growth media. Starch was coupled to the red dye (Reactive Red-120, Sigma) as per the procedure described by Biely et al., 172:176-179 (1988). The coupled starch was incorporated into the SCD-Ura agar plates at a final concentration of 0.15% (w\/v), and was buffered with potassium phosphate to a pH of 7.0 (50-100 mM final concentration).","The positive colonies were picked and streaked across fresh selective media (onto 150 mm plates) in order to obtain well isolated and identifiable single colonies. Well isolated single colonies positive for amylase secretion were detected by direct incorporation of red starch into buffered SCD-Ura agar. Positive colonies were determined by their ability to break down starch resulting in a clear halo around the positive colony visualized directly.","4. Isolation of DNA by PCR Amplification","When a positive colony was isolated, a portion of it was picked by a toothpick and diluted into sterile water (30 \u03bcl) in a 96 well plate. At this time, the positive colonies were either frozen and stored for subsequent analysis or immediately amplified. An aliquot of cells (5 \u03bcl) was used as a template for the PCR reaction in a 25 \u03bcl volume containing: 0.5 \u03bcl Klentaq (Clontech, Palo Alto, Calif.); 4.0 \u03bcl 10 mM dNTP's (Perkin Elmer-Cetus); 2.5 \u03bcl Kentaq buffer (Clontech); 0.25 \u03bcl forward oligo 1; 0.25 \u03bcl reverse oligo 2; 12.5 \u03bcl distilled water.

Typically, the first 18 nucleotides of the 5\u2032 end of these oligonucleotides contained annealing sites for the sequencing primers. Thus, the total product of the PCR reaction from an empty vector was 343 bp. However, signal sequence-fused cDNA resulted in considerably longer nucleotide sequences.","Following the PCR, an aliquot of the reaction (5 \u03bcl) was examined by agarose gel electrophoresis in a 1% agarose gel using a Tris-Borate-EDTA (TBE) buffering system as described by Sambrook et al., supra. Clones resulting in a single strong PCR product larger than 400 bp were further analyzed by DNA sequencing after purification with a 96 Qiaquick PCR clean-up column (Qiagen Inc., Chatsworth, Calif.).","Various polypeptide-encoding nucleic acid sequences were identified by applying a proprietary signal sequence finding algorithm developed by Genentech, Inc. (South San Francisco, Calif.) upon ESTs as well as clustered and assembled EST fragments from public (e.g., GenBank) and\/or private (LIFESEQ\u00ae, Incyte Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Palo Alto, Calif.) databases. The signal sequence algorithm computes a secretion signal score based on the character of the DNA nucleotides surrounding the first and optionally the second methionine codon(s) (ATG) at the 5\u2032-end of the sequence or sequence fragment under consideration. The nucleotides following the first ATG must code for at least 35 unambiguous amino acids without any stop codons. If the first ATG has the required amino acids, the second is not examined. If neither meets the requirement, the candidate sequence is not scored. In order to determine whether the EST sequence contains an authentic signal sequence, the DNA and corresponding amino acid sequences surrounding the ATG codon are scored using a set of seven sensors (evaluation parameters) known to be associated with secretion signals. Use of this algorithm resulted in the identification of numerous polypeptide-encoding nucleic acid sequences.","Using the techniques described in Examples 1 to 3 above, numerous full-length cDNA clones were identified as encoding PRO224, PRO9783, PRO1108, PRO34000, PRO240, PRO943, PRO230, PRO178, PRO1199, PRO4333, PRO1336, PRO19598, PRO1083 or PRO1801 polypeptides as disclosed herein.

An abnormal A\/V ratio signals such systemic diseases or disorders that may be related to the vascular disease of hypertension (and any disease that causes hypertension, e.g. atherosclerosis), diabetes or other ocular diseases corresponding to opthalmological disorders. Such eye abnormalities may include but are not limited to the following: retinal abnormality is retinal dysplasia, various retinopathies, restenosis, retinal artery obstruction or occlusion; retinal degeneration causing secondary atrophy of the retinal vasculature, retinitis pigmentosa, macular dystrophies, Stargardt's disease, congenital stationary night blindness, choroideremia, gyrate atrophy, Leber's congenital amaurosis, retinoschisis disorders, Wagner's syndrome, Usher syndromes, Zellweger syndrome, Saldino-Mainzer syndrome, Senior-Loken syndrome, Bardet-Biedl syndrome, Alport's syndrome, Alstom's syndrome, Cockayne's syndrome, dysplaisa spondyloepiphysaria congentia, Flynn-Aird syndrome, Friedreich ataxia, Hallgren syndrome, Marshall syndrome, Albers-Schnoberg disease, Refsum's disease, Kearns-Sayre syndrome, Waardenburg's syndrome, Alagile syndrome, myotonic dystrophy, olivopontocerebellar atrophy, Pierre-Marie dunsdrome, Stickler syndrome, carotinemeia, cystinosis, Wolfram syndrome, Bassen-Kornzweig syndrome, abetalipoproteinemia, incontinentia pigmenti, Batten's disease, mucopolysaccharidoses, homocystinuria, or mannosidosis.","Procedure: A cohort of 4 wild type, 4 heterozygotes and 8 homozygotes were tested in this assay. Optic fundus photography was performed on conscious animals using a Kowa Genesis small animal fundus camera modified according to Hawes and coauthors (Hawes et al., 1999 Molecular Vision 1999; 5:22). Intra-peritoneal injection of fluorescein permitted the acquisition of direct light fundus images and fluorescent angiograms for each examination. In addition to direct opthalmological changes, this test can detect retinal changes associated with systemic diseases such as diabetes and atherosclerosis or other retinal abnormalities. Pictures were provided of the optic fundus under normal light. The angiographic pictures allowed examination of the arteries and veins of the eye. In addition an artery to vein (A\/V) ratio was determined for the eye.","Opthalmology analysis was performed on generated F2 wild type, heterozygous, and homozygous mutant progeny using the protocol described above. Specifically, the A\/V ratio was measured and calculated according to the fundus images with Kowa COMIT+ software. This test takes color photographs through a dilated pupil: the images help in detecting and classifying many diseases. The artery to vein ratio (A\/V) is the ratio of the artery diameter to the vein diameter (measured before the bifurcation of the vessels). Many diseases will influence the ratio, i.e., diabetes, cardiovascular disorders, papilledema, optic atrophy or other eye abnormalities such as retinal degeneration (known as retinitis pigmentosa) or retinal dysplasia, vision problems or blindness. Thus, phenotypic observations which result in an increased artery-to-vein ratio in homozygous (\u2212\/\u2212) and heterozygous (+\/\u2212) mutant progeny compared to wildtype (+\/+) littermates would be indicative of such pathological conditions.","Results: In this study, the (\u2212\/\u2212) and (+\/\u2212) mice exhibited an increased mean artery-to-vein (A\/V) ratio when compared with their (+\/+) littermates indicating retinal degeneration. In summary, by knocking out the gene identified as DNA33221-1133 encoding PRO224 polypeptides, both heterozygous and homozygous mutant progeny exhibit phenotypes which are associated with retinal degeneration. Such detected retinal changes are most commonly associated with cardiovascular systemic diseases or disorders that may be related to the vascular disease of hypertension (and any disease that causes hypertension, e.g. atherosclerosis), diabetes or other ocular diseases corresponding to opthalmological disorders such as retinal degeneration. Thus, antagonists of PRO224 encoding genes would lead to similar pathological retinal changes, whereas agonists would be useful as therapeutic agents in the treatment of hypertension, atherosclerosis or other opthamological disorders including retinal degeneration and diseases associated with this condition (as indicated above).","B.

The putative proteins are members of the SCP-like (Pfam PF00188) and LCCP (Pfam PF03815) families of extracellular domain containing proteins. While the individual members of these families have diverse physiological functions, proteins containing LCCP domains are suspected to be involved in protein folding.","The mouse protein has the greatest similarity to mouse cocoacrisp (cysteine-rich secretory protein or CRISP) and trypsin inhibitors, which also contain LCCL and SCP-like extracellular domains.

Animals were injected IP at 2 g\/kg with D-glucose delivered as a 20% solution and blood glucose levels were measured at 0, 30, 60 and 90 minutes after injection.","Results: These studies indicated that male (\u2212\/\u2212) mice exhibit enhanced glucose tolerance in the presence of normal fasting glucose at all 3 intervals tested when compared with their gender-matched (+\/+) littermates and the historical means. In addition, hyperinsulinemia was not apparent in the (\u2212\/\u2212) mice. Thus, knockout mice exhibited the opposite phenotypic pattern of an impaired glucose homeostasis, and as such antagonists to PRO9783 polypeptides or its encoding gene would be useful in the treatment of impaired glucose homeostasis and\/or various cardiovascular diseases such as diabetes.","(c) Immunology Phenotypic Analysis","Immune related and inflammatory diseases are the manifestation or consequence of fairly complex, often multiple interconnected biological pathways which in normal physiology are critical to respond to insult or injury, initiate repair from insult or injury, and mount innate and acquired defense against foreign organisms. Disease or pathology occurs when these normal physiological pathways cause additional insult or injury either as directly related to the intensity of the response, as a consequence of abnormal regulation or excessive stimulation, as a reaction to self, or as a combination of these.","Though the genesis of these diseases often involves multistep pathways and often multiple different biological systems\/pathways, intervention at critical points in one or more of these pathways can have an ameliorative or therapeutic effect. Therapeutic intervention can occur by either antagonism of a detrimental process\/pathway or stimulation of a beneficial process\/pathway.","T lymphocytes (T cells) are an important component of a mammalian immune response. T cells recognize antigens which are associated with a self-molecule encoded by genes within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). The antigen may be displayed together with MHC molecules on the surface of antigen presenting cells, virus infected cells, cancer cells, grafts, etc. The T cell system eliminates these altered cells which pose a health threat to the host mammal. T cells include helper T cells and cytotoxic T cells. Helper T cells proliferate extensively following recognition of an antigen-MHC complex on an antigen presenting cell. Helper T cells also secrete a variety of cytokines, i.e., lymphokines, which play a central role in the activation of B cells, cytotoxic T cells and a variety of other cells which participate in the immune response.","In many immune responses, inflammatory cells infiltrate the site of injury or infection. The migrating cells may be neutrophilic, eosinophilic, monocytic or lymphocytic as can be determined by histologic examination of the affected tissues. Current Protocols in Immunology, ed. John E. Coligan, 1994, John Wiley & Sons, Inc.","Many immune related diseases are known and have been extensively studied. Such diseases include immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (such as rheumatoid arthritis, immune mediated renal disease, hepatobiliary diseases, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), psoriasis, and asthma), non-immune-mediated inflammatory diseases, infectious diseases, immunodeficiency diseases, neoplasia, and graft rejection, etc. In the area of immunology, targets were identified for the treatment of inflammation and inflammatory disorders.","In the area of immunology, targets have been identified herein for the treatment of inflammation and inflammatory disorders. Immune related diseases, in one instance, could be treated by suppressing the immune response. Using neutralizing antibodies that inhibit molecules having immune stimulatory activity would be beneficial in the treatment of immune-mediated and inflammatory diseases. Molecules which inhibit the immune response can be utilized (proteins directly or via the use of antibody agonists) to inhibit the immune response and thus ameliorate immune related disease.","The Following Tests were Performed:","Flourescence-activated Cell-sorting (FACS) Analysis","Procedure: FACS analysis of immune cell composition from peripheral blood was performed including analysis of CD4, CD8 and T cell receptors to evaluate T lymphocytes, CD19 for B lymphocytes, CD45 as a leukocyte marker and pan NK for natural killer cells. The FACS analysis was carried out on 2 wild type and 6 homozygous mice and included cells derived from thymus, spleen, bone marrow and lymph node.","In these studies, analyzed cells were isolated from thymus, peripheral blood, spleen, bone marrow and lymph nodes. Flow cytometry was designed to determine the relative proportions of CD4 and CD8 positive T cells, B cells, NK cells and monocytes in the mononuclear cell population. A Becton-Dickinson FACSCalibur 3-laser FACS machine was used to assess immune status. For Phenotypic Assays and Screening, this machine records CD4+\/CD8\u2212, CD8+\/CD4\u2212, NK, B cell and monocyte numbers in addition to the CD4+\/CD8+ ratio.","The mononuclear cell profile was derived by staining a single sample of lysed peripheral blood from each mouse with a panel of six lineage-specific antibodies: CD45 PerCP, anti-TCRb APC, CD4 PE, CD8 FITC, pan-NK PE, and CD19 FITC. The two FITC and PE labeled antibodies stain mutually exclusive cell types. The samples were analyzed using a Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur flow cytometer with CellQuest software.","Results: FACS analysis gave the following results: The male (\u2212\/\u2212) mice exhibited a decreased mean percentage of B cells when compared with their (+\/+) littermates and the historical mean.","Ovalbumin Challenge","Procedure: This assay was carried out on 6 wild types and 14 homozygotes. Chicken ovalbumin (OVA) is a T-cell dependent antigen, which is commonly used as a model protein for studying antigen-specific immune responses in mice. OVA is non-toxic and inert and therefore will not cause harm to the animals even if no immune response is induced. The murine immune response to OVA has been well characterized, to the extent that the immunodominant peptides for eliciting T cell responses have been identified. Anti-OVA antibodies are detectable 8 to 10 days after immunization using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELIZA), and determination of different isotypes of antibodies gives further information on the complex processes that may lead to a deficient response in genetically engineered mice.","As noted above, this protocol assesses the ability of mice to raise an antigen-specific immune response. Animals were injected IP with 50 mg of chicken ovalbumin emulsified in Complete Feund's Adjuvant and 14 days later the serum titer of anti-ovalbumin antibodies (IgM, IgG1 and IgG2 subclasses) was measured. The amount of OVA-specific antibody in the serum sample is proportional to the Optical Density (OD) value generated by an instrument that scans a 96-well sample plate. Data was collected for a set of serial dilutions of each serum sample. [Analyzed wt\/het\/hom: 6\/4\/14]","Results of this challenge: The male (\u2212\/\u2212) mice exhibited a decreased mean serum IgG2a response to the ovalbumin challenge when compared with their (+\/+) littermates. Thus, these knockout mice exhibited a decreased ability to elicit an OVA-specific antibody response to the T-cell dependent OVA antigen.","In summary, both FACS analysis of immune cell composition from peripheral blood and the ovalbumin challenge studies indicate that knockout mice deficient in the gene encoding PRO9783 polypeptides exhibit immunological abnormalities when compared with their wild-type littermates. In one instance, the mutant mice exhibited a decreased ability to elicit an immunological response when challenged with the T-cell dependent OVA antigen. This coupled with the immune cell composition analysis of peripheral blood, suggests that PRO9783 polypeptides or their agonists would be useful for stimulating the immune system (such as T cell proliferation) and would find utility in the cases wherein this effect would be beneficial to the individual such as in the case of leukemia, and other types of cancer, and in immunocompromised patients, such as AIDS sufferers. Accordingly, inhibitors (antagonists) of PRO9783 polypeptides would be useful in inhibiting the immune response and would be useful candidates for suppressing harmful immune responses, e.g. in the case of graft rejection or graft-versus-host diseases.","(d) Oncology Phenotypic Analysis","In the area of oncology, targets were identified herein for the treatment of solid tumors, lymphomas and leukemia.","Adult Skin Cell Proliferation:","Procedure: Skin cells were isolated from 16 week old animals (2 wild type and 4 homozygotes). These were developed into primary fibroblast cultures and the fibroblast proliferation rates were measured in a strictly controlled protocol. The ability of this assay to detect hyper-proliferative and hypo-proliferative phenotypes has been demonstrated with p53 and Ku80. Proliferation was measured using Brdu incorporation.","Specifically, in these studies the skin fibroblast proliferation assay was used. An increase in the number of cells in a standardized culture was used as a measure of relative proliferative capacity. Primary fibroblasts were established from skin biopsies taken from wild type and mutant mice. Duplicate or triplicate cultures of 0.05 million cells were plated and allowed to grow for six days. At the end of the culture period, the number of cells present in the culture was determined using a electronic particle counter.","Results: The female (\u2212\/\u2212) mice exhibited a decreased skin fibroblast proliferation rate when compared with their gender-matched (+\/+) littermates and the historical mean. [Analyzed wt\/het\/hom: 2\/0\/4]","Thus, homozygous mutant mice demonstrated a hypo-proliferative phenotype. As suggested by these observations, antagonists of a PRO9783 polypeptide or its encoding gene would be useful in decreasing abnormal cell proliferation.","(e) Bone Metabolism: Radiology Phenotypic Analysis","In the area of bone metabolism, targets were identified herein for the treatment of arthritis, osteoporosis, osteopenia and osteopetrosis as well as identifying targets that promote bone healing. Tests included:","DEXA for measurement of bone mineral density on femur and vertebra","MicroCT for very high resolution and very high sensitivity measurements of bone mineral density for both trabecular and cortical bone.","Dexa Analysis\u2014Test Description:","Procedure: A cohort of 4 wild type, 4 heterozygotes and 8 homozygotes were tested in this assay. Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) has been used successfully to identify changes in bone. Anesthetized animals were examined and bone mineral content (BMC), BMC\/LBM ratios, volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD), total body BMD, femur BMD and vertebra BMD were measured.","The mouse was anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of Avertin (1.25% 2,2,2,-tribromoethanol, 20 ml\/kg body weight), body length and weight were measured, and then the mouse was placed in a prone position on the platform of the PIXImus\u2122 Densitometer (Lunar Inc.) for a DEXA scan. Using Lunar PIXImus software, the bone mineral density (BMD) and fat composition (% fat) and total tissue mass (TTM) were determined in the regions of interest (ROI) [i.e., whole body, vertebrae, and both femurs].","DEXA Results: The male (\u2212\/\u2212) mice exhibited decreased mean bone mineral content, volumetric bone mineral density, bone mineral content index (BMC\/LBM), and bone mineral density in total body, femur, and vertebrae when compared with their gender-matched (+\/+) littermates and the historical means.","Bone microCT Analysis:","Procedure: MicroCT was also used to get very sensitive measurements of BMD. One vertebra and 1 femur were taken from a cohort of 4 wild type and 8 homozygous mice. Measurements were taken of lumbar 5 veterbra traebecular bone volume, traebecular thickness, connectivity density and midshaft femur total bone area and cortical thickness. The \u03bcCT40 scans provided detailed information on bone mass and architecture. Multiple bones were placed into sample holders and scanned automatically. Instrument software was used to select regions of interest for analysis. Trabecular bone parameters were analyzed in the fifth lumbar vertebrae (LV5) at 16 micrometer resolution and cortical bone parameters were analyzed in the femur midshaft at a resolution of 20 micrometers.","Micro-CT Analysis Results: The male (\u2212\/\u2212) mice exhibited a notably decreased mean lumbar 5 vertebral trabecular bone volume, number, thickness, and connectivity density when compared with their gender-matched (+\/+) littermates and the historical means. These mutants also exhibited notably decreased mean femoral midshaft cross-sectional area. [Analyzed wt\/het\/hom: 4\/4\/8]","These results demonstrate that knockout mutant male mice deficient in the gene encoding PRO9783 polypeptides exhibit abnormal bone metabolism with significant bone loss characterized by a decrease in bone mass with decreased density and possibly fragility leading to bone fractures. No hypercalcemia, hyperglycemia, or increased alkaline phosphate was detected in blood chemistry tests to suggest renal, parathyroid, or adrenal dysfunction that might be related to the decrease in bone mineral density seen on the DEXA scan. As the bone mineral density defect was only seen in male knockout mice, this bone abnormality observation suggests testosterone deficiency. Thus, it appears that PRO9783 polypeptides or agonists thereof would be useful in maintaining bone homeostasis mediated by male hormones such as testosterone. In addition, PRO9783 polypeptides or its encoding gene would be useful in maintaining bone homeostasis and could be important in bone healing or for the treatment of arthritis or osteoporosis; whereas antagonists to PRO9783 polypeptides or its encoding gene would lead to abnormal or pathological bone disorders including inflammatory diseases associated with abnormal bone metabolism such as arthritis, osteoporosis, and osteopenia.","C. Generation and Analysis of Mice Comprising DNA58848-1472 (UNQ551) Gene Disruptions","In these knockout experiments, the gene encoding PRO1108 polypeptides (designated as DNA58848-1472) [UNQ551] was disrupted. The gene specific information for these studies is as follows: mouse nucleotide reference corresponds to: NM018743 or putative lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase (LOC55933), protein reference: NP061213 or putative lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase []; the human nucleotide reference corresponds to: AF317516 or putative lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase, protein reference: AAG33063 or putative lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase []. Retroviral Insertion (OST) appeared to be in the forward direction prior to the start codon of a predicted protein about 295 amino acids in length.","The gene that is mutated in these animals is represented by NCBI sequence NM018743 (expressed sequence AU041707), which is the ortholog of human sequence AF317516 (DKFZp586M1819). Both loci encode a hypothetical putative lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase. DKFZp586M1819 is likely to be an enzyme that catalyzes the biosynthesis of glycerolipids or phospholipids. DKFZp586M1819 contains a phosphate acyltransferase domain, which is found in enzymes that have glycerolphosphate, 1-acylglycerolphosphate, or 2-acylglycerolphosphoethanolamine acyltransferase activities (SMART SM00563).","DKFZp586M1819 has some similarity (33% similar over 270 residues) with 1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate O-acyltransferase 1 (AGPAT1; OMIM 603099).

Genetic data indicate that this retroviral insertion resulted in lethality of the homozygous mutants. Due to lethality, transcript expression analysis was not performed. It is not clear when lethality occurs. Expression of the gene starts at E8.5, continues in all subsequent stages examined thus far (up to E13). Normal expression is ubiquitous as shown by in situ hybridization.","Discussion Related to Embryonic Developmental Abnormality of Lethality:","Embryonic lethality in knockout mice usually results from various serious developmental problems including but not limited to neurodegenerative diseases, angiogenic disorders, inflammatory diseases, or where the gene\/protein has an important role in basic cell signaling processes in many cell types. In addition, embryonic lethals are useful as potential cancer models. Likewise, the corresponding heterozygous (+\/\u2212) mutant animals are particularly useful when they exhibit a phenotype and\/or a pathology report which reveals highly informative clues as to the function of the knocked-out gene. For instance, EPO knockout animals were embryonic lethals, but the pathology reports on the embryos showed a profound lack of RBCs.","In the present example, UNQ 551 is a novel lysophophatidic acid acyltransferase which catalyses the conversion of lysophophatidic acid (LPA) to phosphatidic acid (PA). LPA is a naturally occurring component of phospholipid and is known to have growth factor like activity in the regulation of numerous cellular responses through the activation of specific G-protein coupled receptors. LPA has recently been recognized as diagnostic marker for ovarian cancer thus indicating that a UNQ 551 mediated pathway is implicated in cancer progression (13(7):1185-91 (2004)).","1. Phenotypic Analysis (for Disrupted Gene: DNA58848-1472 (UNQ551)","(a) Overall Phenotypic Summary:","The heterozygous (\u2212\/+) mutant mice exhibited immunological abnormalities when compared with their wild-type littermates and the historical mean. Serum IgM, IgG1, IgG2b and IgG3 were decreased in heterozygous adults.","(b) Further Embryonic Analysis","UNQ551 is expressed during the early stages of embryonic mouse development. A day after gastrulation at 8.5d UNQ551 is expressed in the newly formed mesoderm and also in the ectoplacental cone, a structure that will eventually contribute to the placenta. A day later, UNQ551 expression becomes widespread and uniform until at least mid-gestation. By 12.5d the placenta is fully formed and functional. The placenta provides an interface between mother and embryo to allow exchange of gases, nutrients and wastes. The placenta is also a source of hormones and growth factors and is involved in immune protection of the embryo. Deficiencies in any of these properties can lead to growth retardation and death. UNQ551 is expressed in the spongiotrophoblast layer of the placenta.","Homozygous UNQ551 mutant embryos start dying around 14.5 days. Mutants can first be identified at 12.5d by their small placentas. Also the amniotic fluid of mutants is yellow and the yolk sac vasculature is reduced. Both observations are characteristic of unhealthy embryos that are dying and undergoing resorption. Examination of placental histology at 12.5d revealed that projections of the labyrinthine layer into the spongiotrophoblast layer are reduced in number and extent in the mutants. Marker gene analysis confirms that the spongiotrophoblast layer that expresses UNQ551 is reduced in size.","The labyrinthine layer of the placenta is where the maternal and fetal blood circulations are juxtaposed for metabolic exchange. The reduction in branching and therefore reduced surface area in contact between the two systems in the UNQ551 mutant embryos leads to insufficient oxygen\/nutrient exchange resulting in death of the embryo. UNQ551 is important in placental development especially in mediating the invasion of one tissue type into another as seen in the placenta. A similar role for UNQ551 can occur during metastasis.","(c) Immunology Phenotypic Analysis","Immune related and inflammatory diseases are the manifestation or consequence of fairly complex, often multiple interconnected biological pathways which in normal physiology are critical to respond to insult or injury, initiate repair from insult or injury, and mount innate and acquired defense against foreign organisms.

Thus, PRO1108 polypeptides or the gene encoding PRO1108 is essential for embryonic development. In addition, the gene encoding PRO1108 is essential for making immunoglobulins (or gamma globulins). A disease associated with the failure to make gamma globulins has been characterized as agammaglobulinemia linked to a single-gene defect on the X chromosome and thus occurs mainly in males. This single-gene defect in antibody production causes the absence of immunoglobulin isotypes known as IgM, IgA and several subclasses of IgG. Most inherited immunodeficiency diseases are caused by recessive gene defects. Recessive defects thus lead to disease or death only when both chromosomes are defective.

One such phenotypic test included optic fundus photography and angiography to determine the retinal arteriovenous ratio (A\/V ratio) in order to flag various eye abnormalities. An abnormal A\/V ratio signals such systemic diseases or disorders that may be related to the vascular disease of hypertension (and any disease that causes hypertension, e.g. atherosclerosis), diabetes or other ocular diseases corresponding to opthalmological disorders. Such eye abnormalities may include but are not limited to the following: retinal abnormality is retinal dysplasia, various retinopathies, restenosis, retinal artery obstruction or occlusion; retinal degeneration causing secondary atrophy of the retinal vasculature, retinitis pigmentosa, macular dystrophies, Stargardt's disease, congenital stationary night blindness, choroideremia, gyrate atrophy, Leber's congenital amaurosis, retinoschisis disorders, Wagner's syndrome, Usher syndromes, Zellweger syndrome, Saldino-Mainzer syndrome, Senior-Loken syndrome, Bardet-Biedl syndrome, Alport's syndrome, Alstom's syndrome, Cockayne's syndrome, dysplaisa spondyloepiphysaria congentia, Flynn-Aird syndrome, Friedreich ataxia, Hallgren syndrome, Marshall syndrome, Albers-Schnoberg disease, Refsum's disease, Kearns-Sayre syndrome, Waardenburg's syndrome, Alagile syndrome, myotonic dystrophy, olivopontocerebellar atrophy, Pierre-Marie dunsdrome, Stickler syndrome, carotinemeia, cystinosis, Wolfram syndrome, Bassen-Kornzweig syndrome, abetalipoproteinemia, incontinentia pigmenti, Batten's disease, mucopolysaccharidoses, homocystinuria, or mannosidosis.","In addition, optic fundus photography and angiography may be used to determine cataract formation. Cataracts are associated with such systemic diseases as: Human Down's syndrome, Hallerman-Streiff syndrome, Lowe syndrome, galactosemia, Marfan syndrome, Trismoy 13-15 condition, Alport syndrome, myotonic dystrophy, Fabry disease, hypothroidisms, or Conradi syndrome. Other ocular developmental anomalies include: Aniridia, anterior segment and dysgenesis syndrome. Cataracts may also occur as a result of an intraocular infection or inflammation (uveitis).","Procedure:","A cohort of 4 wild type, 4 heterozygotes and 8 homozygotes were tested in this assay. Optic fundus photography was performed on conscious animals using a Kowa Genesis small animal fundus camera modified according to Hawes and coauthors (Hawes et al., 1999 Molecular Vision 1999; 5:22). Intra-peritoneal injection of fluorescein permitted the acquisition of direct light fundus images and fluorescent angiograms for each examination. In addition to direct opthalmological changes, this test can detect retinal changes associated with systemic diseases such as diabetes and atherosclerosis. Pictures were provided of the optic fundus under normal light. The angiographic pictures allowed examination of the arteries and veins of the eye. In addition an artery to vein (A\/V) ratio was determined for the eye.","Opthalmology analysis was performed on generated F2 wild type, heterozygous, and homozygous mutant progeny using the protocol described above. Specifically, the A\/V ratio was measured and calculated according to the fundus images with Kowa COMIT+ software. This test takes color photographs through a dilated pupil: the images help in detecting and classifying many diseases. The artery to vein ratio (A\/V) is the ratio of the artery diameter to the vein diameter (measured before the bifurcation of the vessels). Many diseases will influence the ratio, i.e., diabetes, cardiovascular disorders, papilledema, optic atrophy or other eye abnormalities such as retinal degeneration (known as retinitis pigmentosa) or retinal dysplasia, vision problems or blindness. Thus, phenotypic observations which result in an increased artery-to-vein ratio in homozygous (\u2212\/\u2212) and heterozygous (+\/\u2212) mutant progeny compared to wildtype (+\/+) littermates would be indicative of such pathological conditions.","Results:","In this study, developing cataracts were observed in 6 (\u2212\/\u2212) mice (F-97, -115, -117, F-120, -134, and -137) and 1 (+\/\u2212) mice (F-99), being more severe in the (\u2212\/\u2212) mice. The male (\u2212\/\u2212) mouse examined (-141) exhibited a cataract in the right eye. A slight increase in artery to ratio was also seen. In summary, by knocking out the gene identified as DNA34387-1138 (UNQ214) which encodes PRO240 polypeptides, both heterozygous and homozygous mutant progeny exhibit phenotypes which are associated with cataract formation and\/or other opthalmological disorders. Such detected opthalmology changes are most commonly associated with cardiovascular systemic diseases. In particular, cataract formation may be indicative of a cardiovascular complication related to disturbances in the blood coagulation cascade. Cataracts are also associated with such systemic diseases as: Human Down's syndrome, Hallerman-Streiff syndrome, Lowe syndrome, galactosemia, Marfan syndrome, Trismoy 13-15 condition, Alport syndrome, myotonic dystrophy, Fabry disease, hypothroidisms, Conradi syndrome.

Phenotypic Analysis (for Disrupted Gene: DNA52192-1369 (UNQ480)","Mutation of the target gene (UNQ480) resulted in embryonic lethality. Heterozygous male (+\/\u2212) mice exhibited an increased mean femoral midshaft cross-sectional area when compared with their gender-matched littermates and the historical mean.","Discussion Related to Developmental Abnormality of Embryonic Lethality for UNQ480 and the Negative Phenotype Associated with Heterozygous Male Mutant Mice:","Embryonic lethality in knockout mice usually results from various serious developmental problems including but not limited to neurodegenerative diseases, angiogenic disorders, inflammatory diseases, or where the gene\/protein has an important role in basic cell signaling processes in many cell types. In addition, embryonic lethals are useful as potential cancer models. Likewise, the corresponding heterozygous (+\/\u2212) mutant animals are particularly useful when they exhibit a phenotype and\/or a pathology report which reveals highly informative clues as to the function of the knocked-out gene. For instance, EPO knockout animals were embryonic lethals, but the pathology reports on the embryos showed a profound lack of RBCs.","With regards to UNQ480, the disease conditions more likely to be associated with the embryonic lethality are as follows:\n\n","During embryonic development UNQ480 is preferentially expressed in the cartilage of skeletal tissues indicating involvement in the control of proliferation and differentiation of chondrocytes. Mutations in cartilage proteins can cause severe congenital disorders, including various forms of chondrodyplasia. In the adult, degeneration of the cartilage can lead to osteoarthritis.","UNQ480 is also expressed at high levels in the developing foregut endoderm which will give rise to the pancreatic analage. In adult human tissues UNQ480 is preferentially expressed in the pancreas. Several FGFs and their receptors are expressed in human pancreatic cancer cell lines and are overexpressed in human pancreatic cancers or in the pancreas of chronic pancreatitis. Therefore, overexpression of UNQ480 is involved in the pathobiology of pancreatic diseases.","UNQ480 also plays a role in vascular development as it binds FGF2 which is known to be involved in this process. FGF2 has also been shown to play a role in demyelination and thus can be involved in demyelination diseases such as multiple sclerosis; by inference so might UNQ480.","(a) Bone Metabolism: Radiology Phenotypic Analysis","Procedure:","In the area of bone metabolism, targets were identified herein for the treatment of arthritis, osteoporosis, osteopenia and osteopetrosis as well as identifying targets that promote bone healing.

Measurements were taken of lumbar 5 veterbra traebecular bone volume, traebecular thickness, connectivity density and midshaft femur total bone area and cortical thickness.

Instrument software was used to select regions of interest for analysis. Trabecular bone parameters were analyzed in the fifth lumbar vertebrae (LV5) at 16 micrometer resolution and cortical bone parameters were analyzed in the femur midshaft at a resolution of 20 micrometers.","Micro-CT Analysis Results: The male (+\/\u2212) mice exhibited an increased mean femoral midshaft cross-sectional area when compared with their gender-matched (+\/+) littermates and the historical mean.","(b) Further Pathology Observations","In addition to the above discussion, UNQ480 knockout mice were further investigated to determine what factors were involved which contributed to the embryonic lethality phenotype for the homozygous mice. The results of these studies show that UNQ480 (designated as FGFRL1) is essential for kidney development and can play a positive role in FGF signaling.","FGFRL1 is expressed during embryonic development in the intermediate mesoderm that gives rise to the two precursor cell populations of the kidney; the metenephric mesenchyme and the Wolffian duct. Kidney development starts at embryonic day 10.5 when the metenephric mesenchyme signals to the adjacent epithelial Wolffian duct to induce ureteric bud formation. FGFRL1 is expressed in the metenephric mesenchyme at this stage. The ureteric bud grows and branches in response to signals from the metenephric mesenchyme to form the collecting duct system of the mature kidney. Reciprocal signals from the ureteric bud cause the metenephric mesenchyme to undergo a mesenchymal to epithelial transition to form the excretory portion of the kidney, the nephron.","UNQ480 homozygous mutants die around birth and exhibit kidney agenesis. The initial ureteric bud forms normally in the UNQ480 mutants as illustrated by the normal expression pattern of c-ret at embryonic day 10.5. However, a day later the ureteric bud fails to branch and form the characteristic T-shape structure. Wnt-11 is expressed in the ureteric bud prior to branching but little to no Wnt-11 is expressed in the UNQ480 mutants. Pax2 is expressed in mesenchyme condensing around the tips of the ureteric bud, although Pax2 is expressed in the UNQ480 mutants, the numbers of cells and levels of expression is greatly reduced. These observations suggest that FGFRL1 signals from the metenephric mesenchyme to the ureteric bud to undergo branching morphogenesis. By 13.5d the ureteric bud has normally branched many times as illustrated by c-ret expression. Similarly Wnt-11 marks the branch termini at these stages. Both these genes are either missing or greatly down regulated in the UNQ480 mutants.","Little detail is known about the role of FGF signaling during the early stages of kidney development. However, over expression of a dominant negative form of FGFR2 blocks ureteric branching providing compelling evidence that FGF signaling plays a key role. The endogenous receptor affected in the dominant negative model is unknown because the FGFR2 knock out develops kidneys normally. However, FGFRL1 plays a role in this process.","In summary we have identified UNQ480 (FGFRL1) as a key regulator during the early stages of kidney development. This data suggests that FGFRL1 plays a positive role in FGF signaling.","G.

The antigen may be displayed together with MHC molecules on the surface of antigen presenting cells, virus infected cells, cancer cells, grafts, etc. The T cell system eliminates these altered cells which pose a health threat to the host mammal. T cells include helper T cells and cytotoxic T cells. Helper T cells proliferate extensively following recognition of an antigen-MHC complex on an antigen presenting cell. Helper T cells also secrete a variety of cytokines, i.e., lymphokines, which play a central role in the activation of B cells, cytotoxic T cells and a variety of other cells which participate in the immune response.","In many immune responses, inflammatory cells infiltrate the site of injury or infection.

Immune related diseases could be treated by suppressing the immune response. Using neutralizing antibodies that inhibit molecules having immune stimulatory activity would be beneficial in the treatment of immune-mediated and inflammatory diseases.

The FACS analysis was carried out on 2 wild type and 6 homozygous mice and included cells derived from thymus, spleen, bone marrow and lymph node.","In these studies, analyzed cells were isolated from thymus, peripheral blood, spleen, bone marrow and lymph nodes. Flow cytometry was designed to determine the relative proportions of CD4 and CD8 positive T cells, B cells, NK cells and monocytes in the mononuclear cell population. A Becton-Dickinson FACSCalibur 3-laser FACS machine was used to assess immune status. For Phenotypic Assays and Screening, this machine records CD4+\/CD8\u2212, CD8+\/CD4\u2212, NK, B cell and monocyte numbers in addition to the CD4+\/CD8+ ratio.","The mononuclear cell profile was derived by staining a single sample of lysed peripheral blood from each mouse with a panel of six lineage-specific antibodies: CD45 PerCP, anti-TCRb APC, CD4 PE, CD8 FITC, pan-NK PE, and CD19 FITC. The two FITC and PE labeled antibodies stain mutually exclusive cell types. The samples were analyzed using a Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur flow cytometer with CellQuest software.","Results:","The homozygous mutant mice exhibited an increased mean percentage of CD4+\/CD8\u2212 cells and a decreased mean percentage of CD4\u2212\/CD8+ cells in the spleen and thymus when compared with their wild-type littermates. In addition, tissue-specific FACS analysis resulted in the following observations: The (\u2212\/\u2212) mice exhibited a decreased mean percentage of CD21hiCD23med B cells in the lymph node when compared with their (+\/+) littermates; the (\u2212\/\u2212) mice also showed decreased mean percentages of B220dim CD43dim and B220Med IgD-cells in bone marrow.","In summary, FACS analysis of immune cell composition from peripheral blood indicates that knockout mice exhibit immunological differences with respect to CD4 and CD8 cells when compared with their wild-type littermates. Thus, antagonists of A33 polypeptides or its encoding gene would be expected to mimic these effects. The co-receptor CD4 molecule cooperates with the T-cell receptor which differentially recognizes MHC class II molecules in the antigen recognition process. An increased mean percentage of CD4 cells plays a central role in B cell activation.","H.

In addition, anxiety disorders may apply to personality disorders including but not limited to the following types: paranoid, antisocial, avoidant behavior, borderline personality disorders, dependent, histronic, narcissistic, obsessive-compulsive, schizoid, and schizotypal.","Procedure:","Behavioral screens were performed on a cohort of 4 wild type, 4 heterozygous and 8 homozygous mutant mice. All behavioral tests were done between 12 and 16 weeks of age unless reduced viability necessitates earlier testing. These tests included open field to measure anxiety, activity levels and exploration.","Open Field Test:","Several targets of known drugs have exhibited phenotypes in the open field test. These include knockouts of the seratonin transporter, the dopamine transporter (Giros et al., Nature. 1996 Feb. 15; 379(6566):606-12), and the GABA receptor (Homanics et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 1997 Apr. 15; 94(8):4143-8). An automated open-field assay was customized to address changes related to affective state and exploratory patterns related to learning. First, the field (40\u00d740 cm) was selected to be relatively large for a mouse, thus designed to pick up changes in locomotor activity associated with exploration. In addition, there were 4 holes in the floor to allow for nose-poking, an activity specifically related to exploration. Several factors were also designed to heighten the affective state associated with this test. The open-field test is the first experimental procedure in which the mice are tested, and the measurements that were taken were the subjects' first experience with the chamber. In addition, the open-field was brightly lit. All these factors will heighten the natural anxiety associated with novel and open spaces. The pattern and extent of exploratory activity, and especially the center-to-total distance traveled ratio, may then be able to discern changes related to susceptibility to anxiety or depression. A large arena (40 cm\u00d740 cm, VersaMax animal activity monitoring system from AccuScan Instruments) with infrared beams at three different levels was used to record rearing, hole poke, and locomotor activity. The animal was placed in the center and its activity was measured for 20 minutes. Data from this test was analyzed in five, 4-minute intervals. The total distance traveled (cm), vertical movement number (rearing), number of hole pokes, and the center to total distance ratio were recorded.","The propensity for mice to exhibit normal habituation responses to a novel environment is assessed by determining the overall change in their horizontal locomotor activity across the 5 time intervals. This calculated slope of the change in activity over time is determined using normalized, rather than absolute, total distance traveled. The slope is determined from the regression line through the normalized activity at each of the 5 time intervals. Normal habituation is represented by a negative slope value.","Results: A notable difference was observed during open field activity testing. The female (\u2212\/\u2212) mice exhibited an increased median sum time in the center area when compared with their gender-matched (+\/+) littermates, which is indicative of a decreased anxiety-like response in the mutants. Thus, knockout mice demonstrated a phenotype consistent with depression, generalized anxiety disorders, attention deficit disorder, sleep disorder, cognitive disorders, hyperalgesia and sensory disorders depressive disorders. Thus, PRO230 polypeptides and agonists thereof would be useful for the treatment or amelioration of the symptoms associated with such depressive disorders.","(c) Immunology Phenotypic Analysis","Immune related and inflammatory diseases are the manifestation or consequence of fairly complex, often multiple interconnected biological pathways which in normal physiology are critical to respond to insult or injury, initiate repair from insult or injury, and mount innate and acquired defense against foreign organisms. Disease or pathology occurs when these normal physiological pathways cause additional insult or injury either as directly related to the intensity of the response, as a consequence of abnormal regulation or excessive stimulation, as a reaction to self, or as a combination of these.","Though the genesis of these diseases often involves multistep pathways and often multiple different biological systems\/pathways, intervention at critical points in one or more of these pathways can have an ameliorative or therapeutic effect.

Chicken ovalbumin (OVA) is a T-cell dependent antigen, which is commonly used as a model protein for studying antigen-specific immune responses in mice. OVA is non-toxic and inert and therefore will not cause harm to the animals even if no immune response is induced. The murine immune response to OVA has been well characterized, to the extent that the immunodominant peptides for eliciting T cell responses have been identified. Anti-OVA antibodies are detectable 8 to 10 days after immunization using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELIZA), and determination of different isotypes of antibodies gives further information on the complex processes that may lead to a deficient response in genetically engineered mice.","As noted above, this protocol assesses the ability of mice to raise an antigen-specific immune response. Animals were injected IP with 50 mg of chicken ovalbumin emulsified in Complete Feund's Adjuvant and 14 days later the serum titer of anti-ovalbumin antibodies (IgM, IgG1 and IgG2 subclasses) was measured. The amount of OVA-specific antibody in the serum sample is proportional to the Optical Density (OD) value generated by an instrument that scans a 96-well sample plate. Data was collected for a set of serial dilutions of each serum sample. [Analyzed wt\/het\/hom: 6\/4\/14]","Results of this challenge: The (\u2212\/\u2212) mice exhibited a trend towards an increased mean serum IgG2a response to the ovalbumin challenge when compared with their (+\/+) littermates. Thus, these knockout mice exhibited an increased ability to elicit an OVA-specific antibody response to the T-cell dependent OVA antigen. Inhibitors (antagonists) of PRO230 polypeptides would be expected to also stimulate the immune system and would find utility in the cases wherein this effect would be beneficial to the individual such as in the case of leukemia, and other types of cancer, and in immunocompromised patients, such as AIDS sufferers. Accordingly, PRO230 polypeptides or agonists thereof would be useful in inhibiting the immune response and would be useful candidates for suppressing harmful immune responses, e.g. in the case of graft rejection or graft-versus-host diseases.","I.

In addition, the female homozygous mutant mice exhibited an increased mean total tissue mass and lean body mass and an increased mean serum triglyceride level.","(b) Immunology Phenotypic Analysis","Immune related and inflammatory diseases are the manifestation or consequence of fairly complex, often multiple interconnected biological pathways which in normal physiology are critical to respond to insult or injury, initiate repair from insult or injury, and mount innate and acquired defense against foreign organisms. Disease or pathology occurs when these normal physiological pathways cause additional insult or injury either as directly related to the intensity of the response, as a consequence of abnormal regulation or excessive stimulation, as a reaction to self, or as a combination of these.","Though the genesis of these diseases often involves multistep pathways and often multiple different biological systems\/pathways, intervention at critical points in one or more of these pathways can have an ameliorative or therapeutic effect. Therapeutic intervention can occur by either antagonism of a detrimental process\/pathway or stimulation of a beneficial process\/pathway.","T lymphocytes (T cells) are an important component of a mammalian immune response. T cells recognize antigens which are associated with a self-molecule encoded by genes within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). The antigen may be displayed together with MHC molecules on the surface of antigen presenting cells, virus infected cells, cancer cells, grafts, etc. The T cell system eliminates these altered cells which pose a health threat to the host mammal. T cells include helper T cells and cytotoxic T cells. Helper T cells proliferate extensively following recognition of an antigen-MHC complex on an antigen presenting cell. Helper T cells also secrete a variety of cytokines, i.e., lymphokines, which play a central role in the activation of B cells, cytotoxic T cells and a variety of other cells which participate in the immune response.","In many immune responses, inflammatory cells infiltrate the site of injury or infection. The migrating cells may be neutrophilic, eosinophilic, monocytic or lymphocytic as can be determined by histologic examination of the affected tissues. Current Protocols in Immunology, ed. John E. Coligan, 1994, John Wiley & Sons, Inc.","Many immune related diseases are known and have been extensively studied. Such diseases include immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (such as rheumatoid arthritis, immune mediated renal disease, hepatobiliary diseases, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), psoriasis, and asthma), non-immune-mediated inflammatory diseases, infectious diseases, immunodeficiency diseases, neoplasia, and graft rejection, etc.","In the area of immunology, targets were identified herein for the treatment of inflammation and inflammatory disorders. Immune related diseases could be treated by suppressing the immune response. Using neutralizing antibodies that inhibit molecules having immune stimulatory activity would be beneficial in the treatment of immune-mediated and inflammatory diseases. Molecules which inhibit the immune response can be utilized (proteins directly or via the use of antibody agonists) to inhibit the immune response and thus ameliorate immune related disease.","The Following Tests were Performed:","Zymosan Challenge Assay\u2014Peritoneal Inflammation:","Procedure: A cohort of 1 wild type and 2 homozygous mutants were used in this assay. Peritoneal leukocyte recruitment assays were used to identify targets that may regulate the inflammatory component of atherosclerosis. These assays detect abnormalities in immune cell recruitment to a site of inflammation. Zymosan (an agent which induces inflammation) was injected into the intraperitoneal cavity and fluid was later removed and measurements were taken of total WBC counts, neutrophil\/monocyte ratio and percent granulocytes, monocytes, lymphocytes and eosinophils in the ip fluid.","Results: The (\u2212\/\u2212) mice exhibited a notably increased total white blood cell count after zymosan challenge when compared with their (+\/+) littermate and the historical range, suggestive of an increased response to an inflammatory stimulus in these mutants.","In summary, the zymosan challenge studies indicate that knockout mice deficient in the gene encoding PRO1199 polypeptides exhibit a proinflammatory response when compared with their wild-type littermates. Thus, antagonists of PRO1199 polypeptides would be important agents which would stimulate the immune system (such as T cell proliferation) and would find utility in the cases wherein this effect would be beneficial to the individual such as in the case of leukemia, and other types of cancer, and in immunocompromised patients, such as AIDS sufferers. Accordingly, PRO1199 polypeptides or agonists thereto would be useful in inhibiting the immune response and would be useful candidates for suppressing harmful immune responses, e.g. in the case of graft rejection or graft-versus-host diseases.","(c) Phenotypic Analysis: Cardiology","In the area of cardiovascular biology, targets were identified for the treatment of hypertension, atherosclerosis, heart failure, stroke, coronary artery diseases, and dislipidemias such as high cholesterol and triglyceride serum levels. The phenotypic tests included the measurement of serum cholesterol and triglycerides.","Blood Lipids","Procedure: A cohort of 4 wild type, 4 heterozygotes and 8 homozygotes were tested in this assay. High serum trigylcerides levels are recognized risk factors in the development of cardiovascular disease. In addition, dislipidemia can be associated with obesity and diabetes. Measuring blood lipids facilitates the finding of biological switches that regulate blood lipid levels. Inhibition of factors which elevate blood lipid levels may be useful for reducing the risk for cardiovascular disease.","As summarized above, the female homozygous mutant mice exhibited an increased mean total tissue mass and lean body mass and an increased mean serum triglyceride level in homozygous knockout mice (167% of wild-type littermates). Thus, mutant mice deficient in the PRO1199 gene can serve as a model for cardiovascular disease and\/or dislipidemia associated with obesity and diabetes. PRO1199 or its encoding gene would be useful in regulating blood lipids and in particular may play a role in maintaining normal lipid metabolism.","(d) Dexa Analysis\u2014Test Description:","Procedure: A cohort of 4 wild type, 4 heterozygotes and 8 homozygotes were tested in this assay.

TNFRSF19 recruits binding of TRAFs, and activates nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (Eby et al., J. Biol. Chem., 275(20): 15336-42 (2000); Kojima et al., J. Biol.

Activation of TNFRSF19 also induces caspace-independent cell death. The function of TNFRSF19 is likely to be pleiotropic and important in embryonic development and skin and hair follicle development (OMIM 606122).","In mouse, alternative splicing gives rise to 2 additional variants; one may function as a soluble receptor and the other may function as a decoy receptor.","Targeted or gene trap mutations were generated in strain 129SvEv-derived embryonic stem (ES) cells.

The male (\u2212\/\u2212) mutant mice exhibited a notably decreased femoral midshaft cross-sectional area when compared with the histroical mean.","(b) Phenotypic Analysis: CNS\/Neurology","In the area of neurology, analysis focused herein on identifying in vivo validated targets for the treatment of neurological and psychiatric disorders. Neurological disorders include but are not limited to: depression, generalized anxiety disorders, attention deficit disorder, sleep disorder, hyperactivity disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, schizophrenia, cognitive disorders, hyperalgesia and sensory disorders, mild to moderate anxiety, anxiety disorder due to a general medical condition, anxiety disorder not otherwise specified, generalized anxiety disorder, panic attack, panic disorder with agoraphobia, panic disorder without agoraphobia, posttraumatic stress disorder, social phobia, social anxiety, autism, specific phobia, substance-induced anxiety disorder, acute alcohol withdrawal, obsessive compulsive disorder, agoraphobia, monopolar disorders, bipolar disorder I or II, bipolar disorder not otherwise specified, cyclothymic disorder, depressive disorder, major depressive disorder, mood disorder, substance-induced mood disorder, enhancement of cognitive function, loss of cognitive function associated with but not limited to Alzheimer's disease, stroke, or traumatic injury to the brain, seizures resulting from disease or injury including but not limited to epilepsy, learning disorders\/disabilities, cerebral palsy. In addition, anxiety disorders may apply to personality disorders including but not limited to the following types: paranoid, antisocial, avoidant behavior, borderline personality disorders, dependent, histronic, narcissistic, obsessive-compulsive, schizoid, and schizotypal.","Procedure:","Behavioral screens were performed on a cohort of 4 wild type, 4 heterozygous and 8 homozygous mutant mice. All behavioral tests were done between 12 and 16 weeks of age unless reduced viability necessitates earlier testing. These tests included open field to measure anxiety, activity levels and exploration.","Open Field Test:","Several targets of known drugs have exhibited phenotypes in the open field test. These include knockouts of the seratonin transporter, the dopamine transporter (Giros et al., Nature. 1996 Feb. 15; 379(6566):606-12), and the GABA receptor (Homanics et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 1997 Apr. 15; 94(8):4143-8). An automated open-field assay was customized to address changes related to affective state and exploratory patterns related to learning. First, the field (40\u00d740 cm) was selected to be relatively large for a mouse, thus designed to pick up changes in locomotor activity associated with exploration. In addition, there were 4 holes in the floor to allow for nose-poking, an activity specifically related to exploration. Several factors were also designed to heighten the affective state associated with this test. The open-field test is the first experimental procedure in which the mice are tested, and the measurements that were taken were the subjects' first experience with the chamber. In addition, the open-field was brightly lit. All these factors will heighten the natural anxiety associated with novel and open spaces. The pattern and extent of exploratory activity, and especially the center-to-total distance traveled ratio, may then be able to discern changes related to susceptibility to anxiety or depression. A large arena (40 cm\u00d740 cm, VersaMax animal activity monitoring system from AccuScan Instruments) with infrared beams at three different levels was used to record rearing, hole poke, and locomotor activity. The animal was placed in the center and its activity was measured for 20 minutes. Data from this test was analyzed in five, 4-minute intervals. The total distance traveled (cm), vertical movement number (rearing), number of hole pokes, and the center to total distance ratio were recorded.","The propensity for mice to exhibit normal habituation responses to a novel environment is assessed by determining the overall change in their horizontal locomotor activity across the 5 time intervals. This calculated slope of the change in activity over time is determined using normalized, rather than absolute, total distance traveled. The slope is determined from the regression line through the normalized activity at each of the 5 time intervals. Normal habituation is represented by a negative slope value.","Results:","As indicated in the phenotypic analysis summary, notable differences were observed during open field activity testing. The (\u2212\/\u2212) mice demonstrated a decrease in locomotor activity, rearing, and hole poke activity over all intervals when compared with the (+\/+) mice, suggesting a hypoactive and decreased exploratory response. Thus, knockout mice demonstrated a phenotype consistent with various neural degenerative diseases which may include consistent with depression, generalized anxiety disorders, attention deficit disorder, sleep disorder, cognitive disorders, hyperalgesia and sensory disorders, schizophrenia and\/or bipolar disorders. Thus, PRO4333 polypeptides and agonists thereof would be useful for the treatment or amelioration of the symptoms associated with such depressive disorders.","(c) Bone Metabolism: Radiology Phenotypic Analysis","Procedure:","In the area of bone metabolism, targets were identified herein for the treatment of arthritis, osteoporosis, osteopenia and osteopetrosis as well as identifying targets that promote bone healing.

Measurements were taken of lumbar 5 veterbra traebecular bone volume, traebecular thickness, connectivity density and midshaft femur total bone area and cortical thickness. The \u03bcCT40 scans provided detailed information on bone mass and architecture. Multiple bones were placed into sample holders and scanned automatically. Instrument software was used to select regions of interest for analysis. Trabecular bone parameters were analyzed in the fifth lumbar vertebrae (LV5) at 16 micrometer resolution and cortical bone parameters were analyzed in the femur midshaft at a resolution of 20 micrometers.","Micro-CT Analysis Results: The male (\u2212\/\u2212) mutant exhibited a notably decreased femoral midshaft cross-sectional area when compared with gender-matched (+\/+) littermates and the historical means.","These results demonstrate that knockout mutant mice exhibit abnormal bone metabolism with significant bone loss similar to osteoporosis characterized by decrease in bone mass with decreased density and possibly fragility leading to bone fractures. Blood chemistry tests also showed an increased alkaline phosphatase activity in (\u2212\/\u2212) mutant mice which is commonly associated with osteoporosis. Thus, it appears that PRO4333 polypeptides or its encoding gene would be useful in maintaining bone homeostasis or would be useful for bone healing or for the treatment of arthritis or osteoporosis, whereas antagonists would lead to abnormal or pathological bone disorders similar to osteoporosis. In addition to these studies, (\u2212\/\u2212) mutant mice showed signs of growth retardation. Such growth disorders may be associated with the phenotype or physiological condition associated with tissue wasting diseases such as diabetes or cachexia. Thus, PRO4333 polypeptides or agonists thereof would be useful for treating diabetes or cachexia.","(d) Phenotypic Analysis: Metabolism\u2014Blood Chemistry","In the area of metabolism, targets may be identified for the treatment of diabetes. Blood chemistry phenotypic analysis includes glucose tolerance tests to measure insulin sensitivity and changes in glucose metabolism. Abnormal glucose tolerance test results may indicate the following disorders or conditions: cachexia, Diabetes Type 1 and Type 2, Syndrome X, various cardiovascular diseases.","Procedure: A cohort of 4 wild type, 4 heterozygote and 8 homozygote mice were used in this assay. The glucose tolerance test is the standard for defining impaired glucose homeostasis in mammals. The intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (IPGTT) measures glucose levels following administration of a glucose challenge. Glucose tolerance tests were performed using a Lifescan glucometer. Animals were injected IP at 2 g\/kg with D-glucose delivered as a 20% solution and blood glucose levels were measured at 0, 30, 60 and 90 minutes after injection.","Results: These studies indicated that male (\u2212\/\u2212) mice exhibit enhanced glucose tolerance in the presence of normal fasting glucose at all 3 intervals tested when compared with their gender-matched (+\/+) littermates and the historical means.

Any value<6 is not significant.","Results:","The serum immunoglobulin isotyping assay revealed that homozygous adults exhibited decreased serum IgA levels compared with the (+\/+) littermates. These results suggest that the phenotype associated with these knockout mice is immunoglobulin deficiency in IgA. The most common inherited form of immunoglobulin deficiency is selective IgA deficiency, which is seen in about one person in 800. Although no obvious disease susceptibility is associated with selective IgA defects, they are commoner in people with chronic lung disease than in the general population. This suggests that lack of IgA may result in a predisposition to lung infections with various pathogens and is consistent with the role of IgA in defense at the body surfaces. Thus PRO4333 polypeptides or agonists thereof, would be useful for natural immunity protection against skin infections and more importantly could prevent susceptibility to lung infections.","L.

Phenotypic Analysis (for Disrupted Gene: DNA65423-1595 (UNQ691)","(a) Overall Phenotypic Summary","At 2 weeks of age, the homozygous mutant neonates exhibited balding; however, their hair grew in and appeared normal at adulthood. Half of the homozygous mutant mice exhibited signs of growth retardation at 16 weeks of age, namely decreased body weight and length, total tissue mass, and lean body mass, when compared with their wild-type littermates. The homozygous mutant mice also exhibited a diaphragmatic hernia and decreased exploratory activity and a decreased anxiety-related response during open field testing.","(b) Phenotypic Analysis: CNS\/Neurology","In the area of neurology, analysis focused herein on identifying in vivo validated targets for the treatment of neurological and psychiatric disorders. Neurological disorders include but are not limited to: depression, generalized anxiety disorders, attention deficit disorder, sleep disorder, hyperactivity disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, schizophrenia, cognitive disorders, hyperalgesia and sensory disorders, mild to moderate anxiety, anxiety disorder due to a general medical condition, anxiety disorder not otherwise specified, generalized anxiety disorder, panic attack, panic disorder with agoraphobia, panic disorder without agoraphobia, posttraumatic stress disorder, social phobia, social anxiety, autism, specific phobia, substance-induced anxiety disorder, acute alcohol withdrawal, obsessive compulsive disorder, agoraphobia, monopolar disorders, bipolar disorder I or II, bipolar disorder not otherwise specified, cyclothymic disorder, depressive disorder, major depressive disorder, mood disorder, substance-induced mood disorder, enhancement of cognitive function, loss of cognitive function associated with but not limited to Alzheimer's disease, stroke, or traumatic injury to the brain, seizures resulting from disease or injury including but not limited to epilepsy, learning disorders\/disabilities, cerebral palsy. In addition, anxiety disorders may apply to personality disorders including but not limited to the following types: paranoid, antisocial, avoidant behavior, borderline personality disorders, dependent, histronic, narcissistic, obsessive-compulsive, schizoid, and schizotypal.","Procedure:","Behavioral screens were performed on a cohort of 4 wild type, 4 heterozygous and 8 homozygous mutant mice. All behavioral tests were done between 12 and 16 weeks of age unless reduced viability necessitates earlier testing. These tests included open field to measure anxiety, activity levels and exploration.","Open Field Test:","Several targets of known drugs have exhibited phenotypes in the open field test. These include knockouts of the seratonin transporter, the dopamine transporter (Giros et al., Nature. 1996 Feb. 15; 379(6566):606-12), and the GABA receptor (Homanics et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 1997 Apr. 15; 94(8):4143-8). An automated open-field assay was customized to address changes related to affective state and exploratory patterns related to learning. First, the field (40\u00d740 cm) was selected to be relatively large for a mouse, thus designed to pick up changes in locomotor activity associated with exploration. In addition, there were 4 holes in the floor to allow for nose-poking, an activity specifically related to exploration. Several factors were also designed to heighten the affective state associated with this test. The open-field test is the first experimental procedure in which the mice are tested, and the measurements that were taken were the subjects' first experience with the chamber. In addition, the open-field was brightly lit. All these factors will heighten the natural anxiety associated with novel and open spaces. The pattern and extent of exploratory activity, and especially the center-to-total distance traveled ratio, may then be able to discern changes related to susceptibility to anxiety or depression. A large arena (40 cm\u00d740 cm, VersaMax animal activity monitoring system from AccuScan Instruments) with infrared beams at three different levels was used to record rearing, hole poke, and locomotor activity. The animal was placed in the center and its activity was measured for 20 minutes. Data from this test was analyzed in five, 4-minute intervals. The total distance traveled (cm), vertical movement number (rearing), number of hole pokes, and the center to total distance ratio were recorded.","The propensity for mice to exhibit normal habituation responses to a novel environment is assessed by determining the overall change in their horizontal locomotor activity across the 5 time intervals. This calculated slope of the change in activity over time is determined using normalized, rather than absolute, total distance traveled. The slope is determined from the regression line through the normalized activity at each of the 5 time intervals. Normal habituation is represented by a negative slope value.","Results:","With regards to general and exploratory activity\/anxiety behavior, notable differences were observed during open field activity testing. The (\u2212\/\u2212) mice demonstrated a decrease in rearing and hole poke activity when compared to the (+\/+) mice, suggesting a decreased exploratory response in the (\u2212\/\u2212) mice. The (\u2212\/\u2212) mice also demonstrated a decrease in center-to-total distance traveled ratio at intervals 2, 3, and 5 when compared to the (+\/+) mice, suggesting a decreased anxiety-like response in the (\u2212\/\u2212) mice. Thus, knockout mice demonstrated a phenotype consistent with various neural degenerative diseases which may include consistent with depression, generalized anxiety disorders, attention deficit disorder, sleep disorder, cognitive disorders, hyperalgesia and sensory disorders, schizophrenia and\/or bipolar disorders. Thus, PRO1336 polypeptides and agonists thereof would be useful for the treatment or amelioration of the symptoms associated with such depressive disorders.","Functional Observational Battery (FOB) Test","The FOB is a series of situations applied to the animal to determine gross sensory and motor deficits. A subset of tests from the Irwin neurological screen that evaluates gross neurological function is used. In general, short-duration, tactile, olfactory, and visual stimuli are applied to the animal to determine their ability to detect and respond normally. These simple tests take approximately 10 minutes and the mouse is returned to its home cage at the end of testing.","Results:","As summarized above, a notable difference was observed during the functional observational battery. Male heterozygous (\u2212\/+) mice exhibited moderate exophthalmus (an abnormal protrusion of the eyeball); whereas female homozygous (\u2212\/\u2212) mutant mice exhibited severe exophthalmus. Both male and female (\u2212\/\u2212) mice also exhibited piloerection. Piloerection is an involuntary erection or bristling of hairs due to a sympathetic reflex usually triggered by cold, shock, or fright or due to a sympatho-mimetic agent. All of the (\u2212\/\u2212) mice exhibited balding at 2 weeks of age with bald hair patches around the snout. However, their hair grew in and appeared normal at adulthood. Thus, functional observational battery testing showed that the mutant mice exhibited a decreased exploratory activity phenotype. Neurological disorders associated with this type of behavior may involve such anxiety disorders of panic or a panic disorder associated with agoraphobia, agoraphobia or cyclothymic disorder. Cyclothymic disorders are characterized by the alteration of depressed moods with elevated, expansive, or irritable moods without psychotic features such as hallucinations or delusions.","(c) Phenotype Analysis: Body Mass:","Dexa Analysis\u2014Test Description:","Procedure: A cohort of 4 wild type, 4 heterozygotes and 6 homozygotes were tested in this assay. Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) has been used successfully to identify changes in total tissue mass (TTM).","The mouse was anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of Avertin (1.25% 2,2,2,-tribromoethanol, 20 ml\/kg body weight), body length and weight were measured, and then the mouse was placed in a prone position on the platform of the PIXImus\u2122 Densitometer (Lunar Inc.) for a DEXA scan. Using Lunar PIXImus software, the bone mineral density (BMD) and fat composition (% fat) and total tissue mass (TTM) were determined in the regions of interest (ROI, i.e., whole body, vertebrae, and both femurs).","Results:","The (\u2212\/\u2212) mice analyzed by DEXA exhibited notably decreased total tissue mass and lean body mass when compared with their (+\/+) littermates, suggestive of growth retardation in these mutants. These mutants also exhibited a notably increased bone mineral content index (BMC\/LBM). Blood chemistry analysis indicated that male (\u2212\/\u2212) mice showed a decreased mean insulin level when compared with their gender-matched (+\/+) littermates and the historical mean. This in conjunction with the observations of a decreased mean body weight and decreased mean body length suggests a tissue wasting condition such as cachexia, diabetes type 1 and type 2. Thus, PRO1336 polypeptides or agonists thereof would be useful in the treatment or prevention of cachexia and\/or diabetes.","CAT-Scan Protocol:","Mice were injected with a CT contrast agent, Omnipaque 300 (Nycomed Amershan, 300 mg of iodine per ml, 0.25 ml per animal, or 2.50-3.75 g iodine\/kg of body weight) intraperitoneally. After resting in the cage for \u02dc10 minutes, the mouse was then sedated by intraperitoneal injection of Avertin (1.25% 2,2,2,-tribromoethanol, 20 ml\/kg body weight). A CAT-scan was performed using a MicroCAT scanner (ImTek, Inc.) with the anesthetized animal lying prone on the test bed. Three dimensional images were reconstructed by the Feldkamp algorithm in a cluster of workstations using an ImTek 3D RECON software.","Results:","Of the five (\u2212\/\u2212) mutant mice that were examined, four exhibited a developmental defect of the diaphragm (diaphragmatic hernia). In addition, the (\u2212\/\u2212) mice exhibited an enlarged right atrium. Microscopic observations were as follows: Histological analysis of these mutants revealed a variety of lesions, including hepatic atrophy, congestion, periportal fibrosis, aortic atherosclerosis, and gastric inflammation. However, all of these lesions were considered to be secondary to the diaphragmatic hernia, rather than being primary gene-related lesions.","M. Generation and Analysis of Mice Comprising DNA145887-2849 (UNQ5793) Gene Disruptions","In these knockout experiments, the gene encoding PRO19598 polypeptides (designated as DNA145887-2849 (UNQ5793) was disrupted. The gene specific information for these studies is as follows: mouse gene sequence nucleotide reference: XM136951 or similar to interleukin-22 binding protein (LOC237310), protein reference: XP136951 similar to interleukin-22 binding protein []; human gene sequence nucleotide reference: NM052962 or class II cytokine receptor (IL22RA2), protein reference: NP443194 or class II cytokine receptor; interleukin 22-binding protein [","The gene that is mutated in these animals is represented by mouse nucleotide sequence XM136951, which is the ortholog of human UniGene cluster Hs. 126891 (IL22RA2). IL22RA2 encodes interleukin 22 receptor alpha-2. The protein is also known as interleukin 22-binding protein (IL22BP) and class II cytokine receptor, IL22BP, CRF2-S1, and IL-22BP.","IL22RA2, containing 2 cytokine-binding fibronectin type III domains, is a secreted glycoprotein resembling the extracellular domain of cytokine receptors IL20RA and IL22R (33% identity) (Dumoutier et al, J. Immunol., 166(12):7090-5 (2001)); Xu et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 98(17):9511-6 (2001)). IL22RA2 binds with IL22, a cytokine produced by T cells, and was shown to inhibit IL22 signaling in numerous cell lines. Thus, IL22RA2 is likely to be a negative regulator of inflammatory responses induced by IL22 (Dumoutier et al, 2001 supra; Xu et al, 2001 supra; Kotenko et al, J. Immunol., 166(12):7096-103 (2001)). IL22RA2 was detected in breast, lung, colon, skin, placenta, spleen, mononuclear cells, and to a lesser extent in several other tissues (Dumoutier et al, 2001 supra; Xu et al, 2001 supra; Kotenko et al, 2001 supra). Highest IL22RA2 expression occurred in mononuclear cells, plasma cells, and epithelium in inflammatory infiltration sites. IL22RA2 expression was also detected in certain types of tumors (see U.S. Patent Application Publication No. US-2002-0137909-A1 published Sep. 26, 2002).","Targeted or gene trap mutations were generated in strain 129SvEv-derived embryonic stem (ES) cells.

Therapeutic intervention can occur by either antagonism of a detrimental process\/pathway or stimulation of a beneficial process\/pathway.","T lymphocytes (T cells) are an important component of a mammalian immune response. T cells recognize antigens which are associated with a self-molecule encoded by genes within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). The antigen may be displayed together with MHC molecules on the surface of antigen presenting cells, virus infected cells, cancer cells, grafts, etc. The T cell system eliminates these altered cells which pose a health threat to the host mammal. T cells include helper T cells and cytotoxic T cells. Helper T cells proliferate extensively following recognition of an antigen-MHC complex on an antigen presenting cell. Helper T cells also secrete a variety of cytokines, i.e., lymphokines, which play a central role in the activation of B cells, cytotoxic T cells and a variety of other cells which participate in the immune response.","In many immune responses, inflammatory cells infiltrate the site of injury or infection.

Such diseases include immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (such as rheumatoid arthritis, immune mediated renal disease, hepatobiliary diseases, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), psoriasis, and asthma), non-immune-mediated inflammatory diseases, infectious diseases, immunodeficiency diseases, neoplasia, and graft rejection, etc.","In the area of immunology, targets were identified herein for the treatment of inflammation and inflammatory disorders. Immune related diseases could be treated by suppressing the immune response. Using neutralizing antibodies that inhibit molecules having immune stimulatory activity would be beneficial in the treatment of immune-mediated and inflammatory diseases. Molecules which inhibit the immune response can be utilized (proteins directly or via the use of antibody agonists) to inhibit the immune response and thus ameliorate immune related disease.","Serum Immunoglobulin Isotyping Assay:","The Serum Immunoglobulin Isotyping Assay was performed using a Cytometric Bead Array (CBA) kit. This assay was used to rapidly identify the heavy and light chain isotypes of a mouse monoclonal antibody in a single sample. The values expressed are \u201crelative fluorescence units\u201d and are based on the detection of kappa light chains. Any value<6 is not significant.","Results:","Mutant (\u2212\/\u2212) mice exhibited elevation of IgM, IgG1, IgG2a and IgG2b serum immunoglobulins compared to their gender-matched (+\/+) littermates. IgM immunoglobulins are the first to be produced in a humoral immune response for neutralization of bacterial toxins and are particularly important in activating the complement system. Likewise, IgG immunoglobulins have neutralization effects and to a lesser extent are important for activation of the complement system. The observed phenotype suggests that the PRO19598 polypeptide is a negative regulator of inflammatory responses. These immunological abnormalities suggest that inhibitors (antagonists) of PRO19598 polypeptides would be useful in stimulating the immune system (such as T cell proliferation) and would find utility in the cases wherein this effect would be beneficial to the individual such as in the case of leukemia, and other types of cancer, and in immunocompromised patients, such as AIDS sufferers. Accordingly, PRO9783 polypeptides or agonists thereof would be useful in inhibiting the immune response and would be useful candidates for suppressing harmful immune responses, e.g. in the case of graft rejection or graft-versus-host diseases.","ConA-induced Hepatitis","Studies were performed to see the effects of ConA-induced hepatitis on homozygous and heterozygous mutant mice in comparison to their wild-type gender-matched littermates.","Procedure:","The effect of ConA-induced hepatitis was studied in UNQ5793 knockout mice. Groups used for this study include wild-type (+\/+) mice, heterozygous (+\/\u2212) mice, UNQ5793 homozygous (\u2212\/\u2212) mice, and untreated C57B16 mice. All mice except for the C57B16 control group were injected with 10 mg\/kg of ConA in 100 ul saline by intravenous injection. Sixteen hours later, mice were sacrificed and serum was collected for analysis of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels. Serum was diluted 1:3 in water and placed on a Roche reagent cassette and read using a Chemistry analyzer (Integra 400). Livers were also collected at 16 hours. The liver samples were fixed and stained with hematoxylin and eosin in order to determine the extent of liver damage.","Results:","Both the homozygous (\u2212\/\u2212) and heterozygous (+\/\u2212) mutant mice exhibited significantly elevated levels of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 16 hours after injection with ConA compared with untreated C57B16 controls and their wild-type (+\/+) gender-matched littermates.

The values expressed are \u201crelative fluorescence units\u201d and are based on the detection of kappa light chains. Any value<6 is not significant.","Results:","Mutant (\u2212\/\u2212) mice exhibited elevation of IgM, IgA, and IgG3 serum immunoglobulins compared to their gender-matched (+\/+) littermates. IgM immunoglobulins are the first to be produced in a humoral immune response for neutralization of bacterial toxins and are particularly important in activating the complement system. Likewise, IgG immunoglobulins have neutralization effects and to a lesser extent are important for activation of the complement system. IgA mainly functions as an epithelial cell protector which can neutralize bacterial toxins and viruses. Although no obvious disease susceptibility is associated with selective IgA defects, they are commoner in people with chronic lung disease than in the general population. This suggests that lack of IgA may result in a predisposition to lung infections with various pathogens and is consistent with the role of IgA in defense at the body surfaces. In this case, the phenotype observed for knockout mice resulted in an increase in IgA serum levels suggesting that inhibitors (antagonists) of PRO1083 polypeptides would be useful for natural immunity protection against skin infections and more importantly would prevent susceptibility to lung infections. The observed phenotype suggests that the PRO1083 polypeptide is a negative regulator of inflammatory responses. These immunological abnormalities suggest that inhibitors (antagonists) of PRO1083 polypeptides would be useful as important agents which could stimulate the immune system (such as T cell proliferation) and would find utility in the cases wherein this effect would be beneficial to the individual such as in the case of leukemia, and other types of cancer, and in immunocompromised patients, such as AIDS sufferers. Accordingly, PRO1083 polypeptides or agonists thereof would be useful in inhibiting the immune response and would be useful candidates for suppressing harmful immune responses, e.g. in the case of graft rejection or graft-versus-host diseases.","(c) Bone Metabolism: Radiology Phenotypic Analysis","In the area of bone metabolism, targets were identified herein for the treatment of arthritis, osteoporosis, osteopenia and osteopetrosis as well as identifying targets that promote bone healing.

These results indicate that the knockout mutant phenotype may be associated with such bone abnormalities as osteopetrosis. Osteopetrosis is a condition characterized by abnormal thickening and hardening of bone and abnormal fragility of the bones. As such, PRO1083 polypeptides or agonists thereof would be useful for the treatment of osteopetrosis. A phenotype associated with an increased bone mineral content, and total body and femoral bone mineral density suggests that agents which mimic these effects (e.g. antagonists of PRO1083 polypeptides) would be useful in bone healing.","O.

ADP-ribose-activated TRPM2 is likely to play an important role in triggering immune responses in certain types of immune cells (Sano et al., Science, 293(5533):1327-30 (Aug. 17, 2001); Perraud et al, Nature, 411(6837):595-9 (May 31, 2001)).","A specific TRPM2 variant lacking the C-terminal Nudix domain is activated by hydrogen peroxide but not ADP-ribose and is thus activated by oxidative stress.

Biol. Chem., 277(26):23150-6 (2002)). Moreover, the TRPM2 variant with the Nudix domain is also activated by hydrogen peroxide. Since it is widely expressed, this TRPM2 variant may play a more general role in necrosis and apoptosis in response to oxidative stress (Hara et al, Mol.

Disease or pathology occurs when these normal physiological pathways cause additional insult or injury either as directly related to the intensity of the response, as a consequence of abnormal regulation or excessive stimulation, as a reaction to self, or as a combination of these.","Though the genesis of these diseases often involves multistep pathways and often multiple different biological systems\/pathways, intervention at critical points in one or more of these pathways can have an ameliorative or therapeutic effect. Therapeutic intervention can occur by either antagonism of a detrimental process\/pathway or stimulation of a beneficial process\/pathway.","T lymphocytes (T cells) are an important component of a mammalian immune response. T cells recognize antigens which are associated with a self-molecule encoded by genes within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). The antigen may be displayed together with MHC molecules on the surface of antigen presenting cells, virus infected cells, cancer cells, grafts, etc. The T cell system eliminates these altered cells which pose a health threat to the host mammal. T cells include helper T cells and cytotoxic T cells. Helper T cells proliferate extensively following recognition of an antigen-MHC complex on an antigen presenting cell. Helper T cells also secrete a variety of cytokines, i.e., lymphokines, which play a central role in the activation of B cells, cytotoxic T cells and a variety of other cells which participate in the immune response.","In many immune responses, inflammatory cells infiltrate the site of injury or infection. The migrating cells may be neutrophilic, eosinophilic, monocytic or lymphocytic as can be determined by histologic examination of the affected tissues. Current Protocols in Immunology, ed. John E. Coligan, 1994, John Wiley & Sons, Inc.","Many immune related diseases are known and have been extensively studied. Such diseases include immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (such as rheumatoid arthritis, immune mediated renal disease, hepatobiliary diseases, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), psoriasis, and asthma), non-immune-mediated inflammatory diseases, infectious diseases, immunodeficiency diseases, neoplasia, and graft rejection, etc.","In the area of immunology, targets were identified herein for the treatment of inflammation and inflammatory disorders. Immune related diseases could be treated by suppressing the immune response. Using neutralizing antibodies that inhibit molecules having immune stimulatory activity would be beneficial in the treatment of immune-mediated and inflammatory diseases.

The conditioned medium is pumped onto a 5 ml Protein A column (Pharmacia) which had been equilibrated in 20 mM Na phosphate buffer, pH 6.8. After loading, the column is washed extensively with equilibration buffer before elution with 100 mM citric acid, pH 3.5.

Useful examples of rational drug design may include molecules which have improved activity or stability as shown by Braxton and Wells, 31:7796-7801 (1992) or which act as inhibitors, agonists, or antagonists of native peptides as shown by Athauda et al., 113:742-746 (1993).","It is also possible to isolate a target-specific antibody, selected by functional assay, as described above, and then to solve its crystal structure. This approach, in principle, yields a pharmacore upon which subsequent drug design can be based. It is possible to bypass protein crystallography altogether by generating anti-idiotypic antibodies (anti-ids) to a functional, pharmacologically active antibody. As a mirror image of a mirror image, the binding site of the anti-ids would be expected to be an analog of the original receptor. The anti-id could then be used to identify and isolate peptides from banks of chemically or biologically produced peptides. The isolated peptides would then act as the pharmacore.","By virtue of the present invention, sufficient amounts of the PRO224, PRO9783, PRO1108, PRO34000, PRO240, PRO943, hu A33, PRO230, PRO178, PRO1199, PRO4333, PRO1336, PRO19598, PRO1083, hu TRPM2 or PRO1801 polypeptide may be made available to perform such analytical studies as X-ray crystallography.
