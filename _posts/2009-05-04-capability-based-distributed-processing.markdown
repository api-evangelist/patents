Given the current decline in rates for web page banner advertising, as well as rates for other web page advertising forms, these businesses are often unable to develop and implement sustainable business models that lead to profitability. In many cases, these Internet-focused businesses provide a service in exchange for advertising exposure which their users are willing to allow because they value the service being offered. Unfortunately, most of these business face revenue rates (e.g., advertising rates) that are declining faster than their costs (e.g., cost of services provided to users).","The present embodiments contemplate the identification of the capabilities of distributed devices connected together through a wide variety of communication systems and networks and the aggregation of these capabilities to accomplish processing, storage, broadcasting or any other desired project objective. For example, distributed devices connected to each other through the Internet, an intranet network, a wireless network, home networks, or any other network may provide any of a number of useful capabilities to third parties once their respective capabilities are identified, organized, and managed for a desired task. These distributed devices may be connected personal computer systems (PCs), internet appliances, notebook computers, servers, storage devices, network attached storage (NAS) devices, wireless devices, hand-held devices, or any other computing device that has useful capabilities and is connected to a network in any manner. Various embodiments further contemplate providing an incentive, which may be based in part upon capabilities of the distributed devices, to encourage users and owners of the distributed devices to allow the capabilities of the distributed devices to be utilized in the distributed parallel processing system of the present embodiments.","The number of usable distributed devices contemplated by various embodiments can be very large. Unlike a small local network environment, for example, as may be used by an Internet Service Provider (ISP), which may include less than 100 interconnected computers systems to perform the tasks required by the ISP, the various embodiments can utilize a multitude of widely distributed devices to provide a massively distributed processing system. With respect to the various embodiments, a multitude of distributed devices refers to greater than 1,000 different distributed devices. With respect to the various embodiments, widely distributed devices refer to a group of interconnected devices of which at least two are physically located at least 100 miles apart. With respect to the various embodiments, a massively distributed processing system is one that utilizes a multitude of widely distributed devices. The Internet is an example of a interconnected system that includes a multitude of widely distributed devices. An intranet system at a large corporation is an example of an interconnected system that includes multitude of distributed devices, and if multiple corporate sites are involved, may include a multitude of widely distributed devices. A distributed processing system according to the various embodiments that utilize such a multitude of widely distributed devices, as are available on the Internet or in a large corporate intranet, is a massively distributed processing system according to the various embodiments.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 1A","b":["100","102","102","102"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 1A","b":["108","110","112","102","118","120","122","104","106","152","102","114","116","119","124","104","108","110","112","126","104","108","110","112","108","110","112","100","108","110","112","104","104"]},"The incentives provided by the incentives block  may be any desired incentive. For example, the incentive may be a sweepstakes in which entries are given to client systems ,  . . .  that are signed up to be utilized by the distributed processing system . Other example incentives are reward systems, such as airline frequent-flyer miles, purchase credits and vouchers, payments of money, monetary prizes, property prizes, free trips, time-share rentals, cruises, connectivity services, free or reduced cost Internet access, domain name hosting, mail accounts, participation in significant research projects, achievement of personal goals, or any other desired incentive or reward.","As indicated above, any number of other systems may also be connected to the network . The element , therefore, represents any number of a variety of other systems that may be connected to the network . The other systems  may include ISPs, web servers, university computer systems, and any other distributed device connected to the network , for example, personal computer systems (PCs), internet appliances, notebook computers, servers, storage devices, network attached storage (NAS) devices, wireless devices, hand-held devices, or any other connected computing device that has useful capabilities and is connected to a network in any manner. The customer systems  represents customers that have projects for the distributed processing system, as further described with respect to . The customer systems  connect to the network  through the communication link .","It is noted that the communication links , , , ,  and  may allow for communication to occur, if desired, between any of the systems connected to the network . For example, client systems ,  . . .  may communicate directly with each other in peer-to-peer type communications. It is further noted that the communication links , , , ,  and  may be any desired technique for connecting into any portion of the network , such as, Ethernet connections, wireless connections, ISDN connections, DSL connections, modem dial-up connections, cable modem connections, fiber optic connections, direct T1 or T3 connections, routers, portal computers, as well as any other network or communication connection. It is also noted that there are any number of possible configurations for the connections for network , according to one or more embodiments. The client system  may be, for example, an individual personal computer located in someone's home and may be connected to the Internet through an Internet Service Provider (ISP). Client system  may also be a personal computer located on an employee's desk at a company that is connected to an intranet through a network router and then connected to the Internet through a second router or portal computer. Client system  may further be personal computers connected to a company's intranet, and the server systems  may also be connected to that same intranet. In short, a wide variety of network environments are contemplated by one or more embodiments on which a large number of potential client systems are connected.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 1B","b":["150","152","104","134","104","124","126","104","130","134","134"]},"Client systems , as discussed above, may be any number of different systems that are connected to the server systems  through a network , such as client systems ,  . . .  in . The client systems  send results  back to the server systems  after the client systems  complete processing any given workload. Depending upon the workload project, the server systems  may then provide results  to customer systems . The customer systems  may be, for example, an entity that desires a given project to be undertaken, and if so, provides the project details and data  to the server systems .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":"FIG. 2A","b":["108","204","208","206","204","104","204","104","102","108","118","108","204","212","202","210","206","206","104","118","102"]},"It is noted that the workload received by client system  and the processing or activity performed may depend up a variety of factors, as discussed further below. In part, this workload allocated by the server system  to each client system ,  and  may depend upon the capabilities of the client system, such as the processing power, disk storage capacity, communications types, and other capabilities available from the various components of the systems within the client system .","The server systems  can select the workloads for the client system  and may control when these workloads are performed, through operational code (i.e., an agent) residing and installed on the client system . Alternatively, the owner or user of the client system  may determine when workloads are procured or obtained from the server systems , as well as when these workloads are performed, for example, by accessing the server systems  through the network . For example, the sever system  may download to the client system  upon request one or more workloads. At the same time, an agent residing on the client system  may operate to process the workload or multiple workloads downloaded to the client system . It is noted, therefore, that the agent may be simultaneously managing more than one workload for any number of projects. When the workload is complete, the agent may inform the owner or user of the client system  the results are ready to be communicated back. The client system  may then upload results to the server system  and download new workloads, if desired. Alternatively, these logistical and operational interactions may take place automatically through control of the agent and\/or the server systems .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIG. 2B","b":["108","108","260","250","260","252","254","258","264","262"]},"It is noted, therefore, that the capabilities for client systems ,  . . .  may span the entire range of possible computing, processing, storage and other subsystems or devices that are connected to a system connected to the network . For example, these subsystems or devices may include: central processing units (CPUs), digital signal processors (DSPs), graphics processing engines (GPEs), hard drives (HDs), memory (MEM), audio subsystems (ASs), communications subsystems (CSs), removable media types (RMs), and other accessories with potentially useful unused capabilities (OAs). In short, for any given computer system connected to a network , there exists a variety of capabilities that may be utilized by that system to accomplish its direct tasks. At any given time, however, only a fraction of these capabilities are typically used on the client systems ,  . . . . The present embodiment can take advantage of these unused capabilities.","It is also noted that along with receiving the workload, the client system  will also receive an agent that manages the completion of the workload. This agent may be software that is customized for the particular computer system and processing capabilities of the client system . For example, if the client system is a personal computer as shown in , the agent may be a program that operates in the background of the computer's operating system. When the agent determines that there is unused processing or other capabilities, the agent may take advantage of it. For example, if the user is using a word processing application to create a document, little processing power is being utilized by the word processing program, leaving the computer's CPU and video processor underutilized. Thus, the agent could execute commands to these processors during dead cycles. In this way, the agent may facilitate the completion of workload processing in a reduced time. In addition, this agent may be self-updating upon connecting to the server systems , so that the agent may be kept up to date with current software revisions and workload activities. It is also noted that the agent may manage work on multiple workloads at the same time, so that any given distributed device connected to the network  may be working on a plurality of workloads at any given time.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"figref":"FIG. 2C","b":["270","270","272","108","270","272","108","272","108","108","272","130","132"]},"The client's system agent  may also include a workload engine , a statistics\/user interface\/incentive advertising block , and a workload package and update processing block . In the example shown in , workloads  pass through the security subsystem  and along line  to the workload package and update processing block . In this block , the agent  may be updated by the server systems . Alternatively, the agent  may determine, when connected to the server systems , whether it should be updated and then accomplish that updating automatically. Once the workload package is processed, the workload engine  may receive the workload following line . The workload engine  works on the workload, ultimately completing the workload. The results or status of the workload may then be sent through the security subsystem  following line . The results  may then be provided back to the server systems .","The statistics\/user interface\/incentive advertising block  may provide workload, incentive and other statistics, as well as any other desired interface features, to the user of the client system. For example, the block  may show a user the expected amount of processing time it will take for the client system to complete a workload task based upon the capabilities of the system. As also shown, the block  may receive information following lines  and  from the workload package and update processing block  and from the workload engine . If desired, security information from the security subsystem  could also be displayed to the user of the client system. It is noted that the information displayed to the user of the client system may be modified and selected as desired without departing from the claimed subject matter.","With respect to incentive advertising, the block  may also show the user of the client system how this processing time might change depending upon various possible upgrades to the capabilities of the client system, such as a faster microprocessor, more memory, more disk storage space, etc. Furthermore, the client system capabilities may be shown correlated to the incentives provided to the client system for participation. Thus, the user may be provided information as to how the user's incentives would increase or change depending upon other computer systems or upgraded capabilities the user could acquire. This incentive value increase may also be tied to upgrades to particular vendor's devices. For example, if the user's device is a computer system having an ABC microprocessor, the block  may provide the user information as to increased incentive values based upon an upgrade to a more powerful ABC microprocessor. Similarly, if the user's device is a computer system obtained from ABC, the block  may provide the user information as to increased incentive values based upon an upgrade to a more powerful ABC computer system.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"figref":["FIG. 2D","FIG. 2D"],"b":["276","276","230","230","104","276","221","222","224","226","228","244","246","248","230","221","222","224","226","228","244","246","248","276"]},"In , the processor values interface tab  is the one currently selected by the user. The processor values tab  includes example information that may be displayed to the user. Assuming that a workload is being processed by the agent client manager, the user may select the button  (Show My Incentive Values) to show the user's current incentive values associated with the workload being performed. The personal incentive values chart  (My Personal Incentive Values) may then be displayed to the user. As shown, the incentive values are provided in a relative scale from 1 to 10. The key designation  represents the incentives associated with the users current central processing unit (CPU) or microprocessor.","As indicated above, this incentive information may also be tied to the specific vendor of the user's CPU, for example, ABC Company's CPU. Thus, as shown, the key designation  (My current processor) and the corresponding bar graph portion  represent incentives for the user's current CPU (e.g., a 166 MHz processor). The key designation  represents the incentives that the user is projected to have if the user were to upgrade the CPU. In this manner, a user may be provided an incentive to increase the capabilities of the distributed device, and a vendor may be provided advertising so that the user is also directed to a particular upgrade.","Looking further to , other similar incentive related information tabs may be provided for any desired capability of the distributed device. For example, tab  (Memory Values) represents information that may be provided for the memory capabilities of the distributed device. Tab  (Graphics Values) represents information that may be provided for the graphics capabilities of the distributed device. Tab  (Communications Values) represents information that may be provided for the communication capabilities of the distributed device. Tab  (Storage Values) represents information that may be provided for the storage capabilities of the distributed device. Tab  (System Values) represents information that may be provided for the system capabilities as a whole for the distributed device.","In addition to these incentive related information tabs, other tabs may be included to provide information and control for any desired features of the agent client manager. For example, the tab  (Current: Prime Search) represents information that may be displayed to the user about the current workload being performed by the agent client manager, for example, a search for large prime numbers. The tab  (Settings) represents information that may be displayed to the user about various settings for the client agent manager. In particular, the tab  may provide the user the ability to control any desired aspect of the operation of the agent client manager. For example, the user may be able to select a portion of the capabilities that may be utilized (e.g., a maximum of 20% of the system memory), the types of workloads that may be performed (e.g., only scientific research projects), the times when the agent may utilize system resources (e.g., only between 12 to 6 am, or only when the system is idle), or any other desired operational feature. It is noted that in addition to upgrade incentive information indicated above, the user may also be provided information as to how incentives would increase if the user allocated or changed the settings for the agent client manager.","This user selection of operational features allows for workloads to be scheduled or balanced based upon user input and desires. These user vectors, as indicated above, would allow users to dedicate their device capabilities to specific research projects (e.g., cancer, Parkinson's disease, Internet, genetics, space science, etc.), to specific non-profit or for profit organizations (e.g., Greenpeace, Celera, etc.), educational institutions (e.g., University of Texas), a specific group of likeminded users, or any other entity or endeavor. This affiliation selection allows the distributed processing system to automatically include a user's device capabilities in a pool dedicated to the chosen affiliation. Additionally, a user could choose to mix various percentages and allocations of device capabilities among multiple affiliations. It is noted that the user does not have to make any affiliation selection and may not allocate 100 percent of device capabilities. Rather, only a portion of the device capabilities may be allocated to a particular affiliation, leaving the remainder non-allocated and not affiliated. The capability allocation may also be a system-wide (i.e., course) allocation, such as some desired percent of overall device capabilities. The capabilities allocation may also be subsystem specific (i.e., fine) allocation, such as allocation of particular subsystem capabilities to particular affiliations.","Now looking to , the server systems  may be one or more computer systems that operate to identify client system capabilities, organize workloads, and utilize client systems to accomplish a desired task. The server systems  includes a control system  a workload database , and a sweepstakes system , as discussed more below. The workload database  stores any desired project task, which may be broken up into discrete workload tasks WL, WL . . . WLN, as represented by elements ,  . . . . The workload database may also store one or more benchmark workloads (BWL)  that may be utilized to determine client system capabilities in response to a standard workload. Through line , the workload database  communicates with control system . Control system , for example, receives original workload  and transfers it to the interface  through line . The interface  then transfers the workload  to the network  through line . This workload  is ultimately received as workload  by client system ,  or , as shown in . The result  is ultimately received by the control system  through interface  and line .","In allocating workloads, the control system  may consider the capabilities of the client systems ,  and  to which the control system  is sending workloads. For example, if client  has more processing power than client , the control system  may allocate and send more difficult or larger workloads. Thus, client  may receive WL  and WL , while client  would only receive WL. Alternatively, the workload database  could be organized with differing levels of processing power or capability requirements for each workload. In this way, WL  may represent a greater processing or system capability requirement than WL . It should be noted that workload may be a processing task, a data storage task, or tied to any other of a variety of capabilities that may be utilized on the client systems ,  . . . .","As indicated above, to encourage owners or users of client systems to allow their system capabilities to be utilized by control system , an incentive system may be utilized. This incentive system may be designed as desired. Incentives may be provided to the user or owner of the clients systems when the client system is signed-up to participate in the distributed processing system, when the client system completes a workload for the distributed processing system, or any other time during the process. In addition, incentives may be based upon the capabilities of the client systems, based upon a benchmark workload that provides a standardized assessment of the capabilities of the client systems, or based upon any other desired criteria.","One example use of a benchmark workload is to use the benchmark workload to determine incentive values. For example, the server systems  may be designed to send out a standard benchmark workload once an hour to each client system ,  . . . . If a client system is not available at that time for any reason, the workload would not be completed by the client system, and there would be no incentive value generated for that client system. In this example, the benchmark workload may be a timed work-set that would exercise each subsystem with capabilities within the client system that was desired to be measured. A more capable client system would then generate greater incentive values from executing the benchmark workload, as compared to a lesser capable client system. These incentive values may be utilized as desired to determine what the client system should get in return for its efforts. For example, if the incentive were a sweepstakes as discussed further below, the number of entries in the sweepstakes may be tied to the system's performance of the benchmark workload. Thus, the faster or better the client system performs the benchmark workload, the more entries the client system would receive.","In the embodiment shown in , the server systems  may include a sweepstakes system  that functions with control system  to provide incentives for the users or owners of client systems ,  and  to allow their system capabilities to be used by the server systems . The control system  may determine a sweepstakes entry value  that is sent along line  to the sweepstakes system . The sweepstakes system  may then receive sweepstakes entry  and provide it to the sweepstakes engine  through line . The sweepstakes engine  may process the entries and determine a winner, when desired. In the embodiment shown, therefore, entries to the sweepstakes may be generated each time a unit of work is accomplished by one or more of the subsystems within a client system ,  or  via an agent installed on the device for the purposes of managing and completing units of work. The total entries for any period of time would, therefore, be dynamic depending on how many are received. Odds of winning would then be determined by the total number of entries received and the total number of entries contributable to any given entrant.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0073","num":"0072"},"figref":["FIG. 3B","FIG. 2D"],"b":["300","104","152","134","340","104","346","344","342","243","245","245","243","134","104","134"]},"The customer systems , which represent customers that have projects that they desired to be processed by the distributed processing system, may be connected to the project pre-processing subsystem  to provide projects to the servers systems . These projects are processed by the project pre-processing subsystem  and passed to the results\/workloads production subsystem , which produces and sends out workloads  and receives back results . The analytic system  then takes the results and processes them as desired. Completed project information may then be provided from the analytic system  to the customer systems . In this manner, the projects of the customer systems  may be processed and project results reported by the distributed processing system in one or more embodiments. Also, as shown, the workloads  and the results , or other tasks of the server systems , may be processed and handled by out-sourced host systems , if desired. Thus, some or all of the workloads  may be sent first to out-sourced host systems . Out-sourced host systems  then send workloads A to the client systems  and receive back results A. The out-sourced host systems  then send the results  back to the server systems . It is noted that this out-sourcing of server system tasks may be implemented as desired for any given task that the server systems  may have. It is further noted that, if desired, the server systems  may perform all of the desired functions of the server systems  so that no out-sourced host systems  would be used.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0075","num":"0074"},"figref":"FIG. 3C","b":["350","360","130","132","354","360","352","356","356","352","558","350"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0076","num":"0075"},"figref":"FIG. 3D","b":["350","356","360","352","358","354"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0077","num":"0076"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","104","402","104","402","418","104","404","420","406","104","108","110","112","406","104","108","110","112","104","408"]},"At this point, control passes along line  to the \u201cdetermine sweepstakes entries\u201d block . In this block , the server system  determines the entry value for the workload completed or for a standard benchmark or entry workload completed. This entry value may be weighted upon a variety of factors including factors such as the amount of work completed, the difficulty level of the processing required, and the accuracy of the results. It is noted that any desired weighting may be utilized. Thus, it is understood that a wide variety of considerations may be utilized to determine the entry value weighting for the sweepstakes.","Although the weighting determination is shown in block  in , the entry value may also be determined, in whole or in part, when a client system signs on to the distributed processing distributed system of one or more embodiments. For example, if a client system has state-of-the-art CPU, video processor, DSP engine, memory, and large amounts of free disk storage space, a high entry value may be allocated to this client system up-front. In contrast, a client system that has a slow CPU, a weak video processor, no DSP engine, little memory, and little free disk storage space may be allocated a small entry value. In this way, the owners or users of the client systems may be provided immediate feedback as to the potential sweepstakes entry value of their computer systems, devices and system capabilities.","It is further noted that the entry value may take any desired form and may be, for example, a multiplier that will be used for each unit of workload completed. In this way, the owner or user will readily be cognizant that a state-of-the-art system will yield a high multiplier, where as an older system, system capability or device will yield a low multiplier. Such feedback, whether communicated to the owner or user immediately upon signing up or upon completion of each workload, will create an incentive for owners and\/or users to acquire state-of-the-art systems, thereby further increasing the potential processing power of the distributed processing system of one or more embodiments. In addition, different workload projects may be designated with different entry values, as well. For example, some workload projects may require particular hardware or software processing systems within a client system or device. Thus, the number of client systems that are capable of performing the task would be limited. To further encourage participation by those owners or users with capable systems, the entry value for taking on particular workloads and\/or systems with the desired features may be allocated higher entry values.","Referring back to , control passes along line  to the \u201cprocess entries\u201d block . In this block , the sweepstakes entries are processed and stored as desired. Following line , \u201cend of entry period\u201d decision block  represents a determination of whether the time for getting entries into the sweepstakes has ended. If not, the control continues to line  and back to blocks ,  and\/or , depending upon what is desired. Once the entry period has ended, control flows along line  to \u201cdetermine winners\u201d block . The server system  then identifies from among the entries, who the winning client system or systems will be.","The entry period may be any desired time frame and may include multiple overlapping time frames, as desired. For example, winners may be determined daily for entries each day, monthly for entries within a month, and\/or yearly for entries within one year. In addition, special entry periods may be generated, if desired, for example where a particularly important workload project had a short time frame in which it is to be completed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0083","num":"0082"},"figref":["FIGS. 1A-B","FIG. 3A","FIG. 4"],"b":["2","3","4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0084","num":"0083"},"figref":["FIGS. 6A and 6B","FIGS. 5A and 5B","FIGS. 7A and 7B","FIG. 8"],"b":"104"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0085","num":"0084"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 10","FIGS. 11A and 11B","FIGS. 12A and 12B","FIGS. 13A and 13B","FIG. 14A","FIG. 14B","FIG. 15"],"b":"20"},"Looking now to , block diagram is depicted of a distributed processing system  for a network site indexing application, according to one or more embodiments.

Each network site  . . .  may have a variety of different content types that may be indexed, ranging from complex sites to relatively simple sites. For example, network site  includes text A, images B, audio streams C, video streams D, files E and other content F. Network site  is less complex and includes text A, images B, and other content C. Both network sites  and  are connected to the network  through communication lines  and , respectively.","As discussed above, the server systems  manage workloads for the client systems ,  . . . . The client systems ,  . . .  process these workloads and produce indexing results. The resulting index may be stored at a centrally managed site, such as central index storage block , or may itself be distributed over the possibly millions of indexing clients , , . . . , as shown by remote index storage blocks , , . . . . If remote index storage is utilized, a master database content index may be stored locally, for example, in the central index storage block . This content index may then direct relevant searches to the distributed massively parallel engine for search queries.","Referring now to , a functional block diagram is shown for a network site indexing operation  according to one or more embodiments. As described in  with respect to other systems , there may be any number of computer and processing systems connected to the network . Any one of these others systems  may publish information on the network  for access by any other system connected to the network . This information to be indexed may take a wide variety of forms, including, for example, text, images, audio streams, video streams, databases, spreadsheets, PDF files, Shockwave data, Flash data, applications, data files, chat streams, or any other information, data or data streams that may be accessible on a network site. The distributed processing system of one or more embodiments may have as a workload the task of indexing this potentially massive amount of information.","For example, where the network  is the Internet or a large intranet, a large amount of processing power and time can be used to create an accurate, complete and up-to-date index of the information. The Internet uses an IP (Internet Protocol) address protocol to direct traffic around the Internet. The IP address is the address of a computer attached to a TCP\/IP (Transmission Control Protocol\/Internet Protocol) network. Every system on the network must have a unique IP address. IP addresses are typically written as four sets of numbers separated by periods. The TCP\/IP packet uses 32 bits to contain the IP address, which is made up of a network and host address (NETID and HOSTID). The more bits used for network address, the fewer remain for hosts. Web pages within a particular web site with a unique address may be addressed through URLs (Uniform Resource Locator) associated with that web site. In short, there is a limited, but very large, number of possible IP addresses for uniquely identifiable Internet sites that may be accessed and analyzed to generate an index of Internet sites and web pages via URLs.","The operation diagram of  starts with the \u201cclients receive indexing workloads\u201d block . In this block, the system server  provides the clients systems ,  . . .  with a workload task to index a portion of the information accessible on the network . For example, with the Internet, each workload may be single EP address or groups of URLs or, in some cases, large data types contained on single sites or pages. Following line , the \u201cclients interact with other systems\u201d block  represents the operation of the agent installed on the client systems , , . . .  to access the network sites, according to the assigned workload, and index the information accessible on that site. This indexing may include all types of information accessible on that site, including text, audio, image, video, etc.","Next, following lines  and , the client systems , , and  completes the workload tasks, get the results ready for transmission, and sends those results back to the system server  in \u201cclients complete workload\u201d block  and \u201cindexing results sent to server system\u201d block . Control passes along line  to \u201cindex compiled for use\u201d block  where the server system formats and\/or compiles the results for use. For example, the index results may be utilized for accurate, complete and up-to-date search information for the network . As indicated with respect to , the resulting index may be stored remotely or locally following line . Thus, element  represents remote storage of the index and element  represents central storage of the index. It is noted that the index may also be stored with a mixture of central and remote storage, as desired. In addition, as indicated above, a directory or summary index for the resulting index may be generated and stored centrally, if desired. It is further noted that the summary index may be stored in any other desired fashion, for example, it may be distributed and stored on a number of client systems.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0092","num":"0091"},"figref":"FIG. 6A","b":["104","304","308","620","308","1","2","1","11","12","1","640","642","644","2","21","22","2","646","648","650","3","31","32","3","652","654","656"]},"It may be expected that different workload projects WL, WL . . . WLN within the workload database  may require widely varying processing requirements. Thus, in order to better direct resources to workload projects, the server system may access various system vectors when a client system signs up to provide processing time and other system or device capabilities to the server system. This capability scheduling helps facilitate project operation and completion. In this respect, the capability vector database  keeps track of any desired feature of client systems or devices in capability vectors CBV , CBV . . . CBVN, represented by elements ,  . . . , respectively. These capability vectors may then be utilized by the control system  through line  to capability balance workloads.","This capability scheduling according to one or more embodiments, therefore, allows for the efficient management of the distributed processing system.

For example, utilizing the operating system or software vectors, workloads may be scheduled or managed so that desired hardware and software configurations are utilized. This scheduling based upon software vectors may be helpful because different software versions often have different capabilities. For example, various additional features and services are included in MICROSOFT WINDOWS '98\u00ae as compared with MICROSOFT WINDOWS '95\u00ae. Any one of these additional functions or services may be desired for a particular workload that is to be hosted on a particular client system device. Software and operating system vectors also allow for customers to select a wide variety of software configurations on which the customers may desire a particular workload to be run. These varied software configurations may be helpful, for example, where software testing is desired. Thus, the distributed processing system of one or more embodiments may be utilized to test new software, data files, Java programs or other software on a wide variety of hardware platforms, software platforms and software versions. For example, a Java program may be tested on a wide proliferation of JREs (Java Runtime Engines) associated with a wide variety of operating systems and machine types, such as personal computers, handheld devices, etc.","From the customer system perspective, the capability management and the capability database, as well as information concerning users of the distributed devices, provide a vehicle through which a customer may select particular hardware, software, user or other configurations, in which the customer is interested. In other words, utilizing the massively parallel distributed processing system of one or more embodiments, a wide variety of selectable distributed device attributes, including information concerning users of the distributed devices, may be provided to a customer with respect to any project, advertising, or other information or activity a customer may have to be processed or distributed.","For example, a customer may desire to advertise certain goods or services to distributed devices that have certain attributes, such as particular device capabilities or particular characteristics for users of those distributed devices. Based upon selected attributes, a set of distributed devices may be identified for receipt of advertising messages. These messages maybe displayed to a user of the distributed device through a browser, the client agent, or any other software that is executing either directly or remotely on the distributed device. Thus, a customer may target particular machine specific device or user attributes for particular advertising messages. For example, users with particular demographic information may be targeted for particular advertisements. As another example, the client agent running on client systems that are personal computers may determine systems that are suffering from numerous page faults (i.e., through tracking operating system health features such as the number of page faults). High numbers of page faults are an indication of low memory. Thus, memory manufactures could target such systems for memory upgrade banners or advertisements.","Still further, if a customer desires to run a workload on specific device types, specific hardware platforms, specific operating systems, etc., the customer may then select these features and thereby select a subset of the distributed client systems on which to send a project workload. Such a project would be, for example, if a customer wanted to run a first set of simulations on personal computers with AMD ATHLON\u00ae microprocessors and a second set of simulations on personal computers with INTEL PENTIUM III\u00ae microprocessors. Alternatively, if a customer is not interested in particular configurations for the project, the customer may simply request any random number of distributed devices to process its project workloads.","Customer pricing levels for distributed processing may then be tied, if desired, to the level of specificity desired by a particular customer. For example, a customer may contract for a block of 10,000 random distributed devices for a base amount. The customer may later decide for an additional or different price to utilize one or more capability vectors in selecting a number of devices for processing its project. Further, a customer may request that a number of distributed devices be dedicated solely to processing its project workloads. In short, once device attributes, including device capabilities and user information, are identified, according to one or more embodiments, any number of customer offerings may be made based upon the device attributes for the connected distributed devices. It is noted that to facilitate use of the device capabilities and user information, capability vectors and user information may be stored and organized in a database, as discussed above.","Referring now to , a block diagram depicts a distributed processing system  that allows customers to select client system attributes, such as device capabilities and user characteristics, according to one or more embodiments. In this embodiment, the network  is depicted as the Internet to which server systems , customer A, customer B, and client systems A, B . . . C are connected. These systems are connected through communication links , A, B, A, B . . . C, respectively.

The client systems A represent client systems that include a first set (Set ) of desired attributes. The client systems B represent client systems that include a second set (Set ) of desired attributes. And the client systems C represent client systems that include a Nth set (Set N) of desired attributes. Once attributes are selected, the client systems with those attributes may be accessed as desired by customers A  and B. For example, customer A may send its advertisement to client systems B. Customer B may send its advertisement to client systems A. The project A from customer A may be processed by client systems C. And the project B from customer B may be processed by client systems B.

In addition, the server systems and clients systems may be interconnected by a variety of possible connection interfaces, for example, Ethernet connections, wireless connections, ISDN connections, DSL connections, modem dial-up connections, cable modem connections, direct T1 or T3 connections, fiber optic connections, routers, portal computers, as well as any other network or communication connection. It is noted, therefore, as discussed with respect to other embodiments such as the embodiment of  A, that systems may be coupled into an interconnected fabric in any of a variety of ways and communications can potentially occur directly or indirectly between any of the systems coupled into the fabric, as would be understood by those of skill in the art.","Within this environment, as depicted in , server systems  are interconnected with any number of client systems, for example, client systems A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, , J, K, and L. In addition, these client systems may also include idle client systems A,  B, and C, as discussed further below. Furthermore, these client systems may include client system A with a component A, client system B with a component B, and client system C with a component C. It is also noted that the interconnection fabric may include any number of devices that are not client systems, in that they themselves are not providing components or processing capabilities for the distributed processing  system of one or more embodiments. Nevertheless, these devices may be considered part of the system because they may relay, interpret, process or otherwise transmit or receive information from or to client systems that are part of the distributed processing system.","Aggregation of component level resources, according to one or more embodiments, will now be discussed. As described above, the capabilities of client systems are determined for purposes of allocating, scheduling and managing distributed processing workloads. In other words, each of the client systems may be made up of many individual subsystems with various capabilities. In some cases, it may occur that particular components on different machines may provide added value if combined or aggregated. Thus, utilizing subsystem or component level resources from a heterogeneous group of devices may be the most efficient or otherwise advantageous way of taking advantage of these resources to complete various desired tasks.","Referring now more particularly to , the client systems A, B, and C may have component A, component B and component C, respectively, that are better utilized in combination. For example, client system A may have a fast processor, a high-speed network connection, but little available storage space. Client system B may have large amounts of available free storage space but little processing power. Client system C may also have a fast processor, but relatively little available storage space. In this example, a workload that requires both a large storage capacity and a fast processor may be efficiently completed by dedicating component level resources to various parts of the workload from different machines. Thus, the workload may be managed by having client systems A and C processing data stored on and transmitted from client system B. Once clients systems A and C process data, this resulting data may then be transmitted back to client system B for aggregation and eventual transmission back to the server systems . The client system B, therefore, essentially acts as a server for a workload subset, sending out portions of a subset workload, receiving back the processed data, and aggregating the data to build a completed workload subset.","It is noted that any number of different components from different client systems may be aggregated, as desired. For example, for wireless devices, DSP processing and storage components could be aggregated with components from other client systems. For display devices, graphics rendering power could be aggregated. For relatively dumb machines, such as connected household appliances, vending machines, etc., slow-speed processing components could be aggregated. In short, an appropriate workload may include instructions to numerous client systems that will enable collaboration and aggregation of component level resources. Such instructions may include things, such as, where to receive input, where to send output, and ultimately which client systems return final results.","It is further noted that the control instructions may be de-centralized as well. In other words, as indicated above, client systems may communicate directly with each other, for example, in a peer-to-peer fashion. In this way, workload communications may occur directly between client systems, and workload control and management may occur through the client system agents located on client systems.","Still referring to , idle system determination will now be discussed. As stated above, client system capabilities are determined and utilized within the distributed processing system of one or more embodiments. The more time any particular client system is idle, the more processing it is arguably able to accomplish, and the more incentives it is likely to receive. In other words, the client system capabilities may be utilized more often and more intensely if the client system is idle more frequently. As such, it is advantageous to identify idle client systems and allocate them to more processor and time sensitive tasks. By identifying these idle client systems, resources available on the network at any given time may be more fully utilized, and otherwise idle resources may be utilized for highly intensive, real-time activities that would otherwise require dedicated devices. Examples of such real-time activities include data caching, indexing, etc. In , idle client systems are designated as A, B, and C.","Identifying idle resources may be determined in any of a variety of ways. It is possible, for example, to simply look at whether a machine is not being used or has low processor utilization at any given time. This simple determination, however, may not yield an accurate picture of how idle a client system may or may not be over a given time period. More particularly, discovery methods may be implemented to identify the activity of a variety of client system components and subsystems. For example, subsystems may be monitored, such as network activity, device output activity, user input, processing activity, executing task monitoring, or mode of operation parameters (e.g., mobile or power management modes, stationary or powered mode). In addition, any number of other device vectors may be monitored or analyzed to determine the true usage and idleness of a client system.","The following TABLE 2 provides a list of idleness vectors or factors that may be utilized in determining the level of device usage or idleness. In particular, TABLE 2 provides two primary categories of activities to monitor or analyze for determination of how idle a client system may or may not be. These activities are user activity and device activity. By monitoring, analyzing, and tracking these client system elements and activities over time, a better determination of device usage and idleness may be made. It is noted that the list provided in TABLE 2 is an example list, and any number of categories, vectors or factors may be identified and utilized, as desired, according to one or more embodiments.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0121","num":"0120"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"273pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE

Server systems  may have, for example, a large, intensive task that it would like to place on these idle devices. After using a number of the vectors in TABLE 2 to determine the utilization level for client systems, the server systems  determines that client systems A, B, and C are idle and capable of handling significant time sensitive processing tasks. For example, idle client systems A, B and C may be personal computers that can act as a local interne cache for other connected devices, such as some of the other client systems depicted in , that are interested in a data type that benefits from a local network cache.","Thus, data or content may be transmitted from a remote network site to the idle machines A, B, and C. These idle devices A, B, and C may then re-transmit this same data or content to other connected devices also interested in the data or content. One example for such network caching is Internet video or multimedia broadcast events that are desired to be viewed or received by a very large number of geographically close connected devices\u2022 at about the same time. In order to meet the demand of these connected devices, web sites broadcasting an event have to be able to handle a huge increase in network traffic over a short period of time. By locally caching the transmission to idle client systems, a web site can reduce the direct demand on its own resources. This is so because other connected devices may receive a re-transmitted broadcast, although delayed, from the idle client system. It is noted that according to one or more embodiments idle client systems A, B and C may work independently or in combination. Even though idle client systems are suited for providing the caching function, it is also noted that that network caching may be accomplished using one or more client systems regardless of their respective levels of idleness.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0124","num":"0123"},"figref":"FIG. 10","b":["270","1010","1006","1004","1002","1008","1012","1014","1016","1018","1020","270","1010","1006","1022","1022","1010","104","104"]},"Still referring to , the workload processor  includes a machine entry generation subsystem .

Customers and their respective task or project developers may utilize the task developer subsystem  to access information within database systems  and modules within the server systems , such as the version\/phase control subsystem , the task module and work unit manager , and the workload information . Customers may also check project results, add new work units, check defect reports, or accomplish any other customer or developer interface option made available, as desired.","Advantageously, the customer or developer may provide the details of the project to be processed, including specific program code and algorithms that will process the data, in addition to any data to be processed. In the embodiment shown in , this program code takes the form of a task module  within the workload, while the data takes the form of work unit . These two portions make up the project or workload component  of each client agent . For a given project, the task module  will likely remain relatively constant, except for version updates, patches or phase modifications, while the work unit  will likely change each time processing of the data that it represents is completed. The project or workload component  runs in conjunction with the base distributed processing system component . When a different customer or project is started on a given client system, the project or workload component  will typically be replaced, while the base distributed processing system component  will likely remain relatively constant, except for version updates, patches or other modifications made for the distributed processing system.","Information sent from the servers systems  to the client agents A, B . . . C may include task modules, data for work units, and advertising information. Information sent from the client agents A, B . . . C to the server systems  may include user information, system information and capabilities, current task module version and phase information, and results. The database systems  may hold any relevant information desired, such as workload information (WL)  and client capability vectors (CV) .

And  provide detailed block diagrams of an embodiment of security measures for the servers systems and the client systems.","Referring to , an embodiment  of a distributed processing system is depicted. Server system  includes a security subsystem  through which communications to and from the server systems  may be made secure. Client systems A, B . . . C and client systems D, E . . . F represent any number of client systems that may communicate with server systems  or with each other. Each of the client systems A, B, C, D, E, and F include a security subsystem A, B, C, D, E, and F, respectively. The electronic information  represents information that the server systems  is to communicate to client systems A, B, C, D, E, and F in a secure manner, so that no unintended or intercepting recipient may understand or tamper with the electronic information , and so that no third party may insert non-authorized information into the distributed processing system . Although not shown, it is understood that any one of the client systems A, B, C, D, E, and F may have electronic information that is to be securely sent to the server systems  or to any other of the client systems A, B, C, D, E, and F.","Electronic information  represents information that is communicated to facilitate the operations of the distributed processing system . Such information includes the client agents that are downloaded to each client system, the workload applications for any given workload, and any work unit that will be processed by a client system. Electronic information  may also be any type of information to be sent or received within the distributed processing system, such as text, images, audio streams, video streams, databases, spreadsheets, PDF files, Shockwave data, Flash data, applications, data files, chat streams, or any other information, data or data streams. In addition, electronic information may be sent by client systems A, B, C, D, E, and F to the server systems  and\/or any of the other client systems.","The Certificate Authority (CA) block  within the server systems  represents an entity that helps to ensure validity of encryption and decryption codes. For example, within a public\/private key encryption environment, a Certificate Authority may help ensure that a public key alleged to be from a particular entity is in fact legitimately from that entity. One third-party entity that performs this CA function on the Internet is VeriSign, Inc. Having a third-party perform the CA function can be advantageous in a transaction or communication between non-trusted entities. For example, the sending entity provides its public key information to the third-party CA, which verifies the information and creates a certificate that includes the sending entity's public key information. This certificate may then be encrypted and signed by the third-party CA. The receiving entity may then obtain the certificate from the third-party CA and decrypt it with the third-party CA's public key. The receiving party will then have the sending party's public key and be fairly secure that it is a legitimate public key from the sending party.","As shown in , the CA functionality may be part of the server systems , such that the server systems  act as their own Certificate Authority with respect to client systems A, B, C, D, E, and F and any other devices that are part of the distributed processing system. A third-party CA may not be used as much in this distributed processing environment because the server systems  primarily direct the operations of the distributed processing system. Thus, a third-party entity may or may not provide a CA function. It is noted that CA functionality may be provided only by the servers systems , only by third-party CAs, or any combination of server systems  and third party CAs, as desired for a particular embodiment. In addition, if desired, no CA functionality could be provided so that secure communications between the server systems  and the devices within the distributed processing system were conducted without the use of a Certificate Authority.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0160","num":"0159"},"figref":"FIG. 17A","b":["1700","108","104","1700","108","270","1702","104","1710","108","270","1704","104","1718","104","1706","108","1712","108","104","104","108","1714","1708","1546","1710","1712","1714","104","1716","1718","1720","1546","308","620"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0161","num":"0160"},"figref":["FIG. 17B","FIG. 17B"],"b":["1750","1704","1706","1708","108","104","1756","1754","1752","108","104"]},"In operation, the server system  may secure the download of the client agent  to the client system  by requiring that the client system  download the client agent  from the client agent download site . As part of the server authentication sequence, the download site  will send back an identifier to assure users that they are indeed connected to the proper server systems . This identifier may be, for example, a CA certificate, but may be any other identifier, as desired. Because it is desirable to have the client agent running on as many distributed devices as possible for the distributed processing system of one or more embodiments, user authentication may not be required to download the client agent  from the download site .","Once a client system  has downloaded and installed the client agent , the client system  will communicate with the application server  to begin working within the distributed processing system. For these communications, server and client authentication may be required to help ensure security. To accomplish this authentication, for example, two-way authentication may be utilized. To provide a public\/private key combination for the client agent  , each client agent  that is downloaded by a client system  may have embedded within its code a default identifier and a default public\/private key pair. Thus, the server systems  may use secure network protocols (such as SSL or similar schemes) to authenticate each client system , and each client system  may use compatible protocols to authenticate each server application with which it communicates. These applications, for example, may include the functionality provided by blocks  and , and, therefore, the communications  and  would utilize authentication.","As an alternative to embedding a public\/private key combination and associated identifiers or certificates into the client agent , the public\/private key pairs may be dynamically generated in block . For example, at start-up, at reboot or at some desired time or event, the client system  may generate a new public\/private key pair. When the client system  next communicates with the server systems , the client system  request a certificate from the server systems . The server systems  may then act as a Certificate Authority (CA) and provide a CA certificate to the client system . This dynamic certificate generation, therefore, allows for added security by allowing each client system  to have its own public\/private key pair for secure network protocol communications and by having this key pair change at some desired recurring event for the client system , such as reboot.","The client system  may initiate communications with the server systems  by logging on to the authentication server, which may be part of block . The user may be prompted to enter a valid e-mail address and\/or password, if already registered, or may be asked to register if the e-mail address and\/or password are not recognized. Once registration is completed, a password may be e-mailed back to the user to provide validation of the user. If authentication is successful when a user logs into the server systems , the server systems  may provide a host-ID, a user-ID, and a session key for any given communication session.","It is also desirable that once a user has successfully registered, the user may install the client agent  on any number of other host or user systems without interacting with that systems network browser, other than to set host-specific preferences. For example, when downloaded, the client agent  may take the form of a self-extracting program that installs appropriate files to the client system , including the proper host and user identifications. In addition, to help ensure proper identification, the session keys may be exchanged each time the client system  communicates with the server systems . For example, the client system  may communicate its current session key to the server systems  each time it communicates with the server systems . The server systems  will then send a new session key for the client system  to utilize for the next session. In this way, stale identification information may be reduced. In addition to this security feature, communications may also be encrypted and decrypted with various encryption techniques, as desired.","Referring now to , one embodiment will be discussed for a security model utilizing public\/private key encryption. This security model utilizes a third-party CA to provide a CA certificate for the server systems .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0168","num":"0167"},"figref":"FIG. 18A","b":["1800","104","1602","108","1602","1602","1802","1830","1826","1802","1804","1806","1830","1826","1822","108","1822","108","104","1808","104","108","1824"]},"A third path begins with block  where a hash value is calculated for non-encrypted electronic information . This hash value is then encrypted in block  with the server private key. Next, this encrypted hash value is sent to the client system  in block . The arrow  represents the encrypted hash value for the non-encrypted electronic information. A fourth path, and the last depicted in the embodiment  of , flows from block  to block , where the hash value is partitioned into N different portions. These N different portions are designated for N different client systems , as well as any client systems  receiving a redundant distribution of any one of the N different portions. In block , the N different hash value portions are encrypted with the server private key. Next, the N different encrypted hash value portions are sent in block  to N different client systems , as well as being sent to client systems  receiving redundant distributions of the hash value portions. The arrows  represent the distribution of the N different hash value portions. It is noted that redundant distribution of the N hash value portions is desirable because, as discussed below with respect to , when the hash value is reconstructed by a client system , it is desirable to have multiple sources for each portion in case one of the receiving client systems is not available at any given time.","Looking now to , the corresponding security procedures implemented by client system  are discussed. Initially, at block , the client system  receives CA certificate  containing the server public key and the server identity. It is again noted that other unique identifiers may be utilized instead of CA certificates, as described above. If a CA certificate is utilized, this CA certificate may be provided from a third-party Certificate Authority (CA) or from the server systems  or any other desired source. In block , the client system  verifies the accuracy of the CA certificate using the CA's public key. If this verification is not successful, the client system  may wait some period of time before retrying. In addition, the time period may be a random period of time. In addition, as discussed with respect to , the client system  will login to the server systems . If this authentication is not successful in this login, the client system will notify the user of the system and the server systems , and then wait for some period of time or a random amount of time before attempting to re-verify.","In block , the client system  receives the encrypted information . Next, the client system  creates a hash value for the encrypted information in block . This hash value can be calculated using the same algorithm utilized by the server systems  in generating the hash value for the encrypted information in block  of . Once the client system  has calculated the hash value for the encrypted information, this hash value  is sent to the server systems in block . As discussed above, a pass\/fail response  is sent back by the server systems . This hash check evaluation is received in block . If the check was a FAIL, flow passes to block  where the client system  sends out a notice to the server systems  and any other client system to which it is attached that a problem has been encountered. The client system  then ends the current connection with the server systems . It is noted that the client system  may retry several times before moving onto block , and that the reporting scheme may be modified, altered or developed as desired.","If the hash check evaluation was a PASS, flow passes to block  where the electronic information is decrypted with the server public key, which was verified in block . A hash value is then calculated for the electronic information . Again, the hash generation algorithm can be the same as that used by the server systems  in creating the hash value in block  of . Next, the hash value is sent from block  to block , where it is compared with two other hash value calculations. One of the other hash values comes from a path that begins with block , in which the client system  receives the encrypted hash value  for the non-encrypted information. In block , the encrypted hash value is decrypted with the server public key. The hash value is then sent to block . The third hash value for block  comes from a path that utilizes the N different hash portions sent out by the server systems in block  of . In block , the client system receives a portion A of the partitioned hash value . In addition to one of the partitioned hash values, it is noted that the server systems  will also send information providing the identity and source for the N\u22121 other hash value portions. In block , the client system  decrypts the portion A with the server public key. Next, in block , the client system  resolves the identity of the source for the N\u22121 other portions, which may be N1 other client systems. In block , the client system  obtains the N\u22121 other portions, and assembles the N partitions into a hash value for the non-encrypted electronic information in block . The resulting hash value is then sent to block . It is noted, as indicated above, that redundant distribution of the N portions of the partitioned hash value is desirable so that unavailability of one client system will not cause another client system to be unable to re-assemble the N different portions.","Once the three hash values are received in block  from three different sources, they are compared to see if they match. If this check is a FAIL, flow moves to block , where the client system  sends out a notice to the server systems  and any other client system to which it is attached that a problem has been encountered. The client system  may also inform the client systems from which it received the N\u22121 other portions, and the client system  may retry the procedures, if desired. In addition, once a client system  is notified of a potential problem, the client system  may download a special check file from the server systems  to make sure that the server systems have not been compromised. If still a FAIL, the client system  then ends the current connection with the server systems . If the check is a PASS, the electronic information is utilized, as represented by block .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0174","num":"0173"},"figref":"FIGS. 19 and 20"},"Looking first at , a block diagram is depicted for a distributed processing system  and an environment  in which network service providers are enabled to monetize their user bases. Environment  includes a distributed processing system , a customer , and a third-party network service provider . The customer  represents an entity that has a project  that the customer  would like processed by the distributed computing system . In return for processing the project data, the customer  will often make a payment . The third-party network service provider  maintains a user database  that identifies its user base  including users A, B . . . C.","The service provider  may be, for example, an Internet business that provides any of a variety of services to users, such as Internet access, e-mail, web page hosting, domain name hosting, file sharing services or any other Internet-based service. In addition, such Internet-based services may be offered for free or low cost to users, in which case the users have historically agreed to view banner or other advertisements in return for the free or low cost service. However, as stated above, advertising revenue has been subject to diminished pricing and has become an unreliable source of revenue for many Internet-based companies. To facilitate the number of projects that the distributed processing system  can take on and the speed at which these projects can be processed and completed, it is desirable to increase the amount and capabilities of the computing resources available to the distributed processing system . To the extent that the users of the service provider  represent a pool of underutilized resources, these users represent a potentially valuable resource to the distributed processing system .","According to one or more embodiments, the service provider  may realize value from its user base and thereby monetize this user base by facilitating the use by the distributed processing system  of computing resources related to these users. Thus, for example, in return for free services, the users may agree to have their respective computing resources utilized by the distributed processing system . The service provider  may then provide to the distributed processing system  the user identifications (IDs)  related to its user base in return for revenue sharing . This monetizing architecture thereby enables service providers or other entities that control or have user bases with useful processing capabilities, such as Internet-based service providers, to generate revenue from its user base, particularly in the face of falling revenue from other sources, such as advertising revenue.","The revenue sharing  may be, for example, a share of payment  relative to the amount of processing toward the project  that was completed through the use of the user resources  made available through users A, B . . . C. It is noted that the revenue sharing  may take any desired form, including but not limited to (a) upfront payments based upon attributes of the user base, such as size or processing capabilities, (b) payments based upon the number of users that become members of the distributed processing system, (c) payments based upon the types of projects processed by the user base, or (d) any other desired compensation scheme related to the value of the user base being made available by the third party.","The monetizing method focuses on the capabilities of the Internet, intranet, wireless or otherwise network connected PCs, internet appliances, notebook computers, servers, storage devices, NAS (Network Attached Storage), or any other connected computing device that could provide any of a number of useful capabilities and that is part of a underutilized user base, such as user bases of Internet-based businesses that rely on advertising or any other method of monetizing their user base in exchange for a valuable service (e.g. free internet access, email, etc.). As discussed above, these useful processing capabilities span the entire range of generic computing subsystems including: Central Processing Unit(s) (CPUs), Digital Signal Processor(s) (DSPs), Graphics Processing Engine(s) (GPEs), Hard Drive(s) (HDs), Memory (MEM), Audio Subsystem(s) (ASs), Communications Subsystem(s) (CSs), Removable Media Types (RMs), or other Add-In\/On Accessories (A\/OAs) with potentially useful unused capabilities. Market creation and potential compensation for all unused capabilities can be accomplished through the massively parallel distributed software architecture of the distributed processing system . For example, credits (revenues) would be generated each time a unit of work is accomplished by one or more of the subsystems on a user's computing device via a client agent installed on the device to manage, process and complete units of work. The total credits\/revenues generated may be, for example, dynamic depending on how many are received. Through this architecture significant revenues may be generated from the user base of the service provider where the service provider may have previously been unable to effectively monetize his user base.","It is further noted, that entity  may be any entity that has direct or indirect control over a group of users, such that the user's resources may be offered to and utilized by the distributed processing system . For example, a company with a large group of internal users that are linked to the distributed processing system  through an intranet network of computer systems or computing devices.

Once the core agent component  is installed on a user's computer, the existing third-party user interface may hook into the core agent component , thereby making the user's resources available to the distributed processing system , while maintaining the user interface the user has come to expect from the service provider.
