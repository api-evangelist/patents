No. 60\/315,357 filed Aug. 29, 2001, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to TR21, a member of the tumor necrosis factor family of receptors. More specifically, isolated nucleic acid molecules are provided encoding TR21 and variants thereof. TR21 polypeptides are also provided, as are vectors, host cells, and recombinant and synthetic methods for producing the same. The invention also relates to diagnostic and therapeutic methods using TR21 nucleic acid molecules, polypeptides and\/or TR21 agonists or antagonists, such as for example agonistic anti-TR21 antibodies, and antagonistic anti-TR21 antibodies. The invention further relates to screening methods for identifying agonists and antagonists of TR21 activity.","2. Related Art","Many biological actions, for instance, response to certain stimuli and natural biological processes, are controlled by factors, such as cytokines. Many cytokines act through receptors by engaging the receptor and producing an intra-cellular response.","For example, tumor necrosis factors (TNF) alpha and beta are cytokines, which act through TNF receptors to regulate numerous biological processes, including protection against infection and induction of shock and inflammatory disease. The TNF molecules belong to the \u201cTNF-ligand\u201d superfamily, and act together with their receptors or counter-ligands, the \u201cTNF-receptor\u201d superfamily. So far, more than ten members of the TNF ligand superfamily have been identified and more than ten members of the TNF-receptor superfamily have been characterized.","Among the ligands there are included TNF-alpha, lymphotoxin-alpha (LT-alpha, also known as TNF-beta), LT-beta (found in complex heterotrimer LT-2-beta), FasL, CD40L, CD27L, CD30L, 4-1BBL, OX40L and nerve growth factor (NGF). The superfamily of TNF receptors includes the p55TNF receptor, p75TNF receptor, TNF receptor-related protein, FAS antigen or APO-1, CD40, CD27, CD30, 4-1BB, OX40, low affinity p75 and NGF-receptor (A. Meager, 22:291\u2013295 (1994)).","Many members of the TNF-ligand superfamily are expressed by activated T-cells, implying that they are necessary for T-cell interactions with other cell types which underlie cell ontogeny and functions. (A. Meager, supra).","Considerable insight into the essential functions of several members of the TNF receptor family has been gained from the identification and creation of mutants that abolish the expression of these proteins. For example, naturally occurring mutations in the FAS antigen and its ligand cause lymphoproliferative disease (R. Watanabe-Fukunaga et al., 356:314 (1992)), perhaps reflecting a failure of programmed cell death. Mutations of the CD40 ligand cause an X-linked immunodeficiency state characterized by high levels of immunoglobulin M and low levels of immunoglobulin G in plasma, indicating faulty T-cell-dependent B-cell activation (R. C. Allen et al., 259:990 (1993)). Targeted mutations of the low affinity nerve growth factor receptor cause a disorder characterized by faulty sensory innervation of peripheral structures (K. F. Lee et al., 69:737 (1992)).","TNF alpha and LT-alpha are capable of binding to two TNF receptors (the 55- and 75-kd TNF receptors). A large number of the biological effects elicited by TNF alpha and LT-alpha are mediated through their receptors, include hemorrhagic necrosis of transplanted tumors, cytotoxicity, a role in endotoxic shock, inflammation, immunoregulation, proliferation and anti-viral responses, as well as protection against the deleterious effects of ionizing radiation. TNF alpha and LT-alpha are involved in the pathogenesis of a wide range of diseases, including endotoxic shock, cerebral malaria, tumors, autoimmune disease, AIDS and graft-host rejection (B. Beutler and C. Von Huffel, 264:667\u2013668 (1994)). Mutations in the p55 receptor cause increased susceptibility to microbial infection.","Moreover, a domain of about 80 amino acids near the C-terminus of TNFR1 (p55) and Fas was reported as the \u201cdeath domain,\u201d which is responsible for transducing signals for programmed cell death (Tartaglia et al., 74:845 (1993)).","Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is a physiologic process essential to the normal development and homeostasis of multicellular organisms (H. Steller, 267:1445\u20131449 (1995)). Derangements of apoptosis contribute to the pathogenesis of several human diseases including cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (C. B. Thompson, 267:1456\u20131462 (1995)). Recently, much attention has focused on the signal transduction and biological function of two cell surface death receptors, Fas\/APO-1 and TNFR-1 (J. L. Cleveland et al., 81:479\u2013482 (1995); A. Fraser et al., 85:781\u2013784 (1996); S. Nagata et al., 267:1449\u201356 (1995)). Both are members of the TNF receptor family, which also include TNFR-2, low affinity NGFR, CD40, and CD30, among others (C. A. Smith et al., 248: 1019\u201323 (1990); M. Tewari et al., in M. Purton, Heldin, Carl, Ed. (Chapman and Hall, London, 1995). While family members are defined by the presence of cysteine-rich repeats in their extracellular domains, Fas\/APO-1 and TNFR-1 also share a region of intracellular homology, appropriately designated the \u201cdeath domain,\u201d which is distantly related to the suicide gene, reaper (P. Golstein et al., 81:185\u20136 (1995); K. White et al., 264:677\u201383 (1994)). This shared death domain suggests that both receptors interact with a related set of signal transducing molecules that, until recently, remained unidentified. Activation of Fas\/APO-1 recruits the death domain-containing adapter molecule FADD\/MORT1 (A. M. Chinnaiyan et al., 81:505\u2013512 (1995); M. P. Boldin et al., 270:7795\u20138 (1995); F. C. Kischkel et al., 14:5579\u20135588 (1995)), which in turn binds and presumably activates FLICE\/MACH1, a member of the ICE\/CED-3 family of pro-apoptotic proteases (M. Muzio et al., 85: 817\u2013827 (1996); M. P. Boldin et al., 85:803\u2013815 (1996)). While the central role of Fas\/APO-1 is to trigger cell death, TNFR-1 can signal an array of diverse biological activities-many of which stem from its ability to activate NF-kB (L. A. Tartaglia et al., 13:151\u2013153 (1992)). Accordingly, TNFR-1 recruits the multivalent adapter molecule TRADD, which like FADD, also contains a death domain (H. Hsu et al., 81:495\u2013504 (1995); H. Hsu et al., 84:299\u2013308 (1996)). Through its associations with a number of signaling molecules including FADD, TRAF2, and RIP, TRADD can signal both apoptosis and NF-kB activation (H. Hsu et al., 84:299\u2013308 (1996); H. Hsu et al., 4:387\u2013396 (1996)).","Recently, Human Genome Sciences has demonstrated that the TNF ligand family member Neutrokine-alpha (International publication number WO 98\/18921) induces both in vitro and in vivo B cell proliferation. B lymphocytes are responsible for the production of immunoglobulins, the major effector molecules of the humoral immune system. Immune system related disorders associated with B cells include, for example, immunodeficiencies and autoimmune disease.","Accordingly, there is a need to provide cytokines similar to TNF that are involved in pathological conditions. Such novel cytokines may be used to make novel antibodies or other antagonists that bind these TNF-like cytokines for diagnosis and therapy of disorders related to TNF-like cytokines. More particularly, there is a need to provide Neutrokine-alpha binding proteins that may be involved in pathological conditions. Such novel Neutrokine-alpha binding proteins may be used, for example, as therapeutics to treat or prevent diseases, disorders or conditions associated with aberrant Neutrokine-alpha mediated activity.","The present invention provides isolated nucleic acid molecules comprising a polynucleotide encoding at least a portion of TR21. Thus, the present invention provides, for example, isolated nucleic acid molecules comprising a polynucleotide encoding the TR21 receptor having the amino acid sequence shown in  (SEQ ID NO:2).","The present invention also relates to recombinant vectors, which include the isolated nucleic acid molecules of the present invention, and to host cells containing the recombinant vectors, as well as to methods of making such vectors and host cells. The invention further provides for the use of such recombinant vectors in the production of TR21 polypeptides by recombinant techniques.","The invention further provides an isolated TR21 polypeptide having an amino acid sequence encoded by a polynucleotide described herein.","The present invention also provides diagnostic assays such as quantitative and diagnostic assays for detecting levels of TR21 protein. Thus, for instance, a diagnostic assay in accordance with the invention for detecting over-expression of TR21, or soluble form thereof, compared to normal control tissue samples may be used to detect the presence of tumors.","Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) family ligands are known to be among the most pleiotropic cytokines, inducing a large number of cellular responses, including cell proliferation, cytotoxicity, anti-viral activity, immunoregulatory activities, hematopoiesis, and the transcriptional regulation of several genes. Cellular responses to TNF-family ligands include not only normal physiological responses, but such responses may lead to diseases associated with dysregulation of these physiological responses, such as, for example, diseases associated with increased apoptosis or the inhibition of apoptosis. Apoptosis-programmed cell death is a physiological mechanism involved in the deletion of peripheral T lymphocytes of the immune system, and its dysregulation can lead to a number of different pathogenic processes. Diseases associated with increased cell survival, unregulated cell proliferation, or the inhibition of apoptosis, include cancers, autoimmune disorders, viral infections, inflammation, graft vs. host disease, acute graft rejection, and chronic graft rejection. Diseases associated with increased apoptosis include AIDS, neurodegenerative disorders, myelodysplastic syndromes, ischemic injury, toxin-induced liver disease, septic shock, cachexia, and anorexia.","Thus, the invention further provides a method comprising contacting cells which express the TR21 polypeptide with a candidate compound and a TNF-family ligand (e.g. Neutrokine-alpha (International Publication Number WO 97\/33902)), and assaying for the inhibition of TR21 mediated signaling, and\/or activation of transcription factors, such as, for example, AP-1 and\/or NF-kappaB, induced by, for example, a TNF-family ligand (e.g., Neutrokine-alpha) which involves administering to a cell which expresses the TR21 polypeptide (e.g., a B cell) an effective amount of a TR21 antagonist capable of decreasing TR21 mediated signaling.","The present invention is also directed to methods for enhancing TR21 mediated signaling induced by a TNF-family ligand (e.g., Neutrokine-alpha) which involves administering to a cell which expresses the TR21 polypeptide (e.g., a B cell) an effective amount of a TR21 agonist capable of increasing TR21 mediated signaling.","Whether any candidate \u201cagonist\u201d or \u201cantagonist\u201d of the present invention can enhance or inhibit TR21 mediated signaling can be determined using or routinely modifying TNF-family ligand\/receptor cellular response assays known in the art, including, for example, those described in von Bulow et al. (Science 278:138\u2013141 (1997)) and herein (see, e.g., Examples 17 and 18). Thus, in a further embodiment, a screening method is provided for determining whether a candidate agonist or antagonist is capable of enhancing or decreasing TR21 mediated cellular response to TNF-ligand (e.g., Neutrokine-alpha). The method involves contacting cells expressing TR21 with the candidate compound (i.e., candidate agonist or antagonist compound) and TNF-ligand (e.g., Neutrokine-alpha), and measuring the TR21 mediated cellular response (e.g., activation of transcription factors such as, for example, NF-AT, AP-1, and\/or NF-kappaB), and comparing the cellular response to a standard cellular response. The standard cellular response being measured when contact is made with the TNF-family ligand (e.g., Neutrokine-alpha) in absence of the candidate compound. An increased cellular response over the standard indicates that the candidate compound is an agonist of the ligand (e.g., Neutrokine-alpha)\/TR21 signaling pathway and a decreased cellular response compared to the standard indicates that the candidate compound is an antagonist of the ligand (e.g., Neutrokine-alpha)\/TR21 signaling pathway. By the invention, a cell expressing the TR21 polypeptide can be contacted with either an endogenous or exogenously administered TNF-family ligand (e.g., Neutrokine-alpha.).","The present invention provides isolated nucleic acid molecules comprising a polynucleotide encoding TR21, such as, for example, polynucleotides having the nucleotide sequence shown in  (SEQ ID NO:1). The present invention provides isolated nucleic acid molecules comprising a polynucleotide encoding a TR21 polypeptide having the amino acid sequence shown in  (SEQ ID NO:2).","TR21 Nucleic Acid Molecules","The determined nucleotide sequence of TR21 (; SEQ ID NO:1) contains an open reading frame encoding a protein of about 184 amino acid residues, with a deduced molecular weight of about 18.9 kDa. The amino acid sequence of the predicted mature TR21 receptor is shown in SEQ ID NO:2 from amino acid residue about 1 to residue about 184.","As indicated, the present invention also provides the mature form(s) of the TR21 receptors of the present invention. According to the signal hypothesis, proteins secreted by mammalian cells have a signal or secretory leader sequence which is cleaved from the mature protein once export of the growing protein chain across the rough endoplasmic reticulum has been initiated. Most mammalian cells and even insect cells cleave secreted proteins with the same specificity. However, in some cases, cleavage of a secreted protein is not entirely uniform, which results in two or more mature species on the protein. Further, it has long been known that the cleavage specificity of a secreted protein is ultimately determined by the primary structure of the complete protein, that is, it is inherent in the amino acid sequence of the polypeptide.","The present invention provides a nucleotide sequence encoding the mature TR21 polypeptide having the amino acid sequence shown in . By the mature TR21 protein having the amino acid sequence shown in  is meant the mature form(s) of the TR21 receptor predicted by computer analysis or produced by expression of the coding sequence shown in  in a mammalian cell (e.g., COS cells, as described below). As indicated below, the mature TR21 receptor having the amino acid sequence encoded by the coding sequence shown in  may or may not differ from the predicted mature TR21 protein shown in  (amino acids from about 1 to about 184) depending on the accuracy of the predicted cleavage site based on computer analysis.","Methods for predicting whether a protein has a secretory leader as well as the cleavage point for that leader sequence are available. For instance, the method of McGeoch (3:271\u2013286 (1985)) and von Heinje (14:4683\u20134690 (1986)) can be used. The accuracy of predicting the cleavage points of known mammalian secretory proteins for each of these methods is in the range of 75\u201380% (von Heinje, supra). However, the two methods do not always produce the same predicted cleavage point(s) for a given protein.","The polypeptide sequence of the TR21 depicted in  can routinely be examined by computer programs. For example, the mature form, intracellular form, extracellular form, and transmembrane domains of the TR21 polypeptides of the invention can routinely be predicted via analysis using the \u201cPSORT\u201d computer program (K. Nakai and M. Kanehisa, 14:897\u2013911(1992)), which is an expert system for predicting the cellular location of a protein based on the amino acid sequence. As part of this computational prediction of localization, the methods of McGeoch and von Heinje are incorporated into the PSORT program.","The predicted TR21 polypeptide comprises about 184 amino acids. However, as one of ordinary skill in the art would appreciate, the actual TR21 polypeptide may be anywhere in the range of 174\u2013194 amino acids due to the possibilities of sequencing errors as well as the variability of cleavage sites for leaders in different known proteins. It will further be appreciated that, the domains described herein have been predicted by computer analysis, and accordingly, that depending on the analytical criteria used for identifying various functional domains, the exact \u201caddress\u201d of, for example, the extracellular domain, intracellular domain, cysteine-rich motif, and transmembrane domain of TR21 may differ slightly from the predicted locations. For example, the exact location of the TR21 extracellular domain in  (SEQ ID NO:2) may vary slightly (e.g., the address may \u201cshift\u201d by about 1 to about 20 residues, more likely about 1 to about 5 residues) depending on the criteria used to define the domain. In any event, as discussed in more detail below, the invention further provides polypeptides having various residues deleted from the N-terminus and\/or C-terminus of the complete TR21 polypeptide, including polypeptides lacking one or more amino acids from the N-termini of the TR21 extracellular domains described herein, which constitute soluble forms of the extracellular domain of the TR21 polypeptides respectively.","As indicated, nucleic acid molecules of the present invention may be in the form of RNA, such as mRNA, or in the form of DNA, including, for instance, cDNA and genomic DNA obtained by cloning or produced synthetically. The DNA may be double-stranded or single-stranded. Single-stranded DNA may be the coding strand, also known as the sense strand, or it may be the non-coding strand, also referred to as the anti-sense strand.","By \u201cisolated\u201d nucleic acid molecule(s) is intended a nucleic acid molecule, DNA or RNA, which has been removed from its native environment. For example, recombinant DNA molecules contained in a vector are considered isolated for the purposes of the present invention. Further examples of isolated DNA molecules include recombinant DNA molecules maintained in heterologous host cells or purified (partially or substantially) DNA molecules in solution. Isolated RNA molecules include in vivo or in vitro RNA transcripts of the DNA molecules of the present invention. Isolated nucleic acid molecules according to the present invention further include such molecules produced naturally, recombinantly or synthetically. However, a nucleic acid molecule contained in a clone that is a member of a mixed clone library (e.g., a genomic or cDNA library) and that has not been isolated from other clones of the library (e.g., in the form of a homogeneous solution containing the clone without other members of the library) or a chromosome isolated or removed from a cell or a cell lysate (e.g., a \u201cchromosome spread\u201d, as in a karyotype), or a preparation of randomly sheared or genomic DNA cut with one or more restriction enzymes, is not \u201cisolated\u201d for the purposes of this invention.","Isolated nucleic acid molecules of the present invention include DNA molecules comprising an open reading frame (ORF) shown in  (SEQ ID NO:1); DNA molecules comprising the coding sequence for the complete (full-length) and\/or mature TR21 protein shown in  (SEQ ID NO:2); and DNA molecules which comprise a sequence substantially different from those described above, but which, due to the degeneracy of the genetic code, still encode the TR21 protein. Of course, the genetic code is well known in the art. Thus, it would be routine for one skilled in the art to generate such degenerate variants.","The invention further provides an isolated nucleic acid molecule having the nucleotide sequence shown in  (SEQ ID NO:1), or a nucleic acid molecule having a sequence complementary thereto. Such isolated molecules, particularly DNA molecules, are useful, for example, as probes for gene mapping by in situ hybridization with chromosomes, and for detecting expression of the TR21 gene in human tissue, for instance, by Northern blot analysis.","The present invention is further directed to fragments of the isolated nucleic acid molecules described herein. By a fragment of an isolated DNA molecule having the nucleotide sequence of the nucleotide sequence shown in  (SEQ ID NO:1) is intended DNA fragments at least about 15 nt, and more preferably at least about 20 nt, at least about 24 nt, still more preferably at least about 30 nt, at least about 35 nt, and even more preferably, at least about 40 nt, at least about 45 nt, at least about 50 nt, at least about 55 nt, at least about 60 nt, at least about 65 nt, at least about 70 nt, at least about 75 nt, at least about 100 nt, at least about 150 nt, at least about 200 nt, at least about 250 nt, at least about 300 nt in length which are useful, for example, as diagnostic probes and primers as discussed herein. Of course, larger fragments 350\u2013899 nt in length are also useful according to the present invention, as are fragments corresponding to most, if not all, of the nucleotide sequence as shown in  (SEQ ID NO:1), or the complementary strand thereto. By a fragment at least 20 nt in length, for example, is intended fragments which include 20 or more contiguous bases from the nucleotide sequence of the nucleotide sequence as shown in  (SEQ ID NO:1). In this context \u201cabout\u201d includes the particularly recited size, and sizes larger or smaller by several (5, 4, 3, 2, or 1) nucleotides, at either terminus or at both termini. In specific embodiments, the fragments of the invention comprise, or alternatively consist of, nucleotides 12\u201350, 120\u2013140, 156\u2013164, 180\u2013188, 315\u2013341, 348\u2013371, 411\u2013419, 444\u2013464, and\/or 537\u2013551 of  (SEQ ID NO:1) or the complementary strand thereto. Polypeptides encoded by these polynucleotide are also encompassed.","Representative examples of TR21 polynucleotide fragments of the invention include, for example, fragments that comprise, or alternatively, consist of, a sequence from about nucleotide 1 to 11, 12 to 50, 51 to 59, 60 to 83, 84 to 110, 111 to 119, 120 to 140, 141 to 155, 156 to 164, 165 to 179, 180 to 188, 189 to 215, 216 to 248, 249 to 308, 309 to 314, 315 to 341, 342 to 347, 348 to 371, 372 to 411, 412 to 419, 420 to 443, 444 to 464, 465 to 500, 501 to 536, 537 to 551, 552 to 557, 558 to 590, 591 to 649, 650 to 708, 709 to 767, 768 to 826, 827 to 885, and\/or 886 to 899 of  (SEQ ID NO:1), or the complementary strand thereto. In this context \u201cabout\u201d includes the particularly recited ranges, and ranges larger or smaller by several (5, 4, 3, 2, or 1) nucleotides, at either terminus or at both termini.","In specific embodiments, the polynucleotide fragments of the invention comprise, or alternatively, consist of, a sequence from nucleotide 60 to 110, of  (SEQ ID NO:1), or the complementary strand thereto.","Preferably, the polynucleotide fragments of the invention encode a polypeptide which demonstrates a TR21 functional activity. By a polypeptide demonstrating a TR21 \u201cfunctional activity\u201d is meant, a polypeptide capable of displaying one or more known functional activities associated with a full-length (complete) TR21 protein. Such functional activities include, but are not limited to, biological activity, antigenicity (ability to bind (or compete with a TR21 polypeptide for binding) to an anti-TR21 antibody), immunogenicity (ability to generate antibody which binds to a TR21 polypeptide), ability to form multimers with TR21 polypeptides of the invention, and ability to bind to a receptor or ligand for a TR21 polypeptide (e.g., Neutrokine-alpha (International Publication Number WO 98\/18921)).","The functional activity of TR21 polypeptides, fragments, variants, derivatives, and analogs thereof, can be assayed by various methods.","For example, in one embodiment where one is assaying for the ability to bind or compete with full-length TR21 polypeptides for binding to anti-TR21 antibody, various immunoassays known in the art can be used, including but not limited to, competitive and non-competitive assay systems using techniques such as radioimmunoassays, ELISA (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay), \u201csandwich\u201d immunoassays, immunoradiometric assays, gel diffusion precipitation reactions, immunodiffusion assays, in situ immunoassays (using colloidal gold, enzyme or radioisotope labels, for example), western blots, precipitation reactions, agglutination assays (e.g., gel agglutination assays, hemagglutination assays), complement fixation assays, immunofluorescence assays, protein A assays, and immunoelectrophoresis assays, etc. In one embodiment, antibody binding is detected by detecting a label on the primary antibody. In another embodiment, the primary antibody is detected by detecting binding of a secondary antibody or reagent to the primary antibody. In a further embodiment, the secondary antibody is labeled. Many means are known in the art for detecting binding in an immunoassay and are within the scope of the present invention.","In another embodiment, where a TR21 ligand is identified (e.g., Neutrokine-alpha), or the ability of a polypeptide fragment, variant or derivative of the invention to multimerize is being evaluated, binding can be assayed by means well-known in the art, such as, for example, reducing and non-reducing gel chromatography, protein affinity chromatography, and affinity blotting. See generally, Phizicky, E., et al., 59:94\u2013123 (1995). In another embodiment, physiological correlates of TR21 binding to its substrates (signal transduction) can be assayed.","In addition, assays described herein (and otherwise known in the art may routinely be applied to measure the ability of TR21 polypeptides and fragments, variants derivatives and analogs thereof to elicit TR21 related biological activity. For example, techniques described herein (see e.g., Examples 16, 17 and 18) and otherwise known in the art may be applied or routinely modified to assay for the ability of the compositions of the invention (e.g., fusion proteins comprising a portion of the extracellular domain of TR21 and an immunoglobulin Fc domain) to inhibit or stimulate B cell proliferation (e.g., Neutrokine-alpha mediated B cell proliferation).","Other methods will be known to the skilled artisan and are within the scope of the invention.","Preferred nucleic acid fragments of the present invention include nucleic acid molecules encoding a member selected from the group: a polypeptide comprising or alternatively, consisting of, the TR21 receptor extracellular domain (amino acid residues from about 1 to about 81 in  (SEQ ID NO:2); a polypeptide comprising, or alternatively consisting of, the TR21 cysteine rich domain (amino acid residues from about 19 to about 35 in  (SEQ ID NO:2); a polypeptide comprising, or alternatively consisting of the TR21 transmembrane domain (amino acid residues from about 82 to about 101 in  (SEQ ID NO:2); and\/or a polypeptide comprising, or alternatively consisting of, the TR21 intracellular domain (amino acid residues from about 102 to about 184 in  (SEQ ID NO:2)). Since the locations of these domains have been predicted by computer analysis, one of ordinary skill would appreciate that the amino acid residues constituting these domains may vary slightly (e.g., by about 1 to 15 amino acid residues) depending on the criteria used to define each domain.","Preferred nucleic acid fragments of the invention encode a full-length TR21 polypeptide lacking the nucleotides encoding the amino terminal methionine in  (SEQ ID NO:1), as it is known that the methionine is cleaved naturally and such sequences may be useful in genetically engineering TR21 expression vectors. Polypeptides encoded by such polynucleotides are also contemplated by the invention.","Preferred nucleic acid fragments of the present invention further include nucleic acid molecules encoding epitope-bearing portions of the TR21 receptor proteins. In particular, such nucleic acid fragments of the present invention include nucleic acid molecules encoding: a polypeptide comprising amino acid residues from about 3 to about 15 in  (SEQ ID NO:2); a polypeptide comprising amino acid residues from about 39 to about 45 in  (SEQ ID NO:2); a polypeptide comprising amino acid residues from about 51 to about 53 in  (SEQ ID NO:2); a polypeptide comprising amino acid residues from about 59 to about 61 in  (SEQ ID NO:2); a polypeptide comprising amino acid residues from about 104 to about 112 in  (SEQ ID NO:2); a polypeptide comprising amino acid residues from about 115 to about 122 in  (SEQ ID NO:2); a polypeptide comprising amino acid residues from about 136 to about 138 in  (SEQ ID NO:2); a polypeptide comprising amino acid residues from about 147 to about 153 in  (SEQ ID NO:2); and a polypeptide comprising amino acid residues from about 178 to about 182 in  (SEQ ID NO:2). In this context \u201cabout\u201d includes the particularly recited ranges, and ranges larger or smaller by several (5, 4, 3, 2, or 1) nucleotides, at either terminus or at both termini. The inventors have determined that the above polypeptide fragments are antigenic regions of TR21. Methods for determining other such epitope-bearing portions of the TR21 proteins are described in detail below.","It is believed that the extracellular cysteine rich motif of TR21 disclosed in  are important for interactions between TR21 and its ligands (e.g., Neutrokine alpha). Accordingly, specific embodiments of the invention are directed to polynucleotides encoding polypeptides which comprise, or alternatively consist of, the amino acid sequence of amino acid residues 19 to 35 of  (SEQ ID NO:2). Polypeptides encoded by these polynucleotides are also encompassed by the invention.","In additional embodiments, the polynucleotides of the invention encode functional attributes of TR21. Preferred embodiments of the invention in this regard include fragments that comprise alpha-helix and alpha-helix forming regions (\u201calpha-regions\u201d), beta-sheet and beta-sheet forming regions (\u201cbeta-regions\u201d), turn and turn-forming regions (\u201cturn-regions\u201d), coil and coil-forming regions (\u201ccoil-regions\u201d), hydrophilic regions, hydrophobic regions, alpha amphipathic regions, beta amphipathic regions, flexible regions, surface-forming regions and antigenic regions of TR21.","The data representing the structural or functional attributes of TR21 set forth in  and\/or Table I, as described above, was generated using the various modules and algorithms of the DNA*STAR set on default parameters. In a preferred embodiment, the data presented in columns VIII, XI, XIII and XIV of Table I can be used to determine regions of TR21 which exhibit a high degree of potential for antigenicity. Regions of high antigenicity are determined from the data presented in columns VIII, XI, XIII and\/or XIV by choosing values which represent regions of the polypeptide which are likely to be exposed on the surface of the polypeptide in an environment in which antigen recognition may occur in the process of initiation of an immune response.","Certain preferred regions in these regards are set out in , but may, as shown in Table I, be represented or identified by using tabular representations of the data presented in . The DNA*STAR computer algorithm used to generate  (set on the original default parameters) was used to present the data in  in a tabular format (See Table I). The tabular format of the data in  may be used to easily determine specific boundaries of a preferred region.","The above-mentioned preferred regions set out in  and in Table I, include, but are not limited to, regions of the aforementioned types identified by analysis of the amino acid sequences set out in . As set out in  and in Table I, such preferred regions include Garnier-Robson alpha-regions, beta-regions, turn-regions, and coil-regions, Chou-Fasman alpha-regions, beta-regions, and turn-regions, Kyte-Doolittle hydrophilic regions, Hopp-Woods hydrophobic regions, Eisenberg alpha- and beta-amphipathic regions, Karplus-Schulz flexible regions, Jameson-Wolf regions of high antigenic index and

another aspect, the invention provides an isolated nucleic acid molecule comprising a polynucleotide which hybridizes under stringent hybridization conditions to a portion of the polynucleotide in a

Polypeptides encoded by these nucleic acids are also encompassed by the invention.","By a polynucleotide which hybridizes to a \u201cportion\u201d of a polynucleotide is intended a polynucleotide (either DNA or RNA) hybridizing to at least about 15 nucleotides (nt), and more preferably at least about 20 nt, still more preferably at least about 30 nt, and even more preferably about 30\u201370 nt of the reference polynucleotide. These are useful, for example, as diagnostic probes and primers as discussed above and in more detail below. By a portion of a polynucleotide of \u201cat least 20 nt in length,\u201d for example, is intended 20 or more contiguous nucleotides from the nucleotide sequence of the reference polynucleotide (e.g., the nucleotide sequence as shown in  (SEQ ID NO:1). In this context \u201cabout\u201d includes the particularly recited size, and sizes larger or smaller by several (5, 4, 3, 2, or 1) nucleotides, at either terminus or at both termini.","In specific embodiments, the polynucleotides of the invention are less than 110000 kb, 50000 kb, 10000 kb, 1000 kb, 500 kb, 400 kb, 350 kb, 300 kb, 250 kb, 200 kb, 175 kb, 150 kb, 125 kb, 100 kb, 75 kb, 50 kb, 40 kb, 30 kb, 25 kb, 20 kb, 15 kb, 10 kb, 7.5 kb, or 5 kb in length.","In further embodiments, polynucleotides of the invention comprise at least 15, at least 30, at least 50, at least 100, or at least 250, at least 500, or at least 800 contiguous nucleotides of TR21 coding sequence, but consist of less than or equal to 100 kb, 75 kb, 50 kb, 30 kb, 25 kb, 20 kb, 15 kb, 10 kb, or 5 kb of genomic DNA that flanks the 5\u2032 or 3\u2032 coding nucleotide set forth in  (SEQ ID NO:1). In further embodiments, polynucleotides of the invention comprise at least 15, at least 30, at least 50, at least 100, or at least 250, at least 500, or at least 800 contiguous nucleotides of TR21 and\/or coding sequence, but do not comprise all or a portion of any TR21 intron. In another embodiment, the nucleic acid comprising TR21 coding sequence does not contain coding sequences of a genomic flanking gene (i.e., 5\u2032 or 3\u2032 to the TR21 gene in the genome). In other embodiments, the polynucleotides of the invention do not contain the coding sequence of more than 1000, 500, 250, 100, 50, 25, 20, 15, 10, 5, 4, 3, 2, or 1 genomic flanking gene(s).","As indicated, nucleic acid molecules of the present invention which encode a TR21 polypeptide may include, but are not limited to, the coding sequence for the mature polypeptide, by itself; the coding sequence for the mature polypeptide and additional sequences, such as those encoding a leader or secretory sequence, such as a pre-, or pro- or prepro-protein sequence; the coding sequence of the mature polypeptide, with or without the aforementioned additional coding sequences, together with additional, non-coding sequences, including for example, but not limited to introns and non-coding 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 sequences, such as the transcribed, non-translated sequences that play a role in transcription, mRNA processing\u2014including splicing and polyadenylation signals, for example\u2014ribosome binding and stability of mRNA; additional coding sequence which codes for additional amino acids, such as those which provide additional functionalities. Thus, for instance, the polypeptide may be fused to a marker sequence, such as a peptide, which facilitates purification of the fused polypeptide. In certain preferred embodiments of this aspect of the invention, the marker sequence is a hexa-histidine peptide, such as the tag provided in a pQE vector (Qiagen, Inc.), among others, many of which are commercially available. As described in Gentz et al., 86: 821\u2013824 (1989), for instance, hexa-histidine provides for convenient purification of the fusion protein. The \u201cHA\u201d tag is another peptide useful for purification which corresponds to an epitope derived from the influenza hemagglutinin protein, which has been described by Wilson et al., 37:767\u2013778 (1984). As discussed below, other such fusion proteins include the TR21 receptor fused to Fc at the N- or C-terminus.","The present invention further relates to variants of the nucleic acid molecules of the present invention, which encode portions, analogs, or derivatives of the TR21 receptor. Variants may occur naturally, such as a natural allelic variant. By an \u201callelic variant\u201d is intended one of several alternate forms of a gene occupying a given locus on a chromosome of an organism. , Lewin, B., ed., John Wiley & Sons, New York (1985). Non-naturally occurring variants may be produced using art-known mutagenesis techniques.","Such variants include those produced by nucleotide substitutions, deletions or additions which may involve one or more nucleotides. The variants may be altered in coding or non-coding regions or both. Alterations in the coding regions may produce conservative or non-conservative amino acid substitutions, deletions, or additions. Especially preferred among these are silent substitutions, additions, and deletions, which do not alter the properties and activities of the TR21 receptor or portions thereof. Also especially preferred in this regard are conservative substitutions.","Further embodiments of the invention include isolated nucleic acid molecules comprising, or alternatively consisting of, a polynucleotide having a nucleotide sequence at least 80%, 85%, or 90% identical, and more preferably at least 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% identical to: (a) a nucleotide sequence encoding the polypeptide having the amino acid sequence shown in  (SEQ ID NO:2); (b) a nucleotide sequence encoding the polypeptide having the amino acid sequence in  (SEQ ID NO: 2), but lacking the amino terminal methionine; (c) a nucleotide sequence encoding the polypeptide having the amino acid sequence at positions 1 to 184 in  (SEQ ID NO:2); (d) a nucleotide sequence encoding the TR21 extracellular domain; (e) a nucleotide sequence encoding the TR21 cysteine-rich motif (i.e., amino acid residues about 19 to about 35 in  (SEQ ID NO:2)); (f) a nucleotide sequence encoding the TR21 transmembrane domain; (g) a nucleotide sequence encoding the TR21 receptor intracellular domain; (h) a nucleotide sequence encoding the TR21 receptor extracellular and intracellular domains with all or part of the transmembrane domain deleted; and (i) a nucleotide sequence complementary to any of the nucleotide sequences in (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g), or (h) above. Polypeptides encoded by these polynucleotides are also encompassed by the invention.","By a polynucleotide having a nucleotide sequence at least, for example, 95% \u201cidentical\u201d to a reference nucleotide sequence encoding a TR21 polypeptide is intended that the nucleotide sequence of the polynucleotide is identical to the reference sequence except that the polynucleotide sequence may include up to five mismatches per each 100 nucleotides of the reference nucleotide sequence encoding the TR21 polypeptide. In other words, to obtain a polynucleotide having a nucleotide sequence at least 95% identical to a reference nucleotide sequence, up to 5% of the nucleotides in the reference sequence may be deleted or substituted with another nucleotide, or a number of nucleotides up to 5% of the total nucleotides in the reference sequence may be inserted into the reference sequence. These mismatches of the reference sequence may occur at the 5\u2032 or 3\u2032 terminal positions of the reference nucleotide sequence or anywhere between those terminal positions, interspersed either individually among nucleotides in the reference sequence or in one or more contiguous groups within the reference sequence. The reference (query) sequence may be the entire TR21 encoding nucleotide sequence shown in  (SEQ ID NO:1), or any TR21 polynucleotide fragment (e.g., a polynucleotide encoding the amino acid sequence of any of the TR21 N- and\/or C-terminal deletions described herein), variant, derivative or analog, as described herein.","As a practical matter, whether any particular nucleic acid molecule is at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 92%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% identical to, for instance, the nucleotide sequence shown in  (SEQ ID NO:1) can be determined conventionally using known computer programs such as the Bestfit program (Wisconsin Sequence Analysis Package, Version 8 for Unix, Genetics Computer Group, University Research Park, 575 Science Drive, Madison, Wis. 53711). Bestfit uses the local homology algorithm of Smith and Waterman, 2: 482\u2013489 (1981), to find the best segment of homology between two sequences. When using Bestfit or any other sequence alignment program to determine whether a particular sequence is, for instance, 95% identical to a reference sequence according to the present invention, the parameters are set, of course, such that the percentage of identity is calculated over the full length of the reference nucleotide sequence and that gaps in homology of up to 5% of the total number of nucleotides in the reference sequence are allowed.","In a specific embodiment, the identity between a reference (query) sequence (a sequence of the present invention) and a subject sequence, also referred to as a global sequence alignment, is determined using the FASTDB computer program based on the algorithm of Brutlag et al. (Comp. App. Biosci. 6:237\u2013245 (1990)). Preferred parameters used in a FASTDB alignment of DNA sequences to calculate percent identity are: Matrix=Unitary, k-tuple=4, Mismatch Penalty=1, Joining Penalty=30, Randomization Group Length=0, Cutoff Score=1, Gap Penalty=5, Gap Size Penalty 0.05, Window Size=500 or the length of the subject nucleotide sequence, whichever is shorter. According to this embodiment, if the subject sequence is shorter than the query sequence because of 5\u2032 or 3\u2032 deletions, not because of internal deletions, a manual correction is made to the results to take into consideration the fact that the FASTDB program does not account for 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 truncations of the subject sequence when calculating percent identity. For subject sequences truncated at the 5\u2032 or 3\u2032 ends, relative to the query sequence, the percent identity is corrected by calculating the number of bases of the query sequence that are 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 of the subject sequence, which are not matched\/aligned, as a percent of the total bases of the query sequence. A determination of whether a nucleotide is matched\/aligned is determined by results of the FASTDB sequence alignment. This percentage is then subtracted from the percent identity, calculated by the above FASTDB program using the specified parameters, to arrive at a final percent identity score. This corrected score is what is used for the purposes of this embodiment. Only bases outside the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 bases of the subject sequence, as displayed by the FASTDB alignment, which are not matched\/aligned with the query sequence, are calculated for the purposes of manually adjusting the percent identity score. For example, a 90 base subject sequence is aligned to a 100 base query sequence to determine percent identity. The deletions occur at the 5\u2032 end of the subject sequence and therefore, the FASTDB alignment does not show a matched\/alignment of the first 10 bases at 5\u2032 end. The 10 unpaired bases represent 10% of the sequence (number of bases at the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends not matched\/total number of bases in the query sequence) so 10% is subtracted from the percent identity score calculated by the FASTDB program. If the remaining 90 bases were perfectly matched the final percent identity would be 90%. In another example, a 90 base subject sequence is compared with a 100 base query sequence. This time the deletions are internal deletions so that there are no bases on the 5\u2032 or 3\u2032 of the subject sequence which are not matched\/aligned with the query. In this case the percent identity calculated by FASTDB is not manually corrected. Once again, only bases 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 of the subject sequence which are not matched\/aligned with the query sequence are manually corrected for. No other manual corrections are made for the purposes of this embodiment.","The present application is directed to nucleic acid molecules comprising, or alternatively consisting of a nucleotide sequence at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 92%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% identical to the nucleic acid sequence for example, shown in  (SEQ ID NO:1), irrespective of whether they encode a polypeptide having TR21 receptor activity. This is because even where a particular nucleic acid molecule does not encode a polypeptide having TR21 functional activity, one of skill in the art would still know how to use the nucleic acid molecule, for instance, as a hybridization probe or a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primer. Uses of the nucleic acid molecules of the present invention that do not encode a polypeptide having TR21 receptor activity include, inter alia: (1) isolating the TR21 gene or allelic variants thereof in a cDNA library; (2) in situ hybridization (e.g., \u201cFISH\u201d) to metaphase chromosomal spreads to provide precise chromosomal location of the TR21 receptor gene, as described in Verma et al., , Pergamon Press, New York (1988); and (3) Northern Blot analysis for detecting TR21 receptor mRNA expression in specific tissues.","Preferred, however, are nucleic acid molecules comprising, or alternatively consisting of, a nucleotide sequence at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 92%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% identical to for example, the nucleic acid sequence shown in  (SEQ ID NO:1), which do, in fact, encode a polypeptide having TR21 functional activity. By \u201ca polypeptide having TR21 functional activity\u201d is intended polypeptides exhibiting activity similar, but not necessarily identical, to an activity of the TR21 receptor of the invention (either the full-length protein or, preferably, the mature protein), as measured in a particular biological assay.","Of course, due to the degeneracy of the genetic code, one of ordinary skill in the art will immediately recognize that a large number of the nucleic acid molecules having a sequence at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 92%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% identical to, for example, the nucleic acid shown in  (SEQ ID NO:1), will encode a polypeptide \u201chaving TR21-short functional activity.\u201d Similarly, a large number of the nucleic acid molecules having a sequence at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 92%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% identical to, for example, a nucleic acid sequence shown in , will encode a polypeptide \u201chaving TR21 functional activity.\u201d In fact, since degenerate variants of these nucleotide sequences all encode the same polypeptide, this will be clear to the skilled artisan even without performing a biological assay. It will be further recognized in the art that, for such nucleic acid molecules that are not degenerate variants, a reasonable number will also encode a polypeptide having TR21 functional activity. This is because the skilled artisan is fully aware of amino acid substitutions that are either less likely or not likely to significantly effect protein function (e.g., replacing one aliphatic amino acid with a second aliphatic amino acid).","For example, guidance concerning how to make phenotypically silent amino acid substitutions is provided in J. U. Bowie et al., \u201cDeciphering the Message in Protein Sequences: Tolerance to Amino Acid Substitutions,\u201d 247:1306\u20131310 (1990), wherein the authors indicate that proteins are surprisingly tolerant of amino acid substitutions.","TR21 Polynucleotide Assays","This invention is also related to the use of TR21 polynucleotides to detect complementary polynucleotides such as, for example, as a diagnostic reagent. Detection of a normal and mutated form of TR21 associated with a dysfunction will provide a diagnostic tool that can add or define a diagnosis of a disease or susceptibility to a disease which results from under-expression over-expression or altered expression of TR21 (or a soluble form thereof), such as, for example, tumors or autoimmune disease.","Individuals carrying mutations in the TR21 gene may be detected at the DNA level by a variety of techniques. Nucleic acids for diagnosis may be obtained from a biological sample from a patient (e.g., a patient's cells, such as from blood, urine, saliva, tissue biopsy and autopsy material). The genomic DNA may be used directly for detection or may be amplified enzymatically by using PCR prior to analysis. (Saiki et al., 324:163\u2013166 (1986)). RNA or cDNA may also be used in the same ways. As an example, PCR primers complementary to the nucleic acid encoding TR21 can be used to identify and analyze TR21 expression and mutations. For example, deletions and insertions can be detected by a change in size of the amplified product in comparison to the normal genotype. Point mutations can be identified by hybridizing amplified DNA to radiolabeled TR21 RNA or alternatively, radiolabeled TR21 antisense DNA sequences. Perfectly matched sequences can routinely be distinguished from mismatched duplexes by techniques known in the art, such as, for example, RNase A digestion or by differences in melting temperatures.","Sequence differences between a reference gene and genes having mutations also may be revealed by direct DNA sequencing. In addition, cloned DNA segments may be employed as probes to detect specific DNA segments. The sensitivity of such methods can be greatly enhanced by appropriate use of PCR or another amplification method. For example, a sequencing primer is used with double-stranded PCR product or a single-stranded template molecule generated by a modified PCR. The sequence determination is performed by conventional procedures with radiolabeled nucleotide or by automatic sequencing procedures with fluorescent-tags.","Genetic testing based on DNA sequence differences may be achieved by detection of alteration in electrophoretic mobility of DNA fragments in gels, with or without denaturing agents. Small sequence deletions and insertions can be visualized by high-resolution gel electrophoresis using techniques known in the art. DNA fragments of different sequences may be distinguished on denaturing formamide gradient gels in which the mobilities of different DNA fragments are retarded in the gel at different positions according to their specific melting or partial melting temperatures (see, e.g., Myers et al., 230:1242 (1985)).","Sequence changes at specific locations also may be revealed by nuclease protection assays, such as RNase and S1 protection or the chemical cleavage method (e.g., Cotton et al., 85: 4397\u20134401 (1985)).","Thus, the detection of a specific DNA sequence may be achieved by methods which include, but are not limited to, hybridization, RNase protection, chemical cleavage, direct DNA sequencing or the use of restriction enzymes, (e.g., restriction fragment length polymorphisms (\u201cRFLP\u201d) and Southern blotting of genomic DNA.","In addition to more conventional gel-electrophoresis and DNA sequencing, mutations also can be detected by in situ analysis.","The invention also encompasses isolated nucleic acids encoding the above-described TR21 polypeptides and proteins. Such polynucleotide sequences can routinely be determined using techniques known in the art. For example, the amino acid sequence of the TR21 polypeptides of the invention can be routinely determined using techniques known in the art, such as via the Edman degradation technique. (See, e.g., Creighton, 1983, \u201cProteins: Structures and Molecular Principles\u201d, W.H. Freeman & Co., N.Y., pp. 34\u201349). The amino acid sequence obtained may be used as a guide for the generation of oligonucleotide mixtures that can be used to screen for polynucleotide sequences encoding TR21 polypeptides. Screening may be accomplished, for example, by standard hybridization or PCR techniques. For example, polynucleotides encoding TR21 polypeptides of the invention may be isolated by techniques known in the art, such as, for example, by performing PCR using two degenerate oligonucleotide primer pools designed on the basis of amino acid sequence of the TR21 polypeptide of interest. Techniques for the generation of oligonucleotide mixtures and the screening are well known. (See, e.g., Ausubel, supra., and PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications, 1990, Innis, M. et al., eds. Academic Press, Inc., New York). The template for the reaction may be cDNA obtained by reverse transcription of mRNA prepared from, for example, human or non-human cell lines or tissue, such as B cells, known or suspected to express a TR21 polypeptide.","The PCR product may be subcloned and sequenced to ensure that the amplified sequences encode a TR21 polypeptide. The PCR fragment may then be used to isolate a full-length cDNA clone by a variety of methods. For example, the amplified fragment may be labeled and used to screen a cDNA library, such as a bacteriophage cDNA library. Alternatively, the labeled fragment may be used to isolate genomic clones via the screening of a genomic library.","PCR technology may also be utilized to isolate full-length cDNA sequences. For example, RNA may be isolated, following standard procedures, from an appropriate cellular or tissue source (i.e., one known, or suspected, to express the TR21 gene, such as, for example, B cells). A reverse transcription reaction may be performed on the RNA using an oligonucleotide primer specific for the most 5\u2032 end of the amplified fragment for the priming of first strand synthesis. The resulting RNA\/DNA hybrid may then be \u201ctailed\u201d with guanines using a standard terminal transferase reaction, the hybrid may be digested with RNAase H, and second strand synthesis may then be primed with a poly-C primer. Thus, cDNA sequences upstream of the amplified fragment may easily be isolated. For a review of cloning strategies which may be used, see e.g., Sambrook et al., 1989, infra.","Additionally, an expression library can be constructed utilizing cDNA synthesized from, for example, RNA isolated from a tissue known, or suspected, to express a TR21 polypeptide. According to this strategy, polypeptides expressed by the cloned cDNA are screened using standard antibody screening techniques in conjunction with antibodies raised against the TR21 polypeptides of the invention. (For screening techniques, see, for example, Harlow, E. and Lane, eds., 1988, \u201cAntibodies: A Laboratory Manual\u201d, Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor.) Additionally, screening can be accomplished by screening with labeled Neutrokine-alpha proteins or fusion proteins, such as, for example, those described herein. Library clones detected via their reaction with such labeled compounds can be purified and subjected to sequence analysis according to methods well known to those of skill in the art.","TR21 Vectors and Host Cells","The present invention also relates to vectors which include the isolated DNA molecules of the present invention, host cells which are genetically engineered with the recombinant vectors and\/or nucleic acids of the invention and the production of TR21 polypeptides or fragments thereof by recombinant techniques.","Host cells can be genetically engineered to incorporate nucleic acid molecules and express polypeptides of the present invention. The polynucleotides may be introduced alone or with other polynucleotides. Such other polynucleotides may be introduced independently, co-introduced or introduced joined to the polynucleotides of the invention.","In accordance with the present invention the vector may be, for example, a plasmid vector, a single or double-stranded phage vector, a single or double-stranded RNA or DNA viral vector. Such vectors may be introduced into cells as polynucleotides, preferably DNA, by well-known techniques for introducing DNA and RNA into cells. Viral vectors may be replication competent or replication defective. In the latter case viral propagation generally will occur only in complementing host cells.","Preferred among vectors, in certain respects, are those for expression of polynucleotides and polypeptides of the present invention. Generally, such vectors comprise cis-acting control regions effective for expression in a host operatively linked to the polynucleotide to be expressed. Appropriate trans-acting factors either are supplied by the host, supplied by a complementing vector or supplied by the vector itself upon introduction into the host.","The polynucleotides may be joined to a vector containing a selectable marker for propagation in a host. Generally, a plasmid vector is introduced in a precipitate, such as a calcium phosphate precipitate, or in a complex with a charged lipid. If the vector is a virus, it may be packaged in vitro using an appropriate packaging cell line and then transduced into host cells.","The DNA insert should be operatively linked to an appropriate promoter, such as the phage lambda PL promoter, the lac, trp and tac promoters, the SV40 early and late promoters and promoters of retroviral LTRs, to name a few. Other suitable promoters will be known to the skilled artisan. The expression constructs will further contain sites for transcription initiation, termination and, in the transcribed region, a ribosome binding site for translation. The coding portion of the mature transcripts expressed by the constructs will preferably include a translation initiating at the beginning and a termination codon (UAA, UGA or UAG) appropriately positioned at the end of the polypeptide to be translated.","As indicated, the expression vectors will preferably include at least one selectable marker. Such markers include dihydrofolate reductase or neomycin resistance for eukaryotic cell culture and tetracycline or ampicillin resistance genes for culturing in and other bacteria. Representative examples of appropriate hosts include, but are not limited to, bacterial cells, such as and cells; fungal cells, such as yeast cells, such as or ; insect cells such as S2 and Sf9 cells; animal cells such as CHO, COS and Bowes melanoma cells; and plant cells. Appropriate culture mediums and conditions for the above-described host cells are known in the art.","Vectors which use glutamine synthase (GS) or DHFR as the selectable markers can be amplified in the presence of the drugs methionine sulphoximine or methotrexate, respectively. The availability of drugs which inhibit the function of the enzymes encoded by these selectable markers allows for selection of cell lines in which the vector sequences have been amplified after integration into the host cell's DNA. An advantage of glutamine synthase based vectors are the availability of cell lines (e.g., the murine myeloma cell line, NS0) which are glutamine synthase negative. Glutamine synthase expression systems can also function in glutamine synthase expressing cells (e.g. Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells) by providing additional inhibitor to prevent the functioning of the endogenous gene. A glutamine synthase expression system and components thereof are detailed in PCT publications: WO87\/04462; WO86\/05807; WO89\/01036; WO89\/10404; and WO91\/06657 which are hereby incorporated in their entireties by reference herein. Additionally, glutamine synthase expression vectors that may be used according to the present invention are commercially available from suppliers including, for example, Lonza Biologics, Inc. (Portsmouth, N.H.). Expression and production of monoclonal antibodies using a GS expression system in murine myeloma cells is described in Bebbington et al., 10:169(1992) and in Biblia and Robinson 11:1 (1995) which are herein incorporated by reference.","Among vectors preferred for use in bacteria include pHE4-5 (ATCC Accession No. 209311; and variations thereof), pQE70, pQE60 and pQE-9, available from Qiagen; pBS vectors, Phagescript vectors, PBluescript vectors, pNH8A, pNH16a, pNH18A, pNH46A, available from Stratagene; and ptrc99a, pKK223-3, pKK233-3, pDR540, pRIT5 available from Pharmacia. Preferred expression vectors for use in yeast systems include, but are not limited to, pYES2, pY01, pTEF1\/Zeo, pYES2\/GS, pPICZ, pGAPZ, pGAPZalpha, pPIC9, pPIC3.5, pHIL-D2, pHIL-S1, pPIC3.5K, pPIC9K, and pA0815 (all available from Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.). Among preferred eukaryotic vectors are pWLNEO, pSV2CAT, pOG44, pXT1 and pSG available from Stratagene; and pSVK3, pBPV, pMSG and pSVL available from Pharmacia. Other suitable vectors will be readily apparent to the skilled artisan.","In one embodiment, the yeast is used to express TR21 protein in a eukaryotic system. is a methylotrophic yeast which can metabolize methanol as its sole carbon source. A main step in the metabolism of methanol is the oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde using O. This reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme alcohol oxidase. In order to metabolize methanol as its sole carbon source, must generate high levels of alcohol oxidase due, in part, to the relatively low affinity of alcohol oxidase for O. Consequently, in a growth medium depending on methanol as a main carbon source, the promoter region of one of the two alcohol oxidase genes (AOX1) is highly active. In the presence of methanol, alcohol oxidase produced from the AOX1 gene comprises up to approximately 30% of the total soluble protein in . See, Ellis, S. B., et al., 5:1111\u201321 (1985); Koutz, P. J, et al., 5:167\u201377 (1989); Tschopp, J. F., et al., 15:3859\u201376 (1987). Thus, a heterologous coding sequence, such as, for example, a TR21 polynucleotide of the present invention, under the transcriptional regulation of all or part of the AOX1 regulatory sequence is expressed at exceptionally high levels in yeast grown in the presence of methanol.","In one example, the plasmid vector pPIC9K is used to express DNA encoding a TR21 polypeptide of the invention, as set forth herein, in a yeast system essentially as described in \u201cProtocols: Methods in Molecular Biology,\u201d D. R. Higgins and J. Cregg, eds. The Humana Press, Totowa, N.J., 1998. This expression vector allows expression and secretion of a TR21 protein of the invention by virtue of the strong AOX1 promoter linked to the alkaline phosphatase (PHO) secretory signal peptide (i.e., leader) located upstream of a multiple cloning site.","Many other yeast vectors could be used in place of pPIC9K, such as, pYES2, pYD1, pTEF1\/Zeo, pYES2\/GS, pPICZ, pGAPZ, pGAPZalpha, pPIC9, pPIC3.5, pHIL-D2, pHIL-S1, pPIC3.5K, and PAO815, as one skilled in the art would readily appreciate, as long as the proposed expression construct provides appropriately located signals for transcription, translation, secretion (if desired), and the like, including an in-frame AUG as required.","In one embodiment, high-level expression of a heterologous coding sequence, such as, for example, a TR21 polynucleotide of the present invention, may be achieved by cloning the heterologous polynucleotide of the invention into an expression vector such as, for example, pGAPZ or pGAPZalpha, and growing the yeast culture in the absence of methanol.","The present invention also relates to host cells containing the above-described vector constructs described herein, and additionally encompasses host cells containing nucleotide sequences of the invention that are operably associated with one or more heterologous control regions (e.g., promoter and\/or enhancer) using techniques known of in the art. The host cell can be a higher eukaryotic cell, such as a mammalian cell (e.g., a human derived cell), or a lower eukaryotic cell, such as a yeast cell, or the host cell can be a prokaryotic cell, such as a bacterial cell. The host strain may modulate the expression of the inserted gene sequences, or modify and process the gene product in the specific fashion desired. Expression from certain promoters can be elevated in the presence of certain inducers; thus expression of the genetically engineered polypeptide may be controlled. Furthermore, different host cells have characteristics and specific mechanisms for the translational and post-translational processing and modification (e.g., phosphorylation, cleavage) of proteins. Appropriate cell lines can be chosen to ensure the desired modifications and processing of the foreign protein expressed.","Introduction of the construct into the host cell can be effected by calcium phosphate transfection, DEAE-dextran mediated transfection, cationic lipid-mediated transfection, electroporation, transduction, infection or other methods. Such methods are described in many standard laboratory manuals, such as Davis et al., (1986).","In addition to encompassing host cells containing the vector constructs discussed herein, the invention also encompasses primary, secondary, and immortalized host cells of vertebrate origin, particularly mammalian origin, that have been engineered to delete or replace endogenous genetic material (e.g., TR21 coding sequence), and\/or to include genetic material (e.g., heterologous polynucleotide sequences) that is operably associated with TR21 polynucleotides of the invention, and which activates, alters, and\/or amplifies endogenous TR21 polynucleotides. For example, techniques known in the art may be used to operably associate heterologous control regions (e.g., promoter and\/or enhancer) and endogenous TR21 polynucleotide sequences via homologous recombination (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,641,670, issued Jun. 24, 1997; International Publication Number WO 96\/29411; International Publication Number WO 94\/12650; Koller et al., 86:8932\u20138935 (1989); and Zijlstra et al., 342:435\u2013438 (1989), the disclosures of each of which are incorporated by reference in their entireties).","The TR21 polypeptide may be expressed in a modified form, such as a fusion protein (comprising the polypeptide joined via a peptide bond to a heterologous protein sequence (of a different protein)), and may include not only secretion signals but also additional heterologous functional regions. Alternatively, such a fusion protein can be made by protein synthetic techniques, e.g., by use of a peptide synthesizer. Thus, a region of additional amino acids, particularly charged amino acids, may be added to the N-terminus of the polypeptide to improve stability and persistence in the host cell, during purification or during subsequent handling and storage. Also, peptide moieties may be added to the polypeptide to facilitate purification. Such regions may be removed prior to final preparation of the polypeptide. The addition of peptide moieties to polypeptides to engender secretion or excretion, to improve stability and to facilitate purification, among others, are familiar and routine techniques in the art.","In one embodiment, polynucleotides encoding TR21 polypeptides of the invention may be fused to signal sequences which will direct the localization of a protein of the invention to particular compartments of a prokaryotic or eukaryotic cell and\/or direct the secretion of a protein of the invention from a prokaryotic or eukaryotic cell. For example, in , one may wish to direct the expression of the protein to the periplasmic space. Examples of signal sequences or proteins (or fragments thereof) to which the polypeptides of the invention may be fused in order to direct the expression of the polypeptide to the periplasmic space of bacteria include, but are not limited to, the pelB signal sequence, the maltose binding protein (MBP) signal sequence, MBP, the ompA signal sequence, the signal sequence of the periplasmic heat-labile enterotoxin B-subunit, and the signal sequence of alkaline phosphatase. Several vectors are commercially available for the construction of fusion proteins which will direct the localization of a protein, such as the pMAL series of vectors (particularly the pMAL-p series) available from New England Biolabs. In a specific embodiment, polynucleotides encoding TR21 polypeptides of the invention may be fused to the pelB pectate lyase signal sequence to increase the efficiency of expression and purification of such polypeptides in Gram-negative bacteria. See, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,576,195 and 5,846,818, the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entireties.","Examples of signal peptides that may be fused to a polypeptide of the invention in order to direct its secretion in mammalian cells include, but are not limited to, the MPIF-1 signal sequence (amino acids 1\u201321 of GenBank Accession number AAB51134), the stanniocalcin signal sequence (MLQNSAVLLLLVISASA, SEQ ID NO:4), and a consensus signal sequence (MPTWAWWLFLVLLLALWAPARG, SEQ ID NO:5). A suitable signal sequence that may be used in conjunction with baculoviral expression systems is the gp67 signal sequence, (amino acids 1\u201319 of GenBank Accession Number AAA72759).","A preferred fusion protein comprises a heterologous region from immunoglobulin that is useful to solubilize proteins. For example, EP-A-O 464 533 (Canadian counterpart 2045869) discloses fusion proteins comprising various portions of constant region of immunoglobulin molecules together with another human protein or part thereof. In many cases, the Fc part in a fusion protein is thoroughly advantageous for use in therapy and diagnosis and thus results, for example, in improved pharmacokinetic properties (EP-A 0232 262). On the other hand, for some uses, it would be desirable to be able to delete the Fc part after the fusion protein has been expressed, detected and purified in the advantageous manner described. This is the case when the Fc portion proves to be a hindrance to use in therapy and diagnosis, for example, when the fusion protein is to be used as an antigen for immunizations. In drug discovery, for example, human proteins, such as the hIL5-receptor, have been fused with Fe portions for the purpose of high-throughput screening assays to identify antagonists of hIL-5. See, D. Bennett et al., 8:52\u201358 (1995) and K. Johanson et al., 270:16:9459\u20139471 (1995).","Polypeptides of the present invention include naturally purified products, products of chemical synthetic procedures, and products produced by recombinant techniques from a prokaryotic or eukaryotic host, including, for example, bacterial, yeast, higher plant, insect and mammalian cells. Depending upon the host employed in a recombinant production procedure, the polypeptides of the present invention may be glycosylated or non-glycosylated. In addition, polypeptides of the invention may also include an initial modified methionine residue, in some cases as a result of host-mediated processes.","In addition, proteins of the invention can be chemically synthesized using techniques known in the art (e.g., see Creighton, Proteins: Structures and Molecular Principles, W.H. Freeman & Co., N.Y. (1983), and Hunkapiller, et al., 310:105\u2013111 (1984)). For example, a polypeptide corresponding to a fragment of the TR21 polypeptides of the invention can be synthesized by use of a peptide synthesizer. Furthermore, if desired, nonclassical amino acids or chemical amino acid analogs can be introduced as a substitution or addition into the TR21 polypeptide sequence. Non-classical amino acids include, but are not limited to, to the D-isomers of the common amino acids, 2,4-diaminobutyric acid, a-amino isobutyric acid, 4-aminobutyric acid, Abu, 2-amino butyric acid, g-Abu, e-Ahx, 6-amino hexanoic acid, Aib, 2-amino isobutyric acid, 3-amino propionic acid, ornithine, norleucine, norvaline, hydroxyproline, sarcosine, citrulline, homocitrulline, cysteic acid, t-butylglycine, t-butylalanine, phenylglycine, cyclohexylalanine, b-alanine, fluoro-amino acids, designer amino acids such as b-methyl amino acids, Ca-methyl amino acids, Na-methyl amino acids, and amino acid analogs in general. Furthermore, the amino acid can be D (dextrorotary) or L (levorotary).","The invention additionally, encompasses TR21 polypeptides which are differentially modified during or after translation, e.g., by glycosylation, acetylation, phosphorylation, amidation, derivatization by known protecting\/blocking groups, proteolytic cleavage, linkage to an antibody molecule or other cellular ligand, etc. Any of numerous chemical modifications may be carried out by known techniques, including but not limited to, specific chemical cleavage by cyanogen bromide, trypsin, chymotrypsin, papain, V8 protease, NaBH, acetylation, formylation, oxidation, reduction, metabolic synthesis in the presence of tunicamycin; etc.","Additional post-translational modifications encompassed by the invention include, for example, e.g., N-linked or O-linked carbohydrate chains, processing of N-terminal or C-terminal ends), attachment of chemical moieties to the amino acid backbone, chemical modifications of N-linked or O-linked carbohydrate chains, and addition or deletion of an N-terminal methionine residue as a result of procaryotic host cell expression. The polypeptides may also be modified with a detectable label, such as an enzymatic, fluorescent, isotopic or affinity label to allow for detection and isolation of the protein.","In specific embodiments, TR21 polypeptides of the invention are attached to macrocyclic chelators useful for conjugating radiometal ions, including but not limited to, In, Lu, Y, Ho, and Sm, to polypeptides. In a preferred embodiment, the radiometal ion associated with the macrocyclic chelators attached to TR21 polypeptides of the invention is In. In another preferred embodiment, the radiometal ion associated with the macrocyclic chelator attached to TR21 polypeptides of the invention is Y. In specific embodiments, the macrocyclic chelator is 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-N,N\u2032,N\u2033,N\u2032\u2033-tetraacetic acid (DOTA). In other specific embodiments, the DOTA is attached to TR21 polypeptide of the invention via a linker molecule. Examples of linker molecules useful for conjugating DOTA to a polypeptide are commonly known in the art\u2014see, for example, DeNardo et al., Clin Cancer Res. 4(10):2483\u201390, 1998; Peterson et al., Bioconjug. Chem. 10(4):553\u20137, 1999; and Zimmerman et al., Nucl. Med. Biol. 26(8):943\u201350, 1999 which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. In addition, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,652,361 and 5,756,065, which disclose chelating agents that may be conjugated to antibodies, and methods for making and using them, are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties. Though U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,652,361 and 5,756,065 focus on conjugating chelating agents to antibodies, one skilled in the art could readily adapt the method disclosed therein in order to conjugate chelating agents to other polypeptides.","Also provided by the invention are chemically modified derivatives of TR21 which may provide additional advantages such as increased solubility, stability and circulating time of the polypeptide, or decreased immunogenicity (see U.S. Pat. No. 4,179,337). The chemical moieties for derivatization may be selected from water soluble polymers such as polyethylene glycol, ethylene glycol\/propylene glycol copolymers, carboxymethylcellulose, dextran, polyvinyl alcohol and the like. The polypeptides may be modified at random positions within the molecule, or at predetermined positions within the molecule and may include one, two, three or more attached chemical moieties.","The polymer may be of any molecular weight, and may be branched or unbranched. For polyethylene glycol, the preferred molecular weight is between about 1 kDa and about 100 kDa (the term \u201cabout\u201d indicating that in preparations of polyethylene glycol, some molecules will weigh more, some less, than the stated molecular weight) for ease in handling and manufacturing. Other sizes may be used, depending on the desired therapeutic profile (e.g., the duration of sustained release desired, the effects, if any on biological activity, the ease in handling, the degree or lack of antigenicity and other known effects of the polyethylene glycol to a therapeutic protein or analog). For example, the polyethylene glycol may have an average molecular weight of about 200, 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, 2500, 3000, 3500, 4000, 4500, 5000, 5500, 6000, 6500, 7000, 7500, 8000, 8500, 9000, 9500, 10,000, 10,500, 11,000, 11,500, 12,000, 12,500, 13,000, 13,500, 14,000, 14,500, 15,000, 15,500, 16,000, 16,500, 17,000, 17,500, 18,000, 18,500, 19,000, 19,500, 20,000, 25,000, 30,000, 35,000, 40,000, 50,000, 55,000, 60,000, 65,000, 70,000, 75,000, 80,000, 85,000, 90,000, 95,000, or 100,000 kDa.","As noted above, the polyethylene glycol may have a branched structure. Branched polyethylene glycols are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,643,575; Morpurgo et al., 56:59\u201372 (1996); Vorobjev et al., 18:2745\u20132750 (1999); and Caliceti et al., 10:638\u2013646 (1999), the disclosures of each of which are incorporated herein by reference.","The polyethylene glycol molecules (or other chemical moieties) should be attached to the protein with consideration of effects on functional or antigenic domains of the protein. There are a number of attachment methods available to those skilled in the art, e.g., EP 0 401 384, herein incorporated by reference (coupling PEG to G-CSF), see also Malik et al., 20:1028\u20131035 (1992) (reporting pegylation of GM-CSF using tresyl chloride). For example, polyethylene glycol may be covalently bound through amino acid residues via a reactive group, such as, a free amino or carboxyl group. Reactive groups are those to which an activated polyethylene glycol molecule may be bound. The amino acid residues having a free amino group may include lysine residues and the N-terminal amino acid residues; those having a free carboxyl group may include aspartic acid residues glutamic acid residues and the C-terminal amino acid residue. Sulhydryl groups may also be used as a reactive group for attaching the polyethylene glycol molecules. Preferred for therapeutic purposes is attachment at an amino group, such as attachment at the N-terminus or lysine group.","As suggested above, polyethylene glycol may be attached to proteins via linkage to any of a number of amino acid residues. For example, polyethylene glycol can be linked to a protein via covalent bonds to lysine, histidine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, or cysteine residues. One or more reaction chemistries may be employed to attach polyethylene glycol to specific amino acid residues (e.g., lysine, histidine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, or cysteine) of the protein or to more than one type of amino acid residue (e.g., lysine, histidine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, cysteine and combinations thereof) of the protein.","One may specifically desire proteins chemically modified at the N-terminus. Using polyethylene glycol as an illustration of the present composition, one may select from a variety of polyethylene glycol molecules (by molecular weight, branching, etc.), the proportion of polyethylene glycol molecules to protein (or peptide) molecules in the reaction mix, the type of pegylation reaction to be performed, and the method of obtaining the selected N-terminally pegylated protein. The method of obtaining the N-terminally pegylated preparation (i.e., separating this moiety from other monopegylated moieties if necessary) may be by purification of the N-terminally pegylated material from a population of pegylated protein molecules. Selective proteins chemically modified at the N-terminus modification may be accomplished by reductive alkylation which exploits differential reactivity of different types of primary amino groups (lysine versus the N-terminal) available for derivatization in a particular protein. Under the appropriate reaction conditions, substantially selective derivatization of the protein at the N-terminus with a carbonyl group containing polymer is achieved.","As indicated above, pegylation of the proteins of the invention may be accomplished by any number of means. For example, polyethylene glycol may be attached to the protein either directly or by an intervening linker. Linkerless systems for attaching polyethylene glycol to proteins are described in Delgado et al., 9:249\u2013304 (1992); Francis et al., 68:1\u201318 (1998); U.S. Pat. No. 4,002,531; U.S. Pat. No. 5,349,052; WO 95\/06058; and WO 98\/32466, the disclosures of each of which are incorporated herein by reference.","One system for attaching polyethylene glycol directly to amino acid residues of proteins without an intervening linker employs tresylated MPEG, which is produced by the modification of monomethoxy polyethylene glycol (MPEG) using tresylchloride (ClSOCHCF). Upon reaction of protein with tresylated MPEG, polyethylene glycol is directly attached to amine groups of the protein. Thus, the invention includes protein-polyethylene glycol conjugates produced by reacting proteins of the invention with a polyethylene glycol molecule having a 2,2,2-trifluoreothane sulphonyl group.","Polyethylene glycol can also be attached to proteins using a number of different intervening linkers. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,612,460, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference, discloses urethane linkers for connecting polyethylene glycol to proteins. Protein-polyethylene glycol conjugates wherein the polyethylene glycol is attached to the protein by a linker can also be produced by reaction of proteins with compounds such as MPEG-succinimidylsuccinate, MPEG activated with 1,1\u2032-carbonyldiimidazole, MPEG-2,4,5-trichloropenylcarbonate, MPEG-p-nitrophenolcarbonate, and various MPEG-succinate derivatives. A number additional polyethylene glycol derivatives and reaction chemistries for attaching polyethylene glycol to proteins are described in WO 98\/32466, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. Pegylated protein products produced using the reaction chemistries set out herein are included within the scope of the invention.","The number of polyethylene glycol moieties attached to each protein of the invention (i.e., the degree of substitution) may also vary. For example, the pegylated proteins of the invention may be linked, on average, to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 17, 20, or more polyethylene glycol molecules. Similarly, the average degree of substitution within ranges such as 1\u20133, 2\u20134, 3\u20135, 4\u20136, 5\u20137, 6\u20138, 7\u20139, 8\u201310, 9\u201311, 10\u201312, 11\u201313, 12\u201314, 13\u201315, 14\u201316, 15\u201317, 16\u201318, 17\u201319, or 18\u201320 polyethylene glycol moieties per protein molecule. Methods for determining the degree of substitution are discussed, for example, in Delgado et al., 9:249\u2013304 (1992).","As mentioned, the TR21 proteins of the invention may be modified by either natural processes, such as posttranslational processing, or by chemical modification techniques which are well known in the art. It will be appreciated that the same type of modification may be present in the same or varying degrees at several sites in a given TR21 polypeptide. TR21 polypeptides may be branched, for example, as a result of ubiquitination, and they may be cyclic, with or without branching. Cyclic, branched, and branched cyclic TR21 polypeptides may result from natural posttranslational processes or may be made by synthetic methods. Modifications include acetylation, acylation, ADP-ribosylation, amidation, covalent attachment of flavin, covalent attachment of a heme moiety, covalent attachment of a nucleotide or nucleotide derivative, covalent attachment of a lipid or lipid derivative, covalent attachment of phosphatidylinositol, cross-linking, cyclization, disulfide bond formation, demethylation, formation of covalent cross-links, formation of cysteine, formation of pyroglutamate, formylation, gamma-carboxylation, glycosylation, GPI anchor formation, hydroxylation, iodination, methylation, myristoylation, oxidation, pegylation, proteolytic processing, phosphorylation, prenylation, racemization, selenoylation, sulfation, transfer-RNA mediated addition of amino acids to proteins such as arginylation, and ubiquitination. (See, for instance, PROTEINS\u2014STRUCTURE AND MOLECULAR PROPERTIES, 2nd Ed., T. E. Creighton, W.H. Freeman and Company, New York (1993); POSTTRANSLATIONAL COVALENT MODIFICATION OF PROTEINS, B. C. Johnson, Ed., Academic Press, New York, pgs. 1\u201312 (1983); Seifter et al., 182:626\u2013646 (1990); Rattan et al., 663:48\u201362 (1992)).","The TR21 polypeptides of the invention can be recovered and purified from chemical synthesis and recombinant cell cultures by standard methods which include, but are not limited to, ammonium sulfate or ethanol precipitation, acid extraction, anion or cation exchange chromatography, phosphocellulose chromatography, hydrophobic interaction chromatography, affinity chromatography, hydroxyapatite chromatography and lectin chromatography. Most preferably, high performance liquid chromatography (\u201cHPLC\u201d) is employed for purification. Well-known techniques for refolding protein may be employed to regenerate active conformation when the polypeptide is denatured during isolation and\/or purification.","TR21 receptor polynucleotides and polypeptides may be used in accordance with the present invention for a variety of applications, particularly those that make use of the chemical and biological properties of TR21. Among these are applications in treatment of autoimmune diseases. Also contemplated are applications in the treatment of tumors, resistance to parasites, bacteria and viruses, to inhibit proliferation of B cells, to induce proliferation of T-cells, endothelial cells and certain hematopoietic cells, to treat restenosis, graft vs. host disease, to regulate anti-viral responses and to prevent certain autoimmune diseases after stimulation of TR21 by an agonist. Additional applications relate to diagnosis and to treatment of disorders of cells, tissues and organisms. These aspects of the invention are discussed further below.","TR21 Transgenics and \u201cKnock-Outs\u201d","The TR21 proteins of the invention can also be expressed in transgenic animals. Animals of any species, including, but not limited to, mice, rats, rabbits, hamsters, guinea pigs, pigs, micro-pigs, goats, sheep, cows and non-human primates, e.g., baboons, monkeys, and chimpanzees may be used to generate transgenic animals. In a specific embodiment, techniques described herein or otherwise known in the art, are used to express polypeptides of the invention in humans, as part of a gene therapy protocol.","Any technique known in the art may be used to introduce the transgene (i.e., nucleic acids of the invention) into animals to produce the founder lines of transgenic animals. Such techniques include, but are not limited to, pronuclear microinjection (Paterson et al., 40:691\u2013698 (1994); Carver et al., () 11:1263\u20131270 (1993); Wright et al., () 9:830\u2013834 (1991); and Hoppe et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,873,191 (1989)); retrovirus mediated gene transfer into germ lines (Van der Putten et al., 82:6148\u20136152 (1985)), blastocysts or embryos; gene targeting in embryonic stem cells (Thompson et al., 56:313\u2013321 (1989)); electroporation of cells or embryos (Lo, 3:1803\u20131814 (1983)); introduction of the polynucleotides of the invention using a gene gun (see, e.g., Ulmer et al., 259:1745 (1993); introducing nucleic acid constructs into embryonic pluripotent stem cells and transferring the stem cells back into the blastocyst; and sperm-mediated gene transfer (Lavitrano et al., 57:717\u2013723 (1989); etc. For a review of such techniques, see Gordon, \u201cTransgenic Animals,\u201d 115:171\u2013229 (1989), which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. Further, the contents of each of the documents recited in this paragraph is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. Gordon, \u201cTransgenic Animals,\u201d Intl. Rev. Cytol. 115:171\u2013229 (1989), which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. See also, U.S. Pat. No. 5,464,764 (Capecchi, et al., Positive-Negative Selection Methods and Vectors); U.S. Pat.

No. 4,736,866 (Leder, et al., Transgenic Non-Human Animals); and U.S. Pat. No. 4,873,191 (Wagner, et al., Genetic Transformation of Zygotes); each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.","Any technique known in the art may be used to produce transgenic clones containing polynucleotides of the invention, for example, nuclear transfer into enucleated oocytes of nuclei from cultured embryonic, fetal, or adult cells induced to quiescence (Campbell et al., 380:64\u201366 (1996); Wilmut et al., 385:810\u2013813 (1997)), each of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety).","The present invention provides for transgenic animals that carry the transgene in all their cells, as well as animals which carry the transgene in some, but not all their cells, i.e., mosaic animals or chimeric animals. The transgene may be integrated as a single transgene or as multiple copies such as in concatamers, e.g., head-to-head tandems or head-to-tail tandems. The transgene may also be selectively introduced into and activated in a particular cell type by following, for example, the teaching of Lasko et al. (89:6232\u20136236 (1992)). The regulatory sequences required for such a cell-type specific activation will depend upon the particular cell type of interest, and will be apparent to those of skill in the art. When it is desired that the polynucleotide transgene be integrated into the chromosomal site of the endogenous gene, gene targeting is preferred. Briefly, when such a technique is to be utilized, vectors containing some nucleotide sequences homologous to the endogenous gene are designed for the purpose of integrating, via homologous recombination with chromosomal sequences, into and disrupting the function of the nucleotide sequence of the endogenous gene. The transgene may also be selectively introduced into a particular cell type, thus inactivating the endogenous gene in only that cell type, by following, for example, the teaching of Gu et al. (265:103\u2013106 (1994)). The regulatory sequences required for such a cell-type specific inactivation will depend upon the particular cell type of interest, and will be apparent to those of skill in the art. The contents of each of the documents recited in this paragraph is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.","Once transgenic animals have been generated, the expression of the recombinant gene may be assayed utilizing standard techniques. Initial screening may be accomplished by Southern blot analysis or PCR techniques to analyze animal tissues to verify that integration of the transgene has taken place. The level of mRNA expression of the transgene in the tissues of the transgenic animals may also be assessed using techniques which include, but are not limited to, Northern blot analysis of tissue samples obtained from the animal, in situ hybridization analysis, and reverse transcriptase-PCR (rt-PCR). Samples of transgenic gene-expressing tissue may also be evaluated immunocytochemically or immunohistochemically using antibodies specific for the transgene product.","Once the founder animals are produced, they may be bred, inbred, outbred, or crossbred to produce colonies of the particular animal. Examples of such breeding strategies include, but are not limited to: outbreeding of founder animals with more than one integration site in order to establish separate lines; inbreeding of separate lines in order to produce compound transgenics that express the transgene at higher levels because of the effects of additive expression of each transgene; crossing of heterozygous transgenic animals to produce animals homozygous for a given integration site in order to both augment expression and eliminate the need for screening of animals by DNA analysis; crossing of separate homozygous lines to produce compound heterozygous or homozygous lines; and breeding to place the transgene on a distinct background that is appropriate for an experimental model of interest.","Transgenic and \u201cknock-out\u201d animals of the invention have uses which include, but are not limited to, animal model systems useful in elaborating the biological function of TR21 polypeptides, studying conditions and\/or disorders associated with aberrant TR21 expression, and in screening for compounds effective in ameliorating such conditions and\/or disorders.","In further embodiments of the invention, cells that are genetically engineered to express the proteins of the invention, or alternatively, that are genetically engineered not to express the proteins of the invention (e.g., knockouts) are administered to a patient in vivo. Such cells may be obtained from the patient (i.e., animal, including human) or an MHC compatible donor and can include, but are not limited to fibroblasts, bone marrow cells, blood cells (e.g., lymphocytes), adipocytes, muscle cells, endothelial cells, etc. The cells are genetically engineered in vitro using recombinant DNA techniques to introduce the coding sequence of polypeptides of the invention into the cells, or alternatively, to disrupt the coding sequence and\/or endogenous regulatory sequence associated with the polypeptides of the invention, e.g., by transduction (using viral vectors, and preferably vectors that integrate the transgene into the cell genome) or transfection procedures, including, but not limited to, the use of plasmids, cosmids, YACs, naked DNA, electroporation, liposomes, etc. The coding sequence of the polypeptides of the invention can be placed under the control of a strong constitutive or inducible promoter or promoter\/enhancer to achieve expression, and preferably secretion, of the polypeptides of the invention. The engineered cells which express and preferably secrete the polypeptides of the invention can be introduced into the patient systemically, e.g., in the circulation, or intraperitoneally. Alternatively, the cells can be incorporated into a matrix and implanted in the body, e.g., genetically engineered fibroblasts can be implanted as part of a skin graft; genetically engineered endothelial cells can be implanted as part of a lymphatic or vascular graft. (See, for example, Anderson et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5,399,349; and Mulligan & Wilson, U.S. Pat. No. 5,460,959, each of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety).","When the cells to be administered are non-autologous or non-MHC compatible cells, they can be administered using well-known techniques which prevent the development of a host immune response against the introduced cells. For example, the cells may be introduced in an encapsulated form which, while allowing for an exchange of components with the immediate extracellular environment, does not allow the introduced cells to be recognized by the host immune system.","TR21 Receptor Polypeptides and Fragments","The TR21 proteins (polypeptides) of the invention may be in monomers or multimers (i.e., dimers, trimers, tetramers, and higher multimers). Accordingly, the present invention relates to monomers and multimers of the TR21 proteins (polypeptides) of the invention, their preparation, and compositions (preferably, pharmaceutical compositions) containing them. In specific embodiments, the polypeptides of the invention are monomers, dimers, trimers or tetramers. In additional embodiments, the multimers of the invention are at least dimers, at least trimers, or at least tetramers.","Multimers encompassed by the invention may be homomers or heteromers. As used herein, the term homomer, refers to a multimer containing only TR21 proteins of the invention (including TR21 fragments, variants, and fusion proteins, as described herein). These homomers may contain TR21 proteins having identical or different polypeptide sequences. In a specific embodiment, a homomer of the invention is a multimer containing only TR21 proteins having an identical polypeptide sequence. In another specific embodiment, a homomer of the invention is a multimer containing TR21 proteins having different polypeptide sequences (e.g., TR21 mutations containing proteins have polypetide sequences. In specific embodiments, the multimer of the invention is a homodimer (e.g., containing TR21 proteins having identical or different polypeptide sequences) or a homotrimer (e.g., containing TR21 proteins having identical or different polypeptide sequences). In additional embodiments, the homomeric multimer of the invention is at least a homodimer, at least a homotrimer, or at least a homotetramer.","As used herein, the term heteromer refers to a multimer containing heterologous proteins (i.e., proteins containing only polypeptide sequences that do not correspond to polypeptide sequences encoded by the TR21 gene) in addition to the TR21 proteins of the invention. In a specific embodiment, the multimer of the invention is a heterodimer, a heterotrimer, or a heterotetramer. In additional embodiments, the heteromeric multimer of the invention is at least a heterodimer, at least a heterotrimer, or at least a heterotetramer.","Multimers of the invention may be the result of hydrophobic, hydrophilic, ionic and\/or covalent associations and\/or may be indirectly linked, by for example, liposome formation. Thus, in one embodiment, multimers of the invention, such as, for example, homodimers or homotrimers, are formed when proteins of the invention contact one another in solution. In another embodiment, heteromultimers of the invention, such as, for example, heterotrimers or heterotetramers, are formed when proteins of the invention contact antibodies to the polypeptides of the invention (including antibodies to the heterologous polypeptide sequence in a fusion protein of the invention) in solution. In other embodiments, multimers of the invention are formed by covalent associations with and\/or between the TR21 proteins of the invention. Such covalent associations may involve one or more amino acid residues contained in the polypeptide sequence of the protein (e.g., the polypeptide sequence shown in  (SEQ ID NO:2)). In one instance, the covalent associations are cross-linking between cysteine residues located within the polypeptide sequences of the proteins which interact in the native (i.e., naturally occurring) polypeptide. In another instance, the covalent associations are the consequence of chemical or recombinant manipulation. Alternatively, such covalent associations may involve one or more amino acid residues contained in the heterologous polypeptide sequence in a TR21 fusion protein. In one example, covalent associations are mediated by the heterologous sequence contained in a fusion protein of the invention (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,478,925). In a specific example, the covalent associations are mediated by the heterologous sequence contained in a TR21-Fc fusion protein of the invention (as described herein). In another specific example, covalent associations of fusion proteins of the invention are mediated by heterologous polypeptide sequences from other TNF family ligand\/receptor members that are capable of forming covalently associated multimers, such as for example, osteoprotegerin (see, e.g., International Publication No. WO 98\/49305, the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). In another embodiment, two or more TR21 polypeptides of the invention are joined through synthetic linkers (e.g., peptide, carbohydrate or soluble polymer linkers). Examples include those peptide linkers described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,073,627 (hereby incorporated by reference). Proteins comprising multiple TR21 polypeptides separated by peptide linkers may be produced using conventional recombinant DNA technology.","Another method for preparing multimeric TR21 polypeptides of the invention involves use of TR21 polypeptides fused to a leucine zipper or isoleucine zipper polypeptide sequence. Leucine zipper domains and isoleucine zipper domains are polypeptides that promote multimerization of the proteins in which they are found. Leucine zippers were originally identified in several DNA-binding proteins (Landschulz et al., 240:1759, (1988)), and have since been found in a variety of different proteins. Among the known leucine zippers are naturally occurring peptides and derivatives thereof that dimerize or trimerize. Examples of leucine zipper domains suitable for producing soluble multimeric TR21 proteins are those described in PCT application WO 94\/10308, hereby incorporated by reference. Recombinant fusion proteins comprising a soluble TR21 polypeptide fused to a peptide that dimerizes or trimerizes in solution are expressed in suitable host cells, and the resulting soluble multimeric TR21 is recovered from the culture supernatant using techniques known in the art.","Certain members of the TNF family of proteins are believed to exist in trimeric form (Beutler and Huffel, 264:667, 1994; Banner et al., 73:431, 1993). Thus, trimeric TR21 may offer the advantage of enhanced biological activity. Preferred leucine zipper moieties are those that preferentially form trimers. One example is a leucine zipper derived from lung surfactant protein D (SPD), as described in Hoppe et al. (344:191, (1994)) and in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08\/446,922, hereby incorporated by reference. Other peptides derived from naturally occurring trimeric proteins may be employed in preparing trimeric TR21.","In another example, proteins of the invention are associated by interactions between Flag\u00ae polypeptide sequences contained in Flag\u00ae-TR21 fusion proteins of the invention. In a further embodiment, associated proteins of the invention are associated by interactions between heterologous polypeptide sequence contained in Flag\u00ae-TR21 fusion proteins of the invention and anti-Flag\u00ae antibody.","The multimers of the invention may be generated using chemical techniques known in the art. For example, proteins desired to be contained in the multimers of the invention may be chemically cross-linked using linker molecules and linker molecule length optimization techniques known in the art (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,478,925, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). Additionally, multimers of the invention may be generated using techniques known in the art to form one or more inter-molecule cross-links between the cysteine residues located within the polypeptide sequence of the proteins desired to be contained in the multimer (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,478,925, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). Further, proteins of the invention may be routinely modified by the addition of cysteine or biotin to the C terminus or N-terminus of the polypeptide sequence of the protein and techniques known in the art may be applied to generate multimers containing one or more of these modified proteins (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,478,925, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). Additionally, techniques known in the art may be applied to generate liposomes containing the protein components desired to be contained in the multimer of the invention (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,478,925, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety).","Alternatively, multimers of the invention may be generated using genetic engineering techniques known in the art. In one embodiment, proteins contained in multimers of the invention are produced recombinantly using fusion protein technology described herein or otherwise known in the art (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,478,925, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). In a specific embodiment, polynucleotides coding for a homodimer of the invention are generated by ligating a polynucleotide sequence encoding a polypeptide of the invention to a sequence encoding a linker polypeptide and then further to a synthetic polynucleotide encoding the translated product of the polypeptide in the reverse orientation from the original C-terminus to the N-terminus (lacking the leader sequence) (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,478,925, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). In another embodiment, recombinant techniques described herein or otherwise known in the art are applied to generate recombinant polypeptides of the invention which contain a transmembrane domain and which can be incorporated by membrane reconstitution techniques into liposomes (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,478,925, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety).","The polypeptides of the present invention are preferably provided in an isolated form. By \u201cisolated polypeptide\u201d is intended a polypeptide removed from its native environment. Thus, a polypeptide produced and\/or contained within a recombinant host cell is considered isolated for purposes of the present invention. Also intended as an \u201cisolated polypeptide\u201d are polypeptides that have been purified, partially or substantially, from a recombinant host cell. For example, a recombinantly produced version of the TR21 polypeptide can be substantially purified by the one-step method described in Smith and Johnson, 67:31\u201340 (1988).","Accordingly, in one embodiment, the invention provides an isolated TR21 polypeptide having the amino acid sequence encoded by the amino acid sequence in  (SEQ ID NO:2), or a polypeptide comprising, or alternatively consisting of, a portion of the above polypeptides, such as for example, a mature TR21, the TR21 extracellular domain (amino acids 1 to 81 of  (SEQ ID NO:2)), the TR21 cysteine rich motif (amino acids 19 to 35 of  (SEQ ID NO:2)), and\/or the TR21 intracellular domain (amino acids 102 to 184 of  (SEQ ID NO:2)).","Polypeptide fragments of the present invention include polypeptides comprising or alternatively, consisting of: an amino acid sequence contained in  (SEQ ID NO:2); and encoded by a nucleic acid which hybridizes (e.g., under stringent hybridization conditions) to the complementary strand of the nucleotide sequence shown in  (SEQ ID NO:1), or a fragment thereof. Polynucleotides encoding these polypeptides are also encompassed by the invention.","Protein fragments may be \u201cfree-standing,\u201d or comprised within a larger polypeptide of which the fragment forms a part or region, most preferably as a single continuous region. Representative examples of polypeptide fragments of the invention, include, for example, fragments that comprise or alternatively, consist of about amino acid residues: 1 to 2, 3 to 15, 16 to 18, 19 to 26, 27 to 35, 36 to 38, 39 to 45, 46 to 50, 51 to 53, 54 to 58, 59 to 61, 62 to 70, 71 to 81, 82 to 101, 102 to 103, 104 to 112, 113 to 114, 115 to 122, 123 to 135, 136 to 138, 139 to 146, 147 to 153, 154 to 177, 178 to 182 and\/or 183 to 184, of SEQ ID NO:2 or . In this context \u201cabout\u201d includes the particularly recited ranges, ranges larger or smaller by several (5, 4, 3, 2, or 1) amino acids, at either extreme or at both extremes. Moreover, polypeptide fragments can be at least 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120, 130, 140, 150 or amino acids in length. Polynucleotides encoding these polypeptides are also encompassed by the invention. Polynucleotides encoding these polypeptides are also encompassed by the invention.","In additional embodiments, the polypeptide fragments of the invention comprise, or alternatively consist of, one or more TR21 domains. Preferred polypeptide fragments of the present invention include one, two, three or more members selected from the group: (a) a polypeptide comprising or alternatively, consisting of, the TR21 extracellular domain (predicted to constitute amino acid residues 1 to 81  (SEQ ID NO:2)); (b) a polypeptide comprising or alternatively, consisting of, the TR21 cysteine rich domain (predicted to constitute amino acid residues 19 to 35  (SEQ ID NO:2)); (c) a polypeptide comprising or alternatively, consisting of, the TR21 transmembrane domain (predicted to constitute amino acid residues 82 to 101  (SEQ ID NO:2)); (d) a polypeptide comprising or alternatively, consisting of, the TR21 intracellular domain (predicted to constitute amino acid residues 102 to 184  (SEQ ID NO:2)); (e) a polypeptide comprising, or alternatively, consisting of, one, two, three, four or more, epitope bearing portions of the TR21 protein; or (f) any combination of polypeptides (a)\u2013(e). Polynucleotides encoding these polypeptides are also encompassed by the invention.","As discussed above, it is believed that the extracellular cysteine rich motif of TR21 is important for interactions between TR21 and its ligands (e.g., Neutrokine-alpha). Accordingly, in preferred embodiments, polypeptides of the invention comprise, or alternatively consist of amino acid residues 19 to 35 of  (SEQ ID NO:2). Proteins comprising or alternatively consisting of a polypeptide sequence which is at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 92%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% identical to the polypeptide sequences of the cysteine rich motif are also encompassed by the invention. Polynucleotides encoding these polypeptides are also encompassed by the invention.","Among the especially preferred fragments of the invention are fragments characterized by structural or functional attributes of TR21. Such fragments include amino acid residues that comprise alpha-helix and alpha-helix forming regions (\u201calpha-regions\u201d), beta-sheet and beta-sheet-forming regions (\u201cbeta-regions\u201d), turn and turn-forming regions (\u201cturn-regions\u201d), coil and coil-forming regions (\u201ccoil-regions\u201d), hydrophilic regions, hydrophobic regions, alpha amphipathic regions, beta amphipathic regions, surface forming regions, and high antigenic index regions (i.e., containing three or more contiguous amino acids having an antigenic index of greater than or equal to 1.5, as identified using the default parameters of the Jameson-Wolf program) of complete (i.e., full-length) TR21 ( (SEQ ID NO:2)). Certain preferred regions are those set out in  and Table 1 and include, but are not limited to, regions of the aforementioned types identified by analysis of the amino acid sequence depicted in  (SEQ ID NO:2), such preferred regions include; Garnier-Robson predicted alpha-regions, beta-regions, turn-regions, and coil-regions; Chou-Fasman predicted alpha-regions, beta-regions, and turn-regions; Kyte-Doolittle predicted hydrophilic; Hopp-Woods predicted hydrophobic regions; Eisenberg alpha and beta amphipathic regions; Emini surface-forming regions; and Jameson-Wolf high antigenic index regions, as predicted using the default parameters of these computer programs. Polynucleotides encoding these polypeptides are also encompassed by the invention.","As mentioned above, even if deletion of one or more amino acids from the N-terminus of a protein results in modification of loss of one or more biological functions of the protein, other functional activities (e.g., biological activities, ability to multimerize, ability to bind TR21 ligand (e.g., Neutrokine-alpha)) may still be retained. For instance, Ron et al., J. Biol. Chem., 268:2984\u20132988 (1993) reported modified KGF proteins that had heparin binding activity even if 3, 8, or 27 amino-terminal amino acid residues were missing. The ability of shortened TR21 \u201cmuteins\u201d to induce and\/or bind to antibodies which recognize the complete or mature forms of the polypeptides generally will be retained when less than the majority of the residues of the complete or mature polypeptide are removed from the N-terminus. As used herein, a \u201cmutein\u201d is a mutant protein including single or multiple amino acid substitutions, deletions, or additions (including fusion proteins). Whether a particular polypeptide lacking N-terminal residues of a complete full-length polypeptide retains such immunologic activities can readily be determined by routine methods described herein and otherwise known in the art. It is not unlikely that a TR21 mutein with a large number of deleted N-terminal amino acid residues may retain some biological or immunogenic activities. In fact, peptides composed of as few as six TR21 amino acid residues may often evoke an immune response.","Accordingly, the present invention further provides polypeptides having one or more residues deleted from the amino terminus of the TR21 amino acid sequence shown in , up to the alanine residue at position number 179 and polynucleotides encoding such polypeptides. In particular, the present invention provides polypeptides comprising, or alternatively consisting of, the amino acid sequence of residues n-184 of , where nis an integer from 2 to 179 corresponding to the position of the amino acid residue in  (SEQ ID NO:2).","More in particular, N-terminal deletions of the TR21 polypeptide of the invention shown as SEQ ID NO:2 include polypeptides comprising the amino acid sequence of residues: R-2 to Q-184; R-3 to Q-184; G-4 to Q-184; P-5 to Q-184; R-6 to Q-184; S-7 to Q-184; L-8 to Q-184; R-9 to Q-184; G-10 to Q-184; R-11 to Q-184; D-12 to Q-184; A-13 to Q-184; P-14 to Q-184; A-15 to Q-184; P-16 to Q-184; T-17 to Q-184; P-18 to Q-184; C-19 to Q-184; V-20 to Q-184; P-21 to Q-184; A-22 to Q-184; E-23 to Q-184; C-24 to Q-184; F-25 to Q-184; D-26 to Q-184; L-27 to Q-184; L-28 to Q-184; V-29 to Q-184; R-30 to Q-184; H-31 to Q-184; C-32 to Q-184; V-33 to Q-184; A-34 to Q-184; C-35 to Q-184; G-36 to Q-184; L-37 to Q-184; L-38 to Q-184; R-39 to Q-184; T-40 to Q-184; P-41 to Q-184; R-42 to Q-184; P-43 to Q-184; K-44 to Q-184; P-45 to Q-184; A-46 to Q-184; G-47 to Q-184; A-48 to Q-184; S-49 to Q-184; S-50 to Q-184; P-51 to Q-184; A-52 to Q-184; P-53 to Q-184; R-54 to Q-184; T-55 to Q-184; A-56 to Q-184; L-57 to Q-184; Q-58 to Q-184; P-59 to Q-184; Q-60 to Q-184; E-61 to Q-184; S-62 to Q-184; V-63 to Q-184; G-64 to Q-184; A-65 to Q-184; G-66 to Q-184; A-67 to Q-184; G-68 to Q-184; E-69 to Q-184; A-70 to Q-184; A-71 to Q-184; L-72 to Q-184; P-73 to Q-184; L-74 to Q-184; P-75 to Q-184; G-76 to Q-184; L-77 to Q-184; L-78 to Q-184; F-79 to Q-184; G-80 to Q-184; A-81 to Q-184; P-82 to Q-184; A-83 to Q-184; L-84 to Q-184; L-85 to Q-184; G-86 to Q-184; L-87 to Q-184; A-88 to Q-184; L-89 to Q-184; V-90 to Q-184; L-91 to Q-184; A-92 to Q-184; L-93 to Q-184; V-94 to Q-184; L-95 to Q-184; V-96 to Q-184; G-97 to Q-184; L-98 to Q-184; V-99 to Q-184; S-100 to Q-184; W-101 to Q-184; R-102 to Q-184; R-103 to Q-184; R-104 to Q-184; Q-105 to Q-184; R-106 to Q-184; R-107 to Q-184; L-108 to Q-184; R-109 to Q-184; G-110 to Q-184; A-111 to Q-184; S-112 to Q-184; S-113 to Q-184; A-114 to Q-184; E-115 to Q-184; A-116 to Q-184; P-117 to Q-184; D-118 to Q-184; G-119 to Q-184; D-120 to Q-184; K-121 to Q-184; D-122 to Q-184; A-123 to Q-184; P-124 to Q-184; E-125 to Q-184; P-126 to Q-184; L-127 to Q-184; D-128 to Q-184; K-129 to Q-184; V-130 to Q-184; I-131 to Q-184; I-132 to Q-184; L-133 to Q-184; S-134 to Q-184; P-135 to Q-184; G-136 to Q-184; I-137 to Q-184; S-138 to Q-184; D-139 to Q-184; A-140 to Q-184; T-141 to Q-184; A-142 to Q-184; P-143 to Q-184; A-144 to Q-184; W-145 to Q-184; P-146 to Q-184; P-147 to Q-184; P-148 to Q-184; G-149 to Q-184; E-150 to Q-184; D-151 to Q-184; P-152 to Q-184; G-153 to Q-184; T-154 to Q-184; T-155 to Q-184; P-156 to Q-184; P-157 to Q-184; G-158 to Q-184; H-159 to Q-184; S-160 to Q-184; V-161 to Q-184; P-162 to Q-184; V-163 to Q-184; P-164 to Q-184; A-165 to Q-184; T-166 to Q-184; E-167 to Q-184; L-168 to Q-184; G-169 to Q-184; S-170 to Q-184; T-171 to Q-184; E-172 to Q-184; L-173 to Q-184; V-174 to Q-184; T-175 to Q-184; T-176 to Q-184; K-177 to Q-184; T-178 to Q-184; and\/or A-179 to Q-184 of the TR21 sequence disclosed as SEQ ID NO:2 and shown in .

Polynucleotides encoding these polypeptides are also encompassed by the invention.","The present invention encompasses TR21 polypeptides comprising, or alternatively consisting of, an epitope of the polypeptide having an amino acid sequence of  (SEQ ID NO:2), or an epitope of a polypeptide sequence encoded by a polynucleotide that hybridizes to the complement of the sequence of SEQ ID NO:1 (e.g., under stringent hybridization conditions or lower stringency hybridization conditions as defined herein). The present invention further encompasses polynucleotide sequences encoding an epitope of a TR21 polypeptide sequence of the invention (such as, for example, the sequence disclosed in SEQ ID NO:2), polynucleotide sequences of the complementary strand of a polynucleotide sequence encoding an epitope of the invention, and polynucleotide sequences which hybridize to this complementary strand (e.g., under stringent hybridization conditions or lower stringency hybridization conditions defined herein).","The term \u201cepitopes,\u201d as used herein, refers to portions of a polypeptide having antigenic or immunogenic activity in an animal, preferably a mammal, and most preferably in a human. In a preferred embodiment, the present invention encompasses a polypeptide comprising an epitope, as well as the polynucleotide encoding this polypeptide. An \u201cimmunogenic epitope,\u201d as used herein, is defined as a portion of a protein that elicits an antibody response in an animal, as determined by any method known in the art, for example, by the methods for generating antibodies described herein. (See, e.g., Geysen et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81:3998\u20134002 (1983)). Further still, U.S. Pat. No. 5,194,392 to Geysen (1990) describes a general method of detecting or determining the sequence of monomers (amino acids or other compounds) which is a topological equivalent of the epitope (i.e., a \u201cmimotope\u201d) which is complementary to a particular paratope (antigen binding site) of an antibody of interest. More generally, U.S. Pat. No. 4,433,092 to Geysen (1989) describes a method of detecting or determining a sequence of monomers which is a topographical equivalent of a ligand which is complementary to the ligand-binding site of a particular receptor of interest. Similarly, U.S. Pat. No. 5,480,971 to Houghten, R. A. et al. (1996) on Peralkylated Oligopeptide Mixtures discloses linear C1\u2013C7-alkyl peralkylated oligopeptides and sets and libraries of such peptides, as well as methods for using such oligopeptide sets and libraries for determining the sequence of a peralkylated oligopeptide that preferentially binds to an acceptor molecule of interest. Thus, non-peptide analogs of the epitope-bearing peptides of the invention also can be made routinely by these methods. Antibodies that specifically bind TR21 are also encompassed by the invention.","The term \u201cantigenic epitope,\u201d as used herein, is defined as a portion of a protein to which an antibody can immunospecifically bind its antigen as determined by any method well known in the art, for example, by the immunoassays described herein. Immunospecific binding excludes non-specific binding but does not necessarily exclude cross-reactivity with other antigens. Antigenic epitopes need not necessarily be immunogenic.","Fragments which function as epitopes may be produced by any conventional means. (See, e.g., Houghten, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82:5131\u20135135 (1985), further described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,631,211).","In the present invention, antigenic epitopes preferably contain a sequence of at least 3, at least 4, at least 5, at least 6, at least 7, more preferably at least 8, at least 9, at least 10, at least 11, at least 12, at least 13, at least 14, at least 15, at least 20, at least 25, at least 30, at least 40, at least 50, and, most preferably, between about 15 to about 30 amino acids. Preferred polypeptides comprising immunogenic or antigenic epitopes are at least 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, or 100 amino acid residues in length.","Non-limiting examples of antigenic polypeptides of the invention include one, two, three, four, five, or more members selected from the group: a polypeptide comprising, or alternatively consisting of, amino acid residues from about Arg-3 to about Ala-15 in  (SEQ ID NO:2); a polypeptide comprising, or alternatively consisting of, amino acid residues from about Arg-39 to about Pro-45 in  (SEQ ID NO:2); a polypeptide comprising, or alternatively consisting of, amino acid residues from about Pro-51 to about Pro-53 in  (SEQ ID NO:2); a polypeptide comprising, or alternatively consisting of, amino acid residues from about Pro-59 to Glu-61 in  (SEQ ID NO:2); a polypeptide comprising, or alternatively consisting of, amino acid residues from about Arg-104 to about Ser-112 in  (SEQ ID NO:2); a polypeptide comprising, or alternatively consisting of, amino acid residues from about Glu-115 to about Asp-122 in  (SEQ ID NO:2); a polypeptide comprising, or alternatively consisting of, amino acid residues from about Gly-136 to about Ser-138 in  (SEQ ID NO:2); a polypeptide comprising, or alternatively consisting of, amino acid residues from about Pro-147 to about Gly-153 in  (SEQ ID NO:2); and a polypeptide comprising, or alternatively consisting of, amino acid residues from about Thr-178 to Glu-182 in  (SEQ ID NO:2). In this context, \u201cabout\u201d means the particularly recited ranges and ranges that are larger or smaller by several, a few, 5, 4, 3, 2 or 1 amino acid residues at either or both the amino- and carboxy-termini. These polypeptide fragments have been determined to bear antigenic epitopes of the TR21 polypeptide by the analysis of the Jameson-Wolf antigenic index, as shown in  and Table I, above. Additional non-exclusive preferred antigenic epitopes include the antigenic epitopes disclosed herein, as well as portions thereof. Antigenic epitopes are useful, for example, to raise antibodies, including monoclonal antibodies that specifically bind the epitope. Preferred antigenic epitopes include the antigenic epitopes disclosed herein, as well as any combination of two, three, four, five or more of these antigenic epitopes. Antigenic epitopes can be used as the target molecules in immunoassays. (See, e.g., Wilson et al., Cell 37:767\u2013778 (1984); Sutcliffe et al., Science 219:660\u2013666 (1983)). Polynucleotides encoding these polypeptides are encompassed by the invention. Additionally, antibodies that bind to one or more of these polypeptides are also encompassed by the invention.","Additional polypeptides of the invention include one, two, three, four, five, six, seven or more members selected from the group consisting of, amino acids 3 to 15 in SEQ ID NO:2; amino acids 39 to 45 in SEQ ID NO:2; amino acids 51 to 53 in SEQ ID NO:2; amino acids 59 to 61 in SEQ ID NO:2; amino acids 104 to 112 in SEQ ID NO:2; amino acids 136 to 138 in SEQ ID NO:2; amino acids 147 to 153 in SEQ ID NO:2; and amino acids 178 to 182 in SEQ ID NO:2. Polynucleotides encoding these polypeptides are encompassed by the invention. Additionally, antibodies that bind to one or more of these polypeptides are also encompassed by the invention.","Similarly, immunogenic epitopes can be used, for example, to induce antibodies according to methods well known in the art. (See, for instance, Sutcliffe et al., supra; Wilson et al., supra; Chow et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82:910\u2013914; and Bittle et al., J. Gen. Virol. 66:2347\u20132354 (1985). Preferred immunogenic epitopes include the immunogenic epitopes disclosed herein, as well as any combination of two, three, four, five, six, seven or more of these immunogenic epitopes. The polypeptides comprising one or more immunogenic epitopes may be presented for eliciting an antibody response together with a carrier protein, such as an albumin, to an animal system (such as rabbit or mouse), or, if the polypeptide is of sufficient length (at least about 25 amino acids), the polypeptide may be presented without a carrier. However, immunogenic epitopes comprising as few as 8 to 10 amino acids have been shown to be sufficient to raise antibodies capable of binding to, at the very least, linear epitopes in a denatured polypeptide (e.g., in Western blotting).","Epitope-bearing polypeptides of the present invention may be used to induce antibodies according to methods well known in the art including, but not limited to, in vivo immunization, in vitro immunization, and phage display methods. See, e.g., Sutcliffe et al., supra; Wilson et al., supra, and Bittle et al., J. Gen. Virol., 66:2347\u20132354 (1985). If in vivo immunization is used, animals may be immunized with free peptide; however, anti-peptide antibody titer may be boosted by coupling the peptide to a macromolecular carrier, such as keyhole limpet Hemocyanin (KLH) or tetanus toxoid. For instance, peptides containing cysteine residues may be coupled to a carrier using a linker such as maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (MBS), while other peptides may be coupled to carriers using a more general linking agent such as glutaraldehyde. Animals such as rabbits, rats and mice are immunized with either free or carrier-coupled peptides, for instance, by intraperitoneal and\/or intradermal injection of emulsions containing about 100 \u03bcg of peptide or carrier protein and Freund's adjuvant or any other adjuvant known for stimulating an immune response. Several booster injections may be needed, for instance, at intervals of about two weeks, to provide a useful titer of anti-peptide antibody which can be detected, for example, by ELISA assay using free peptide adsorbed to a solid surface. The titer of anti-peptide antibodies in serum from an immunized animal may be increased by selection of anti-peptide antibodies, for instance, by adsorption to the peptide on a solid support and elution of the selected antibodies according to methods well known in the art.","As one of skill in the art will appreciate, and as discussed above, the polypeptides of the present invention comprising an immunogenic or antigenic epitope can be fused to other polypeptide sequences. For example, the polypeptides of the present invention may be fused with the constant domain of immunoglobulins (IgA, IgE, IgG, IgM), or portions thereof (CH1, CH2, CH3, or any combination thereof and portions thereof), or albumin (including, but not limited to, recombinant human albumin and fragments or variants thereof (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,876,969, EP Patent 0413622, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,766,883, herein incorporated by reference in their entirety). Such fusion proteins may facilitate purification and may increase half-life in vivo. This has been shown for chimeric proteins consisting of the first two domains of the human CD4-polypeptide and various domains of the constant regions of the heavy or light chains of mammalian immunoglobulins. See, e.g., EP 394,827; Traunecker et al., Nature, 331:84\u201386 (1988). Enhanced delivery of an antigen across the epithelial barrier to the immune system has been demonstrated for antigens (e.g., insulin) conjugated to an FcRn binding partner such as IgG or Fc fragments (see, e.g., PCT Publications WO 96\/22024 and WO 99\/04813). IgG Fusion proteins that have a disulfide-linked dimeric structure due to the IgG portion disulfide bonds have also been found to be more efficient in binding and neutralizing other molecules than monomeric polypeptides or fragments thereof alone. See, e.g., Fountoulakis et al., J. Biochem., 270:3958\u20133964 (1995). Nucleic acids encoding the above epitopes can also be recombined with a gene of interest as an epitope tag (e.g., the hemagglutinin (\u201cHA\u201d) tag or flag tag) to aid in detection and purification of the expressed polypeptide. For example, a system described by Janknecht et al. allows for the ready purification of non-denatured fusion proteins expressed in human cell lines (Janknecht et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88:8972\u2013897(1991)). In this system, the gene of interest is subcloned into a vaccinia recombination plasmid such that the open reading frame of the gene is translationally fused to an amino-terminal tag consisting of six histidine residues. The tag serves as a matrix-binding domain for the fusion protein. Extracts from cells infected with the recombinant vaccinia virus are loaded onto Ni2+ nitriloacetic acid-agarose column and histidine-tagged proteins can be selectively eluted with imidazole-containing buffers.","Additional fusion proteins of the invention may be generated through the techniques of gene shuffling, motif shuffling, exon shuffling and\/or codon-shuffling (collectively referred to as \u201cDNA shuffling\u201d). DNA shuffling may be employed to modulate the activities of polypeptides of the invention, such methods can be used to generate polypeptides with altered activity, as well as agonists and antagonists of the polypeptides. See, generally, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,605,793; 5,811,238; 5,830,721; 5,834,252; and 5,837,458, and Patten et al., Curr. Opinion Biotechnol. 8:724\u201333 (1997); Harayama, Trends Biotechnol. 16(2):76\u201382 (1998); Hansson, et al., J. Mol. Biol. 287:265\u201376 (1999); and Lorenzo and Blasco, Biotechniques 24(2):308\u201313 (1998) (each of these patents and publications are hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety). In one embodiment, alteration of TR21 polynucleotides corresponding to  (SEQ ID NO:1) and the polypeptides encoded by these polynucleotides may be achieved by DNA shuffling. DNA shuffling involves the assembly of two or more DNA segments by homologous or site-specific recombination to generate variation in the polynucleotide sequence. In another embodiment polynucleotides of the invention, or polypeptides encoded thereby, may be altered by random mutagenesis by error-prone PCR, random nucleotide insertion or other methods prior to recombination. In another embodiment, one or more components, motifs, sections, parts, domains, fragments, etc., of a polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide of the invention may be recombined with one or more components, motifs, sections, parts, domains, fragments, etc. of one or more heterologous molecules.","It will be recognized in the art that some amino acid sequences of TR21 can be varied without significant effect on the structure or function of the protein. If such differences in sequence are contemplated, it should be remembered that there will be critical areas on the protein which determine activity. Thus, the invention further includes variations of the TR21 receptor, which show substantial TR21 receptor activity or which include regions of TR21 proteins, such as the protein portions discussed herein. Such mutants include deletions, insertions, inversions, repeats, and type substitutions. As indicated above, guidance concerning which amino acid changes are likely to be phenotypically silent can be found in J. U. Bowie et al., 247:1306\u20131310 (1990).","Thus, the fragment, derivative, or analog of the polypeptide of  (SEQ ID NO:2), may be (i) one in which at least one or more of the amino acid residues are substituted with a conserved or non-conserved amino acid residue (preferably a conserved amino acid residue(s), and more preferably at least one but less than ten conserved amino acid residues) and such substituted amino acid residue may or may not be one encoded by the genetic code, or (ii) one in which one or more of the amino acid residues includes a substituent group, or (iii) one in which the mature polypeptide is fused with another compound, such as a compound to increase the half-life of the polypeptide (for example, polyethylene glycol), or (iv) one in which the additional amino acids are fused to the mature polypeptide, such as an IgG Fc fusion region peptide or leader or secretory sequence or a sequence which is employed for purification of the mature polypeptide or a proprotein sequence. Such fragments, derivatives and analogs are deemed to be within the scope of those skilled in the art from the teachings herein.","Of particular interest are substitutions of charged amino acids with another charged amino acid and with neutral or negatively charged amino acids. The latter results in proteins with reduced positive charge to improve the characteristics of the TR21 receptor protein. The prevention of aggregation is highly desirable. Aggregation of proteins not only results in a loss of activity but can also be problematic when preparing pharmaceutical formulations, because they can be immunogenic. (Pinckard et al., 2:331\u2013340 (1967); Robbins et al., 36:838\u2013845 (1987); Cleland et al. 10:307\u2013377 (1993)).","The replacement of amino acids can also change the selectivity of binding to cell surface receptors. Ostade et al., 361:266\u2013268 (1993), describes certain mutations resulting in selective binding of TNF-\u03b1 to only one of the two known types of TNF receptors. Thus, the TR21 polypeptide receptors of the present invention may include one or more amino acid substitutions, deletions, or additions, either from natural mutations or human manipulation.","As indicated, changes are preferably of a minor nature, such as conservative amino acid substitutions that do not significantly affect the folding or activity of the protein (see Table II).","Table II.

Polynucleotides encoding these polypeptides are also encompassed by the invention. The resulting TR21 of the invention may be routinely screened for TR21 functional activity and\/or physical properties (such as, for example, enhanced or reduced stability and\/or solubility). Preferably, the resulting proteins of the invention have an increased and\/or a decreased TR21 functional activity. More preferably, the resulting TR21 proteins of the invention have more than one increased and\/or decreased TR21 functional activity and\/or physical property.","Amino acids in the TR21 proteins of the present invention that are essential for function can be identified by methods known in the art, such as site-directed mutagenesis or alanine-scanning mutagenesis (Cunningham and Wells, 244:1081\u20131085 (1989)). The latter procedure introduces single alanine mutations at every residue in the molecule. The resulting mutant molecules are then tested for biological activity such as receptor binding or in vitro proliferative activity. Sites that are critical for ligand-receptor binding can also be determined by structural analysis such as crystallization, nuclear magnetic resonance or photoaffinity labeling (Smith et al., 224:899\u2013904 (1992) and de Vos et al. 255:306\u2013312 (1992)).","Of special interest are substitutions of charged amino acids with other charged or neutral amino acids that may produce proteins with highly desirable improved characteristics, such as less aggregation. Aggregation may not only reduce activity but also be problematic when preparing pharmaceutical formulations, because aggregates can be immunogenic (Pinckard et al., 2:331\u2013340 (1967); Robbins et al., Diabetes 36: 838\u2013845 (1987); Cleland et al., 10:307\u2013377 (1993).","In another embodiment, the invention provides for polypeptides having amino acid sequences containing non-conservative substitutions of the amino acid sequence provided in SEQ ID NO:2.

and\/or Q184 replaced with D, E, H, K, R, A, G, I, L, S, T, M, V, F, W, Y, P, or C. Polynucleotides encoding these polypeptides are also encompassed by the invention. The resulting TR21 proteins of the invention may be routinely screened for TR21 functional activities and\/or physical properties (such as, for example, enhanced or reduced stability and\/or solubility) described throughout the specification and known in the art. Preferably, the resulting proteins of the invention have an increased and\/or a decreased TR21 functional activity. More preferably, the resulting TR21 proteins of the invention have more than one increased and\/or decreased TR21 functional activity and\/or physical property.","To improve or alter the characteristics of TR21 polypeptides, protein engineering may be employed. Recombinant DNA technology known to those skilled in the art can be used to create novel mutant proteins or \u201cmuteins including single or multiple amino acid substitutions, deletions, additions or fusion proteins. Such modified polypeptides can show, e.g., enhanced activity or increased stability. In addition, they may be purified in higher yields and show better solubility than the corresponding natural polypeptide, at least under certain purification and storage conditions.","Non-naturally occurring variants may be produced using art-known mutagenesis techniques, which include, but are not limited to oligonucleotide mediated mutagenesis, alanine scanning, PCR mutagenesis, site directed mutagenesis (see e.g., Carter et al., 13:4331 (1986); and Zoller et al., 10:6487 (1982)), cassette mutagenesis (see e.g., Wells et al., 34:315 (1985)), restriction selection mutagenesis (see e.g., Wells et al., 317:415 (1986)).","Thus, the invention also encompasses TR21 derivatives and analogs that have one or more amino acid residues deleted, added, or substituted to generate TR21 polypeptides that are better suited for expression, scale up, etc., in the host cells chosen. For example, cysteine residues can be deleted or substituted with another amino acid residue in order to eliminate disulfide bridges; N-linked glycosylation sites can be altered or eliminated to achieve, for example, expression of a homogeneous product that is more easily recovered and purified from yeast hosts which are known to hyperglycosylate N-linked sites. To this end, a variety of amino acid substitutions at one or both of the first or third amino acid positions on any one or more of the glycosylation recognitions sequences in the TR21 polypeptides of the invention, and\/or an amino acid deletion at the second position of any one or more such recognition sequences will prevent glycosylation of the TR21 at the modified tripeptide sequence (see, e.g., Miyajimo et al., 5(6):1193\u20131197). Additionally, one or more of the amino acid residues of the polypeptides of the invention (e.g., arginine and lysine residues) may be deleted or substituted with another residue to eliminate undesired processing by proteases such as, for example, furins or kexins.","The polypeptides of the present invention include a polypeptide comprising, or alternatively, consisting of: amino acids 1 to 184 in  (SEQ ID NO:2); amino acids 2 to 184 in  (SEQ ID NO:2); the TR21 extracellular domain; the TR21 cysteine rich motif; the TR21 transmembrane domain; the intracellular domain of TR21; and the TR21 extracellular domain and the TR21 intracellular domain with all or part of the transmembrane domain deleted; as well as polypeptides which are at least 80% identical, more preferably at least 90% or 95% identical, still more preferably at least 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or 100% identical to the polypeptides described above (e.g., the polypeptide of  (SEQ ID NO:2)), and also include portions of such polypeptides with at least 30 amino acids and more preferably at least 50 or at least 100 amino acids. Polynucleotides encoding these polypeptides are also encompassed by the invention.","By a polypeptide having an amino acid sequence at least, for example, 95% \u201cidentical\u201d to a reference amino acid sequence of a TR21 polypeptide is intended that the amino acid sequence of the polypeptide is identical to the reference sequence except that the polypeptide sequence may include up to five amino acid alterations per each 100 amino acids of the reference amino acid of the TR21 receptor. In other words, to obtain a polypeptide having an amino acid sequence at least 95% identical to a reference amino acid sequence, up to 5% of the amino acid residues in the reference sequence may be deleted or substituted with another amino acid, or a number of amino acids up to 5% of the total amino acid residues in the reference sequence may be inserted into the reference sequence. These alterations of the reference sequence may occur at the amino or carboxy terminal positions of the reference amino acid sequence or anywhere between those terminal positions, interspersed either individually among residues in the reference sequence or in one or more contiguous groups within the reference sequence.","As a practical matter, whether any particular polypeptide is at least 85%, 90%, 92%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% identical to, for instance, the amino acid sequence shown in  (SEQ ID NO:2), can be determined conventionally using known computer programs such the Bestfit program (Wisconsin Sequence Analysis Package, Version 8 for Unix, Genetics Computer Group, University Research Park, 575 Science Drive, Madison, Wis. 53711). When using Bestfit or any other sequence alignment program to determine whether a particular sequence is, for instance, 95% identical to a reference sequence according to the present invention, the parameters are set, of course, such that the percentage of identity is calculated over the full length of the reference amino acid sequence and that gaps in homology of up to 5% of the total number of amino acid residues in the reference sequence are allowed.","In a specific embodiment, the identity between a reference (query) sequence (a sequence of the present invention) and a subject sequence, also referred to as a global sequence alignment, is determined using the FASTDB computer program based on the algorithm of Brutlag et al. (6:237\u2013245 (1990)). Preferred parameters used in a FASTDB amino acid alignment are: Matrix=PAM 0, k-tuple=2, Mismatch Penalty=1, Joining Penalty=20, Randomization Group Length=0, Cutoff Score=1, Window Size=sequence length, Gap Penalty=5, Gap Size Penalty=0.05, Window Size=500 or the length of the subject amino acid sequence, whichever is shorter. According to this embodiment, if the subject sequence is shorter than the query sequence due to N- or C-terminal deletions, not because of internal deletions, a manual correction is made to the results to take into consideration the fact that the FASTDB program does not account for N- and C-terminal truncations of the subject sequence when calculating global percent identity. For subject sequences truncated at the N- and C-termini, relative to the query sequence, the percent identity is corrected by calculating the number of residues of the query sequence that are N- and C-terminal of the subject sequence, which are not matched\/aligned with a corresponding subject residue, as a percent of the total bases of the query sequence. A determination of whether a residue is matched\/aligned is determined by results of the FASTDB sequence alignment. This percentage is then subtracted from the percent identity, calculated by the above FASTDB program using the specified parameters, to arrive at a final percent identity score. This final percent identity score is what is used for the purposes of this embodiment. Only residues to the N- and C-termini of the subject sequence, which are not matched\/aligned with the query sequence, are considered for the purposes of manually adjusting the percent identity score. That is, only query residue positions outside the farthest N- and C-terminal residues of the subject sequence. For example, a 90 amino acid residue subject sequence is aligned with a 100 residue query sequence to determine percent identity. The deletion occurs at the N-terminus of the subject sequence and therefore, the FASTDB alignment does not show a matching\/alignment of the first 10 residues at the N-terminus. The 10 unpaired residues represent 10% of the sequence (number of residues at the N- and C-termini not matched\/total number of residues in the query sequence) so 10% is subtracted from the percent identity score calculated by the FASTDB program. If the remaining 90 residues were perfectly matched the final percent identity would be 90%. In another example, a 90 residue subject sequence is compared with a 100 residue query sequence. This time the deletions are internal deletions so there are no residues at the N- or C-termini of the subject sequence which are not matched\/aligned with the query. In this case the percent identity calculated by FASTDB is not manually corrected. Once again, only residue positions outside the N- and C-terminal ends of the subject sequence, as displayed in the FASTDB alignment, which are not matched\/aligned with the query sequence are manually corrected for. No other manual corrections are made for the purposes of this embodiment.","In additional embodiments, polynucleotides of the invention comprise, or alternatively consist of, a polynucleotide sequence at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 92%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or 100% identical to the polynucleotide sequence encoding the extracellular cysteine rich motif of TR21 disclosed in  (amino acid residues from 19 to 35). In another embodiment, the invention provides an isolated nucleic acid molecule comprising a polynucleotide that hybridizes under stringent hybridization conditions to DNA complementary to the polynucleotide sequence encoding the TR21 extracellular cysteine rich motif. The present invention also encompasses the above polynucleotide\/nucleic acid sequences fused to a heterologous polynucleotide sequence. Polypeptides encoded by these nucleic acids and\/or polynucleotide sequences are also encompassed by the invention.","The present application is also directed to proteins containing polypeptides at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 92%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% identical to the TR21 polypeptide sequence set forth as n\u2013m, and\/or n\u2013mas described herein. In preferred embodiments, the application is directed to proteins comprising or alternatively consisting of, polypeptides at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 92%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% identical to polypeptides having the amino acid sequence of the specific TR21 N- and C-terminal deletions recited herein. Polynucleotides encoding these polypeptides are also encompassed by the invention.","In certain preferred embodiments, TR21 proteins of the invention comprise fusion proteins as described above wherein the TR21 polypeptides are those described as n\u2013m, and\/or n\u2013mas described herein. In preferred embodiments, the application is directed to nucleic acid molecules at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 92%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% identical to the nucleic acid sequences encoding polypeptides having the amino acid sequence of the specific N- and C-terminal deletions recited herein. Polynucleotides encoding these polypeptides are also encompassed by the invention.","In preferred embodiments, the TR21 polypeptide or fragment thereof binds a Neutrokine-alpha polypeptide or splice variants thereof. The ability of a TR21 polypeptide (e.g., fragment) of the invention to bind a Neutrokine-alpha polypeptide, or a splice variant thereof, can routinely be determined using techniques described herein or otherwise known in the art. In another non-exclusive preferred embodiment, a TR21 polypeptide, or fragment thereof, of the invention antagonizes B cell proliferation and\/or differentiation merdiated by Neutokine-alpha or a splice variant thereof. The ability of a TR21 polypeptide to antagonize B cell proliferation and\/or differentiation mediated by Neutrokine-alpha or a splice variant thereof can routinely be determined using techniques described herein or otherwise known in the art.","In preferred embodiments, the TR21 polypeptide or fragment thereof binds a heteromultimeric polypeptide complex comprising one or more Neutrokine-alpha polypeptides or splice avariants thereof. The ability of a TR21 polypeptide (e.g., fragment) of the invention to bind a heteromultimeric polypeptide complex comprising one or more Neutrokine alpha polypeptides or splice variants thereof can routinely be determined using techniques described herein or otherwise known in the art. In another non-exclusive preferred embodiment, a TR21 polypeptide or fragment thereof of the invention antagonizes B cell proliferation and\/or differentiation mediated by a heteromultimeric polypeptide complex comprising one or more Neutrokine-alpha polypeptides or splice variants thereof. The ability of a TR21 polypeptide to antagonize B cell proliferation and\/or differentiation mediated by a heteromultimeric polypeptide complex comprising one or more Neutrokine-alpha polypeptides or splice variants thereof can routinely be determined using techniques described herein or otherwise known in the art.","In one embodiment, one or more of the TR21 polypeptides of the invention are expressed at relatively high levels in mature B cells. In a specific embodiment, expression of one or more of the TR21 polypeptides of the invention is restricted to mature B cells.","In one embodiment, the B cell proliferation assay described herein may be modified for use in screening for TR21 related proteins or agonists or antagonists thereof. In this instance, a baseline level of B cell proliferation and\/or differentiation mediated by Neutrokine-alpha or Neutrokine-alpha SV is determined. Potential TR21 related proteins or polypeptide(s) are added to an experimental well and the resultant level of B cell proliferation and\/or differentiation mediated by Neutrokine-alpha or Neutrokine-alpha SV is assessed and compared to the baseline level. An increase in B cell proliferation and\/or differentiation in the experimental well will indicate that the potential TR21 related proteins(s) or polypeptide(s) is either (or both) a TR21 related protein or an agonist. Decreased B cell proliferation and\/or differentiation will indicate that the potential TR21 protein(s) or polypeptide(s) is an antagonist.","In another embodiment, the B cell proliferation assay may be modified for use in screening for TR21 related proteins or agonists or antagonists thereof using heteromultimeric polypeptide complexes comprising one or more Neutrokine-alpha or Neutrokine-alpha SV proteins. The baseline level of B cell proliferation and\/or differentiation mediated by a heteromultimeric polypeptide complex comprising one or more Neutrokine-alpha or Neutrokine-alpha SV proteins may be determined by routinely modifying the techniques described herein. Potential TR21 related proteins or polypeptide(s) are added to an experimental well and the resultant level of B cell proliferation and\/or differentiation is assessed and compared to the baseline level. An increase in B cell proliferation and\/or differentiation in the experimental well will indicate that the potential TR21 related proteins(s) or polypeptide(s) is either (or both) a TR21 related protein or an agonist. Decreased B cell proliferation and\/or differentiation will indicate that the potential TR21 protein(s) or polypeptide(s) is an antagonist.","In another embodiment, TR21 polypeptides (including TR21 soluble fragments) may be identified by means of a functional screen using the modified B cell proliferation assay as described above.","Moreover, the TR21 polypeptides described herein may be used as a means of detecting and\/or quantifying levels of Neutrokine-alpha or Neutrokine-alpha SV or heteromultimeric polypeptide complexes comprising Neutrokine-alpha or Neutrokine-alpha SV in a sample (e.g., a biological sample) by for example using, or routinely modifying immunoassays known in the art, and\/or using or routinely modifying, the B cell proliferation assay described herein.","TR21 Antibodies","Further polypeptides of the invention relate to antibodies and T-cell antigen receptors (TCR) which immunospecifically bind a TR21 polypeptide, polypeptide fragment, or variant of SEQ ID NO:2, and\/or a TR21 epitope (as determined by immunoassays well known in the art for assaying specific antibody-antigen binding).

The invention features both receptor-specific antibodies and ligand-specific antibodies. The invention also features receptor-specific antibodies that do not prevent ligand binding but prevent receptor activation. Receptor activation (i.e., signaling) may be determined by techniques described herein or otherwise known in the art. For example, receptor activation can be determined by detecting activation of the transcription factors NF-AT, AP-1, and\/or NF-KAPPAB using techniques known in the art, and\/or the phosphorylation (e.g., tyrosine or serine\/threonine) of the receptor or its substrate by immunoprecipitation followed by western blot analysis (for example, as described supra).

Likewise, included in the invention are neutralizing antibodies which bind the ligand and prevent binding of the ligand to the receptor, as well as antibodies which bind the ligand, thereby preventing receptor activation, but do not prevent the ligand from binding the receptor. Further included in the invention are antibodies which activate the receptor. These antibodies may act as receptor agonists, i.e., potentiate or activate either all or a subset of the biological activities of the ligand-mediated receptor activation, for example, by inducing multimerization and\/or aggregation (i.e., via antibody cross-linking) of the receptor (i.e., TR21). The antibodies may be specified as agonists, antagonists or inverse agonists for biological activities comprising the specific biological activities of the peptides of the invention disclosed herein.

For example, the antibodies have use in immunoassays for qualitatively and quantitatively measuring levels of the polypeptides of the present invention in biological samples. See, e.g., Harlow et al., Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 2nd ed. 1988) (incorporated by reference herein in its entirety).","By way of another non-limiting example, antibodies of the invention may be administered to individuals as a form of passive immunization. Alternatively, antibodies of the present invention may be used for epitope mapping to identify the epitope(s) bound by the antibody. Epitopes identified in this way may, in turn, for example, be used as vaccine candidates, i.e., to immunize an individual to elicit antibodies against the naturally occurring forms of TR21.","As discussed in more detail below, the antibodies of the present invention may be used either alone or in combination with other compositions. The antibodies may further be recombinantly fused to a heterologous polypeptide at the N- or C-terminus or chemically conjugated (including covalently and non-covalently conjugations) to polypeptides or other compositions. For example, antibodies of the present invention may be recombinantly fused or conjugated to molecules useful as labels in detection assays and effector molecules such as heterologous polypeptides, drugs, radionuclides, or toxins. See, e.g., PCT publications WO 92\/08495; WO 91\/14438; WO 89\/12624; U.S. Pat. No. 5,314,995; and EP 396,387.","The antibodies of the invention include derivatives that are modified, i.e., by the covalent attachment of any type of molecule to the antibody such that covalent attachment does not prevent the antibody from generating an anti-idiotypic response. For example, but not by way of limitation, the antibody derivatives include antibodies that have been modified, e.g., by glycosylation, acetylation, pegylation, phosphorylation, amidation, derivatization by known protecting\/blocking groups, proteolytic cleavage, linkage to a cellular ligand or other protein, etc. Any of numerous chemical modifications may be carried out by known techniques, including, but not limited to specific chemical cleavage, acetylation, formylation, metabolic synthesis of tunicamycin, etc. Additionally, the derivative may contain one or more non-classical amino acids.","The antibodies of the present invention may be generated by any suitable method known in the art. Polyclonal antibodies to an antigen-of-interest can be produced by various procedures well known in the art. For example, a polypeptide of the invention can be administered to various host animals including, but not limited to, rabbits, mice, rats, etc. to induce the production of sera containing polyclonal antibodies specific for the antigen. Various adjuvants may be used to increase the immunological response, depending on the host species, and include but are not limited to, Freund's (complete and incomplete), mineral gels such as aluminum hydroxide, surface active substances such as lysolecithin, pluronic polyols, polyanions, peptides, oil emulsions, keyhole limpet hemocyanins, dinitrophenol, and potentially useful human adjuvants such as BCG (bacille Calmette-Guerin) and . Such adjuvants are also well known in the art.","Monoclonal antibodies can be prepared using a wide variety of techniques known in the art including the use of hybridoma, recombinant, and phage display technologies, or a combination thereof. For example, monoclonal antibodies can be produced using hybridoma techniques including those known in the art and taught, for example, in Harlow et al., Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 2nd ed. 1988); Hammerling, et al., in: Monoclonal Antibodies and T-Cell Hybridomas 563\u2013681 (Elsevier, N.Y., 1981) (said references incorporated by reference in their entireties). The term \u201cmonoclonal antibody\u201d as used herein is not limited to antibodies produced through hybridoma technology. The term \u201cmonoclonal antibody\u201d refers to an antibody that is derived from a single clone, including any eukaryotic, prokaryotic, or phage clone, and not the method by which it is produced.","Methods for producing and screening for specific antibodies using hybridoma technology are routine and well known in the art and are discussed in detail in the Examples (e.g., Example 3). In a non-limiting example, mice can be immunized with a polypeptide of the invention or a cell expressing such peptide. Once an immune response is detected, e.g., antibodies specific for the antigen are detected in the mouse serum, the mouse spleen is harvested and splenocytes isolated. The splenocytes are then fused by well-known techniques to any suitable myeloma cells, for example cells from cell line SP20 available from the ATCC. Hybridomas are selected and cloned by limited dilution. The hybridoma clones are then assayed by methods known in the art for cells that secrete antibodies capable of binding a polypeptide of the invention. Ascites fluid, which generally contains high levels of antibodies can be generated by immunizing mice with positive hybridoma clones.","Accordingly, the present invention provides methods of generating monoclonal antibodies as well as antibodies produced by the method comprising culturing a hybridoma cell secreting an antibody of the invention wherein, preferably, the hybridoma is generated by fusing splenocytes isolated from a mouse immunized with an antigen of the invention with myeloma cells and then screening the hybridomas resulting from the fusion for hybridoma clones that secrete an antibody able to bind a polypeptide of the invention.","Protocols for generating EBV-transformed B cell lines are commonly known in the art, such as, for example, the protocol outlined in Chapter 7.22 of Current Protocols in Immunology, Coligan et al., Eds., 1994, John Wiley & Sons, NY, which is hereby incorporated in its entirety by reference herein. The source of B cells for transformation is commonly human peripheral blood, but B cells for transformation may also be derived from other sources including, but not limited to, lymph nodes, tonsil, spleen, tumor tissue, and infected tissues. Tissues are generally made into single cell suspensions prior to EBV transformation. Investigators may also choose to perform selection procedures that will enrich the sample for B cells that are antigen-reactive. For example, one method of enriching for antigen-reactive B cells is panning on a plastic dish that has been coated with antigen. Antigen reactive B cells may then be eluted from the plastic dish and used for transformation. Alternatively, it is possible to enrich for antigen-reactive B cells using fluorescence activated cells sorting (FACS). In this method, one might use fluorescently labeled antigen to sort out a population of antigen reactive B-cells from non-antigen reactive B cells an other cells types. Both FACS analysis and panning, may also be performed in a manner so as to enrich for B cells as opposed to antigen-reactive B cells. The advantage of selecting for total B cells populations is that one is more likely to include plasma cells, or B cells actively secreting immunoglobulin, that might be missed in procedures that require the presence of cell-surface immunoglobulin for detection. Growth of EBV-infected cells is promoted by monocytes, so investigators may wish to take care not to exclude these form culture, or to resupply monocytes after selection procedures. Additionally, steps may be taken to either physically remove or inactivate T cells (e.g., by treatment with cyclosporin A) in B cell-containing samples, because T cells from individuals seropositive for anti-EBV antibodies can suppress B cell immortalization by EBV.","In general, the sample containing human B cells is innoculated with EBV, and cultured for 3\u20134 weeks. A typical source of EBV is the culture supernatant of the B95-8 cell line (ATCC #VR-1492). Physical signs of EBV transformation can generally be seen towards the end of the 3\u20134 week culture period. By phase-contrast microscopy, transformed cells may appear large, clear, hairy and tend to aggregate in tight clusters of cells. Initially, EBV lines are generally polyclonal. However, over prolonged periods of cell cultures, EBV lines may become monoclonal or polyclonal as a result of the selective outgrowth of particular B cell clones. Alternatively, polyclonal EBV transformed lines may be subcloned (e.g., by limiting dilution culture) or fused with a suitable fusion partner and plated at limiting dilution to obtain monoclonal B cell lines. Suitable fusion partners for EBV transformed cell lines include mouse myeloma cell lines (e.g., SP2\/0, X63-Ag8.653), heteromyeloma cell lines (human\u00d7mouse; e.g., SPAM-8, SBC-H20, and CB-F7), and human cell lines (e.g., GM 1500, SKO-007, RPMI 8226, and KR-4). Thus, the present invention also provides a method of generating polyclonal or monoclonal human antibodies against polypeptides of the invention or fragments thereof, comprising EBV-transformation of human B cells.","Antibody fragments which recognize specific epitopes may be generated by known techniques. For example, Fab and F(ab\u2032)2 fragments of the invention may be produced by proteolytic cleavage of immunoglobulin molecules, using enzymes such as papain (to produce Fab fragments) or pepsin (to produce F(ab\u2032)2 fragments). F(ab\u2032)2 fragments contain the variable region, the light chain constant region and the CH1 domain of the heavy chain.","For example, the antibodies of the present invention can also be generated using various phage display methods known in the art. In phage display methods, functional antibody domains are displayed on the surface of phage particles that carry the polynucleotide sequences encoding them. In a particular embodiment, such phage can be utilized to display antigen-binding domains expressed from a repertoire or combinatorial antibody library (e.g., human or murine). Phage expressing an antigen binding domain that binds the antigen of interest can be selected or identified with antigen, e.g., using labeled antigen or antigen bound or captured to a solid surface or bead. Phages used in these methods are typically filamentous phage including fd and M13 binding domains expressed from phage with Fab, Fv or disulfide stabilized Fv antibody domains recombinantly fused to either the phage gene III or gene VIII protein. Examples of phage display methods that can be used to make the antibodies of the present invention include those disclosed in Brinkman et al., J. Immunol.

For example, techniques to recombinantly produce Fab, Fab\u2032 and F(ab\u2032)2 fragments can also be employed using methods known in the art such as those disclosed in PCT publication WO 92\/22324; Mullinax et al., BioTechniques 12(6):864\u2013869 (1992); and Sawai et al., AJRI34:26\u201334 (1995); and Better et al., Science 240:1041\u20131043 (1988) (said references incorporated by reference in their entireties).","Examples of techniques which can be used to produce single-chain Fvs and antibodies include those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,946,778 and 5,258,498; Huston et al., Methods in Enzymology 203:46\u201388 (1991); Shu et al., PNAS 90:7995\u20137999 (1993); and Skerra et al., Science 240:1038\u20131040 (1988). For some uses, including in vivo use of antibodies in humans and in vitro detection assays, it may be preferable to use chimeric, humanized, or human antibodies. A chimeric antibody is a molecule in which different portions of the antibody are derived from different animal species, such as antibodies having a variable region derived from a murine monoclonal antibody and a human immunoglobulin constant region. Methods for producing chimeric antibodies are known in the art. See e.g., Morrison, Science 229:1202 (1985); Oi et al., BioTechniques 4:214 (1986); Gillies et al., (1989) J. Immunol. Methods 125:191\u2013202; U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,807,715; 4,816,567; and 4,816,397, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. Humanized antibodies are antibody molecules from non-human species antibody that binds the desired antigen having one or more complementarity determining regions (CDRs) from the non-human species and a framework regions from a human immunoglobulin molecule. Often, framework residues in the human framework regions will be substituted with the corresponding residue from the CDR donor antibody to alter, preferably improve, antigen binding. These framework substitutions are identified by methods well known in the art, e.g., by modeling of the interactions of the CDR and framework residues to identify framework residues important for antigen binding and sequence comparison to identify unusual framework residues at particular positions. (See, e.g., Queen et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,585,089; Riechmann et al., Nature 332:323 (1988), which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.) Antibodies can be humanized using a variety of techniques known in the art including, for example, CDR-grafting (EP 239,400; PCT publication WO 91\/09967; U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,225,539; 5,530,101; and 5,585,089), veneering or resurfacing (EP 592,106; EP 519,596; Padlan, Molecular Immunology 28(4\/5):489\u2013498 (1991); Studnicka et al., Protein Engineering 7(6):805\u2013814 (1994); Roguska. et al., PNAS 91:969\u2013973 (1994)), and chain shuffling (U.S. Pat. No. 5,565,332).","Completely human antibodies are particularly desirable for therapeutic treatment of human patients. Human antibodies can be made by a variety of methods known in the art including phage display methods described above using antibody libraries derived from human immunoglobulin sequences. See also, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,444,887 and 4,716,111; and PCT publications WO 98\/46645, WO 98\/50433, WO 98\/24893, WO 98\/16654, WO 96\/34096, WO 96\/33735, and WO 91\/10741; each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","Human antibodies can also be produced using transgenic mice which are incapable of expressing functional endogenous immunoglobulins, but which can express human immunoglobulin genes. For example, the human heavy and light chain immunoglobulin gene complexes may be introduced randomly or by homologous recombination into mouse embryonic stem cells. Alternatively, the human variable region, constant region, and diversity region may be introduced into mouse embryonic stem cells in addition to the human heavy and light chain genes. The mouse heavy and light chain immunoglobulin genes may be rendered non-functional separately or simultaneously with the introduction of human immunoglobulin loci by homologous recombination. In particular, homozygous deletion of the JH region prevents endogenous antibody production. The modified embryonic stem cells are expanded and microinjected into blastocysts to produce chimeric mice. The chimeric mice are then bred to produce homozygous offspring which express human antibodies. The transgenic mice are immunized in the normal fashion with a selected antigen, e.g., all or a portion of a polypeptide of the invention. Monoclonal antibodies directed against the antigen can be obtained from the immunized, transgenic mice using conventional hybridoma technology. The human immunoglobulin transgenes harbored by the transgenic mice rearrange during B cell differentiation, and subsequently undergo class switching and somatic mutation. Thus, using such a technique, it is possible to produce therapeutically useful IgG, IgA, IgM and IgE antibodies. For an overview of this technology for producing human antibodies, see Lonberg and Huszar, Int. Rev. Immunol. 13:65\u201393 (1995). For a detailed discussion of this technology for producing human antibodies and human monoclonal antibodies and protocols for producing such antibodies, see, e.g., PCT publications WO 98\/24893; WO 92\/01047; WO 96\/34096; WO 96\/33735; European Patent No. 0 598 877; U.S. Pat.

In addition, companies such as Abgenix, Inc. (Freemont, Calif.) and Genpharm (San Jose, Calif.) can be engaged to provide human antibodies directed against a selected antigen using technology similar to that described above.","Completely human antibodies which recognize a selected epitope can be generated using a technique referred to as \u201cguided selection.\u201d In this approach a selected non-human monoclonal antibody, e.g., a mouse antibody is used to guide the selection of a completely human antibody recognizing the same epitope. (Jespers et al., Bio\/technology 12:899\u2013903 (1988)).","Further, antibodies to the polypeptides of the invention can, in turn, be utilized to generate anti-idiotype antibodies that \u201cmimic\u201d polypeptides of the invention using techniques well known to those skilled in the art. (See, e.g., Greenspan & Bona, FASEB J. 7(5): 437\u2013444; (1989) and Nissinoff, J. Immunol. 147(8): 2429\u20132438 (1991)). For example, antibodies which bind to and competitively inhibit polypeptide multimerization and\/or binding of a polypeptide of the invention to a ligand can be used to generate anti-idiotypes that \u201cmimic\u201d the polypeptide multimerization and\/or binding domain and, as a consequence, bind to and neutralize polypeptide and\/or its ligand (e.g., Neutrokine-alpha). Such neutralizing anti-idiotypes or Fab fragments of such anti-idiotypes can be used in therapeutic regimens to neutralize polypeptide ligand. For example, such anti-idiotypic antibodies can be used to bind a polypeptide of the invention and\/or to bind its ligands\/receptors, and thereby block its biological activity.","Intrabodies of the invention can be produced using methods known in the art, such as those disclosed and reviewed in Chen et al., 5:595\u2013601 (1994); Marasco, W. A., 4:11\u201315 (1997); Rondon and Marasco, 51:257\u2013283 (1997); Proba et al., 275:245\u2013253 (1998); Cohen et al., 17:2445\u20132456 (1998); Ohage and Steipe, 291:1119\u20131128 (1999); Ohage et al., 291:1129\u20131134 (1999); Wirtz and Steipe, 8:2245\u20132250 (1999); Zhu et al., 231:207\u2013222 (1999); and references cited therein. In particular, a CCR5 intrabody has been produced by Steinberger et al., 97:805\u2013810 (2000).","Polynucleotides Encoding TR21 Antibodies","The invention further provides polynucleotides comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding an antibody of the invention and fragments thereof. The invention also encompasses polynucleotides that hybridize under stringent or lower stringency hybridization conditions, e.g., as defined supra, to polynucleotides that encode an antibody, preferably, that specifically binds to a TR21 polypeptide of the invention, preferably, an antibody that binds to a polypeptide having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:2.","The polynucleotides may be obtained, and the nucleotide sequence of the polynucleotides determined, by any method known in the art. For example, if the nucleotide sequence of the antibody is known, a polynucleotide encoding the antibody may be assembled from chemically synthesized oligonucleotides (e.g., as described in Kutmeier et al., BioTechniques 17:242 (1994)), which, briefly, involves the synthesis of overlapping oligonucleotides containing portions of the sequence encoding the antibody, annealing and ligating of those oligonucleotides, and then amplification of the ligated oligonucleotides by PCR.","Alternatively, a polynucleotide encoding an antibody may be generated from nucleic acid from a suitable source. If a clone containing a nucleic acid encoding a particular antibody is not available, but the sequence of the antibody molecule is known, a nucleic acid encoding the immunoglobulin may be chemically synthesized or obtained from a suitable source (e.g., an antibody cDNA library, or a cDNA library generated from, or nucleic acid, preferably poly A+ RNA, isolated from, any tissue or cells expressing the antibody, such as hybridoma cells selected to express an antibody of the invention) by PCR amplification using synthetic primers hybridizable to the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 ends of the sequence or by cloning using an oligonucleotide probe specific for the particular gene sequence to identify, e.g., a cDNA clone from a cDNA library that encodes the antibody. Amplified nucleic acids generated by PCR may then be cloned into replicable cloning vectors using any method well known in the art.","Once the nucleotide sequence and corresponding amino acid sequence of the antibody is determined, the nucleotide sequence of the antibody may be manipulated using methods well known in the art for the manipulation of nucleotide sequences, e.g., recombinant DNA techniques, site directed mutagenesis, PCR, etc. (see, for example, the techniques described in Sambrook et al., 1990, Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual, 2d Ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. and Ausubel et al., eds., 1998, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley & Sons, NY, which are both incorporated by reference herein in their entireties), to generate antibodies having a different amino acid sequence, for example to create amino acid substitutions, deletions, and\/or insertions.","In a specific embodiment, the amino acid sequence of the heavy and\/or light chain variable domains may be inspected to identify the sequences of the complementarity determining regions (CDRs) by methods that are well know in the art, e.g., by comparison to known amino acid sequences of other heavy and light chain variable regions to determine the regions of sequence hypervariability. Using routine recombinant DNA techniques, one or more of the CDRs may be inserted within framework regions, e.g., into human framework regions to humanize a non-human antibody, as described supra. The framework regions may be naturally occurring or consensus framework regions, and preferably human framework regions (See, e.g., Chothia et al., J. Mol. Biol. 278: 457\u2013479 (1998) for a listing of human framework regions). Preferably, the polynucleotide generated by the combination of the framework regions and CDRs encodes an antibody that specifically binds a polypeptide of the invention. Preferably, as discussed supra, one or more amino acid substitutions may be made within the framework regions, and, preferably, the amino acid substitutions improve binding of the antibody to its antigen. Additionally, such methods may be used to make amino acid substitutions or deletions of one or more variable region cysteine residues participating in an intrachain disulfide bond to generate antibody molecules lacking one or more intrachain disulfide bonds. Other alterations to the polynucleotide are encompassed by the present invention and within the skill of the art.","In addition, techniques developed for the production of \u201cchimeric antibodies\u201d (Morrison et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 81:851\u2013855 (1984); Neuberger et al., Nature 312:604\u2013608 (1984); Takeda et al., Nature 314:452\u2013454 (1985)) by splicing genes from a mouse antibody molecule of appropriate antigen specificity together with genes from a human antibody molecule of appropriate biological activity can be used. As described supra, a chimeric antibody is a molecule in which different portions are derived from different animal species, such as those having a variable region derived from a murine mAb and a human immunoglobulin constant region, e.g., humanized antibodies.","Alternatively, techniques described for the production of single chain antibodies (U.S. Pat. No. 4,946,778; Bird, Science 242:423\u201342 (1988); Huston et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85:5879\u20135883 (1988); and Ward et al., Nature 334:544\u201354 (1989)) can be adapted to produce single chain antibodies. Single chain antibodies are formed by linking the heavy and light chain fragments of the Fv region via an amino acid bridge, resulting in a single chain polypeptide. Techniques for the assembly of functional Fv fragments in may also be used (Skerra et al., Science 242:1038\u20131041 (1988)).","Methods of Producing TR21 Antibodies","The antibodies of the invention can be produced by any method known in the art for the synthesis of antibodies, in particular, by chemical synthesis or preferably, by recombinant expression techniques. Methods of producing antibodies include, but are not limited to, hybridoma technology, EBV transformation, and other methods discussed herein as well as through the use recombinant DNA technology, as discussed below.","Recombinant expression of an antibody of the invention, or fragment, derivative or analog thereof, (e.g., a heavy or light chain of an antibody of the invention or a single chain antibody of the invention), requires construction of an expression vector containing a polynucleotide that encodes the antibody. Once a polynucleotide encoding an antibody molecule or a heavy or light chain of an antibody, or portion thereof (preferably containing the heavy or light chain variable domain), of the invention has been obtained, the vector for the production of the antibody molecule may be produced by recombinant DNA technology using techniques well known in the art. Thus, methods for preparing a protein by expressing a polynucleotide containing an antibody encoding nucleotide sequence are described herein. Methods which are well known to those skilled in the art can be used to construct expression vectors containing antibody coding sequences and appropriate transcriptional and translational control signals. These methods include, for example, in vitro recombinant DNA techniques, synthetic techniques, and in vivo genetic recombination. The invention, thus, provides replicable vectors comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding an antibody molecule of the invention, or a heavy or light chain thereof, or a heavy or light chain variable domain, operably linked to a promoter. Such vectors may include the nucleotide sequence encoding the constant region of the antibody molecule (see, e.g., PCT Publication WO 86\/05807; PCT Publication WO 89\/01036; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,122,464) and the variable domain of the antibody may be cloned into such a vector for expression of the entire heavy or light chain.","The expression vector is transferred to a host cell by conventional techniques and the transfected cells are then cultured by conventional techniques to produce an antibody of the invention. Thus, the invention includes host cells containing a polynucleotide encoding an antibody of the invention, or a heavy or light chain thereof, or a single chain antibody of the invention, operably linked to a heterologous promoter. In preferred embodiments for the expression of double-chained antibodies, vectors encoding both the heavy and light chains may be co-expressed in the host cell for expression of the entire immunoglobulin molecule, as detailed below.","A variety of host-expression vector systems may be utilized to express the antibody molecules of the invention. Such host-expression systems represent vehicles by which the coding sequences of interest may be produced and subsequently purified, but also represent cells which may, when transformed or transfected with the appropriate nucleotide coding sequences, express an antibody molecule of the invention in situ. These include but are not limited to microorganisms such as bacteria (e.g., ) transformed with recombinant bacteriophage DNA, plasmid DNA or cosmid DNA expression vectors containing antibody coding sequences; yeast (e.g., ) transformed with recombinant yeast expression vectors containing antibody coding sequences; insect cell systems infected with recombinant virus expression vectors (e.g., baculovirus) containing antibody coding sequences; plant cell systems infected with recombinant virus expression vectors (e.g., cauliflower mosaic virus, CaMV; tobacco mosaic virus, TMV) or transformed with recombinant plasmid expression vectors (e.g., Ti plasmid) containing antibody coding sequences; or mammalian cell systems (e.g., COS, CHO, BHK, 293, 3T3 cells) harboring recombinant expression constructs containing promoters derived from the genome of mammalian cells (e.g., metallothionein promoter) or from mammalian viruses (e.g., the adenovirus late promoter; the vaccinia virus 7.5K promoter). Preferably, bacterial cells such as , and more preferably, eukaryotic cells, especially for the expression of whole recombinant antibody molecule, are used for the expression of a recombinant antibody molecule. For example, mammalian cells such as Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO), in conjunction with a vector such as the major intermediate early gene promoter element from human cytomegalovirus is an effective expression system for antibodies (Foecking et al., Gene 45:101 (1986); Cockett et al., Bio\/Technology 8:2 (1990)).","In bacterial systems, a number of expression vectors may be advantageously selected depending upon the use intended for the antibody molecule being expressed. For example, when a large quantity of such a protein is to be produced, for the generation of pharmaceutical compositions of an antibody molecule, vectors which direct the expression of high levels of fusion protein products that are readily purified may be desirable. Such vectors include, but are not limited, to the expression vector pUR278 (Ruther et al., EMBO J. 2:1791 (1983)), in which the antibody coding sequence may be ligated individually into the vector in frame with the lac Z coding region so that a fusion protein is produced; pIN vectors (Inouye & Inouye, Nucleic Acids Res. 13:3101\u20133109 (1985); Van Heeke & Schuster, J. Biol. Chem. 24:5503\u20135509 (1989)); and the like. pGEX vectors may also be used to express foreign polypeptides as fusion proteins with glutathione S-transferase (GST). In general, such fusion proteins are soluble and can easily be purified from lysed cells by adsorption and binding to matrix glutathione-agarose beads followed by elution in the presence of free glutathione. The pGEX vectors are designed to include thrombin or factor Xa protease cleavage sites so that the cloned target gene product can be released from the GST moiety.","In an insect system, nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcNPV) is used as a vector to express foreign genes. The virus grows in cells. The antibody coding sequence may be cloned individually into non-essential regions (for example the polyhedrin gene) of the virus and placed under control of an AcNPV promoter (for example the polyhedrin promoter).","In mammalian host cells, a number of viral-based expression systems may be utilized. In cases where an adenovirus is used as an expression vector, the antibody coding sequence of interest may be ligated to an adenovirus transcription\/translation control complex, e.g., the late promoter and tripartite leader sequence. This chimeric gene may then be inserted in the adenovirus genome by in vitro or in vivo recombination. Insertion in a non-essential region of the viral genome (e.g., region E1 or E3) will result in a recombinant virus that is viable and capable of expressing the antibody molecule in infected hosts. (See e.g., Logan & Shenk, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81:355\u2013359 (1984)). Specific initiation signals may also be required for efficient translation of inserted antibody coding sequences. These signals include the ATG initiation codon and adjacent sequences. Furthermore, the initiation codon must be in phase with the reading frame of the desired coding sequence to ensure translation of the entire insert. These exogenous translational control signals and initiation codons can be of a variety of origins, both natural and synthetic. The efficiency of expression may be enhanced by the inclusion of appropriate transcription enhancer elements, transcription terminators, etc. (see Bittner et al., Methods in Enzymol. 153:51\u2013544 (1987)).","In addition, a host cell strain may be chosen which modulates the expression of the inserted sequences, or modifies and processes the gene product in the specific fashion desired. Such modifications (e.g., glycosylation) and processing (e.g., cleavage) of protein products may be important for the function of the protein. Different host cells have characteristic and specific mechanisms for the post-translational processing and modification of proteins and gene products. Appropriate cell lines or host systems can be chosen to ensure the correct modification and processing of the foreign protein expressed. To this end, eukaryotic host cells which possess the cellular machinery for proper processing of the primary transcript, glycosylation, and phosphorylation of the gene product may be used. Such mammalian host cells include but are not limited to CHO, VERY, BHK, Hela, COS, MDCK, 293, 3T3, WI38, and in particular, breast cancer cell lines such as, for example, BT483, Hs578T, HTB2, BT20 and T47D, and normal mammary gland cell line such as, for example, CRL7030 and Hs578Bst.","For long-term, high-yield production of recombinant proteins, stable expression is preferred. For example, cell lines which stably express the antibody molecule may be engineered. Rather than using expression vectors which contain viral origins of replication, host cells can be transformed with DNA controlled by appropriate expression control elements (e.g., promoter, enhancer, sequences, transcription terminators, polyadenylation sites, etc.), and a selectable marker. Following the introduction of the foreign DNA, engineered cells may be allowed to grow for 1\u20132 days in an enriched media, and then are switched to a selective media. The selectable marker in the recombinant plasmid confers resistance to the selection and allows cells to stably integrate the plasmid into their chromosomes and grow to form foci which in turn can be cloned and expanded into cell lines. This method may advantageously be used to engineer cell lines which express the antibody molecule. Such engineered cell lines may be particularly useful in screening and evaluation of compounds that interact directly or indirectly with the antibody molecule.","A number of selection systems may be used, including but not limited to the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (Wigler et al., Cell 11:223 (1977)), hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (Szybalska & Szybalski, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 48:202 (1992)), and adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (Lowy et al., Cell 22:817 (1980)) genes can be employed in tk\u2212, hgprt\u2212 or aprt\u2212 cells, respectively. Also, antimetabolite resistance can be used as the basis of selection for the following genes: dhfr, which confers resistance to methotrexate (Wigler et al., Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 77:357 (1980); O'Hare et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 78:1527 (1981)); gpt, which confers resistance to mycophenolic acid (Mulligan & Berg, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 78:2072 (1981)); neo, which confers resistance to the aminoglycoside G-418 Clinical Pharmacy 12:488\u2013505; Wu and Wu, Biotherapy 3:87\u201395 (1991); Tolstoshev, Ann. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 32:573\u2013596 (1993); Mulligan, Science 260:926\u2013932 (1993); and Morgan and Anderson, Ann. Rev. Biochem. 62:191\u2013217 (1993); May, 1993, TIB TECH 11(5):155\u2013215); and hygro, which confers resistance to hygromycin (Santerre et al., Gene 30:147 (1984)). Methods commonly known in the art of recombinant DNA technology may be routinely applied to select the desired recombinant clone, and such methods are described, for example, in Ausubel et al. (eds.), Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley & Sons, NY (1993); Kriegler, Gene Transfer and Expression, A Laboratory Manual, Stockton Press, NY (1990); and in Chapters 12 and 13, Dracopoli et al. (eds), Current Protocols in Human Genetics, John Wiley & Sons, NY (1994); Colberre-Garapin et al., J. Mol. Biol. 150:1 (1981), which are incorporated by reference herein in their entireties.","The expression levels of an antibody molecule can be increased by vector amplification (for a review, see Bebbington and Hentschel, The use of vectors based on gene amplification for the expression of cloned genes in mammalian cells in DNA cloning, Vol. 3. (Academic Press, New York, 1987)). When a marker in the vector system expressing antibody is amplifiable, increase in the level of inhibitor present in culture of host cell will increase the number of copies of the marker gene. Since the amplified region is associated with the antibody gene, production of the antibody will also increase (Crouse et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 3:257 (1983)).","Vectors which use glutamine synthase (GS) or DHFR as the selectable markers can be amplified in the presence of the drugs methionine sulphoximine or methotrexate, respectively. An advantage of glutamine synthase based vectors are the availability of cell lines (e.g., the murine myeloma cell line, NS0) which are glutamine synthase negative. Glutamine synthase expression systems can also function in glutamine synthase expressing cells (e.g. Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells) by providing additional inhibitor to prevent the functioning of the endogenous gene. A glutamine synthase expression system and components thereof are detailed in PCT publications: WO87\/04462; WO86\/05807; WO89\/01036; WO89\/10404; and WO91\/06657 which are incorporated in their entireties by reference herein. Additionally, glutamine synthase expression vectors that may be used according to the present invention are commercially available from suppliers, including, for example Lonza Biologics, Inc. (Portsmouth, N.H.). Expression and production of monoclonal antibodies using a GS expression system in murine myeloma cells is described in Bebbington et al., 10:169(1992) and in Biblia and Robinson 11:1 (1995) which are incorporated in their entireties by reference herein.","The host cell may be co-transfected with two expression vectors of the invention, the first vector encoding a heavy chain derived polypeptide and the second vector encoding a light chain derived polypeptide. The two vectors may contain identical selectable markers which enable equal expression of heavy and light chain polypeptides. Alternatively, a single vector may be used which encodes, and is capable of expressing both heavy and light chain polypeptides. In such situations, the light chain should be placed before the heavy chain to avoid an excess of toxic free heavy chain (Proudfoot, Nature 322:52 (1986); Kohler, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 77:2197 (1980)). The coding sequences for the heavy and light chains may comprise cDNA or genomic DNA.","Once an antibody molecule of the invention has been produced by an animal, chemically synthesized, or recombinantly expressed, it may be purified by any method known in the art for purification of an immunoglobulin molecule, for example, by chromatography (e.g., ion exchange, affinity, particularly by affinity for the specific antigen after Protein A, and sizing column chromatography), centrifugation, differential solubility, or by any other standard technique for the purification of proteins. In addition, the antibodies of the present invention or fragments thereof can be fused to heterologous polypeptide sequences described herein or otherwise known in the art, to facilitate purification.","The present invention encompasses antibodies recombinantly fused or chemically conjugated (including both covalently and non-covalently conjugations) to a polypeptide (or portion thereof, preferably at least 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 or 100 amino acids of the polypeptide) of the present invention to generate fusion proteins. The fusion does not necessarily need to be direct, but may occur through linker sequences. The antibodies may be specific for antigens other than polypeptides (or portion thereof, preferably at least 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 or 100 amino acids of the polypeptide) of the present invention. For example, antibodies may be used to target the polypeptides of the present invention to particular cell types, either in vitro or in vivo, by fusing or conjugating the polypeptides of the present invention to antibodies specific for particular cell surface receptors. Antibodies fused or conjugated to the polypeptides of the present invention may also be used in in vitro immunoassays and purification methods using methods known in the art. See e.g., Harbor et al., supra, and PCT publication WO 93\/21232; EP 439,095; Naramura et al., Immunol. Lett. 39:91\u201399 (1994); U.S. Pat. No. 5,474,981; Gillies et al., PNAS 89:1428\u20131432 (1992); Fell et al., J. Immunol. 146:2446\u20132452(1991), which are incorporated by reference in their entireties.","The present invention further includes compositions comprising the polypeptides of the present invention fused or conjugated to antibody domains other than the variable regions. For example, the polypeptides of the present invention may be fused or conjugated to an antibody Fc region or a portion thereof. The antibody portion fused to a polypeptide of the present invention may comprise the constant region, hinge region, CH1 domain, CH2 domain, and CH3 domain or any combination of whole domains or portions thereof. The polypeptides may also be fused or conjugated to the above antibody portions to form multimers. For example, Fc portions fused to the polypeptides of the present invention can form dimers through disulfide bonding between the Fc portions. Higher multimeric forms may be made by fusing polypeptides to portions of IgA and IgM. Methods for fusing or conjugating the polypeptides of the present invention to antibody portions are known in the art. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,336,603; 5,622,929; 5,359,046; 5,349,053; 5,447,851; 5,112,946; EP 307,434; EP 367,166; PCT publications WO 96\/04388; WO 91\/06570; Ashkenazi et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88:10535\u201310539 (1991); Zheng et al., J. Immunol. 154:5590\u20135600 (1995); and Vil et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:11337\u201311341(1992) (said references incorporated by reference in their entireties).","As discussed, supra, the polypeptides corresponding to a TR21 polypeptide, polypeptide fragment, or a variant of SEQ ID NO:2 may be fused or conjugated to the above antibody portions to increase the in vivo half life of the polypeptides or for use in immunoassays using methods known in the art. Further, the polypeptides corresponding to SEQ ID NO:2 may be fused or conjugated to the above antibody portions to facilitate purification. One reported example describes chimeric proteins consisting of the first two domains of the human CD4-polypeptide and various domains of the constant regions of the heavy or light chains of mammalian immunoglobulins. (EP 394,827; Traunecker et al., Nature 331:84\u201386 (1988). The polypeptides of the present invention fused or conjugated to an antibody having disulfide-linked dimeric structures (due to the IgG) may also be more efficient in binding and neutralizing other molecules, than the monomeric secreted protein or protein fragment alone. (Fountoulakis et al., J. Biochem. 270:3958\u20133964 (1995)). In many cases, the Fc part in a fusion protein is beneficial in therapy and diagnosis, and thus can result in, for example, improved pharmacokinetic properties. (EP A 232,262). Alternatively, deleting the Fc part after the fusion protein has been expressed, detected, and purified, would be desired. For example, the Fc portion may hinder therapy and diagnosis if the fusion protein is used as an antigen for immunizations. In drug discovery, for example, human proteins, such as hIL-5, have been fused with Fc portions for the purpose of high-throughput screening assays to identify antagonists of hIL-5. (See, Bennett et al., J. Molecular Recognition 8:52\u201358 (1995); Johanson et al., J. Biol. Chem. 270:9459\u20139471 (1995).","Moreover, the antibodies or fragments thereof of the present invention can be fused to marker sequences, such as a peptide to facilitate purification. In preferred embodiments, the marker amino acid sequence is a hexa-histidine peptide, such as the tag provided in a pQE vector (QIAGEN, Inc., 9259 Eton Avenue, Chatsworth, Calif., 91311), among others, many of which are commercially available. As described in Gentz et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86:821\u2013824 (1989), for instance, hexa-histidine provides for convenient purification of the fusion protein. Other peptide tags useful for purification include, but are not limited to, the \u201cHA\u201d tag, which corresponds to an epitope derived from the influenza hemagglutinin protein (Wilson et al., Cell 37:767 (1984)) and the \u201cFlag\u2122\u201d tag.","The present invention further encompasses antibodies or fragments thereof conjugated to a diagnostic or therapeutic agent. The antibodies can be used diagnostically to, for example, monitor the development or progression of a tumor as part of a clinical testing procedure to, e.g., determine the efficacy of a given treatment regimen. Detection can be facilitated by coupling the antibody to a detectable substance. Examples of detectable substances include various enzymes, prosthetic groups, fluorescent materials, luminescent materials, bioluminescent materials, radioactive materials, positron emitting metals using various positron emission tomographies, and nonradioactive paramagnetic metal ions. The detectable substance may be coupled or conjugated either directly to the antibody (or fragment thereof) or indirectly, through an intermediate (such as, for example, a linker known in the art) using techniques known in the art. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,741,900 for metal ions which can be conjugated to antibodies for use as diagnostics according to the present invention. Examples of suitable enzymes include horseradish peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase, beta-galactosidase, or acetylcholinesterase; examples of suitable prosthetic group complexes include streptavidin\/biotin and avidin\/biotin; examples of suitable fluorescent materials include umbelliferone, fluorescein, fluorescein isothiocyanate, rhodamine, dichlorotriazinylamine fluorescein, dansyl chloride or phycoerythrin; an example of a luminescent material includes luminol; examples of bioluminescent materials include luciferase, luciferin, and aequorin; and examples of suitable radioactive material include iodine (I, I, I, I), carbon (C), sulfur (S), tritium (H), indium (In, In, In, In), technetium (Tc, Tc), thallium (Ti), gallium (Ga, Ga), palladium (Pd), molybdenum (Mo), xenon (Xe), fluorine (F), Sm, Lu, Gd, Pm, La, Yb, Ho, Y, Sc, Re, Re, Pr, Rh, and Ru.","Further, an antibody or fragment thereof may be conjugated to a therapeutic moiety such as a cytotoxin, e.g., a cytostatic or cytocidal agent, a therapeutic agent or a radioactive metal ion, e.g., alpha-emitters such as, for example, Bi, or other radioisotopes such as, for example, At, Pd, Xe, I, I, Ge, Co, Zn, Sr, P, S, Y, Sm, Gd, Yb, Cr, Mn, 75Se, Sn, Y, Tin, Re, Re and Ho. In specific embodiments, an antibody or fragment thereof is attached to macrocyclic chelators useful for conjugating radiometal ions, including but not limited to, Lu, Y, Ho, In, and Sm, to polypeptides. In a preferred embodiment, the radiometal ion associated with the macrocyclic chelators attached to TR21 polypeptides of the invention is In. In another preferred embodiment, the radiometal ion associated with the macrocyclic chelator attached to TR21 polypeptides of the invention is Y. In specific embodiments, the macrocyclic chelator is 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-N,N\u2032,N\u2033,N\u2032\u2033-tetraacetic acid (DOTA). In other specific embodiments, the DOTA is attached to an antibody of the invention or fragment thereof via a linker molecule. Examples of linker molecules useful for conjugating DOTA to a polypeptide are commonly known in the art\u2014see, for example, DeNardo et al., Clin Cancer Res. 4(10):2483\u201390 (1998); Peterson et al., Bioconjug. Chem. 10(4):553\u20137 (1999); and Zimmerman et al., Nucl. Med. Biol. 26(8):943\u201350 (1999) which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. In addition, U.S. Pat.

No. 4,676,980, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","An antibody, with or without a therapeutic moiety conjugated to it, administered alone or in combination with cytotoxic factor(s) and\/or cytokine(s) can be used as a therapeutic.","Immunophenotyping Using TR21 Antibodies","The antibodies of the invention may be utilized for immunophenotyping of cell lines and biological samples. The translation product of the gene of the present invention may be useful as a cell specific marker, or more specifically as a cellular marker that is differentially expressed at various stages of differentiation and\/or maturation of particular cell types. Monoclonal antibodies directed against a specific epitope, or combination of epitopes, will allow for the screening of cellular populations expressing the marker. Various techniques can be utilized using monoclonal antibodies to screen for cellular populations expressing the marker(s), and include magnetic separation using antibody-coated magnetic beads, \u201cpanning\u201d with antibody attached to a solid matrix (i.e., plate), and flow cytometry (See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,985,660; and Morrison et al., 96:737\u201349 (1999)).","These techniques allow for the screening of particular populations of cells, such as might be found with hematological malignancies (i.e. minimal residual disease (MRD) in acute leukemic patients) and \u201cnon-self\u201d cells in transplantations to prevent Graft-versus-Host Disease (GVHD). Alternatively, these techniques allow for the screening of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells capable of undergoing proliferation and\/or differentiation, as might be found in human umbilical cord blood.","Assays for TR21 Antibody Binding","The antibodies of the invention may be assayed for immunospecific binding by any method known in the art. The immunoassays which can be used include but are not limited to competitive and non-competitive assay systems using techniques such as western blots, radioimmunoassays, ELISA (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay), \u201csandwich\u201d immunoassays, immunoprecipitation assays, precipitin reactions, gel diffusion precipitin reactions, immunodiffusion assays, agglutination assays, complement-fixation assays, immunoradiometric assays, fluorescent immunoassays, protein A immunoassays, to name but a few. Such assays are routine and well known in the art (see, e.g., Ausubel et al, eds, 1994, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Vol. 1, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety). Exemplary immunoassays are described briefly below (but are not intended by way of limitation).","Immunoprecipitation protocols generally comprise lysing a population of cells in a lysis buffer such as RIPA buffer (1% NP-40 or Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.01 M sodium phosphate at pH 7.2, 1% Trayslol) supplemented with protein phosphatase and\/or protease inhibitors (e.g., EDTA, PMSF, aprotinin, sodium vanadate), adding the antibody of interest to the cell lysate, incubating for a period of time (e.g., 1\u20134 hours) at 4\u00b0 C., adding protein A and\/or protein G sepharose beads to the cell lysate, incubating for about an hour or more at 4\u00b0 C., washing the beads in lysis buffer and resuspending the beads in SDS\/sample buffer. The ability of the antibody of interest to immunoprecipitate a particular antigen can be assessed by, e.g., western blot analysis. One of skill in the art would be knowledgeable as to the parameters that can be modified to increase the binding of the antibody to an antigen and decrease the background (e.g., pre-clearing the cell lysate with sepharose beads). For further discussion regarding immunoprecipitation protocols see, e.g., Ausubel et al., eds, 1994, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Vol. 1, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York at 10.16.1.","Western blot analysis generally comprises preparing protein samples, electrophoresis of the protein samples in a polyacrylamide gel (e.g., 8%\u201320% SDS-PAGE depending on the molecular weight of the antigen), transferring the protein sample from the polyacrylamide gel to a membrane such as nitrocellulose, PVDF or nylon, blocking the membrane in blocking solution (e.g., PBS with 3% BSA or non-fat milk), washing the membrane in washing buffer (e.g., PBS-Tween 20), blocking the membrane with primary antibody (the antibody of interest) diluted in blocking buffer, washing the membrane in washing buffer, blocking the membrane with a secondary antibody (which recognizes the primary antibody, e.g., an anti-human antibody) conjugated to an enzyme (e.g., horseradish peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase) or radioactive molecule (e.g., P or I) diluted in blocking buffer, washing the membrane in wash buffer, and detecting the presence of the antigen. One of skill in the art would be knowledgeable as to the parameters that can be modified to increase the signal detected and to reduce the background noise. For further discussion regarding western blot protocols see, e.g., Ausubel et al., eds, 1994, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Vol. 1, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York at 10.8.1.","ELISAs comprise preparing antigen, coating the well of a 96 well microtiter plate with the antigen, adding the antibody of interest conjugated to a detectable compound such as an enzyme (e.g., horseradish peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase) to the well and incubating for a period of time, and detecting the presence of the antigen. In ELISAs the antibody of interest does not have to be conjugated to a detectable compound; instead, a second antibody (which recognizes the antibody of interest) conjugated to a detectable compound may be added to the well. Further, instead of coating the well with the antigen, the antibody may be coated to the well. In this case, a second antibody conjugated to a detectable compound may be added following the addition of the antigen of interest to the coated well. One of skill in the art would be knowledgeable as to the parameters that can be modified to increase the signal detected as well as other variations of ELISAs known in the art. For further discussion regarding ELISAs see, e.g., Ausubel et al., eds, 1994, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Vol. 1, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York at 11.2.1.","The binding affinity of an antibody to an antigen and the off-rate of an antibody-antigen interaction can be determined by competitive binding assays. One example of a competitive binding assay is a radioimmunoassay comprising the incubation of labeled antigen (e.g., H or I) with the antibody of interest in the presence of increasing amounts of unlabeled antigen, and the detection of the antibody bound to the labeled antigen. The affinity of the antibody of interest for a particular antigen and the binding off-rates can be determined from the data by scatchard plot analysis. Competition with a second antibody can also be determined using radioimmunoassays. In this case, the antigen is incubated with antibody of interest conjugated to a labeled compound (e.g., H or I) in the presence of increasing amounts of an unlabeled second antibody.","Therapeutic Uses of TR21 Antibodies","The present invention is further directed to antibody-based therapies which involve administering antibodies of the invention to an animal, preferably a mammal, and most preferably a human, patient for treating one or more of the disclosed diseases, disorders, or conditions. Therapeutic compounds of the invention include, but are not limited to, antibodies of the invention (including fragments, analogs and derivatives thereof as described herein) and nucleic acids encoding antibodies of the invention (including fragments, analogs and derivatives thereof and anti-idiotypic antibodies as described herein).","The present invention is further directed to antibody-based therapies which involve administering antibodies of the invention to an animal, preferably a mammal, and most preferably a human, patient for treating one or more of the disclosed diseases, disorders, or conditions. Therapeutic compounds of the invention include, but are not limited to, antibodies of the invention (including fragments, analogs and derivatives thereof as described herein) and nucleic acids encoding antibodies of the invention (including fragments, analogs and derivatives thereof and anti-idiotypic antibodies as described herein). The antibodies of the invention can be used to treat, inhibit or prevent diseases, disorders or conditions associated with aberrant expression and\/or activity of a polypeptide of the invention, including, but not limited to, any one or more of the diseases, disorders, or conditions described herein.","For example, antibody antagonists of the invention may be used to treat, inhibit or prevent autoimmune diseases, disorders, or conditions associated with such diseases or disorders, including, but not limited to, autoimmune hemolytic anemia (including, but not limited to cryoglobinemia or Coombs positive anemia), autoimmune neonatal thrombocytopenia, idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura, autoimmune neutropenia, autoimmunocytopenia, hemolytic anemia, antiphospholipid syndrome, dermatitis (e.g. atopic dermatitis), gluten-sensitive enteropathy, allergic encephalomyclitis, myocarditis, relapsing polychondritis, rheumatic heart disease, Multiple Sclerosis, Neuritis, Uveitis Ophthalmia, Polyendocrinopathies, Purpura (e.g., Henloch-Scoenlein purpura), Reiter's Disease, Stiff-Man Syndrome, Autoimmune Pulmonary Inflammation, IgA glomerulonephritis, dense deposit disease, Guillain-Barre Syndrome, diabetes mellitus (e.g. Type I diabetes mellitus or insulin dependent diabetes mellitis), juvenile onset diabetes, and autoimmune inflammatory eye, autoimmune thyroiditis, hypothyroidism (i.e., Hashimoto's thyroiditis, systemic lupus erhythematosus, discoid lupus, Goodpasture's syndrome, Pemphigus, receptor autoimmunities such as, for example, (a) Graves' Disease, (b) Myasthenia Gravis, and (c) insulin resistance, autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura, rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma with anti-collagen antibodies, mixed connective tissue disease, polymyositis\/dermatomyositis, pernicious anemia (Addison's disease), idiopathic Addison's disease, infertility, glomerulonephritis such as primary glomerulonephritis and IgA nephropathy, bullous pemphigoid, Sjogren's syndrome, and adrenergic drug resistance (including adrenergic drug resistance with asthma or cystic fibrosis), chronic active hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, other endocrine gland failure, vitiligo, vasculitis, post-MI, cardiotomy syndrome, urticaria, atopic dermatitis, asthma, inflammatory myopathies, and other inflammatory, granulamatous, degenerative, atrophic disorders, and other disorders such as inflammatory skin diseases including psoriasis and sclerosis, responses associated with inflammatory bowel disease (such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis), respiratory distress syndrome (including adult respiratory distress syndrome, ARDS), meningitis, encephalitis, colitis, allergic conditions such as eczema and other conditions involving infiltration of T cells and chronic inflammatory responses, atherosclerosis, leukocyte adhesion deficiency, Reynaud's syndrome, and immune responses associated with acute and delayed hypersensitivity mediated by cytokines and T-lymphocytes typically found in tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, granulomatosis and diseases involving leukocyte diapedesis, central nervous system (CNS) inflammatory disorder, multiple organ injury syndrome, antigen-antibody complex mediated diseases, anti-glomerular basement membrane disease, Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome, Beheet disease, giant cell arteritis, immune complex nephritis, IgA nephropathy, IgM polyneuropathies or autoimmune thrombocytopenia etc.","In a specific embodiment, antibodies of the invention are used to treat, inhibit, prognose, diagnose or prevent rheumatoid arthritis. In a specific embodiment, antibodies of the invention are used to treat, inhibit, prognose, diagnose or prevent advanced rheumatoid arthritis. In another specific embodiment, antibodies of the invention are used to treat, inhibit, prognose, diagnose or prevent systemic lupus erythematosis.","For example, an antibody, or antibodies, of the present invention are used to treat patients with clinical diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The patient treated will not have a B cell malignancy. Moreover, the patient is optionally further treated with any one or more agents employed for treating RA such as salicylate; nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as indomethacin, phenylbutazone, phenylacetic acid derivatives (e.g. ibuprofen and fenoprofen), naphthalene acetic acids (naproxen), pyrrolealkanoic acid (tometin), indoleacetic acids (sulindac), halogenated anthranilic acid (meclofenamate sodium), piroxicam, zomepirac and diflunisal; antimalarials such as chloroquine; gold salts; penicillamine; or immunosuppressive agents such as methotrexate or corticosteroids in dosages known for such drugs or reduced dosages. Preferably however, the patient is only treated with an antibody, or antibodies, of the present invention. Antibodies of the present invention are administered to the RA patient according to a dosing schedule as described infra, which may be readily determined by one of ordinary skill in the art. The primary response is determined by the Paulus index (Paulus et al. Athritis Rheum. 33:477\u2013484 (1990)), i.e. improvement in morning stiffness, number of painful and inflamed joints, erythrocyte sedimentation (ESR), and at least a 2-point improvement on a 5-point scale of disease severity assessed by patient and by physician. Administration of an antibody, or antibodies, of the present invention will alleviate one or more of the symptoms of RA in the patient treated as described above.","In a further specific embodiment, antibodies of the invention are used to treat, inhibit, prognose, diagnose or prevent hemolytic anemia. For example, patients diagnosed with autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA), e.g., cryoglobinemia or Coombs positive anemia, are treated with an antibody, or antibodies, of the present invention. AIHA is an acquired hemolytic anemia due to auto-antibodies that react with the patient's red blood cells. The patient treated will not have a B cell malignancy. Further adjunct therapies (such as glucocorticoids, prednisone, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, vinca-laden platelets or Danazol) may be combined with the antibody therapy, but preferably the patient is treated with an antibody, or antibodies, of the present invention as a single-agent throughout the course of therapy. Antibodies of the present invention are administered to the hemolytic anemia patient according to a dosing schedule as described infra, which may be readily determined by one of ordinary skill in the art. Overall response rate is determined based upon an improvement in blood counts, decreased requirement for transfusions, improved hemoglobin levels and\/or a decrease in the evidence of hemolysis as determined by standard chemical parameters. Administration of an antibody, or antibodies of the present invention will improve any one or more of the symptoms of hemolytic anemia in the patient treated as described above. For example, the patient treated as described above will show an increase in hemoglobin and an improvement in chemical parameters of hemolysis or return to normal as measured by serum lactic dehydrogenase and\/or bilirubin.","In another specific embodiment, antibodies of the invention are used to treat, inhibit, prognose, diagnose or prevent adult immune thrombocytopenic purpura. Adult immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is a relatively rare hematologic disorder that constitutes the most common of the immune-mediated cytopenias. The disease typically presents with severe thrombocytopenia that may be associated with acute hemorrhage in the presence of normal to increased megakaryocytes in the bone marrow. Most patients with ITP have an IgG antibody directed against target antigens on the outer surface of the platelet membrane, resulting in platelet sequestration in the spleen and accelerated reticuloendothelial destruction of platelets (Bussell, J. B. Hematol. Oncol. Clin. North Am. (4):179 (1990)). A number of therapeutic interventions have been shown to be effective in the treatment of ITP. Steroids are generally considered first-line therapy, after which most patients are candidates for intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), splenectomy, or other medical therapies including vincristine or immunosuppressive\/cytotoxic agents. Up to 80% of patients with ITP initially respond to a course of steroids, but far fewer have complete and lasting remissions. Splenectomy has been recommended as standard second-line therapy for steroid failures, and leads to prolonged remission in nearly 60% of cases yet may result in reduced immunity to infection. Splenectomy is a major surgical procedure that may be associated with substantial morbidity (15%) and mortality (2%). IVIG has also been used as second line medical therapy, although only a small proportion of adult patients with ITP achieve remission. Therapeutic options that would interfere with the production of autoantibodies by activated B cells without the associated morbidities that occur with corticosteroids and\/or splenectomy would provide an important treatment approach for a proportion of patients with ITP. Patients with clinical diagnosis of ITP are treated with an antibody, or antibodies of the present invention, optionally in combination with steroid therapy. The patient treated will not have a B cell malignancy. Antibodies of the present invention are administered to the RA patient according to a dosing schedule as described infra, which may be readily determined by one of ordinary skill in the art. Overall patient response rate is determined based upon a platelet count determined on two consecutive occasions two weeks apart following treatments as described above.

Such immunodeficiencies include, but are not limited to, severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID)-X linked, SCID-autosomal, adenosine deaminase deficiency (ADA deficiency), X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA), Bruton's disease, congenital agammaglobulinemia, X-linked infantile agammaglobulinemia, acquired agammaglobulinemia, adult onset agammaglobulinemia, late-onset agammaglobulinemia, dysgammaglobulinemia, hypogammaglobulinemia, transient hypogammaglobulinemia of infancy, unspecified hypogammaglobulinemia, agammaglobulinemia, common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) (acquired), Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome (WAS), X-linked immunodeficiency with hyper IgM, non X-linked immunodeficiency with hyper IgM, selective IgA deficiency, IgG subclass deficiency (with or without IgA deficiency), antibody deficiency with normal or elevated Igs, immunodeficiency with thymoma, Ig heavy chain deletions, kappa chain deficiency, B cell lymphoproliferative disorder (BLPD), selective IgM immunodeficiency, recessive agammaglobulinemia (Swiss type), reticular dysgenesis, neonatal neutropenia, severe congenital leukopenia, thymic alymphoplasia-aplasia or dysplasia with immunodeficiency, ataxia-telangiectasia, short limbed dwarfism, X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome (XLP), Nezelof syndrome-combined immunodeficiency with Igs, purine nucleoside phosphorylase deficiency (PNP), MHC Class II deficiency (Bare Lymphocyte Syndrome) and severe combined immunodeficiency.","In another specific embodiment, antibodies of the invention are used to treat, inhibit, prognose, diagnose or prevent CVID, or a subgroup of individuals having CVID.","In another specific embodiment, antibody agonists of the invention are used as an adjuvant to stimulate B cell proliferation, immunoglobulin production, and\/or to enhance B cell survival.","The treatment and\/or prevention of diseases, disorders, or conditions associated with aberrant expression and\/or activity of a polypeptide of the invention includes, but is not limited to, alleviating symptoms associated with those diseases, disorders or conditions. The antibodies of the invention may also be used to target and kill cells expressing TR21 on their surface (e.g., B cells) and\/or cells having TR21 bound to their surface. Antibodies of the invention may be provided in pharmaceutically acceptable compositions as known in the art or as described herein.","A summary of the ways in which the antibodies of the present invention may be used therapeutically includes binding polynucleotides or polypeptides of the present invention locally or systemically in the body or by direct cytotoxicity of the antibody, e.g. as mediated by complement (CDC) or by effector cells (ADCC). Some of these approaches are described in more detail below. Armed with the teachings provided herein, one of ordinary skill in the art will know how to use the antibodies of the present invention for diagnostic, monitoring or therapeutic purposes without undue experimentation.","The antibodies of this invention may be advantageously utilized in combination with other monoclonal or chimeric antibodies, or with lymphokines or hematopoietic growth factors (such as, e.g., IL-2, IL-3 and IL-7), for example, which serve to increase the number or activity of effector cells which interact with the antibodies.","The antibodies of the invention may be administered alone or in combination with other types of treatments (e.g., radiation therapy, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, immunotherapy and anti-tumor agents). Generally, administration of products of a species origin or species reactivity (in the case of antibodies) that is the same species as that of the patient is preferred. Thus, in a preferred embodiment, human antibodies, fragments derivatives, analogs, or nucleic acids, are administered to a human patient for therapy or prophylaxis.","It is preferred to use high affinity and\/or potent in vivo inhibiting and\/or neutralizing antibodies against polypeptides or polynucleotides of the present invention, fragments or regions thereof, for both immunoassays directed to and therapy of disorders related to polynucleotides or polypeptides, including fragments thereof, of the present invention. Such antibodies, fragments, or regions, will preferably have an affinity for polynucleotides or polypeptides of the invention, including fragments thereof. Preferred binding affinities include those with a dissociation constant or Kd less than 5\u00d710M, 10M, 5\u00d710M, 10M, 5\u00d710M, 10M, 5\u00d710M, 10M, 5\u00d710M, 10M, 5\u00d710M, 10M, 5\u00d710M, or 10M.

Gene therapy refers to therapy performed by the administration to a subject of an expressed or expressible nucleic acid. In this embodiment of the invention, the nucleic acids produce their encoded protein that mediates a therapeutic effect.","Any of the methods for gene therapy available in the art can be used according to the present invention. Exemplary methods are described below.","For general reviews of the methods of gene therapy, see Goldspiel et al., Clinical Pharmacy 12:488\u2013505 (1993); Wu and Wu, Biotherapy 3:87\u201395 (1991); Tolstoshev, Ann. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 32:573\u2013596 (1993); Mulligan, Science 260:926\u2013932 (1993); and Morgan and Anderson, Ann. Rev. Biochem. 62:191\u2013217 (1993); May, TIBTECH 11(5):155\u2013215 (1993). Methods commonly known in the art of recombinant DNA technology which can be used are described in Ausubel et al. (eds.), Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley & Sons, NY (1993); and Kriegler, Gene Transfer and Expression, A Laboratory Manual, Stockton Press, NY (1990).","In a preferred aspect, the compound comprises nucleic acid sequences encoding an antibody, said nucleic acid sequences being part of expression vectors that express the antibody or fragments or chimeric proteins or heavy or light chains thereof in a suitable host. In particular, such nucleic acid sequences have promoters operably linked to the antibody coding region, said promoter being inducible or constitutive, and, optionally, tissue-specific. In another particular embodiment, nucleic acid molecules are used in which the antibody coding sequences and any other desired sequences are flanked by regions that promote homologous recombination at a desired site in the genome, thus providing for intrachromosomal expression of the antibody encoding nucleic acids (Koller and Smithies, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86:8932\u20138935 (1989); Zijlstra et al., Nature 342:435\u2013438 (1989). In specific embodiments, the expressed antibody molecule is a single chain antibody; alternatively, the nucleic acid sequences include sequences encoding both heavy and light chains or fragments thereof, of the antibody.","Delivery of the nucleic acids into a patient may be either direct, in which case the patient is directly exposed to the nucleic acid or nucleic acid-carrying vectors, or indirect, in which case, cells are first transformed with the nucleic acids in vitro, then transplanted into the patient. These two approaches are known, respectively, as in vivo or ex vivo gene therapy.","In a specific embodiment, the nucleic acid sequences are directly administered in vivo, where it is expressed to produce the encoded product. This can be accomplished by any of numerous methods known in the art, e.g., by constructing them as part of an appropriate nucleic acid expression vector and administering it so that they become intracellular, e.g., by infection using defective or attenuated retrovirals or other viral vectors (see U.S. Pat. No. 4,980,286), or by direct injection of naked DNA, or by use of microparticle bombardment (e.g., a gene gun; Biolistic, Dupont), or coating with lipids or cell-surface receptors or transfecting agents, encapsulation in liposomes, microparticles, or microcapsules, or by administering them in linkage to a peptide which is known to enter the nucleus, by administering it in linkage to a ligand subject to receptor-mediated endocytosis (see, e.g., Wu and Wu, J. Biol. Chem. 262:4429\u20134432 (1987)) (which can be used to target cell types specifically expressing the receptors), etc. In another embodiment, nucleic acid-ligand complexes can be formed in which the ligand comprises a fusogenic viral peptide to disrupt endosomes, allowing the nucleic acid to avoid lysosomal degradation. In yet another embodiment, the nucleic acid can be targeted in vivo for cell specific uptake and expression, by targeting a specific receptor (see, e.g., PCT Publications WO 92\/06180; WO 92\/22635; WO92\/20316; WO93\/14188, WO 93\/20221). Alternatively, the nucleic acid can be introduced intracellularly and incorporated within host cell DNA for expression, by homologous recombination (Koller and Smithies, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86:8932\u20138935 (1989); Zijlstra et al., Nature 342:435\u2013438 (1989)).","In a specific embodiment, viral vectors that contain nucleic acid sequences encoding an antibody of the invention are used. For example, a retroviral vector can be used (see Miller et al., Meth. Enzymol. 217:581\u2013599 (1993)). These retroviral vectors contain the components necessary for the correct packaging of the viral genome and integration into the host cell DNA. The nucleic acid sequences encoding the antibody to be used in gene therapy are cloned into one or more vectors, which facilitate delivery of the gene into a patient. More detail about retroviral vectors can be found in Boesen et al., Biotherapy 6:291\u2013302 (1994), which describes the use of a retroviral vector to deliver the mdr1 gene to hematopoietic stem cells in order to make the stem cells more resistant to chemotherapy. Other references illustrating the use of retroviral vectors in gene therapy are: Clowes et al., J. Clin. Invest. 93:644\u2013651 (1994); Kiem et al., Blood 83:1467\u20131473 (1994); Salmons and Gunzberg, Human Gene Therapy 4:129\u2013141 (1993); and Grossman and Wilson, Curr. Opin. in Genetics and Devel. 3:110\u2013114 (1993).","Adenoviruses are other viral vectors that can be used in gene therapy. Adenoviruses are especially attractive vehicles for delivering genes to respiratory epithelia. Adenoviruses naturally infect respiratory epithelia where they cause a mild disease. Other targets for adenovirus-based delivery systems are liver, the central nervous system, endothelial cells, and muscle. Adenoviruses have the advantage of being capable of infecting non-dividing cells. Kozarsky and Wilson, Current Opinion in Genetics and Development 3:499\u2013503 (1993) present a review of adenovirus-based gene therapy. Bout et al., Human Gene Therapy 5:3\u201310 (1994) demonstrated the use of adenovirus vectors to transfer genes to the respiratory epithelia of rhesus monkeys. Other instances of the use of adenoviruses in gene therapy can be found in Rosenfeld et al., Science 252:431\u2013434 (1991); Rosenfeld et al., Cell 68:143\u2013155 (1992); Mastrangeli et al., J. Clin. Invest. 91:225\u2013234 (1993); PCT Publication WO94\/12649; and Wang, et al., Gene Therapy 2:775\u2013783 (1995). In a preferred embodiment, adenovirus vectors are used.","Adeno-associated virus (AAV) has also been proposed for use in gene therapy (Walsh et al., Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 204:289\u2013300 (1993); U.S. Pat. No. 5,436,146).","Another approach to gene therapy involves transferring a gene to cells in tissue culture by such methods as electroporation, lipofection, calcium phosphate mediated transfection, or viral infection. Usually, the method of transfer includes the transfer of a selectable marker to the cells. The cells are then placed under selection to isolate those cells that have taken up and are expressing the transferred gene. Those cells are then delivered to a patient.","In this embodiment, the nucleic acid is introduced into a cell prior to administration in vivo of the resulting recombinant cell. Such introduction can be carried out by any method known in the art, including but not limited to transfection, electroporation, microinjection, infection with a viral or bacteriophage vector containing the nucleic acid sequences, cell fusion, chromosome-mediated gene transfer, microcell-mediated gene transfer, spheroplast fusion, etc. Numerous techniques are known in the art for the introduction of foreign genes into cells (see, e.g., Loeffler and Behr, Meth. Enzymol. 217:599\u2013618 (1993); Cohen et al., Meth. Enzymol. 217:618\u2013644 (1993); Cline, Pharmac. Ther. 29:69\u201392m (1985) and may be used in accordance with the present invention, provided that the necessary developmental and physiological functions of the recipient cells are not disrupted. The technique should provide for the stable transfer of the nucleic acid to the cell, so that the nucleic acid is expressible by the cell and preferably heritable and expressible by its progeny.","The resulting recombinant cells can be delivered to a patient by various methods known in the art. Recombinant blood cells (e.g., hematopoietic stem or progenitor cells) are preferably administered intravenously. The amount of cells envisioned for use depends on the desired effect, patient state, etc., and can be determined by one skilled in the art.","Cells into which a nucleic acid can be introduced for purposes of gene therapy encompass any desired, available cell type, and include but are not limited to epithelial cells, endothelial cells, keratinocytes, fibroblasts, muscle cells, hepatocytes; blood cells such as T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, megakaryocytes, granulocytes; various stem or progenitor cells, in particular hematopoietic stem or progenitor cells, e.g., as obtained from bone marrow, umbilical cord blood, peripheral blood, fetal liver, etc.","In a preferred embodiment, the cell used for gene therapy is autologous to the patient.","In an embodiment in which recombinant cells are used in gene therapy, nucleic acid sequences encoding an antibody are introduced into the cells such that they are expressible by the cells or their progeny, and the recombinant cells are then administered in vivo for therapeutic effect. In a specific embodiment, stem or progenitor cells are used. Any stem and\/or progenitor cells which can be isolated and maintained in vitro can potentially be used in accordance with this embodiment of the present invention (see e.g. PCT Publication WO 94\/08598; Stemple and Anderson, Cell 71:973\u2013985 (1992); Rheinwald, Meth. Cell Bio. 21A:229 (1980); and Pittelkow and Scott, Mayo Clinic Proc. 61:771 (1986)).","In a specific embodiment, the nucleic acid to be introduced for purposes of gene therapy comprises an inducible promoter operably linked to the coding region, such that expression of the nucleic acid is controllable by controlling the presence or absence of the appropriate inducer of transcription.","Demonstration of Therapeutic or Prophylactic Activity","The compounds or pharmaceutical compositions of the invention are preferably tested in vitro, and then in vivo for the desired therapeutic or prophylactic activity, prior to use in humans. For example, in vitro assays to demonstrate the therapeutic or prophylactic utility of a compound or pharmaceutical composition include, the effect of a compound on a cell line or a patient tissue sample. The effect of the compound or composition on the cell line and\/or tissue sample can be determined utilizing techniques known to those of skill in the art including, but not limited to, rosette formation assays and cell lysis assays. In accordance with the invention, in vitro assays which can be used to determine whether administration of a specific compound is indicated, include in vitro cell culture assays in which a patient tissue sample is grown in culture, and exposed to or otherwise administered a compound, and the effect of such compound upon the tissue sample is observed.","Therapeutic\/Prophylactic Administration and Composition","The invention provides methods of treatment, inhibition and prophylaxis by administration to a subject of an effective amount of a compound or pharmaceutical composition of the invention, such as, for example, an antibody of the invention. In a preferred aspect, the compound is substantially purified (e.g., substantially free from substances that limit its effect or produce undesired side-effects). The subject is preferably an animal, including but not limited to animals such as cows, pigs, horses, chickens, cats, dogs, etc., and is preferably a mammal, and most preferably human.","Formulations and methods of administration that can be employed when the compound comprises a nucleic acid or an immunoglobulin are described above; additional appropriate formulations and routes of administration can be selected from among those described herein below.","Various delivery systems are known and can be used to administer a compound of the invention, e.g., encapsulation in liposomes, microparticles, microcapsules, recombinant cells capable of expressing the compound, receptor-mediated endocytosis (see, e.g., Wu and Wu, J.

Chem. 262:4429\u20134432 (1987)), construction of a nucleic acid as part of a retroviral or other vector, etc. Methods of introduction include but are not limited to intradermal, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intravenous, subcutaneous, intranasal, epidural, and oral routes. The compounds or compositions may be administered by any convenient route, for example by infusion or bolus injection, by absorption through epithelial or mucocutaneous linings (e.g., oral mucosa, rectal and intestinal mucosa, etc.) and may be administered together with other biologically active agents. Administration can be systemic or local. In addition, it may be desirable to introduce the pharmaceutical compounds or compositions of the invention into the central nervous system by any suitable route, including intraventricular and intrathecal injection; intraventricular injection may be facilitated by an intraventricular catheter, for example, attached to a reservoir, such as an Ommaya reservoir. Pulmonary administration can also be employed, e.g., by use of an inhaler or nebulizer, and formulation with an aerosolizing agent.","In a specific embodiment, it may be desirable to administer the pharmaceutical compounds or compositions of the invention locally to the area in need of treatment; this may be achieved by, for example, and not by way of limitation, local infusion during surgery, topical application, e.g., in conjunction with a wound dressing after surgery, by injection, by means of a catheter, by means of a suppository, or by means of an implant, said implant being of a porous, non-porous, or gelatinous material, including membranes, such as sialastic membranes, or fibers. Preferably, when administering a protein, including an antibody, of the invention, care must be taken to use materials to which the protein does not adsorb.","In another embodiment, the compound or composition can be delivered in a vesicle, in particular a liposome (see Langer, Science 249:1527\u20131533 (1990); Treat et al., in Liposomes in the Therapy of Infectious Disease and Cancer, Lopez-Berestein and Fidler (eds.), Liss, New York, pp. 353\u2013365 (1989); Lopez-Berestein, ibid., pp. 317\u2013327; see generally ibid.)","In yet another embodiment, the compound or composition can be delivered in a controlled release system. In one embodiment, a pump may be used (see Langer, supra; Sefton, CRC Crit. Ref. Biomed. Eng. 14:201 (1987); Buchwald et al., Surgery 88:507 (1980); Saudek et al., N. Engl. J. Med. 321:574 (1989)). In another embodiment, polymeric materials can be used (see Medical Applications of Controlled Release, Langer and Wise (eds.), CRC Pres., Boca Raton, Fla. (1974); Controlled Drug Bioavailability, Dnig Product Design and Performance, Smolen and Ball (eds.), Wiley, New York (1984); Ranger and Peppas, J., Macromol. Sci. Rev. Macromol. Chem. 23:61 (1983); see also Levy et al., Science 228:190 (1985); During et al., Ann. Neurol. 25:351 (1989); Howard et al., J. Neurosurg. 71:105 (1989)). In yet another embodiment, a controlled release system can be placed in proximity of the therapeutic target, i.e., the brain, thus requiring only a fraction of the systemic dose (see, e.g., Goodson, in Medical Applications of Controlled Release, supra, vol. 2, pp. 115\u2013138 (1984)). Other controlled release systems are discussed in the review by Langer (Science 249:1527\u20131533 (1990)).","In a specific embodiment where the compound of the invention is a nucleic acid encoding a protein, the nucleic acid can be administered in vivo to promote expression of its encoded protein, by constructing it as part of an appropriate nucleic acid expression vector and administering it so that it becomes intracellular, e.g., by use of a retroviral vector (see U.S. Pat. No. 4,980,286), or by direct injection, or by use of microparticle bombardment (e.g., a gene gun; Biolistic, Dupont), or coating with lipids or cell-surface receptors or transfecting agents, or by administering it in linkage to a homeobox-like peptide which is known to enter the nucleus (see e.g., Joliot et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88:1864\u20131868 (1991)), etc. Alternatively, a nucleic acid can be introduced intracellularly and incorporated within host cell DNA for expression, by homologous recombination.","The present invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions. Such compositions comprise a therapeutically effective amount of a compound, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In a specific embodiment, the term \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable\u201d means approved by a regulatory agency of the Federal or a state government or listed in the U.S. Pharmacopoeia or other generally recognized pharmacopoeia for use in animals, and more particularly in humans. The term \u201ccarrier\u201d refers to a diluent, adjuvant, excipient, or vehicle with which the therapeutic is administered. Such pharmaceutical carriers can be sterile liquids, such as water and oils, including those of petroleum, animal, vegetable or synthetic origin, such as peanut oil, soybean oil, mineral oil, sesame oil and the like. Water is a preferred carrier when the pharmaceutical composition is administered intravenously. Saline solutions and aqueous dextrose and glycerol solutions can also be employed as liquid carriers, particularly for injectable solutions. Suitable pharmaceutical excipients include starch, glucose, lactose, sucrose, gelatin, malt, rice, flour, chalk, silica gel, sodium stearate, glycerol monostearate, talc, sodium chloride, dried skim milk, glycerol, propylene, glycol, water, ethanol and the like. The composition, if desired, can also contain minor amounts of wetting or emulsifying agents, or pH buffering agents. These compositions can take the form of solutions, suspensions, emulsion, tablets, pills, capsules, powders, sustained-release formulations and the like. The composition can be formulated as a suppository, with traditional binders and carriers such as triglycerides. Oral formulation can include standard carriers such as pharmaceutical grades of mannitol, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, sodium saccharine, cellulose, magnesium carbonate, etc. Examples of suitable pharmaceutical carriers are described in \u201cRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences\u201d by E. W. Martin. Such compositions will contain a therapeutically effective amount of the compound, preferably in purified form, together with a suitable amount of carrier so as to provide the form for proper administration to the patient. The formulation should suit the mode of administration.","In a preferred embodiment, the composition is formulated in accordance with routine procedures as a pharmaceutical composition adapted for intravenous administration to human beings. Typically, compositions for intravenous administration are solutions in sterile isotonic aqueous buffer. Where necessary, the composition may also include a solubilizing agent and a local anesthetic such as lignocaine to ease pain at the site of the injection. Generally, the ingredients are supplied either separately or mixed together in unit dosage form, for example, as a dry lyophilized powder or water free concentrate in a hermetically sealed container such as an ampoule or sachette indicating the quantity of active agent. Where the composition is to be administered by infusion, it can be dispensed with an infusion bottle containing sterile pharmaceutical grade water or saline. Where the composition is administered by injection, an ampoule of sterile water for injection or saline can be provided so that the ingredients may be mixed prior to administration.","The compounds of the invention can be formulated as neutral or salt forms. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include those formed with anions such as those derived from hydrochloric, phosphoric, acetic, oxalic, tartaric acids, etc., and those formed with cations such as those derived from sodium, potassium, ammonium, calcium, ferric hydroxides, isopropylamine, triethylamine, 2-ethylamino ethanol, histidine, procaine, etc.","The amount of the compound of the invention which will be effective in the treatment, inhibition and prevention of a disease or disorder associated with aberrant expression and\/or activity of a polypeptide of the invention can be determined by standard clinical techniques. In addition, in vitro assays may optionally be employed to help identify optimal dosage ranges. The precise dose to be employed in the formulation will also depend on the route of administration, and the seriousness of the disease or disorder, and should be decided according to the judgment of the practitioner and each patient's circumstances. Effective doses may be extrapolated from dose-response curves derived from in vitro or animal model test systems.","For antibodies, the dosage administered to a patient is typically 0.1 mg\/kg to 100 mg\/kg of the patient's body weight. Preferably, the dosage administered to a patient is between 0.1 mg\/kg and 20 mg\/kg of the patient's body weight, more preferably 1 mg\/kg to 10 mg\/kg of the patient's body weight. Generally, human antibodies have a longer half-life within the human body than antibodies from other species due to the immune response to the foreign polypeptides. Thus, lower dosages of human antibodies and less frequent administration is often possible. Further, the dosage and frequency of administration of antibodies of the invention may be reduced by enhancing uptake and tissue penetration (e.g., into the brain) of the antibodies by modifications such as, for example, lipidation.","The invention also provides a pharmaceutical pack or kit comprising one or more containers filled with one or more of the ingredients of the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention. Optionally associated with such container(s) can be a notice in the form prescribed by a governmental agency regulating the manufacture, use or sale of pharmaceuticals or biological products, which notice reflects approval by the agency of manufacture, use or sale for human administration. Diagnosis and Imaging.","Labeled antibodies, and derivatives and analogs thereof, which specifically bind to a polypeptide of interest can be used for diagnostic purposes to detect, diagnose, or monitor diseases and\/or disorders associated with the aberrant expression and\/or activity of a polypeptide of the invention. The invention provides for the detection of aberrant expression of a polypeptide of interest, comprising (a) assaying the expression of the polypeptide of interest in cells or body fluid of an individual using one or more antibodies specific to the polypeptide interest and (b) comparing the level of gene expression with a standard gene expression level, whereby an increase or decrease in the assayed polypeptide gene expression level compared to the standard expression level is indicative of aberrant expression.","The invention provides a diagnostic assay for diagnosing a disorder, comprising (a) assaying the expression of the polypeptide of interest in cells or body fluid of an individual using one or more antibodies specific to the polypeptide interest and (b) comparing the level of gene expression with a standard gene expression level, whereby an increase or decrease in the assayed polypeptide gene expression level compared to the standard expression level is indicative of a particular disorder. With respect to cancer, the presence of a relatively high amount of transcript in biopsied tissue from an individual may indicate a predisposition for the development of the disease, or may provide a means for detecting the disease prior to the appearance of actual clinical symptoms. A more definitive diagnosis of this type may allow health professionals to employ preventative measures or aggressive treatment earlier thereby preventing the development or further progression of the cancer.","Antibodies of the invention can be used to assay protein levels in a biological sample using classical immunohistological methods known to those of skill in the art (e.g., see Jalkanen, et al., J. Cell. Biol. 101:976\u2013985 (1985); Jalkanen, et al., J. Cell. Biol. 105:3087\u20133096 (1987)). Other antibody-based methods useful for detecting protein gene expression include immunoassays, such as the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and the radioimmunoassay (RIA). Suitable antibody assay labels are known in the art and include enzyme labels, such as, glucose oxidase; radioisotopes, such as radioisotopes, such as iodine (I, I, I, I), carbon (C), sulfur (S), tritium (H), indium (In, In, In, In), and technetium (Tc, Tc), thallium (Ti), gallium (Ga, Ga), palladium (Pd), molybdenum (Mo), xenon (Xe), fluorine (F), Sm, Lu, Gd, Pm, La, Yb, Ho, Y, Sc, Re, Re, Pr, Rh, Ru; luminescent labels, such as luminol; and fluorescent labels, such as fluorescein and rhodamine, and biotin.","One aspect of the invention is the detection and diagnosis of a disease or disorder associated with aberrant expression of a polypeptide of interest in an animal, preferably a mammal and most preferably a human. In one embodiment, diagnosis comprises: a) administering (for example, parenterally, subcutaneously, or intraperitoneally) to a subject an effective amount of a labeled molecule which specifically binds to the polypeptide of interest; b) waiting for a time interval following the administering for permitting the labeled molecule to preferentially concentrate at sites in the subject where the polypeptide is expressed (and for unbound labeled molecule to be cleared to background level); c) determining background level; and d) detecting the labeled molecule in the subject, such that detection of labeled molecule above the background level indicates that the subject has a particular disease or disorder associated with aberrant expression of the polypeptide of interest. Background level can be determined by various methods including, comparing the amount of labeled molecule detected to a standard value previously determined for a particular system.","It will be understood in the art that the size of the subject and the imaging system used will determine the quantity of imaging moiety needed to produce diagnostic images. In the case of a radioisotope moiety, for a human subject, the quantity of radioactivity injected will normally range from about 5 to 20 millicuries of 99 mTc. The labeled antibody or antibody fragment will then preferentially accumulate at the location of cells which contain the specific protein. In vivo tumor imaging is described in S. W. Burchiel et al., \u201cImmunopharmacokinetics of Radiolabeled Antibodies and Their Fragments.\u201d (Chapter 13 in Tumor Imaging: The Radiochemical Detection of Cancer, S. W. Burchiel and B. A. Rhodes, eds., Masson Publishing Inc. (1982).","Depending on several variables, including the type of label used and the mode of administration, the time interval following the administration for permitting the labeled molecule to preferentially concentrate at sites in the subject and for unbound labeled molecule to be cleared to background level is 6 to 48 hours or 6 to 24 hours or 6 to 12 hours. In another embodiment the time interval following administration is 5 to 20 days or 5 to 10 days.","In an embodiment, monitoring of the disease or disorder is carried out by repeating the method for diagnosing the disease or disease, for example, one month after initial diagnosis, six months after initial diagnosis, one year after initial diagnosis, etc.","Presence of the labeled molecule can be detected in the patient using methods known in the art for in vivo scanning. These methods depend upon the type of label used. Skilled artisans will be able to determine the appropriate method for detecting a particular label. Methods and devices that may be used in the diagnostic methods of the invention include, but are not limited to, computed tomography (CT), whole body scan such as position emission tomography (PET), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and sonography.","In a specific embodiment, the molecule is labeled with a radioisotope and is detected in the patient using a radiation responsive surgical instrument (Thurston et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,441,050). In another embodiment, the molecule is labeled with a fluorescent compound and is detected in the patient using a fluorescence responsive scanning instrument. In another embodiment, the molecule is labeled with a positron emitting metal and is detected in the patent using positron emission-tomography. In yet another embodiment, the molecule is labeled with a paramagnetic label and is detected in a patient using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).","Kits","The present invention provides kits that can be used in the above methods. In one embodiment, a kit comprises an antibody of the invention, preferably a purified antibody, in one or more containers. In a specific embodiment, the kits of the present invention contain a substantially isolated polypeptide comprising an epitope which is specifically immunoreactive with an antibody included in the kit. Preferably, the kits of the present invention further comprise a control antibody which does not react with the polypeptide of interest. In another specific embodiment, the kits of the present invention contain a means for detecting the binding of an antibody to a polypeptide of interest (e.g., the antibody may be conjugated to a detectable substrate such as a fluorescent compound, an enzymatic substrate, a radioactive compound or a luminescent compound, or a second antibody which recognizes the first antibody may be conjugated to a detectable substrate).","In another specific embodiment of the present invention, the kit is a diagnostic kit for use in screening serum containing antibodies specific against proliferative and\/or cancerous polynucleotides and polypeptides. Such a kit may include a control antibody that does not react with the polypeptide of interest. Such a kit may include a substantially isolated polypeptide antigen comprising an epitope which is specifically immunoreactive with at least one anti-polypeptide antigen antibody. Further, such a kit includes means for detecting the binding of said antibody to the antigen (e.g., the antibody may be conjugated to a fluorescent compound such as fluorescein or rhodamine which can be detected by flow cytometry). In specific embodiments, the kit may include a recombinantly produced or chemically synthesized polypeptide antigen. The polypeptide antigen of the kit may also be attached to a solid support.","In a more specific embodiment the detecting means of the above-described kit includes a solid support to which said polypeptide antigen is attached. Such a kit may also include a non-attached reporter-labeled anti-human antibody. In this embodiment, binding of the antibody to the polypeptide antigen can be detected by binding of the said reporter-labeled antibody.","In an additional embodiment, the invention includes a diagnostic kit for use in screening serum containing antigens of the polypeptide of the invention. The diagnostic kit includes a substantially isolated antibody specifically immunoreactive with polypeptide or polynucleotide antigens, and means for detecting the binding of the polynucleotide or polypeptide antigen to the antibody. In one embodiment, the antibody is attached to a solid support. In a specific embodiment, the antibody may be a monoclonal antibody. The detecting means of the kit may include a second, labeled monoclonal antibody. Alternatively, or in addition, the detecting means may include a labeled, competing antigen.","In one diagnostic configuration, test serum is reacted with a solid phase reagent having a surface-bound antigen obtained by the methods of the present invention. After binding with specific antigen antibody to the reagent and removing unbound serum components by washing, the reagent is reacted with reporter-labeled anti-human antibody to bind reporter to the reagent in proportion to the amount of bound anti-antigen antibody on the solid support. The reagent is again washed to remove unbound labeled antibody, and the amount of reporter associated with the reagent is determined. Typically, the reporter is an enzyme which is detected by incubating the solid phase in the presence of a suitable fluorometric, luminescent or colorimetric substrate (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.).","The solid surface reagent in the above assay is prepared by known techniques for attaching protein material to solid support material, such as polymeric beads, dip sticks, 96-well plate or filter material. These attachment methods generally include non-specific adsorption of the protein to the support or covalent attachment of the protein, typically through a free amine group, to a chemically reactive group on the solid support, such as an activated carboxyl, hydroxyl, or aldehyde group. Alternatively, streptavidin coated plates can be used in conjunction with biotinylated antigen(s).","Thus, the invention provides an assay system or kit for carrying out this diagnostic method. The kit generally includes a support with surface-bound recombinant antigens, and a reporter-labeled anti-human antibody for detecting surface-bound anti-antigen antibody.","Diagnosis of Immune System-Related Disorders","TR21 is preferentially expressed in mature B lymphocytes. For a number of immune system-related disorders, substantially altered (increased or decreased) levels of TR21 gene expression may be detected in immune system tissue or other cells or bodily fluids (e.g., sera, plasma, urine, synovial fluid or spinal fluid) taken from an individual having such a disorder, relative to a \u201cstandard\u201d TR21 gene expression level, that is, the TR21 expression level in immune system tissues or bodily fluids from an individual not having the immune system disorder. Thus, the invention provides a diagnostic method useful during diagnosis of an immune system disorder, which involves measuring the expression level of the gene encoding the TR21 polypeptide in immune system tissue or other cells or body fluid from an individual and comparing the measured gene expression level with a standard TR21 gene expression level, whereby an increase or decrease in the gene expression level compared to the standard is indicative of an immune system disorder or abnormal activation, proliferation, differentiation, and\/or death.","In particular, it is believed that certain tissues in mammals with cancer of cells or tissue of the immune system express significantly enhanced or reduced levels of the TR21 polypeptide and mRNA encoding the TR21 polypeptide when compared to a corresponding \u201cstandard\u201d level. Further, it is believed that enhanced or depressed levels of the TR21 polypeptide can be detected in certain body fluids (e.g., sera, plasma, urine, and spinal fluid) or cells or tissue from mammals with such a cancer when compared to sera from mammals of the same species not having the cancer.","For example, as disclosed herein, TR21 is highly expressed primarily in cells of B cell lineage. Accordingly, polynucleotides of the invention (e.g., polynucleotide sequences complementary to all or a portion of TR21 mRNA) and antibodies (and antibody fragments) directed against the polypeptides of the invention may be used to quantitate or qualitate concentrations of cells of B cell lineage (e.g., B cell leukemia and lymphoma cells) expressing TR21 on their cell surfaces. These antibodies additionally have diagnostic applications in detecting abnormalities in the level of TR21 gene expression, or abnormalities in the structure and\/or temporal, tissue, cellular, or subcellular location of TR21. These diagnostic assays may be performed in vivo or in vitro, such as, for example, on blood samples, biopsy tissue or autopsy tissue.","Additionally, as disclosed herein, TR21 ligand (e.g., Neutrokine-alpha) is expressed primarily on cells of monocytic lineage. Accordingly, TR21 polypeptides of the invention (including labeled TR21 polypeptides and TR21 fusion proteins), and anti-TR21 antibodies (including anti-TR21 antibody fragments) against the polypeptides of the invention may be used to quantitate or qualitate concentrations of cells of monocytic lineage (e.g., monocyte cell lineage related leukemias or lymphomas) expressing Neutrokine-alpha on their cell surfaces. These TR21 polypeptides and antibodies additionally have diagnostic applications in detecting abnormalities in the level of Neutrokine-alpha gene expression, or abnormalities in the structure and\/or temporal, tissue, cellular, or subcellular location of Neutrokine-alpha, and\/or diagnosing activity\/defects in signaling pathways associated with TR21. These diagnostic assays may be performed in vivo or in vitro, such as, for example, on blood samples or biopsy tissue using techniques described herein or otherwise known in the art.","In one embodiment, TR21 polynucleotides or polypeptides or TR21 agonists (e.g., anti-TR21 antibodies) or antagonists (e.g., anti-TR21 antibodies) of the invention are used to treat, diagnose, or prognose an individual having an autoimmune disease or disorder.","Autoimmune diseases or disorders that may be treated, diagnosed, or prognosed using TR21 polynucleotides or polypeptides (e.g., TR21 extracellular domain-Fc fusion polypeptides) or TR21 agonists (e.g., anti-TR21 antibodies) or antagonists (e.g., anti-TR21 antibodies) of the invention include, but are not limited to, one or more of the following: autoimmune hemolytic anemia, autoimmune neonatal thrombocytopenia, idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura, autoimmune neutropenia, autoimmunocytopenia, hemolytic anemia, antiphospholipid syndrome, dermatitis, gluten sensitive enteropathy, allergic encephalomyelitis, myocarditis, relapsing polychondritis, rheumatic heart disease, glomerulonephritis (e.g., IgA nephropathy), Multiple Sclerosis, Neuritis, Uveitis Ophthalmia, Polyendocrinopathies, Purpura (e.g., Henloch-Scoenlein purpura), Reiter's Disease, Stiff-Man Syndrome, Autoimmune Pulmonary Inflammation, myocarditis, IgA glomerulonephritis, dense deposit disease, rheumatic heart disease, Guillain-Barre Syndrome, insulin dependent diabetes mellitis, and autoimmune inflammatory eye, autoimmune thyroiditis, hypothyroidism (i.e., Hashimoto's thyroiditis, systemic lupus erhythematosus, discoid lupus, Goodpasture's syndrome, Pemphigus, Receptor autoimmunities such as, for example, (a) Graves' Disease, (b) Myasthenia Gravis, and (c) insulin resistance, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura, rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma with anti-collagen antibodies, mixed connective tissue disease, polymyositis\/dermatomyositis, pernicious anemia, idiopathic Addison's disease, infertility, glomerulonephritis such as primary glomerulonephritis and IgA nephropathy, bullous pemphigoid, Sjogren's syndrome, diabetes mellitus, and adrenergic drug resistance (including adrenergic drug resistance with asthma or cystic fibrosis), chronic active hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, other endocrine gland failure, vitiligo, vasculitis, post-MI, cardiotomy syndrome, urticaria, atopic dermatitis, asthma, inflammatory myopathies, and other inflammatory, granulamatous, degenerative, and atrophic disorders.","According to this embodiment, an individual having an autoimmune disease or disorder may express aberrantly high levels of TR21 ligand (e.g., Neutrokine-alpha) and\/or TR21 when compared to an individual not having an autoimmune disease or disorder. Any means described herein or otherwise known in the art may be applied to detect TR21 polynucleotides or polypeptides of the invention (e.g., FACS analysis or ELISA detection of TR21 polypeptides of the invention and hybridization or PCR detection of TR21 polynucleotides of the invention) and to determine the expression profile of, for example, TR21, polynucleotides and\/or polypeptides of the invention, in a biological sample.","A biological sample of persons afflicted with an autoimmune disease or disorder may be characterized by high levels of expression of TR21 when compared to that observed in individuals not having an autoimmune disease or disorder. Thus, TR21 polynucleotides and\/or polypeptides (e.g., anti-TR21 antibodies and TR21-extracellular domain-Fc fusion polypeptides) of the invention and\/or agonists or antagonists thereof, may be used according to the methods of the invention in the diagnosis and\/or prognosis of an autoimmune disease or disorder. For example, a biological sample obtained from a person suspected of being afflicted with an autoimmune disease or disorder (\u201cthe subject\u201d) may be analyzed for the relative expression level(s) of TR21 polynucleotides and\/or polypeptides of the invention. The expression level(s) of one or more of the TR21 molecules of the invention is (are) then compared to the expression level(s) of the same molecules of the invention as expressed in a person known not to be afflicted with an autoimmune disease or disorder. According to this example, a significant difference in expression level(s) of TR21, polynucleotides and\/or polypeptides of the invention, and\/or agonists and\/or antagonists thereof, between samples obtained from the subject and the control suggests that the subject is afflicted with an autoimmune disease or disorder.","In another embodiment, TR21 polynucleotides or polypeptides or TR21 agonists (such as, for example, anti-TR21 antibodies) or TR21 antagonists (such as, for example, anti-TR21 antibodies) of the invention are used to treat, diagnose, or prognose an individual having systemic lupus erythematosus or a subset of this disease. According to this embodiment, an individual having systemic lupus erythematosus or a subset of individuals having systemic lupus erythematosus may express aberrantly high levels of TR21 when compared to an individual not having systemic lupus erythematosus or this subset of systemic lupus. TR21 polynucleotides or polypeptides of the invention (e.g., FACS analysis or ELISA detection of TR21 polypeptides of the invention and hybridization or PCR detection of TR21 polynucleotides of the invention) may be used to determine the expression profile of TR21, polynucleotides and\/or polypeptides of the invention in a biological sample.","A biological sample of persons afflicted with systemic lupus erythematosus may be characterized by high levels of expression of TR21 when compared to that observed in individuals not having systemic lupus erythematosus. Thus, TR21 polynucleotides and\/or polypeptides of the invention and\/or agonists or antagonists thereof, may be used according to the methods of the invention in the diagnosis and\/or prognosis of systemic lupus erythematosus or a subset of systemic lupus erythematosus. For example, a biological sample obtained from a person suspected of being afflicted with systemic lupus erythematosus (\u201cthe subject\u201d) may be analyzed for the relative expression level(s) of TR21 polynucleotides and\/or polypeptides of the invention. The expression level(s) of one or more of these molecules of the invention is (are) then compared to the expression level(s) of the same molecules of the invention as expressed in a person known not to be afflicted with systemic lupus erythematosus. According to this example, a significant difference in expression level(s) of TR21, polynucleotides and\/or polypeptides of the invention, and\/or agonists (e.g., agonistic antibodies) and\/or antagonists thereof, between samples obtained from the subject and the control suggests that the subject is afflicted with systemic lupus erythematosus or a subset thereof.","Furthermore, there may be a direct correlation between the severity of systemic lupus erythematosus, or a subset of this disease, and the concentration of TR21 polynucleotides (RNA) and\/or polypeptides of the invention. Thus, TR21 polynucleotides (RNA) and\/or polypeptides and\/or agonists or antagonists of the invention, may be used according to the methods of the invention in prognosis of the severity of systemic lupus erythematosus or a subset of systemic lupus erythematosus. For example, a biological sample obtained from a person suspected of being afflicted with systemic lupus erythematosus (\u201cthe subject\u201d) may be analyzed for the relative expression level(s) of TR21 polynucleotides and\/or polypeptides of the invention. The expression level(s) of one or more of these molecules of the invention is (are) then compared to the expression level(s) of the same molecules of the invention as expressed in a panel of persons known to represent a range in severities of this disease. According to this example, the match of expression level with a characterized member of the panel indicates the severity of the disease.","In another embodiment, TR21 polynucleotides or polypeptide (e.g., anti-TR21 antibodies and TR21 extracellular domain-Fc fusion polypeptides) or TR21 agonists (such as, for example, anti-TR21 antibodies) or TR21 antagonists (such as, for example, anti-TR21 antibodies) of the invention are used to treat, diagnose, or prognose an individual having rheumatoid arthritis or a subset of this disease.

For example, a biological sample obtained from a person suspected of being afflicted with an immunodeficiency (\u201cthe subject\u201d) may be analyzed for the relative expression level(s) of TR21 polynucleotides and\/or polypeptides of the invention. The expression level(s) of one or more of these molecules of the invention is (are) then compared to the expression level(s) of the same molecules of the invention as expressed in a person known not to be afflicted with an immunodeficiency. A significant difference in expression level(s) of TR21, polynucleotides and\/or polypeptides of the invention, and\/or agonists and\/or antagonists thereof, between samples obtained from the subject and the control suggests that the subject is afflicted with an immunodeficiency.","In another embodiment, TR21 polynucleotides or polypeptides (e.g., TR21 extracellular domain-Fc fusion polypeptides) or TR21 agonists (e.g., anti-TR21 antibodies) or antagonists (e.g., anti-TR21 antibodies) of the invention are used to treat, diagnose and\/or prognose an individual having common variable immunodeficiency disease (\u201cCVID\u201d; also known as \u201cacquired agammaglobulinemia\u201d and \u201cacquired hypogammaglobulinemia\u201d) or a subset of this disease. According to this embodiment, an individual having CVID or a subset of individuals having CVID expresses aberrant levels of TR21 and\/or Neutrokine-alpha or Neutrokine-alpha SV on their B cells and\/or monocytes, when compared to individuals not having CVID. Any means described herein or otherwise known in the art may be applied to detect TR21 polynucleotides or polypeptides of the invention (e.g., FACS analysis or ELISA detection of TR21 polypeptides of the invention and hybridization or PCR detection of TR21 polynucleotides of the invention) and to determine differentially the expression profile of TR21 polynucleotides or polypeptides of the invention in a sample containing at least monocyte cells or some component thereof (e.g., RNA) as compared to a sample containing at least B cells or a component thereof (e.g., RNA). In the instance where a sample containing at least monocyte cells or some component thereof (e.g., RNA) is determined to reflect TR21 ligand (e.g., Neutrokine-alpha) polynucleotide or polypeptide expression and a sample containing at least B cells or a component thereof (e.g., RNA) is determined to reflect less than normal levels of TR21 polynucleotide or polypeptide expression, the samples may be correlated with the occurrence of CVID (i.e., \u201cacquired agammaglobulinemia\u201d or \u201cacquired hypogammaglobulinemia\u201d).","A subset of persons afflicted with CVID may be characterized by high levels of expression of Neutrokine-alpha, Neutrokine-alpha SV, and\/or TR21 polypeptides in peripheral or circulating B cells when compared to that observed in individuals not having CVID. In contrast, persons who are not afflicted with CVID are typically characterized by low levels of Neutrokine-alpha expression and high levels of TR21 expression in peripheral or circulating B cells. Thus, TR21 polypeptides, polynucleotides and\/or polypeptides of the invention, and\/or agonists or antagonists thereof, may be used according to the methods of the invention in the differential diagnosis of this subset of CVID. For example, a sample of peripheral B cells obtained from a person suspected of being afflicted with CVID (\u201cthe subject\u201d) may be analyzed for the relative expression level(s) of Neutrokine-alpha, Neutrokine-alpha SV, and\/or TR21 polynucleotides and\/or polypeptides of the invention. The expression level(s) of one or more of these molecules of the invention is (are) then compared to the expression level(s) of the same molecules of the invention as expressed in a person known not to be afflicted with CVID (\u201cthe control\u201d). According to this example, a significant difference in expression level(s) of Neutrokine-alpha, Neutrokine-alpha SV, and\/or TR21 polynucleotides or polypeptides of the invention, and\/or agonists and\/or antagonists thereof, between samples obtained from the subject and the control suggests that the subject is afflicted with this subset of CVID.","Cunningham-Rundles and Bodian followed 248 CVID patients over a period of 1\u201325 years and discovered that a number of associated diseases or conditions appear with increased frequency in CVID patients (Cunningham-Rundles and Bodian, 92:34\u201348 (1999) which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.) The most important clinical events include infections, autoimmunity, inflammatory disorders, marked by gastrointestinal and granulomatous disease, cancer and hepatitis. Most CVID patients are at increased risk of recurrent infections particularly of the respiratory tract. The types of acute and recurring bacterial infections exhibited in most patients include pneumonia, bronchitis and sinusitis. Children with CVID have a marked increased risk of otitis media. Additionally, blood borne infections including sepsis, meningitis, septic arthritis, and osteomyelitis are seen with increased frequency in these patients.","In another specific embodiment, TR21 polynucleotides or polypeptides, or agonists or antagonists thereof (e.g., anti-TR21 antibodies) are used to diagnose, prognose, treat, or prevent conditions associated with CVID, including, but not limited to, conditions associated with acute and recurring infections (e.g., pneumonia, bronchitis, sinusitis, otitis media, sepsis, meningitis, septic arthritis, and osteomyelitis), chronic lung disease, autoimmunity, granulomatous disease, lymphoma, cancers (e.g., cancers of the breast, stomach, colon, mouth, prostate, lung, vagina, ovary, skin, and melanin forming cells (i.e. melanoma), inflammatory bowel disease (e.g., Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and ulcerative proctitis), malabsorption, Hodgkin's disease, and Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia.","In a specific embodiment, TR21 polynucleotides or polypeptides, or agonists or antagonists thereof (e.g., anti-TR21 antibodies) are used to diagnose, prognose, treat, or prevent a disorder characterized by deficient serum immunoglobulin production, recurrent infections, and\/or immune system dysfunction. Moreover, TR21 polynucleotides or polypeptides, or agonists or antagonists thereof (e.g., anti-TR21 antibodies) may be used to diagnose, prognose, treat, or prevent infections of the joints, bones, skin, and\/or parotid glands, blood-borne infections (e.g., sepsis, meningitis, septic arthritis, and\/or osteomyelitis), autoimmune diseases (e.g., those disclosed herein), inflammatory disorders, and malignancies, and\/or any disease or disorder or condition associated with these infections, diseases, disorders and\/or malignancies) including, but not limited to, CVID, other primary immune deficiencies, HIV disease, CLL, recurrent bronchitis, sinusitis, otitis media, conjunctivitis, pneumonia, hepatitis, meningitis, herpes zoster (e.g., severe herpes zoster), and\/or ","Thus, the invention provides a diagnostic method useful during diagnosis of a immune system disorder, including cancers of this system, and immunodeficiencies and\/or autoimmune diseases which involves measuring the expression level of the gene encoding TR21 polypeptide in immune system tissue or other cells or body fluid from an individual and comparing the measured gene expression level with a standard TR21 gene expression level, whereby an increase or decrease in the gene expression level compared to the standard is indicative of an immune system disorder.","Where a diagnosis of a disorder in the immune system, including, but not limited to, diagnosis of a tumor, diagnosis of an immunodeficiency, and\/or diagnosis of an autoimmune disease, has already been made according to conventional methods, the present invention is useful as a prognostic indicator, whereby patients exhibiting enhanced or depressed TR21 gene expression will experience a worse clinical outcome relative to patients expressing the gene at a level nearer the standard level.","By analyzing or determining the expression level of the gene encoding the TR21 polypeptide is intended qualitatively or quantitatively measuring or estimating the level of the TR21 polypeptide or the level of the mRNA encoding the TR21 polypeptide in a first biological sample either directly (e.g., by determining or estimating absolute protein level or mRNA level) or relatively (e.g., by comparing to the TR21 polypeptide level or mRNA level in a second biological sample). Preferably, the TR21 polypeptide level or mRNA level in the first biological sample is measured or estimated and compared to a standard TR21 polypeptide level or mRNA level, the standard being taken from a second biological sample obtained from an individual not having the disorder or being determined by averaging levels from a population of individuals not having a disorder of the immune system. As will be appreciated in the art, once a standard TR21 polypeptide level or mRNA level is known, it can be used repeatedly as a standard for comparison.","By \u201cbiological sample\u201d is intended any biological sample obtained from an individual, body fluid, cell line, tissue culture, or other source which contains TR21 polypeptide or mRNA. As indicated, biological samples include body fluids (such as sera, plasma, urine, synovial fluid and spinal fluid) which contain free extracellular domains of the TR21 polypeptide, immune system tissue, and other tissue sources found to express complete or free extracellular domain of the TR21. Methods for obtaining tissue biopsies and body fluids from mammals are well known in the art. Where the biological sample is to include mRNA, a tissue biopsy is the preferred source.","The compounds of the present invention are useful for diagnosis, prognosis, or treatment of various immune system-related disorders in mammals, preferably humans. Such disorders include, but are not limited to tumors (e.g., B cell and monocytic cell leukemias and lymphomas) and tumor metastasis, infections by bacteria, viruses and other parasites, immunodeficiencies, inflammatory diseases, lymphadenopathy, autoimmune diseases (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjogren's syndrome, mixed connective tissue disease, and inflammatory myopathies), and graft versus host disease.","Total cellular RNA can be isolated from a biological sample using any suitable technique such as the single-step guanidinium-thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform method described in Chomczynski and Sacchi, 162:156\u2013159 (1987). Levels of mRNA encoding the TR21 polypeptide are then assayed using any appropriate method. These include Northern blot analysis, S1 nuclease mapping, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), reverse transcription in combination with the polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and reverse transcription in combination with the ligase chain reaction (RT-LCR).","Assaying TR21 polypeptide levels in a biological sample can occur using antibody-based techniques. For example, TR21 polypeptide expression in tissues can be studied with classical immunohistological methods (Jalkanen, M., et al., 101:976\u2013985 (1985); Jalkanen, M., et al., 105:3087\u20133096 (1987)). Other antibody-based methods useful for detecting TR21 polypeptide gene expression include immunoassays, such as the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and the radioimmunoassay (RIA). Suitable antibody assay labels are known in the art and include enzyme labels, such as, glucose oxidase, and radioisotopes, such as iodine (I, I, I, I), carbon (C), sulfur (S), tritium (H), indium (In, In, In, In), and technetium (Tc, Tc), thallium (Ti), gallium (Ga, Ga), palladium (Pd), molybdenum (Mo), xenon (Xe), fluorine (F), Sm, Lu, Gd, Pm, La, Yb, Ho, Y, Sc, Re, Re, Pr, Rh, Ru; luminescent labels, such as luminol; and fluorescent labels, such as fluorescein and rhodamine, and biotin.","Techniques known in the art may be applied to label polypeptides (including antibodies) of the invention. Such techniques include, but are not limited to, the use of bifunctional conjugating agents (see e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,756,065; 5,714,631; 5,696,239; 5,652,361; 5,505,931; 5,489,425; 5,435,990; 5,428,139; 5,342,604; 5,274,119; 4,994,560; and 5,808,003; the contents of each of which are hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety).","The tissue or cell type to be analyzed will generally include those which are known, or suspected, to express the TR21 (such as, for example, cells of B cell lineage and the spleen). The protein isolation methods employed herein may, for example, be such as those described in Harlow and Lane (Harlow, E. and Lane, D., 1988, \u201cAntibodies: A Laboratory Manual\u201d, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y.), which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The isolated cells can be derived from cell culture or from a patient. The analysis of cells taken from culture may be a necessary step in the assessment of cells that could be used as part of a cell-based gene therapy technique or, alternatively, to test the effect of compounds on the expression of the TR21 gene.","For example, antibodies, or fragments of antibodies, such as those described herein, may be used to quantitatively or qualitatively detect the presence of TR21 gene products or conserved variants or peptide fragments thereof. This can be accomplished, for example, by immunofluorescence techniques employing a fluorescently labeled antibody coupled with light microscopic, flow cytometric, or fluorimetric detection.","The antibodies (or fragments thereof) or TR21 polynucleotides or polypeptides, may additionally be employed histologically, as in immunofluorescence, immunoelectron microscopy or non-immunological assays, for in situ detection of TR21 gene products or conserved variants or peptide fragments thereof, or for Neutrokine-alpha and\/or Neutrokine-alpha SV binding to TR21. In situ detection may be accomplished by removing a histological specimen from a patient, and applying thereto a labeled antibody or TR21 polypeptide of the present invention. The antibody (or fragment) or TR21 polypeptide is preferably applied by overlaying the labeled antibody (or fragment) onto a biological sample. Through the use of such a procedure, it is possible to determine not only the presence of the TR21 gene product, or conserved variants or peptide fragments, or TR21 polypeptide binding, but also its distribution in the examined tissue. Using the present invention, those of ordinary skill will readily perceive that any of a wide variety of histological methods (such as staining procedures) can be modified in order to achieve such in situ detection.","Immunoassays and non-immunoassays for TR21 gene products or conserved variants or peptide fragments thereof will typically comprise incubating a sample, such as a biological fluid, a tissue extract, freshly harvested cells, or lysates of cells which have been incubated in cell culture, in the presence of a detectably labeled antibody capable of identifying TR21 gene products or conserved variants or peptide fragments thereof, and detecting the bound antibody by any of a number of techniques well-known in the art.","The biological sample may be brought in contact with and immobilized onto a solid phase support or carrier such as nitrocellulose, or other solid support which is capable of immobilizing cells, cell particles or soluble proteins. The support may then be washed with suitable buffers followed by treatment with the detectably labeled an anti-TR21 antibody or detectable polypeptide. The solid phase support may then be washed with the buffer a second time to remove unbound antibody or polypeptide. Optionally the antibody is subsequently labeled. The amount of bound label on solid support may then be detected by conventional means.","By \u201csolid phase support or carrier\u201d is intended any support capable of binding an antigen or an antibody. Well-known supports or carriers include glass, polystyrene, polypropylene, polyethylene, dextran, nylon, amylases, natural and modified celluloses, polyacrylamides, gabbros, and magnetite. The nature of the carrier can be either soluble to some extent or insoluble for the purposes of the present invention. The support material may have virtually any possible structural configuration so long as the coupled molecule is capable of binding to an antigen or antibody. Thus, the support configuration may be spherical, as in a bead, or cylindrical, as in the inside surface of a test tube, or the external surface of a rod. Alternatively, the surface may be flat such as a sheet, test strip, etc. Preferred supports include polystyrene beads. Those skilled in the art will know many other suitable carriers for binding antibody or antigen, or will be able to ascertain the same by use of routine experimentation.","The binding activity of a given lot of anti-TR21 antibody or TR21 polypeptide may be determined according to well-known methods. Those skilled in the art will be able to determine operative and optimal assay conditions for each determination by employing routine experimentation.","In addition to assaying TR21 polypeptide levels or polynucleotide levels in a biological sample obtained from an individual, TR21 polypeptides or polynucleotides can also be detected in vivo by imaging. For example, in one embodiment of the invention, TR21 polypeptide and\/or anti-TR21 antibody is used to image B cell lymphomas. In another embodiment, TR21 polypeptides and\/or anti-TR21 antibodies and\/or TR21 polynucleotides of the invention (e.g., polynucleotides complementary to all or a portion of TR21 mRNA) is used to image lymphomas (e.g., monocyte and B cell lymphomas).","Antibody labels or markers for in vivo imaging of TR21 polypeptide include those detectable by X-radiography, NMR, MRI, CAT-scans or ESR. For X-radiography, suitable labels include radioisotopes such as barium or cesium, which emit detectable radiation but are not overtly harmful to the subject. Suitable markers for NMR and ESR include those with a detectable characteristic spin, such as deuterium, which may be incorporated into the antibody by labeling of nutrients for the relevant hybridoma. Where in vivo imaging is used to detect enhanced levels of TR21 polypeptide for diagnosis in humans, it may be preferable to use human antibodies or \u201chumanized\u201d chimeric monoclonal antibodies. Such antibodies can be produced using techniques described herein or otherwise known in the art. For example methods for producing chimeric antibodies are known in the art. See, for review, Morrison, 229:1202 (1985); Oi et al., 4:214 (1986); Cabilly et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567; Taniguchi et al., EP 171496; Morrison et al., EP 173494; Neuberger et al., WO 8601533; Robinson et al., WO 8702671; Boulianne et al., 312:643 (1984); Neuberger et al., 314:268 (1985).","Additionally, any TR21 polypeptide whose presence can be detected can be administered. For example, TR21 polypeptides labeled with a radio-opaque or other appropriate compound can be administered and visualized in vivo, as discussed, above for labeled antibodies. Further such TR21 polypeptides can be utilized for in vitro diagnostic procedures.","A TR21 polypeptide-specific antibody or antibody fragment which has been labeled with an appropriate detectable imaging moiety, such as a radioisotope (for example, I, In, Tc, (I, I, I, I), carbon (C), sulfur (S), tritium (H), indium (In, In, In, In), and technetium (Tc, Tc), thallium (Ti), gallium (Ga, Ga), palladium (Pd), molybdenum (Mo), xenon (Xe), fluorine (F), Sm, Lu, Gd, Pm, La, Yb, Ho, Y, Sc, Re, Re, Pr, Rh, Ru), a radio-opaque substance, or a material detectable by nuclear magnetic resonance, is introduced (for example, parenterally, subcutaneously or intraperitoneally) into the mammal to be examined for immune system disorder. It will be understood in the art that the size of the subject and the imaging system used will determine the quantity of imaging moiety needed to produce diagnostic images. In the case of a radioisotope moiety, for a human subject, the quantity of radioactivity injected will normally range from about 5 to 20 millicuries of Tc. The labeled antibody or antibody fragment will then preferentially accumulate at the location of cells which contain TR21 protein. In vivo tumor imaging is described in S. W. Burchiel et al., \u201cImmunopharmacokinetics of Radiolabeled Antibodies and Their Fragments\u201d (Chapter 13 in , S. W. Burchiel and B. A. Rhodes, eds., Masson Publishing Inc. (1982)).","With respect to antibodies, one of the ways in which the anti-TR21 antibody can be detectably labeled is by linking the same to an enzyme and using the linked product in an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) (Voller, A., \u201cThe Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)\u201d, 1978, Diagnostic Horizons 2:1\u20137, Microbiological Associates Quarterly Publication, Walkersville, Md.); Voller et al., 31:507\u2013520 (1978); Butler, J. E., 73:482\u2013523 (1981); Maggio, E. (ed.), 1980, Enzyme Immunoassay, CRC Press, Boca Raton, Fla.; Ishikawa, E. et al., (eds.), 1981, Enzyme Immunoassay, Kgaku Shoin, Tokyo). The enzyme which is bound to the antibody will react with an appropriate substrate, preferably a chromogenic substrate, in such a manner as to produce a chemical moiety which can be detected, for example, by spectrophotometric, fluorimetric or by visual means. Enzymes which can be used to detectably label the antibody include, but are not limited to, malate dehydrogenase, staphylococcal nuclease, delta-5-steroid isomerase, yeast alcohol dehydrogenase, alpha-glycerophosphate, dehydrogenase, triose phosphate isomerase, horseradish peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase, asparaginase, glucose oxidase, beta-galactosidase, ribonuclease, urease, catalase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, glucoamylase and acetylcholinesterase. Additionally, the detection can be accomplished by colorimetric methods which employ a chromogenic substrate for the enzyme. Detection may also be accomplished by visual comparison of the extent of enzymatic reaction of a substrate in comparison with similarly prepared standards.","Detection may also be accomplished using any of a variety of other immunoassays. For example, by radioactively labeling the antibodies or antibody fragments, it is possible to detect TR21 through the use of a radioimmunoassay (RIA) (see, for example, Weintraub, B., Principles of Radioimmunoassays, Seventh Training Course on Radioligand Assay Techniques, The Endocrine Society, March, 1986, which is incorporated by reference herein). The radioactive isotope can be detected by means including, but not limited to, a gamma counter, a scintillation counter, or autoradiography.","It is also possible to label the antibody with a fluorescent compound. When the fluorescently labeled antibody is exposed to light of the proper wavelength, its presence can then be detected due to fluorescence. Among the most commonly used fluorescent labeling compounds are fluorescein isothiocyanate, rhodamine, phycoerythrin, phycocyanin, allophycocyanin, ophthaldehyde and fluorescamine.","The antibody can also be detectably labeled using fluorescence emitting metals such as Eu, or others of the lanthanide series. These metals can be attached to the antibody using such metal chelating groups as diethylenetriaminepentacetic acid (DTPA) or ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA).","The antibody also can be detectably labeled by coupling it to a chemiluminescent compound. The presence of the chemiluminescent-tagged antibody is then determined by detecting the presence of luminescence that arises during the course of a chemical reaction. Examples of particularly useful chemiluminescent labeling compounds are luminol, isoluminol, theromatic acridinium ester, imidazole, acridinium salt and oxalate ester.","Likewise, a bioluminescent compound may be used to label the antibody of the present invention. Bioluminescence is a type of chemiluminescence found in biological systems in, which a catalytic protein increases the efficiency of the chemiluminescent reaction. The presence of a bioluminescent protein is determined by detecting the presence of luminescence. Important bioluminescent compounds for purposes of labeling include, but are not limited to, luciferin, luciferase and aequorin.","Treatment of Immune System-Related Disorders","As noted above, TR21 polynucleotides and polypeptides (e.g., TR21 extracellular domain-Fc fusion proteins), and anti-TR21 antibodies, are useful for diagnosis of conditions involving abnormally high or low expression of TR21 activities. For example, given the cells and tissues where TR21 is expressed as well as the activities modulated by TR21, it is readily apparent that a substantially altered (increased or decreased) level of expression of TR21 in an individual compared to the standard or \u201cnormal\u201d level may produce pathological conditions related to the bodily system(s) in which TR21 is expressed and\/or is active.","It will also be appreciated by one of ordinary skill that, since the TR21 polypeptides of the invention are members of the TNFR family, the extracellular domains of the respective proteins may be released in soluble form from the cells which express TR21 by proteolytic cleavage and therefore, when TR21 polypeptide (particularly a soluble form of the respective extracellular domains) is added from an exogenous source to cells, tissues or the body of an individual, the polypeptide may inhibit the modulating activities of its ligand (e.g., Neutrokine-alpha) on any of its target cells of that individual. Also, cells expressing this type III transmembrane protein may be added to cells, tissues or the body of an individual whereby the added cells will bind to cells expressing TR21 ligands (e.g., Neutrokine-alpha) whereby the cells expressing the TR21 ligand (e.g., Neutrokine-alpha) can cause actions (e.g., proliferation or cytotoxicity) on the ligand-bearing target cells.","The present invention is further directed to TR21 based therapies which involve administering TR21 based therapeutic compounds of the invention to an animal, preferably a mammal, and most preferably a human, patient for treating one or more of the diseases, disorders, or conditions disclosed herein. Therapeutic compounds of the invention include, but are not limited to, TR21 polypeptides (including fragments and variants of TR21 polypeptides), polynucleotides encoding these polypeptides, antibodies that bind these polypeptides, and agonists and\/or antagonists of these polypeptides, polynucleotides and antibodies. The TR21 polypeptides, polynucleotides, and antibodies of the invention can be used to treat, ameliorate or prevent diseases, disorders or conditions associated with aberrant expression and\/or activity of Neutrokine-alpha, Neutrokine-alpha SV (See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,969,102; and von Bulow et al., Science 278:138\u2013141(1997)), and\/or TR21, including, but not limited to, any one or more of the diseases, disorders, or conditions described herein. The treatment and\/or prevention of diseases, disorders, or conditions associated with aberrant expression and\/or activity of Neutrokine-alpha, Neutrokine-alpha SV, and\/or TR21, includes, but is not limited to, alleviating symptoms associated with those diseases, disorders or conditions. TR21 compositions of the invention may be provided in pharmaceutically acceptable compositions as known in the art or as described herein.","The TR21 polypeptides, polynucleotides, and antibodies of the invention that function as agonists or antagonists of Neutrokine alpha, Neutrokine-alpha SV and\/or heteromultimeric polypeptide complexes comprising one or more copies of Neutrokine-alpha and\/or Neutrokine-alpha SV, preferably of signal transduction induced by Neutrokine alpha, Neutrokine-alpha SV and\/or heteromultimeric polypeptide complexes comprising one or more copies of Neutrokine-alpha and\/or Neutrokine-alpha SV, can be administered to an animal to treat, prevent or ameliorate a disease or disorder associated with aberrant expression of Neutrokine alpha, Neutrokine-alpha SV and\/or heteromultimeric polypeptide complexes comprising one or more copies of Neutrokine-alpha and\/or Neutrokine-alpha SV, lack of function of Neutrokine alpha, Neutrokine-alpha SV and\/or heteromultimeric polypeptide complexes comprising one or more copies of Neutrokine-alpha and\/or Neutrokine-alpha SV, aberrant TR21 expression, aberrant TACI and\/or BCMA expression, lack of TR21 function and\/or lack of TACI and\/or BCMA function. For example, TR21 polypeptides of the invention which disrupt the interaction between TR21 and one or more of its ligands may be administered to an animal to treat, prevent or ameliorate a disease or disorder associated with aberrant expression of Neutrokine alpha, Neutrokine-alpha SV and\/or heteromultimeric polypeptide complexes comprising one or more copies of Neutrokine-alpha and\/or Neutrokine-alpha SV, excessive function of Neutrokine alpha, Neutrokine-alpha SV and\/or heteromultimeric polypeptide complexes comprising one or more copies of Neutrokine-alpha and\/or Neutrokine-alpha SV, aberrant TR21 expression, aberrant TACI and\/or BCMA expression, excessive TR21 function or excessive TACI and\/or BCMA function.","In a preferred embodiment, TR21 polypeptides of the invention neutralize activity of Neutrokine alpha, Neutrokine-alpha SV and\/or heteromultimeric polypeptide complexes comprising one or more copies of Neutrokine-alpha and\/or Neutrokine-alpha SV. In another preferred embodiment, TR21 polypeptides of the invention inhibit B cell proliferation. In another preferred embodiment, TR21 polypeptides of the invention inhibit immunoglobulin production by B cells.","In a preferred embodiment, TR21 polypeptides of the invention (including TR21 fragments and variants, and anti-TR21 antibodies) inhibit or reduce binding of the soluble form of Neutrokine alpha, Neutrokine-alpha SV and\/or heteromultimeric polypeptide complexes comprising one or more copies of Neutrokine-alpha and\/or Neutrokine-alpha SV to a Neutrokine alpha receptor (e.g., TR21 and\/or TACI and\/or BCMA). In another preferred embodiment TR21 polypeptides of the invention (including TR21 fragments and variants, and anti-TR21 antibodies) inhibit or reduce B cell proliferation induced by the soluble form of Neutrokine alpha, Neutrokine-alpha SV and\/or heteromultimeric polypeptide complexes comprising one or more copies of Neutrokine-alpha and\/or Neutrokine-alpha SV. In another preferred embodiment TR21 polypeptides of the invention (including TR21 fragments and variants, and anti-TR21 antibodies) inhibit or reduce immunoglobulin production induced by the soluble form of Neutrokine alpha, Neutrokine-alpha SV and\/or heteromultimeric polypeptide complexes comprising one or more copies of Neutrokine-alpha and\/or Neutrokine-alpha SV. In another preferred embodiment TR21 polypeptides of the invention (including TR21 fragments and variants, and anti-TR21 antibodies) inhibit or reduce immunoglobulin production in response to T cell dependent immunogens. In another preferred embodiment TR21 polypeptides of the invention (including TR21 fragments and variants, and anti-TR21 antibodies) inhibit or reduce immunoglobulin production in response to T cell independent immunogens.","In another preferred embodiment TR21 polypeptides of the invention (including TR21 fragments and variants, and anti-TR21 antibodies) promote or enhance B cell proliferation induced by the soluble form of Neutrokine alpha, Neutrokine-alpha SV and\/or heteromultimeric polypeptide complexes comprising one or more copies of Neutrokine-alpha and\/or Neutrokine-alpha SV. In another preferred embodiment TR21 polypeptides of the invention (including TR21 fragments and variants, and anti-TR21 antibodies) increase or enhance immunoglobulin production induced by the soluble form of Neutrokine alpha, Neutrokine-alpha SV and\/or heteromultimeric polypeptide complexes comprising one or more copies of Neutrokine-alpha and\/or Neutrokine-alpha SV.

Polo like kinases (PLK) belong to a sub family of serine\/threonine kinases related to the cell cycle protein CDC5. The expression of PLK is induced during G2 and S phase of the cell cycle. PLK is reported to play a role in cell proliferation (See e.g., Lee et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 95:9301\u20139306). The role of extracellular-signal related kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1 and 2) in cell survival and proliferation in response to stimulation by growth factors and other agonists has been extensively studied. The induced expression of PLK and ERK-1 is consistent with the survival and proliferative effects of Neutrokine-alpha on B cells.","Additionally, in some samples of human tonsillar B cells stimulated with Neutrokine-alpha and SAC, mRNA for CD25 (IL-2R alpha) was upregulated. Nuclear extracts from human tonsillar B cells treated with Neutrokine-alpha and from IM-9 cells treated with Neutrokine-alpha were able to shift probes from the CD25 promoter region containing sites for NF-kappaB, SRF, ELF-1 and HMGI\/Y in an electromobility shift assay. ELF-1 for example, is a transcription factor that is part of the ETS family of proteins and whose expression appears to be restricted to T and B cells. Binding sites for ELF-1 have been described in the promoters of a number of proteins that are important in the regulation of the immune response.","Thus Neutrokine-alpha induced signaling has been shown to be consistent with the activation of cellular activation and cellular proliferation pathways as well as with cellular signaling pathways that regulate B cell lifespan. Further, Neutrokine-alpha treatment of B cells induces cellular proliferation and immunoglobulin secretion, a characteristic of activation of B cells (Moore et al., Science 285:260\u2013263, 1999).

BrdU is a thymidine analogue that gets incorporated into the DNA of dividing cells. Cells containing BrdU in their DNA can be detected using, for example fluorescently labeled anti-BrdU antibody and flow cytometry. Briefly, an animal is injected with BrdU in an amount sufficient to label developing B cells. Then, a sample of B cells is withdrawn from the animal, for example, from peripheral blood, and analyzed for the percentage of cells that contain BrdU. Such an analysis performed at several time points can be used to calculate the halflife of B cells. Alternatively, B cell survival may be measured in vitro. For example, B cells may be cultured under conditions where proliferation does not occur, (for example the media should contain no reagents that crosslink the immunoglobulin receptor, such as anti-IgM antibodies) for a period of time (usually 2\u20134 days). At the end of this time, the percent of surviving cells is determined, using for instance, the vital dye Trypan Blue, or by staining cells with propidium iodide or any other agent designed to specifically stain apoptotic cells and analyzing the percentage of cells stained using flow cytometry.

The expression of Neutrokine-alpha on monocytes, the expression of TR21 on B cells, and the responsiveness of B cells to Neutrokine-alpha suggests that it may be involved in exchange of signals between B cells and monocytes or their differentiated progeny. This activity is in many ways analogous to the CD40\u2013CD 154 signaling between B cells and T cells. TR21 may therefore be an important regulator of T cell independent immune responses to environmental pathogens.

In specific embodiments, the host is a mouse, rabbit, goat, guinea pig, chicken, rat, hamster, pig, sheep, dog or cat. In preferred embodiments, the host is a mammal. In most preferred embodiments, the host is a human.","The agonists and antagonists may be employed in a composition with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, e.g., as described herein.","The antagonists may be employed, for instance, to inhibit TR21-mediated chemotaxis and activation of macrophages and their precursors, and of neutrophils, basophils, B lymphocytes and some T-cell subsets, e.g., activated and CD8 cytotoxic T cells and natural killer cells, in certain auto-immune and chronic inflammatory and infective diseases. Examples of auto-immune diseases include multiple sclerosis, and insulin-dependent diabetes. The antagonists may also be employed to treat, prevent, and\/or diagnose infectious diseases including silicosis, sarcoidosis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis by preventing the recruitment and activation of mononuclear phagocytes. They may also be employed to treat, prevent, and\/or diagnose idiopathic hyper-eosinophilic syndrome by preventing eosinophil production and migration. Endotoxic shock may also be treated by the antagonists by preventing the migration of macrophages and their production of the TR21 polypeptides of the present invention. The antagonists may also be employed for treating atherosclerosis, by preventing monocyte infiltration in the artery wall. The antagonists may also be employed to treat, prevent, and\/or diagnose histamine-mediated allergic reactions and immunological disorders including late phase allergic reactions, chronic urticaria, and atopic dermatitis by inhibiting chemokine-induced mast cell and basophil degranulation and release of histamine. IgE-mediated allergic reactions such as allergic asthma, rhinitis, and eczema may also be treated. The antagonists may also be employed to treat, prevent, and\/or diagnose chronic and acute inflammation by preventing the attraction of monocytes to a wound area. They may also be employed to regulate normal pulmonary macrophage populations, since chronic and acute inflammatory pulmonary diseases are associated with sequestration of mononuclear phagocytes in the lung. Antagonists may also be employed to treat, prevent, and\/or diagnose rheumatoid arthritis by preventing the attraction of monocytes into synovial fluid in the joints of patients. Monocyte influx and activation plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of both degenerative and inflammatory arthropathies. The antagonists may be employed to interfere with the deleterious cascades attributed primarily to IL-1 and TNF, which prevents the biosynthesis of other inflammatory cytokines. In this way, the antagonists may be employed to prevent inflammation. The antagonists may also be employed to inhibit prostaglandin-independent fever induced by TR21. The antagonists may also be employed to treat, prevent, and\/or diagnose cases of bone marrow failure, for example, aplastic anemia and myelodysplastic syndrome. The antagonists may also be employed to treat, prevent, and\/or diagnose asthma and allergy by preventing eosinophil accumulation in the lung. The antagonists may also be employed to treat, prevent, and\/or diagnose subepithelial basement membrane fibrosis which is a prominent feature of the asthmatic lung. The antagonists may also be employed to treat, prevent, and\/or diagnose lymphomas (e.g., one or more of the extensive, but not limiting, list of lymphomas provided herein).","All of the above described applications as they may apply to veterinary medicine.

Many autoimmune disorders result from inappropriate recognition of self as foreign material by immune cells. This inappropriate recognition results in an immune response leading to the destruction of the host tissue. Therefore, the administration of TR21 polynucleotides or polypeptides of the invention and\/or agonists and\/or antagonists thereof that can inhibit an immune response, particularly the proliferation of B cells and\/or the production of immunoglobulins, may be an effective therapy in treating and\/or preventing autoimmune disorders.

V. Goeddel et al., \u201cTumor Necrosis Factors: Gene Structure and Biological Activities,\u201d 51:597\u2013609 (1986), Cold Spring Harbor; B. Beutler and A. Cerami, 57:505\u2013518 (1988); L. J. Old, 258:59\u201375 (1988); W. Fiers, 285:199\u2013224 (1991)). The TNF-family ligands, including the TR21 ligands (e.g., Neutrokine-alpha), induce such various cellular responses by binding to TNF-family receptors, including TR21. TNF-ligand (e.g., Neutrokine-alpha)\/TR21 interactions may elicit a potent cellular response including any genotypic, phenotypic, and\/or morphologic change to the cell, cell line, tissue, tissue culture or patient. As indicated, such cellular responses include not only normal physiological responses to TNF-family ligands, but such responses may lead to diseases associated with dysregulation of these physiological responses, such as, for example, diseases associated with increased apoptosis or the inhibition of apoptosis. Apoptosis-programmed cell death-is a physiological mechanism involved in the deletion of peripheral B and\/or T lymphocytes of the immune system, and its dysregulation can lead to a number of different pathogenic processes (J. C. Arneisen, 8:1197\u20131213 (1994); P. H.

Preferably, TR21 mediated signaling is increased or decreased to treat, prevent, and\/or diagnose a disease wherein decreased apoptosis or decreased cytokine and adhesion molecule expression is exhibited. An agonist or antagonist can include soluble forms of TR21 and monoclonal antibodies directed against the TR21 polypeptide.","Many of the pathologies associated with HIV are mediated by apoptosis, including HIV-induced nephropathy and HIV encephalitis. Thus, in additional preferred embodiments, TR21 polynucleotides, polypeptides, and\/or TR21 agonists (e.g., anti-TR21 antibodies) or antagonists of the invention are used to treat AIDS and pathologies associated with AIDS.","The state of immunodeficiency that defines AIDS is secondary to a decrease in the number and function of CD4 T-lymphocytes. Recent reports estimate the daily loss of CD4 T cells to be between 3.5\u00d710and 2\u00d710cells (Wei et al., 373:117\u2013122 (1995)). One cause of CD4 T cell depletion in the setting of HIV infection is believed to be HIV-induced apoptosis (see, for example, Meyaard et al., 257:217\u2013219, 1992; Groux et al., 175:331, 1992; and Oyaizu et al., in , Andrieu and Lu, Eds., Plenum Press, New York, 1995, pp. 101\u2013114). Indeed, HIV-induced apoptotic cell death has been demonstrated not only in vitro but also, more importantly, in infected individuals (J. C. Ameisen, 8:1197\u20131213 (1994); T. H. Finkel and N. K. Banda, 6:605\u2013615(1995); C. A. Muro-Cacho et al., 154:5555\u20135566 (1995)). Furthermore, apoptosis and CD4 T-lymphocyte depletion is tightly correlated in different animal models of AIDS (T. Brunner et al., 373:441\u2013444 (1995); M. L. Gougeon et al., 9:553\u2013563 (1993)) and, apoptosis is not observed in those animal models in which viral replication does not result in AIDS. Id. Further data indicates that uninfected but primed or activated T lymphocytes from HIV-infected individuals undergo apoptosis after encountering the TNF-family ligand FasL. Using monocytic cell lines that result in death following HIV infection, it has been demonstrated that infection of U937 cells with HIV results in the de novo expression of FasL and that FasL mediates HIV-induced apoptosis (A. D. Badley et al., 70:199\u2013206 (1996)). Further, the TNF-family ligand was detectable in uninfected macrophages and its expression was upregulated following HIV infection resulting in selective killing of uninfected CD4 T-lymphocytes. Id. Thus, by the invention, a method for treating HIV individuals is provided which involves administering TR21 and\/or TR21 agonists (e.g., anti-TR21 antibodies) or antagonists of the present invention to reduce selective killing of CD4 T-lymphocytes. Modes of administration and dosages are discussed in detail below.","Activated human T cells are induced to undergo programmed cell death (apoptosis) upon triggering through the CD3\/T cell receptor complex, a process termed activated-induced cell death (AICD). AICD of CD4 T cells isolated from HIV-Infected asymptomatic individuals has been reported (Groux et al., supra). Thus, AICD may play a role in the depletion of CD4 T cells and the progression to AIDS in HIV-infected individuals. Thus, the present invention provides a method of inhibiting TNF ligand-mediated T cell death in HIV patients, comprising administering a TR21 polypeptide of the invention (preferably, a soluble TR21 polypeptide) to the patients. In one embodiment, the patient is asymptomatic when treatment with TR21 commences. If desired, prior to treatment, peripheral blood T cells may be extracted from an HIV patient, and tested for susceptibility to TNF ligand-mediated cell death by procedures known in the art. In one embodiment, a patient's blood or plasma is contacted with TR21 ex vivo. The TR21 may be bound to a suitable chromatography matrix by procedures known in the art. The patient's blood or plasma flows through a chromatography column containing TR21 bound to the matrix, before being returned to the patient. The immobilized TR21 binds TNF ligand, thus removing TNF ligand protein from the patient's blood.","In additional embodiments a TR21 polypeptide of the invention is administered in combination with other inhibitors of T cell apoptosis. For example, Fas-mediated apoptosis and TRAIL-mediated apoptosis have also has been implicated in loss of T cells in HIV individuals (See, e.g., Katsikis et al., 181:2029\u20132036 (1995)). Thus, a patient susceptible to Fas ligand mediated and\/or TRAIL mediated T cell death may be treated with an agent that blocks Fas-ligand\/Fas receptor interactions and\/or an agent that blocks TRAIL\/TRAIL interactions.","Suitable agents for blocking binding of Fas-ligand to Fas that may be administered with the TR21 polynucleotides or polypeptides of the invention (including TR21 agonists (e.g., agonistic antibodies) and\/or antagonists) include, but are not limited to, soluble Fas polypeptides; multimeric forms of soluble Fas polypeptides (e.g., dimers of sFas\/Fc); anti-Fas antibodies that bind Fas without transducing the biological signal that results in apoptosis; anti-Fas-ligand antibodies that block binding of Fas-ligand to Fas; and muteins of Fas-ligand that bind Fas but do not transduce the biological signal that results in apoptosis. Preferably, the antibodies employed according to this method are monoclonal antibodies. Examples of suitable agents for blocking Fas-ligand\/Fas interactions, including blocking anti-Fas monoclonal antibodies, are described in International application publication number WO 95\/10540, hereby incorporated by reference.","Suitable agents, which also block binding of TRAIL to a TRAIL receptor that may be administered with the polynucleotides and\/or polypeptides of the present invention include, but are not limited to, soluble TRAIL receptor polypeptides (e.g., a soluble form of OPG, DR4 (International application publication number WO 98\/32856); TR5 (International application publication number WO 98\/30693); and DR5 (International application publication number WO 98\/41629)); multimeric forms of soluble TRAIL receptor polypeptides; and TRAIL receptor antibodies that bind the TRAIL receptor without transducing the biological signal that results in apoptosis, anti-TRAIL antibodies that block binding of TRAIL to one or more TRAIL receptors, and muteins of TRAIL that bind TRAIL receptors but do not transduce the biological signal that results in apoptosis. Preferably, the antibodies employed according to this method are monoclonal antibodies.","In a further aspect, the present invention is directed to a method for inhibiting apoptosis induced by a TNF-family ligand, which involves administering to a cell which expresses the TR21 an effective amount of an agonist or antagonist capable of increasing or decreasing signaling mediated by the TR21. Preferably, TR21 mediated signaling is increased or decreased to treat, prevent, and\/or diagnose a disease wherein increased apoptosis or NF-kappaB expression is exhibited. An agonist or antagonist can include soluble forms of TR21 and monoclonal antibodies directed against the TR21 polypeptide.","TR21 polypeptides or polynucleotides encoding TR21 and anti-TR21 antibodies of the invention of the invention may be used to treat cardiovascular disorders, including peripheral artery disease, such as limb ischemia.","Cardiovascular disorders include cardiovascular abnormalities, such as arterio-arterial fistula, arteriovenous fistula, cerebral arteriovenous malformations, congenital heart defects, pulmonary atresia, and Scimitar Syndrome.

See e.g., Rastinejad et al., 56:345\u2013355 (1989). In those rare instances in which neovascularization occurs under normal physiological conditions, such as wound healing, organ regeneration, embryonic development, and female reproductive processes, angiogenesis is stringently regulated and spatially and temporally delimited. Under conditions of pathological angiogenesis such as that characterizing solid tumor growth, these regulatory controls fail. Unregulated angiogenesis becomes pathologic and sustains progression of many neoplastic and non-neoplastic diseases. A number of serious diseases are dominated by abnormal neovascularization including solid tumor growth and metastases, arthritis, some types of eye disorders, and psoriasis. See, e.g., reviews by Moses et al., 9:630\u2013634 (1991); Folkman et al., 333:1757\u20131763 (1995); Auerbach et al., 29:401\u2013411 (1985); Folkman, Advances in Cancer Research, eds. Klein and Weinhouse, Academic Press, New York, pp. 175\u2013203 (1985); Patz, 94:715\u2013743 (1982); and Folkman et al., 221:719\u2013725 (1983). In a number of pathological conditions, the process of angiogenesis contributes to the disease state. For example, significant data have accumulated which suggest that the growth of solid tumors is dependent on angiogenesis. Folkman and Klagsbrun, 235:442\u2013447 (1987).","The present invention provides for treatment of diseases or disorders associated with neovascularization by administration of the TR21 polynucleotides and\/or polypeptides of the invention (including TR21 agonists (e.g., agonistic antibodies) and\/or antagonists). Malignant and metastatic conditions which can be treated with the polynucleotides and polypeptides of the invention include, but are not limited to those malignancies, solid tumors, and cancers described herein and otherwise known in the art (for review of such disorders, see Fishman et al., Medicine, 2d Ed., J. B. Lippincott Co., Philadelphia (1985)).","Additionally, ocular disorders associated with neovascularization which can be treated with the TR21 polynucleotides and polypeptides of the present invention (including TR21 agonists and TR21 antagonists) include, but are not limited to: neovascular glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, retinoblastoma, retrolental fibroplasia, uveitis, retinopathy of prematurity macular degeneration, corneal graft neovascularization, as well as other eye inflammatory diseases, ocular tumors and diseases associated with choroidal or iris neovascularization. See, e.g., reviews by Waltman et al., 85:704\u201378) and Gartner et al., 22:291\u2013312 (1978).","Additionally, disorders which can be treated with the TR21 polynucleotides and polypeptides of the present invention (including TR21 agonists and TR21 antagonists) include, but are not limited to, hemangioma, arthritis, psoriasis, angiofibroma, atherosclerotic plaques, delayed wound healing, granulations, hemophilic joints, hypertrophic scars, nonunion fractures, Osler-Weber syndrome, pyogenic granuloma, scleroderma, trachoma, and vascular adhesions.","The polynucleotides and\/or polypeptides of the invention and\/or agonists and\/or antagonists thereof, can also be employed to inhibit the proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic cells and therefore may be employed to protect bone marrow stem cells from chemotherapeutic agents during chemotherapy. This antiproliferative effect may allow administration of higher doses of chemotherapeutic agents and, therefore, more effective chemotherapeutic treatment.","The polynucleotides and\/or polypeptides of the invention and\/or agonists and\/or antagonists thereof, may also be employed for the expansion of immature hematopoietic progenitor cells, for example, granulocytes, macrophages or monocytes (e.g., C-kit+, Sca-1+), by temporarily preventing their differentiation. These bone marrow cells may be cultured in vitro. Thus, TR21 may be useful as a modulator of hematopoietic stem cells in vitro for the purpose of bone marrow transplantation and\/or gene therapy. Since stem cells are rare and are most useful for introducing genes into for gene therapy, TR21 can be used to isolate enriched populations of stem cells. Stem cells can be enriched by culturing cells in the presence of cytotoxins, such as 5-Fu, which kills rapidly dividing cells, where as the stem cells will be protected by TR21. These stem cells can be returned to a bone marrow transplant patient or can then be used for transfection of the desired gene for gene therapy. In addition, TR21 can be injected into animals which results in the release of stem cells from the bone marrow of the animal into the peripheral blood. These stem cells can be isolated for the purpose of autologous bone marrow transplantation or manipulation for gene therapy. After the patient has finished chemotherapy or radiation treatment, the isolated stem cells can be returned to the patient.","In a specific embodiment, polynucleotides and\/or polypeptides of the invention and\/or agonists and\/or antagonists thereof may be used to increase the concentration of blood cells in individuals in need of such increase (i.e., in hematopoietic therapy).

Examples of patient conditions that require supplementation of the oxygen carrying capacity of blood and which are within the scope of this invention, include, but are not limited to: treatment of blood disorders characterized by low or defective red blood cell production, anemia associated with chronic renal failure, stimulation of reticulocyte response, development of ferrokinetic effects (such as plasma iron turnover effects and marrow transit time effects), erythrocyte mass changes, stimulation of hemoglobin C synthesis, and increasing levels of hematocrit in vertebrates.

In addition, since TR21 inhibits immune cell functions, the polypeptides will have a wide range of anti-inflammatory activities. TR21 may be employed as an anti-neovascularizing agent to treat, prevent, and\/or diagnose solid tumors by stimulating the invasion and activation of host defense cells, e.g., cytotoxic T cells and macrophages and by inhibiting the angiogenesis of tumors. Those of skill in the art will recognize other non-cancer indications where blood vessel proliferation is not wanted. They may also be employed to enhance host defenses against resistant chronic and acute infections, for example, myobacterial infections via the attraction and activation of microbicidal leukocytes. TR21 may also be employed to inhibit T-cell proliferation by the inhibition of IL-2 biosynthesis for the treatment of T-cell mediated auto-immune diseases and lymphocytic leukemias (including, for example, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)).

Moreover, as further discussed herein, the TR21 polypeptide or polynucleotide can be used as an adjuvant in a vaccine to raise an immune response against infectious disease.","Formulations and Administration","The TR21 polypeptide composition (preferably containing anti-TR21 antibody or a polypeptide which is a soluble form of the TR21 extracellular domain) will be formulated and dosed in a fashion consistent with good medical practice, taking into account the clinical condition of the individual patient (especially the side effects of treatment with TR21 polypeptide alone), the site of delivery of the TR21 polypeptide composition, the method of administration, the scheduling of administration, and other factors known to practitioners. The \u201ceffective amount\u201d of TR21 polypeptide for purposes herein is thus determined by such considerations.","As a general proposition, the total pharmaceutically effective amount of TR21 polypeptide administered parenterally per dose will be in the range of about 1 microgram\/kg\/day to 10 mg\/kg\/day of patient body weight, although, as noted above, this will be subject to therapeutic discretion.

An agonist is a compound which increases the natural biological functions of TR21 or which functions in a manner similar to TR21 while antagonists decrease or eliminate such functions.","In another embodiment, the invention provides a method for identifying a ligand protein or other ligand-binding protein which binds specifically to TR21 polypeptide. For example, a cellular compartment, such as a membrane or a preparation thereof, may be prepared from a cell that expresses a molecule that binds Neutrokine-alpha. The preparation is incubated with labeled Neutrokine-alpha and complexes of Neutrokine-alpha bound to TR21 or other binding protein are isolated and characterized according to routine methods known in the art. Alternatively, the TR21 ligand polypeptide may be bound to a solid support so that binding molecules solubilized from cells are bound to the column and then eluted and characterized according to routine methods.","In the assay of the invention for agonists or antagonists, a cellular compartment, such as a membrane or a preparation thereof, may be prepared from a cell that expresses a molecule that binds TR2 such as a molecule of a signaling or regulatory pathway modulated by TR21. The preparation is incubated with labeled TR21 in the absence or the presence of a candidate molecule which may be a TR21 agonist or antagonist. The ability of the candidate molecule to bind the binding molecule is reflected in decreased binding of the labeled ligand. Molecules which bind gratuitously, i.e., without inducing the effects of TR21 on binding the TR21 binding molecule, are most likely to be good antagonists. Molecules that bind well and elicit effects that are the same as or closely related to TR21 are agonists.","By \u201cagonist\u201d is intended naturally occurring and synthetic compounds capable of enhancing or potentiating TR21 mediated signaling. By \u201cantagonist\u201d is intended naturally occurring and synthetic compounds capable of inhibiting apoptosis. Whether any candidate \u201cagonist\u201d or \u201cantagonist\u201d of the present invention can enhance or inhibit TR21 mediated signaling can be determined using art-known TNF-family ligand\/receptor cellular response assays, including those described in more detail below.","One such screening procedure involves the use of melanophores which are transfected to express the receptor of the present invention. Such a screening technique is described in PCT WO 92\/01810. Such an assay may be employed, for example, for screening for a compound which inhibits (or enhances) activation of the receptor polypeptide of the present invention by contacting the melanophore cells which encode the receptor with both a TNF-family ligand and the candidate antagonist (or agonist). Inhibition or enhancement of the signal generated by the ligand indicates that the compound is an antagonist or agonist of the ligand\/receptor signaling pathway.","Other screening techniques include the use of cells which express the receptor (for example, transfected CHO cells) in a system which measures extracellular pH changes caused by receptor activation. For example, compounds may be contacted with a cell which expresses the receptor polypeptide of the present invention and a second messenger response, e.g., signal transduction or pH changes, may be measured to determine whether the potential compound activates or inhibits the receptor.","Another such screening technique involves introducing RNA encoding the receptor into oocytes to transiently express the receptor. The receptor oocytes may then be contacted with the receptor ligand and a compound to be screened, followed by detection of inhibition or activation of a calcium signal in the case of screening for compounds which are thought to inhibit activation of the receptor.","Another screening technique well known in the art involves expressing in cells a construct wherein the receptor is linked to a phospholipase C or D. Exemplary cells include endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, embryonic kidney cells, etc. The screening may be accomplished as hereinabove described by detecting activation of the receptor or inhibition of activation of the receptor from the phospholipase signal.","Another method involves screening for compounds which inhibit activation of the receptor polypeptide of the present invention antagonists by determining inhibition of binding of labeled ligand to cells which have the receptor on the surface thereof. Such a method involves transfecting a eukaryotic cell with DNA encoding the receptor such that the cell expresses the receptor on its surface and contacting the cell with a compound in the presence of a labeled form of a known ligand. The ligand can be labeled, e.g., by radioactivity. The amount of labeled ligand bound to the receptors is measured, e.g., by measuring radioactivity of the receptors. If the compound binds to the receptor as determined by a reduction of labeled ligand which binds to the receptors, the binding of labeled ligand to the receptor is inhibited.","Further screening assays for agonists and antagonists of the present invention are described in L. A. Tartaglia and D. V. Goeddel, 267:4304\u20134307(1992).","Thus, in a further aspect, a screening method is provided for determining whether a candidate agonist or antagonist is capable of enhancing or inhibiting a cellular response to a TNF-family ligand. The method involves contacting cells which express the TR21 polypeptide with a candidate compound and a TNF-family ligand, assaying a cellular response, and comparing the cellular response to a standard cellular response, the standard being assayed when contact is made with the ligand in absence of the candidate compound, whereby an increased cellular response over the standard indicates that the candidate compound is an agonist of the ligand\/receptor signaling pathway and a decreased cellular response compared to the standard indicates that the candidate compound is an antagonist of the ligand\/receptor signaling pathway. By \u201cassaying a cellular response\u201d is intended qualitatively or quantitatively measuring a cellular response to a candidate compound and\/or a TNF-family ligand (e.g., determining or estimating an increase or decrease in B and\/or T cell proliferation or tritiated thymidine labeling). By the invention, a cell expressing the TR21 polypeptide can be contacted with either an endogenous or exogenously administered TNF-family ligand.","TR21\u2014like effects of potential agonists and antagonists may by measured, for instance, by determining activity of a second messenger system following interaction of the candidate molecule with a cell or appropriate cell preparation, and comparing the effect with that of TR21 or molecules that elicit the same effects as TR21. Second messenger systems that may be useful in this regard include but are not limited to AMP guanylate cyclase, ion channel or phosphoinositide hydrolysis second messenger systems.","Another example of an assay for TR21 antagonists is a competitive assay that combines TR21 and a potential antagonist with membrane-bound ligand molecules or recombinant TR21 ligand molecules under appropriate conditions for a competitive inhibition assay. TR21 can be labeled, such as by radioactivity, such that the number of TR21 molecules bound to a ligand molecule can be determined accurately to assess the effectiveness of the potential antagonist.","Agonists according to the present invention include naturally occurring and synthetic compounds such as, for example, the CD40 ligand, neutral amino acids, zinc, estrogen, androgens, viral genes (such as Adenovirus ElB, Baculovirus p35 and IAP, Cowpox virus crmA, Epstein-Barr virus BHRF1, LMP-1, African swine fever virus LMW5-HL, and Herpesvirus yl 34.5), calpain inhibitors, cysteine protease inhibitors, and tumor promoters (such as PMA, Phenobarbital, and \u03b1-Hexachlorocyclohexane).","Antagonist according to the present invention include naturally occurring and synthetic compounds such as, for example, TNF family ligand peptide fragments, transforming growth factor, neurotransmitters (such as glutamate, dopamine, N-methyl-D-aspartate), tumor suppressors (p53), cytolytic T cells and antimetabolites. Preferred agonists include chemotherapeutic drugs such as, for example, cisplatin, doxorubicin, bleomycin, cytosine arabinoside, nitrogen mustard, methotrexate and vincristine. Others include ethanol and -amyloid peptide. (267:1457\u20131458 (1995)). Further preferred agonists include TR21 polypeptides of the invention, polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies raised against the TR21 polypeptide, or a fragment thereof. Such agonist antibodies raised against a TNF-family receptor are disclosed in L. A. Tartaglia et al., 88:9292\u20139296 (1991); and L. A. Tartaglia and D. V. Goeddel, 267:4304\u20134307(1992). See, also, PCT Application WO 94\/09137.","Potential antagonists include small organic molecules, peptides, polypeptides (e.g., IL-13), and antibodies that bind to a polypeptide of the invention and thereby inhibit or extinguish its activity. Potential antagonists also may be small organic molecules, a peptide, a polypeptide such as a closely related protein or antibody that binds the same sites on a binding molecule, such as a ligand molecule, without inducing TR21 induced activities, thereby preventing the action of TR21 by excluding TR21 from binding.","Other potential antagonists include antisense molecules. Antisense technology can be used to control gene expression through antisense DNA or RNA or through triple-helix formation. Antisense techniques are discussed, for example, in Okano, J. Neurochem. 56: 560 (1991); \u201cOligodeoxynucleotides as Antisense Inhibitors of Gene Expression, CRC Press, Boca Raton, Fla. (1988). Antisense technology can be used to control gene expression through antisense DNA or RNA, or through triple-helix formation. Antisense techniques are discussed for example, in Okano, J. Neurochem. 56:560 (1991); Oligodeoxynucleotides as Antisense Inhibitors of Gene Expression, CRC Press, Boca Raton, Fla. (1988). Triple helix formation is discussed in, for instance Lee et al., Nucleic Acids Research 6: 3073 (1979); Cooney et al., Science 241: 456 (1988); and Dervan et al., Science 251: 1360 (1991). The methods are based on binding of a polynucleotide to a complementary DNA or RNA. For example, the 5\u2032 coding portion of a polynucleotide that encodes the extracellular domain of the polypeptide of the present invention may be used to design an antisense RNA oligonucleotide of from about 10 to 40 base pairs in length. A DNA oligonucleotide is designed to be complementary to a region of the gene involved in transcription thereby preventing transcription and the production of TR21. The antisense RNA oligonucleotide hybridizes to the mRNA in vivo and blocks translation of the mRNA molecule into TR21 polypeptide. The oligonucleotides described above can also be delivered to cells such that the antisense RNA or DNA may be expressed in vivo to inhibit production of TR21.","In one embodiment, the TR21 antisense nucleic acid of the invention is produced intracellularly by transcription from an exogenous sequence. For example, a vector or a portion thereof, is transcribed, producing an antisense nucleic acid (RNA) of the invention. Such a vector would contain a sequence encoding the TR21 antisense nucleic acid. Such a vector can remain episomal or become chromosomally integrated, as long as it can be transcribed to produce the desired antisense RNA. Such vectors can be constructed by recombinant DNA technology methods standard in the art. Vectors can be plasmid, viral, or others know in the art, used for replication and expression in vertebrate cells. Expression of the sequence encoding TR21, or fragments thereof, can be by any promoter known in the art to act in vertebrate, preferably human cells. Such promoters can be inducible or constitutive. Such promoters include, but are not limited to, the SV40 early promoter region (Bemoist and Chambon, Nature 29:304\u2013310 (1981)), the promoter contained in the 3\u2032 long terminal repeat of Rous sarcoma virus (Yamamoto et al., Cell 22:787\u2013797 (1980)), the herpes thymidine promoter (Wagner et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 78:1441\u20131445 (1981)), the regulatory sequences of the metallothionein gene (Brinster, et al., Nature 296:39\u201342 (1982)), etc.","The antisense nucleic acids of the invention comprise a sequence complementary to at least a portion of an RNA transcript of a TR21 gene. However, absolute complementarity, although preferred, is not required. A sequence \u201ccomplementary to at least a portion of an RNA,\u201d referred to herein, means a sequence having sufficient complementarity to be able to hybridize with the RNA, forming a stable duplex; in the case of double stranded TR21 antisense nucleic acids, a single strand of the duplex DNA may thus be tested, or triplex formation may be assayed. The ability to hybridize will depend on both the degree of complementarity and the length of the antisense nucleic acid. Generally, the larger the hybridizing nucleic acid, the more base mismatches with a TR21 RNA it may contain and still form a stable duplex (or triplex as the case may be). One skilled in the art can ascertain a tolerable degree of mismatch by use of standard procedures to determine the melting point of the hybridized complex.","Oligonucleotides that are complementary to the 5\u2032 end of the message, e.g., the 5\u2032 untranslated sequence up to and including the AUG initiation codon, should work most efficiently at inhibiting translation. However, sequences complementary to the 3\u2032 untranslated sequences of mRNAs have been shown to be effective at inhibiting translation of mRNAs as well. See generally, Wagner, R., 1994, Nature 372:333\u2013335. Thus, oligonucleotides complementary to either the 5\u2032- or 3\u2032-non-translated, non-coding regions of TR21 shown in , respectively, could be used in an antisense approach to inhibit translation of endogenous TR21 mRNA. Oligonucleotides complementary to the 5\u2032 untranslated region of the mRNA should include the complement of the AUG start codon. Antisense oligonucleotides complementary to mRNA coding regions are less efficient inhibitors of translation but could be used in accordance with the invention. Whether designed to hybridize to the 5\u2032-, 3\u2032- or coding region of TR21 mRNA, antisense nucleic acids should be at least six nucleotides in length, and are preferably oligonucleotides ranging from 6 to about 50 nucleotides in length. In specific aspects the oligonucleotide is at least 10 nucleotides, at least 17 nucleotides, at least 25 nucleotides or at least 50 nucleotides.","The polynucleotides of the invention can be DNA or RNA or chimeric mixtures or derivatives or modified versions thereof, single-stranded or double-stranded. The oligonucleotide can be modified at the base moiety, sugar moiety, or phosphate backbone, for example, to improve stability of the molecule, hybridization, etc. The oligonucleotide may include other appended groups such as peptides (e.g., for targeting host cell receptors in vivo), or agents facilitating transport across the cell membrane (see, e.g., Letsinger et al., 1989, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 86:6553\u20136556; Lemaitre et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 84:648\u2013652 (1987); PCT Publication No. WO88\/09810, published Dec. 15, 1988) or the blood-brain barrier (see, e.g., PCT Publication No. WO89\/10134, published Apr. 25, 1988), hybridization-triggered cleavage agents. (See, e.g., Krol et al., BioTechniques 6:958\u2013976 (1988)) or intercalating agents. (See, e.g., Zon, Pharm. Res. 5:539\u2013549 (1988)). To this end, the oligonucleotide may be conjugated to another molecule, e.g., a peptide, hybridization triggered cross-linking agent, transport agent, hybridization-triggered cleavage agent, etc.","The antisense oligonucleotide may comprise at least one modified base moiety which is selected from the group including, but not limited to, 5-fluorouracil, 5-bromouracil, 5-chlorouracil, 5-iodouracil, hypoxanthine, xanthine, 4-acetylcytosine, 5-(carboxyhydroxylmethyl) uracil, 5-carboxymethylaminomethyl-2-thiouridine, 5-carboxymethylaminomethyluracil, dihydrouracil, beta-D-galactosylqueosine, inosine, N6-isopentenyladenine, 1-methylguanine, 1-methylinosine, 2,2-dimethylguanine, 2-methyladenine, 2-methylguanine, 3-methylcytosine, 5-methylcytosine, N6-adenine, 7-methylguanine, 5-methylaminomethyluracil, 5-methoxyaminomethyl-2-thiouracil, beta-D-mannosylqueosine, 5-methoxycarboxymethyluracil, 5-methoxyuracil, 2-methylthio-N-6-isopentenyladenine, uracil-5-oxyacetic acid (v), wybutoxosine, pseudouracil, queosine, 2-thiocytosine, 5-methyl-2-thiouracil, 2-thiouracil, 4-thiouracil, 5-methyluracil, uracil-5-oxyacetic acid methylester, uracil-5-oxyacetic acid (v), 5-methyl-2-thiouracil, 3-(3-amino-3-N-2-carboxypropyl) uracil, (acp3)w, and 2,6-diaminopurine.","The antisense oligonucleotide may also comprise at least one modified sugar moiety selected from the group including, but not limited to, arabinose, 2-fluoroarabinose, xylulose, and hexose.","In yet another embodiment, the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified phosphate backbone selected from the group including, but not limited to, a phosphorothioate, a phosphorodithioate, a phosphoramidothioate, a phosphoramidate, a phosphordiamidate, a methylphosphonate, an alkyl phosphotriester, and a formacetal or analog thereof.","In yet another embodiment, the antisense oligonucleotide is an alpha-anomeric oligonucleotide. An alpha-anomeric oligonucleotide forms specific double-stranded hybrids with complementary RNA in which, contrary to the usual beta-units, the strands run parallel to each other (Gautier et al., Nucl. Acids Res. 15:6625\u20136641 (1987)). The oligonucleotide is a 2-O-methylribonucleotide (Inoue et al., Nucl. Acids Res. 15:6131\u20136148 (1987)), or a chimeric RNA-DNA analogue (Inoue et al., FEBS Lett. 215:327\u2013330 (1997)).","Polynucleotides of the invention may be synthesized by standard methods known in the art, e.g. by use of an automated DNA synthesizer (such as are commercially available from Biosearch, Applied Biosystems, etc.). As examples, phosphorothioate oligonucleotides may be synthesized by the method of Stein et al. (Nucl. Acids Res. 16:3209 (1988)), methylphosphonate oligonucleotides can be prepared by use of controlled pore glass polymer supports (Sarin et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 85:7448\u20137451 (1988)), etc.","While antisense nucleotides complementary to the TR21 coding region sequence could be used, those complementary to the transcribed untranslated region are most preferred.","Potential antagonists according to the invention also include catalytic RNA, or a ribozyme (See, e.g., PCT International Publication WO 90\/11364, published Oct. 4, 1990; Sarver et al., Science 247:1222\u20131225 (1990). While ribozymes that cleave mRNA at site-specific recognition sequence can be used to destroy TR21 mRNAs, the use of hammerhead ribozymes is preferred. Hammerhead ribozymes cleave mRNAs at locations dictated by flanking regions that form complementary base pairs with the target mRNA. The sole requirement is that the target mRNA have the following sequence of two bases: 5\u2032-UG-3\u2032. The construction and production of hammerhead ribozymes is well known in the art and is described more fully in Haseloff and Gerlach, Nature 334:585\u2013591 (1988). There are numerous potential hammerhead ribozyme cleavage sites within the nucleotide sequence TR21 (). Preferably, the ribozyme is engineered so that the cleavage recognition site is located near the 5\u2032 end of the TR21 mRNA; i.e., to increase efficiency and minimize the intracellular accumulation of non-functional mRNA transcripts.","As in the antisense approach, the ribozymes of the invention can be composed of modified oligonucleotides (e.g. for improved stability, targeting, etc.) and should be delivered to cells which express TR21 in vivo. DNA constructs encoding the ribozyme may be introduced into the cell in the same manner as described above for the introduction of antisense encoding DNA. A preferred method of delivery involves using a DNA construct \u201cencoding\u201d the ribozyme under the control of a strong constitutive promoter, such as, for example, pol III or pol II promoter, so that transfected cells will produce sufficient quantities of the ribozyme to destroy endogenous TR21 messages and inhibit translation. Since ribozymes unlike antisense molecules, are catalytic, a lower intracellular concentration is required for efficiency.","Endogenous gene expression can also be reduced by inactivating or \u201cknocking out\u201d the TR21 gene and\/or its promoter using targeted homologous recombination. (E.g., see Smithies et al., Nature 317:230\u2013234 (1985); Thomas & Capecchi, Cell 51:503\u2013512 (1987); Thompson et al., Cell 5:313\u2013321 (1989); each of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety). For example, a mutant, non-functional polynucleotide of the invention (or a completely unrelated DNA sequence) flanked by DNA homologous to the endogenous polynucleotide sequence (either the coding regions or regulatory regions of the gene) can be used, with or without a selectable marker and\/or a negative selectable marker, to transfect cells that express polypeptides of the invention in vivo. In another embodiment, techniques known in the art are used to generate knockouts in cells that contain, but do not express the gene of interest. Insertion of the DNA construct, via targeted homologous recombination, results in inactivation of the targeted gene. Such approaches are particularly suited in research and agricultural fields where modifications to embryonic stem cells can be used to generate animal offspring with an inactive targeted gene (e.g., see Thomas & Capecchi 1987 and Thompson 1989, supra). However this approach can be routinely adapted for use in humans provided the recombinant DNA constructs are directly administered or targeted to the required site in vivo using appropriate viral vectors that will be apparent to those of skill in the art. The contents of each of the documents recited in this paragraph is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.","In other embodiments, antagonists according to the present invention include soluble forms of TR21 (e.g., fragments of TR21 shown in  (SEQ ID NO:2) that include one or more copies of the cysteine rich motif from the extracellular domain of TR21). Such soluble forms of the TR21, which may be naturally occurring or synthetic, antagonize TR21 mediated signaling by competing with native TR21 for binding to TR21 ligands (e.g., Neutrokine-alpha (See, U.S. Application Ser. No. 60\/188,208)), and\/or by forming a multimer that may or may not be capable of binding the receptor, but which is incapable of inducing signal transduction. Preferably, these antagonists inhibit TR21 mediated stimulation of lymphocyte (e.g., B-cell) proliferation, differentiation, and\/or activation. Antagonists of the present invention also include antibodies specific for TNFR-family receptors and TR21-Fc fusion proteins.","By a \u201cTNF-family ligand\u201d is intended naturally occurring, recombinant, and synthetic ligands that are capable of binding to a member of the TNF receptor family and inducing and\/or blocking the ligand\/receptor signaling pathway. Members of the TNF ligand family include, but are not limited to, TNF-alpha, lymphotoxin-alpha (LT-alpha, also known as TNF-beta), LT-beta (found in complex heterotrimer LT-alpha2-beta), FasL, CD40L, (TNF-gamma (International Publication No. WO 96\/14328), AIM-I (International Publication No. WO 97\/33899), AIM-II (International Publication No. WO 97\/34911), APRIL (International Publication Number WO 97\/33902; J. Exp. Med. 188(6):1185\u20131190) (1998)), endokine-alpha (International Publication No. WO 98\/07880), Neutrokine-alpha (International Publication No. WO 98\/18921), CD27L, CD30L, 4-1BBL, OX40L, CD27, CD30, 4-1BB, OX40, and nerve growth factor (NGF). In specific embodiments, the TNF-family ligand is Neutrokine-alpha, or fragments or variants thereof. In other specific embodiments, the TNF-family ligand is APRIL or fragments or variants thereof.","Antagonists of the present invention also include antibodies specific for TNF-family ligands or the TR21 polypeptides of the invention. Antibodies according to the present invention may be prepared by any of a variety of standard methods using TR21 immunogens of the present invention. As indicated, such TR21 immunogens include the complete TR21 polypeptides depicted in  (SEQ ID NO:2) and TR21 polypeptide fragments comprising, for example, the cysteine rich domain, extracellular domain, transmembrane domain, and\/or intracellular domain, or any combination thereof.","Polyclonal and monoclonal antibody agonists or antagonists according to the present invention can be raised according to the methods disclosed herein and\/or known in the art, such as, for example, those methods described in Tartaglia and Goeddel, 267(7):4304\u20134307(1992)); Tartaglia et al., 73:213\u2013216 (1993)), and PCT Application WO 94\/09137 and are preferably specific to (i.e., bind uniquely to polypeptides of the invention having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:2.","In a preferred method, antibodies according to the present invention are mAbs. Such mAbs can be prepared using hybridoma technology (Kohler and Milstein, 256:495\u2013497 (1975) and U.S. Pat. No. 4,376,110; Harlow et al., A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., 1988Plenum Press, New York, N.Y., 1980; Campbell, \u201cMonoclonal Antibody Technology,\u201d In: , Volume 13 (Burdon et al., eds.), Elsevier, Amsterdam (1984)).","Antagonists according to the present invention include soluble forms of TR21, i.e., TR21 fragments that include one or more of the cysteine rich motif from the extracellular region of the full-length receptor (or variants thereof). Such soluble forms of the receptor, which may be naturally occurring or synthetic, antagonize TR21 mediated signaling by competing with the cell surface TR21 for binding to TNF-family ligands (e.g., Neutrokine-alpha). Thus, soluble forms of the receptor that include one or more copies of the cysteine-rich motif of TR21 are novel cytokines capable of inhibiting TR21 mediated signaling induced by TNF-family ligands. These soluble forms are preferably expressed as dimers or trimers, since these have been shown to be superior to monomeric forms of soluble receptor as antagonists, e.g., IgGFc-TNF receptor family fusions. Other such cytokines are known in the art and include Fas B (a soluble form of the mouse Fas receptor) that acts physiologically to limit apoptosis induced by Fas ligand (D. P. Hughes and I. N. Crispe, 182:1395\u20131401 (1995)).","The techniques of gene shuffling, motif shuffling, exon shuffling, and\/or codon-shuffling (collectively referred to as \u201cDNA shuffling\u201d) may be employed to modulate the activities of TR21 thereby effectively generating agonists and antagonists of TR21. See generally, International Publication No. WO 99\/29902, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,605,793, 5,811,238, 5,830,721, 5,834,252, and 5,837,458, and Patten et al., 8:724\u201333 (1997); Harayama, 16(2):76\u201382 (1998); Hansson et al., 287:265\u201376 (1999); and Lorenzo and Blasco, 24(2):308\u201313 (1998) (each of these patents and publications are hereby incorporated by reference). In one embodiment, alteration of TR21 polynucleotides and corresponding polypeptides may be achieved by DNA shuffling. DNA shuffling involves the assembly of two or more DNA segments into a desired TR21 molecule by homologous, or site-specific, recombination. In another embodiment, TR21 polynucleotides and corresponding polypeptides may be altered by being subjected to random mutagenesis by error-prone PCR, random nucleotide insertion or other methods prior to recombination. In another embodiment, one or more components, motifs, sections, parts, domains, fragments, etc., of TR21 may be recombined with one or more components, motifs, sections, parts, domains, fragments, etc. of one or more heterologous molecules. In preferred embodiments, the heterologous molecules are include, but are not limited to, TNF-alpha, lymphotoxin-alpha (LT-alpha, also known as TNF-beta), LT-beta (found in complex heterotrimer LT-alpha2-beta), OPGL, FasL, CD27L, CD30L, CD40L, 4-1BBL, DcR3, OX40L, TNF-gamma (International Publication No. WO 96\/14328), TRAIL, AIM-II (International Publication No. WO 97\/34911), APRIL (188(6):1185\u20131190 (1998)), endokine-alpha (International Publication No. WO 98\/07880), Neutrokine alpha (International Publication No. WO98\/18921), OPG, OX40, and nerve growth factor (NGF), and soluble forms of Fas, CD30, CD27, CD40 and 4-1BB, TR2 (International Publication No. WO 96\/34095), DR3 (International Publication No. WO 97\/33904), DR4 (International Publication No. WO 98\/32856), TR5 (International Publication No. WO 98\/30693), TR6 (International Publication No. WO 98\/30694), TR7 (International Publication No. WO 98\/41629), TRANK, TR9 (International Publication No. WO 98\/56892), 312C2 (International Publication No. WO 98\/06842), and TR12, and soluble forms CD154, CD70, and CD153. In further preferred embodiments, the heterologous molecules are any member of the TNF family.","Proteins and other compounds which bind the TR21 domains are also candidate agonists and antagonists according to the present invention. Such binding compounds can be \u201ccaptured\u201d using the yeast two-hybrid system (Fields and Song, 340:245\u2013246 (1989)). A modified version of the yeast two-hybrid system has been described by Roger Brent and his colleagues (Gyuris, 75:791\u2013803 (1993); Zervos et al., 72:223\u2013232 (1993)). Preferably, the yeast two-hybrid system is used according to the present invention to capture compounds which bind to the extracellular domain, intracellular, transmembrane, and the cysteine rich domain of TR21. Such compounds are good candidate agonists and antagonists of the present invention.","For example, using the two-hybrid assay described above, the extracellular or intracellular domain of the TR21, or a portion thereof (e.g., the cysteine rich domain), may be used to identify cellular proteins which interact with TR21 the receptor in vivo. Such an assay may also be used to identify ligands with potential agonistic or antagonistic activity of TR21 receptor function. This screening assay has previously been used to identify protein which interact with the cytoplasmic domain of the murine TNF-RII and led to the identification of two receptor associated proteins. Rothe et al., 78:681 (1994). Such proteins and amino acid sequences which bind to the cytoplasmic domain of the TR21 are good candidate agonist and antagonist of the present invention.","Other screening techniques include the use of cells which express the polypeptide of the present invention (for example, transfected CHO cells) in a system which measures extracellular pH changes caused by receptor activation, for example, as described in 246:181\u2013296 (1989). In another example, potential agonists or antagonists may be contacted with a cell which expresses the polypeptide of the present invention and a second messenger response, e.g., signal transduction may be measured to determine whether the potential antagonist or agonist is effective.","Agonists according to the present invention include naturally occurring and synthetic compounds such as, for example, TNF family ligand peptide fragments, transforming growth factor, neurotransmitters (such as glutamate, dopamine, N-methyl-D-aspartate), tumor suppressors (p53), cytolytic T cells and antimetabolites. Preferred agonists include chemotherapeutic drugs such as, for example, cisplatin, doxorubicin, bleomycin, cytosine arabinoside, nitrogen mustard, methotrexate and vincristine. Others include ethanol and -amyloid peptide. (267:1457\u20131458 (1995)).","Preferred agonists are fragments of TR21 polypeptides of the invention which stimulate lymphocyte (e.g., B cell) proliferation, differentiation and\/or activation. Further preferred agonists include polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies raised against the TR21 polypeptides of the invention, or a fragment thereof. Such agonist antibodies raised against a TNF-family receptor are disclosed in Tartaglia et al., 88:9292\u20139296 (1991); and Tartaglia et al., 267:4304\u20134307(1992). See, also, PCT Application WO 94\/09137.","In an additional embodiment, immunoregulatory molecules such as, for example, IL2, IL3, IL4, IL5, IL6, IL7, IL10, IL12, IL13, IL15, anti-CD40, CD40L, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha, may be used as agonists of TR21 polypeptides of the invention which stimulate lymphocyte (e.g., B cell) proliferation, differentiation and\/or activation. In a specific embodiment, IL4 and\/or IL10 are used to enhance the TR21-mediated proliferation of B cells.","In further embodiments of the invention, cells that are genetically engineered to express the polypeptides of the invention, or alternatively, that are genetically engineered not to express the polypeptides of the invention (e.g., knockouts) are administered to a patient in vivo. Such cells may be obtained from the patient (i.e., animal, including human) or an MHC compatible donor and can include, but are not limited to fibroblasts, bone marrow cells, blood cells (e.g., lymphocytes), adipocytes, muscle cells, endothelial cells etc. The cells are genetically engineered in vitro using recombinant DNA techniques to introduce the coding sequence of polypeptides of the invention into the cells, or alternatively, to disrupt the coding sequence and\/or endogenous regulatory sequence associated with the polypeptides of the invention, e.g., by transduction (using viral vectors, and preferably vectors that integrate the transgene into the cell genome) or transfection procedures, including, but not limited to, the use of plasmids, cosmids, YACs, naked DNA, electroporation, liposomes, etc. The coding sequence of the polypeptides of the invention can be placed under the control of a strong constitutive or inducible promoter or promoter\/enhancer to achieve expression, and preferably secretion, of the polypeptides of the invention. The engineered cells which express and preferably secrete the polypeptides of the invention can be introduced into the patient systemically, e.g., in the circulation, or intraperitoneally.","Alternatively, the cells can be incorporated into a matrix and implanted in the body, e.g., genetically engineered fibroblasts can be implanted as part of a skin graft; genetically engineered endothelial cells can be implanted as part of a lymphatic or vascular graft. (See, for example, Anderson et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5,399,349; and Mulligan & Wilson, U.S. Pat. No. 5,460,959 each of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety).","When the cells to be administered are non-autologous or non-MHC compatible cells, they can be administered using well-known techniques to prevent the development of a host immune response against the introduced cells. For example, the cells may be introduced in an encapsulated form that while allowing for an exchange of components with the immediate extracellular environment does not allow the introduced cells to be recognized by the host immune system.","In yet another embodiment of the invention, the activity of TR21 polypeptide can be reduced using a \u201cdominant negative.\u201d To this end, constructs which encode, for example, defective TR21 polypeptide, such as, for example, mutants lacking all or a portion of the TNF-conserved domain, can be used in gene therapy approaches to diminish the activity of TR21 on appropriate target cells. For example, nucleotide sequences that direct host cell expression of TR21 polypeptide in which all or a portion of the TNFR-conserved domain is altered or missing can be introduced into monocytic cells or other cells or tissues (either by in vivo or ex vivo gene therapy methods described herein or otherwise known in the art). Alternatively, targeted homologous recombination can be utilized to introduce such deletions or mutations into the subject's endogenous TR21 gene in monocytes. The engineered cells will express non-functional TR21 polypeptides (i.e., a receptor (e.g., multimer) that may be capable of binding, but which is incapable of inducing signal transduction).","Diagnostic Assays","The compounds of the present invention are useful for diagnosis or treatment of various immune system-related disorders in mammals, preferably humans. Such disorders include but are not limited to tumors (e.g., B cell and monocytic cell leukemias and lymphomas) and tumor metastasis, infections by bacteria, viruses and other parasites, immunodeficiencies, inflammatory diseases, lymphadenopathy, autoimmune diseases, and graft versus host disease.","TR21 is expressed in B cells and spleen. For a number of immune system-related disorders, substantially altered (increased or decreased) levels of TR21 gene expression can be detected in immune system tissue or other cells or bodily fluids (e.g., sera, plasma, urine, synovial fluid or spinal fluid) taken from an individual having such a disorder, relative to a \u201cstandard\u201d TR21 gene expression level, that is, the TR21 expression level in immune system tissues or bodily fluids from an individual not having the immune system disorder. Thus, the invention provides a diagnostic method useful during diagnosis of an immune system disorder, which involves measuring the expression level of the gene encoding the TR21 polypeptide in immune system tissue or other cells or body fluid from an individual and comparing the measured gene expression level with a standard TR21 gene expression level, whereby an increase or decrease in the gene expression level(s) compared to the standard is indicative of an immune system disorder or normal activation, proliferation, differentiation, and\/or death.","In particular, it is believed that certain tissues in mammals with cancer of cells or tissue of the immune system express significantly enhanced or reduced levels of normal or altered TR21 polypeptide and mRNA encoding the TR21 polypeptide when compared to a corresponding \u201cstandard\u201d level. Further, it is believed that enhanced or depressed levels of the TR21 polypeptide can be detected in certain body fluids (e.g., sera, plasma, urine, and spinal fluid) or cells or tissue from mammals with such a cancer when compared to sera from mammals of the same species not having the cancer.","For example, as disclosed herein, TR21 are expressed in B cells. Accordingly, polynucleotides of the invention (e.g., polynucleotide sequences complementary to all or a portion of TR21 mRNA) and antibodies (and antibody fragments) directed against the polypeptides of the invention may be used to quantitate or qualitate concentrations of cells of B cell lineage (e.g., B cell leukemia cells) expressing TR21 on their cell surfaces. These antibodies additionally have diagnostic applications in detecting abnormalities in the level of TR21 gene expression, or abnormalities in the structure and\/or temporal, tissue, cellular, or subcellular location of TR21. These diagnostic assays may be performed in vivo or in vitro, such as, for example, on blood samples, biopsy tissue or autopsy tissue.","Thus, the invention provides a diagnostic method useful during diagnosis of a immune system disorder, including cancers of this system, which involves measuring the expression level of the gene encoding the TR21 polypeptide in immune system tissue or other cells or body fluid from an individual and comparing the measured gene expression level with a standard TR21 gene expression level, whereby an increase or decrease in the gene expression level compared to the standard is indicative of an immune system disorder.","Where a diagnosis of a disorder in the immune system, including diagnosis of a tumor, has already been made according to conventional methods, the present invention is useful as a prognostic indicator, whereby patients exhibiting enhanced or depressed TR21 gene expression will experience a worse clinical outcome relative to patients expressing the gene at a level nearer the standard level.","By \u201cassaying the expression level of the gene encoding the TR21 polypeptide\u201d is intended qualitatively or quantitatively measuring or estimating the level of the TR21 polypeptide or the level of the mRNA encoding the TR21 polypeptide in a first biological sample either directly (e.g., by determining or estimating absolute protein level or mRNA level) or relatively (e.g., by comparing to the TR21 polypeptide level or mRNA level in a second biological sample). Preferably, the TR21 polypeptide level or mRNA level in the first biological sample is measured or estimated and compared to a standard TR21 polypeptide level or mRNA level, the standard being taken from a second biological sample obtained from an individual not having the disorder or being determined by averaging levels from a population of individuals not having a disorder of the immune system. As will be appreciated in the art, once a standard TR21 polypeptide level or mRNA level is known, it can be used repeatedly as a standard for comparison.","By \u201cbiological sample\u201d is intended any biological sample obtained from an individual, cell line, tissue culture, or other source containing TR21 receptor protein (including portions thereof) or mRNA. As indicated, biological samples include body fluids (such as sera, plasma, urine, synovial fluid and spinal fluid) which contain free extracellular domains of the TR21 polypeptide, immune system tissue, and other tissue sources found to express complete or free extracellular domain of the TR21 receptor. Methods for obtaining tissue biopsies and body fluids from mammals are well known in the art. Where the biological sample is to include mRNA, a tissue biopsy is the preferred source.","Total cellular RNA can be isolated from a biological sample using any suitable technique such as the single-step guanidinium-thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform method described in Chomczynski and Sacchi, 162:156\u2013159 (1987). Levels of mRNA encoding the TR21 polypeptide are then assayed using any appropriate method. These include Northern blot analysis, S1 nuclease mapping, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), reverse transcription in combination with the polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and reverse transcription in combination with the ligase chain reaction (RT-LCR).","The present invention also relates to diagnostic assays such as quantitative and diagnostic assays for detecting levels of TR21 receptor protein, or the soluble form thereof, in a biological sample (e.g., cells and tissues), including determination of normal and abnormal levels of polypeptides. Thus, for instance, a diagnostic assay in accordance with the invention for detecting over-expression of TR21, or soluble form thereof, compared to normal control tissue samples may be used to detect the presence of tumors, for example. Assay techniques that can be used to determine levels of a protein, such as a TR21 protein of the present invention, or a soluble form thereof, in a sample derived from a host are well-known to those of skill in the art. Such assay methods include radioimmunoassays, competitive-binding assays, Western Blot analysis and ELISA assays. Assaying TR21 protein levels in a biological sample can occur using any art-known method.","Assaying TR21 polypeptide levels in a biological sample can occur using antibody-based techniques. For example, TR21 polypeptide expression in tissues can be studied with classical immunohistological methods (Jalkanen, M., et al., 101:976\u2013985 (1985); Jalkanen, M., et al., 105:3087\u20133096 (1987)). Other antibody-based methods useful for detecting TR21 polypeptide gene expression include immunoassays, such as the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and the radioimmunoassay (RIA). Suitable antibody assay labels are known in the art and include enzyme labels, such as, glucose oxidase, and radioisotopes, such as iodine (I, I), carbon (C), sulfur (S), tritium (H), indium (In), and technetium (Tc), and fluorescent labels, such as fluorescein and rhodamine, and biotin.","The tissue or cell type to be analyzed will generally include those which are known, or suspected, to express the TR21 gene (such as, for example, cells of B cell lineage and the spleen) or cells or tissue which are known, or suspected, to express the TR21 ligand gene (such as, for example, cells of monocytic lineage). The protein isolation methods employed herein may, for example, be such as those described in Harlow and Lane (Harlow, E. and Lane, D., 1988, \u201cAntibodies: A Laboratory Manual\u201d, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y.), which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The isolated cells can be derived from cell culture or from a patient. The analysis of cells taken from culture may be a necessary step in the assessment of cells that could be used as part of a cell-based gene therapy technique or, alternatively, to test the effect of compounds on the expression of the TR21 gene or TR21 ligand gene.","For example, antibodies, or fragments of antibodies, such as those described herein, may be used to quantitatively or qualitatively detect the presence of TR21 gene products or conserved variants or peptide fragments thereof. This can be accomplished, for example, by immunofluorescence techniques employing a fluorescently labeled antibody coupled with light microscopic, flow cytometric, or fluorimetric detection.","The antibodies (or fragments thereof), TR21 polypeptides, and\/or TR21 ligands (e.g., Neutrokine-alpha) of the present invention may, additionally, be employed histologically, as in immunofluorescence, immunoelectron microscopy or non-immunological assays, for in situ detection of TR21 gene products or conserved variants or peptide fragments thereof, or for TR21 binding to TR21 ligand. In situ detection may be accomplished by removing a histological specimen from a patient, and applying thereto a labeled antibody or TR21 polypeptide of the present invention. The antibody (or fragment) or TR21 polypeptide is preferably applied by overlaying the labeled antibody (or fragment) onto a biological sample. Through the use of such a procedure, it is possible to determine not only the presence of the TR21 gene product, or conserved variants or peptide fragments, or TR21 polypeptide binding, but also its distribution in the examined tissue. Using the present invention, those of ordinary skill will readily perceive that any of a wide variety of histological methods (such as staining procedures) can be modified in order to achieve such in situ detection.","Immunoassays and non-immunoassays for TR21 gene products or conserved variants or peptide fragments thereof will typically comprise incubating a sample, such as a biological fluid, a tissue extract, freshly harvested cells, or lysates of cells which have been incubated in cell culture, in the presence of a detectably labeled antibody capable of binding TR21 gene products or conserved variants or peptide fragments thereof, and detecting the bound antibody by any of a number of techniques well-known in the art.","Immunoassays and non-immunoassays for TR21 ligand gene products or conserved variants or peptide fragments thereof will typically comprise incubating a sample, such as a biological fluid, a tissue extract, freshly harvested cells, or lysates of cells which have been incubated in cell culture, in the presence of a detectable or labeled TR21 polypeptide capable of identifying TR21 ligand gene products or conserved variants or peptide fragments thereof, and detecting the bound TR21 polypeptide by any of a number of techniques well-known in the art.","The biological sample may be brought in contact with and immobilized onto a solid phase support or carrier such as nitrocellulose, or other solid support which is capable of immobilizing cells, cell particles or soluble proteins. The support may then be washed with suitable buffers followed by treatment with the detectably labeled anti-TR21 antibody or detectable TR21 polypeptide. The solid phase support may then be washed with the buffer a second time to remove unbound antibody or polypeptide. Optionally the antibody is subsequently labeled. The amount of bound label on solid support may then be detected by conventional means.","By \u201csolid phase support or carrier\u201d is intended any support capable of binding an antigen or an antibody. Well-known supports or carriers include glass, polystyrene, polypropylene, polyethylene, dextran, nylon, amylases, natural and modified celluloses, polyacrylamides, gabbros, and magnetite. The nature of the carrier can be either soluble to some extent or insoluble for the purposes of the present invention. The support material may have virtually any possible structural configuration so long as the coupled molecule is capable of binding to an antigen or antibody. Thus, the support configuration may be spherical, as in a bead, or cylindrical, as in the inside surface of a test tube, or the external surface of a rod. Alternatively, the surface may be flat such as a sheet, test strip, etc. Preferred supports include polystyrene beads. Those skilled in the art will know many other suitable carriers for binding antibody or antigen, or will be able to ascertain the same by use of routine experimentation.","The binding activity of a given lot of anti-TR21 antibody or TR21 polypeptide may be determined according to well-known methods. Those skilled in the art will be able to determine operative and optimal assay conditions for each determination by employing routine experimentation.","In addition to assaying TR21 polypeptide levels or polynucleotide levels in a biological sample obtained from an individual, TR21 polypeptide or polynucleotide can also be detected in vivo by imaging. For example, in one embodiment of the invention, TR21 polypeptide is used to image monocytic leukemias or lymphomas. In another embodiment, TR21 polynucleotides of the invention and\/or anti-TR21 antibodies (e.g., polynucleotides complementary to all or a portion of TR21 mRNA) are used to image B cell leukemias or lymphomas.","Antibody labels or markers for in vivo imaging of TR21 polypeptide include those detectable by X-radiography, NMR, MRI, CAT-scans or ESR. For X-radiography, suitable labels include radioisotopes such as barium or cesium, which emit detectable radiation but are not overtly harmful to the subject. Suitable markers for NMR and ESR include those with a detectable characteristic spin, such as deuterium, which may be incorporated into the antibody by labeling of nutrients for the relevant hybridoma. Where in vivo imaging is used to detect enhanced levels of TR21 polypeptide for diagnosis in humans, it may be preferable to use human antibodies or \u201chumanized\u201d chimeric monoclonal antibodies. Such antibodies can be produced using techniques described herein or otherwise known in the art. For example methods for producing chimeric antibodies are known in the art. See, for review, Morrison, 229:1202 (1985); Oi et al., 4:214 (1986); Cabilly et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567; Taniguchi et al., EP 171496; Morrison et al., EP 173494; Neuberger et al., WO 8601533; Robinson et al., WO 8702671; Boulianne et al., 312:643 (1984); Neuberger et al., 314:268 (1985).","Additionally, any TR21 polypeptide whose presence can be detected, can be administered. For example, TR21 polypeptides labeled with a radio-opaque or other appropriate compound can be administered and visualized in vivo, as discussed, above for labeled antibodies. Further such TR21 polypeptides can be utilized for in vitro diagnostic procedures.","A TR21 polypeptide-specific antibody or antibody fragment which has been labeled with an appropriate detectable imaging moiety, such as a radioisotope (for example, I, In, Tc), a radio-opaque substance, or a material detectable by nuclear magnetic resonance, is introduced (for example, parenterally, subcutaneously or intraperitoneally) into the mammal to be examined for immune system disorder. It will be understood in the art that the size of the subject and the imaging system used will determine the quantity of imaging moiety needed to produce diagnostic images. In the case of a radioisotope moiety, for a human subject, the quantity of radioactivity injected will normally range from about 5 to 20 millicuries of Tc. The labeled antibody or antibody fragment will then preferentially accumulate at the location of cells which contain TR21 protein. In vivo tumor imaging is described in S. W. Burchiel et al., \u201cImmunopharmacokinetics of Radiolabeled Antibodies and Their Fragments\u201d (Chapter 13 in , S. W. Burchiel and B. A. Rhodes, eds., Masson Publishing Inc. (1982)).","With respect to antibodies, one of the ways in which the anti-TR21 antibody can be detectably labeled is by linking the same to an enzyme and using the linked product in an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) (Voller, A., \u201cThe Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)\u201d, 1978, Diagnostic Horizons 2:1\u20137, Microbiological Associates Quarterly Publication, Walkersville, Md.); Voller et al., 31:507\u2013520 (1978); Butler, J. E., 73:482\u2013523 (1981); Maggio, E. (ed.), 1980, Enzyme Immunoassay, CRC Press, Boca Raton, Fla.; Ishikawa, E. et al., (eds.), 1981, Enzyme Immunoassay, Kgaku Shoin, Tokyo). The enzyme which is bound to the antibody will react with an appropriate substrate, preferably a chromogenic substrate, in such a manner as to produce a chemical moiety which can be detected, for example, by spectrophotometric, fluorimetric or by visual means. Enzymes which can be used to detectably label the antibody include, but are not limited to, malate dehydrogenase, staphylococcal nuclease, delta-5-steroid isomerase, yeast alcohol dehydrogenase, alpha-glycerophosphate, dehydrogenase, triose phosphate isomerase, horseradish peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase, asparaginase, glucose oxidase, beta-galactosidase, ribonuclease, urease, catalase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, glucoamylase and acetylcholinesterase. Additionally, the detection can be accomplished by colorimetric methods which employ a chromogenic substrate for the enzyme. Detection may also be accomplished by visual comparison of the extent of enzymatic reaction of a substrate in comparison with similarly prepared standards.","Detection may also be accomplished using any of a variety of other immunoassays. For example, by radioactively labeling the antibodies or antibody fragments, it is possible to detect TR21 through the use of a radioimmunoassay (RIA) (see, for example, Weintraub, B., Principles of Radioimmunoassays, Seventh Training Course on Radioligand Assay Techniques, The Endocrine Society, March, 1986, which is incorporated by reference herein). The radioactive isotope can be detected by means including, but not limited to, a gamma counter, a scintillation counter, or autoradiography.","It is also possible to label the antibody with a fluorescent compound. When the fluorescently labeled antibody is exposed to light of the proper wavelength, its presence can then be detected due to fluorescence. Among the most commonly used fluorescent labeling compounds are fluorescein isothiocyanate, rhodamine, phycoerythrin, phycocyanin, allophycocyanin, ophthaldehyde and fluorescamine.","The antibody can also be detectably labeled using fluorescence emitting metals such as Eu, or others of the lanthanide series. These metals can be attached to the antibody using such metal chelating groups as diethylenetriaminepentacetic acid (DTPA) or ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA).","The antibody also can be detectably labeled by coupling it to a chemiluminescent compound. The presence of the chemiluminescent-tagged antibody is then determined by detecting the presence of luminescence that arises during the course of a chemical reaction. Examples of particularly useful chemiluminescent labeling compounds are luminol, isoluminol, theromatic acridinium ester, imidazole, acridinium salt and oxalate ester.","Likewise, a bioluminescent compound may be used to label the antibody of the present invention. Bioluminescence is a type of chemiluminescence found in biological systems in, which a catalytic protein increases the efficiency of the chemiluminescent reaction. The presence of a bioluminescent protein is determined by detecting the presence of luminescence. Important bioluminescent compounds for purposes of labeling are luciferin, luciferase and aequorin.","Chromosome Assays","The nucleic acid molecules of the present invention are also valuable for chromosome identification.","In certain preferred embodiments in this regard, the cDNA herein disclosed is used to clone genomic DNA of a TR21 receptor gene. This can be accomplished using a variety of well-known techniques and libraries, which generally are available commercially. The genomic DNA is then used for in situ chromosome mapping using well-known techniques for this purpose.","In addition, in some cases, sequences can be mapped to chromosomes by preparing PCR primers (preferably 15\u201325 bp) from the cDNA. Computer analysis of the 3\u2032 untranslated region of the gene is used to rapidly select primers that do not span more than one exon in the genomic DNA, thus complicating the amplification process. These primers are then used for PCR screening of somatic cell hybrids containing individual human chromosomes.","Fluorescence in situ hybridization (\u201cFISH\u201d) of a cDNA clone to a metaphase chromosomal spread can be used to provide a precise chromosomal location in one step. This technique can be used with cDNA as short as 50 or 60 bp. For a review of this technique, see Verma et al., , Pergamon Press, New York (1988).","Once a sequence has been mapped to a precise chromosomal location, the physical position of the sequence on the chromosome can be correlated with genetic map data. Such data are found, for example, in V. McKusick, , available on line through Johns Hopkins University, Welch Medical Library. The relationship between genes and diseases that have been mapped to the same chromosomal region are then identified through linkage analysis (coinheritance of physically adjacent genes).","Next, it is necessary to determine the differences in the cDNA or genomic sequence between affected and unaffected individuals. If a mutation is observed in some or all of the affected individuals but not in any normal individuals, then the mutation is likely to be the causative agent of the disease.","Having generally described the invention, the same will be more readily understood by reference to the following examples, which are provided by way of illustration and are not intended as limiting.","TR21 polypeptides of the invention are optionally fused to other proteins. These fusion proteins can be used for a variety of applications. For example, fusion of TR21 polypeptides to His-tag, HA-tag, protein A, IgG domains, and maltose binding protein facilitates purification. (See EP A 394,827; Traunecker, et al., 331:84\u201386 (1988)). Similarly, fusion to IgG-1, IgG-3, and albumin increases the half-life time in vivo. Nuclear localization signals fused to TR21 polypeptides can target the protein to a specific subcellular localization, while covalent heterodimer or homodimers can increase or decrease the activity of a fusion protein. Fusion proteins can also create chimeric molecules having more than one function. Finally, fusion proteins can increase solubility and\/or stability of the fused protein compared to the non-fused protein. All of the types of fusion proteins described above can be made using techniques known in the art or by using or routinely modifying the following protocol, which outlines the fusion of a polypeptide to an IgG molecule.","Briefly, the human Fc portion of the IgG molecule can be PCR amplified, using primers that span the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of the sequence described below (SEQ ID NO:3). These primers also preferably contain convenient restriction enzyme sites that will facilitate cloning into an expression vector, preferably a mammalian expression vector.","For example, if the pC4 (Accession No. 209646) expression vector is used, the human Fc portion can be ligated into the BamHI cloning site. Note that the 3\u2032 BamHI site should be destroyed. Next, the vector containing the human Fc portion is re-restricted with BamHI, linearizing the vector, and TR21 polynucleotide is ligated into this BamHI site. Note that the polynucleotide is cloned without a stop codon otherwise a fusion protein will not be produced.","If the naturally occurring signal sequence is used to produce the secreted protein, pC4 does not need a second signal peptide. Alternatively, if the naturally occurring signal sequence is not used, the vector can be modified to include a heterologous signal sequence. (See e.g., WO 96\/34891.)","Human IgG Fc Region:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0765","num":"0764"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00004","num":"00004"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","tabstyle":"monospace"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"left"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"GGGATCCGGAGCCCAAATCTTCTGACAAAACTCACACATGCCCACCGTG"},{"entry":{}},{"entry":"CCCAGCACCTGAATTCGAGGGTGCACCGTCAGTCTTCCTCTTCCCCCCA"},{"entry":{}},{"entry":"AAACCCAAGGACACCCTCATGATCTCCCGGACTCCTGAGGTCACATGCG"},{"entry":{}},{"entry":"TGGTGGTGGACGTAAGCCACGAAGACCCTGAGGTCAAGTTCAACTGGTA"},{"entry":{}},{"entry":"CGTGGACGGCGTGGAGGTGCATAATGCCAAGACAAAGCCGCGGGAGGAG"},{"entry":{}},{"entry":"CAGTACAACAGCACGTACCGTGTGGTCAGCGTCCTCACCGTCCTGCACC"},{"entry":{}},{"entry":"AGGACTGGCTGAATGGCAAGGAGTACAAGTGCAAGGTCTCCAACAAAGC"},{"entry":{}},{"entry":"CCTCCCAACCCCCATCGAGAAAACCATCTCCAAAGCCAAAGGGCAGCCC"},{"entry":{}},{"entry":"CGAGAACCACAGGTGTACACCCTGCCCCCATCCCGGGATGAGCTGACCA"},{"entry":{}},{"entry":"AGAACCAGGTCAGCCTGACCTGCCTGGTCAAAGGCTTCTATCCAAGCGA"},{"entry":{}},{"entry":"CATCGCCGTGGAGTGGGAGAGCAATGGGCAGCCGGAGAACAACTACAAG"},{"entry":{}},{"entry":"ACCACGCCTCCCGTGCTGGACTCCGACGGCTCCTTCTTCCTCTACAGCA"},{"entry":{}},{"entry":"AGCTCACCGTGGACAAGAGCAGGTGGCAGCAGGGGAACGTCTTCTCATG"},{"entry":{}},{"entry":"CTCCGTGATGCATGAGGCTCTGCACAACCACTACACGCAGAAGAGCCTC"},{"entry":{}},{"entry":"TCCCTGTCTCCGGGTAAATGAGTGCGACGGCCGCGACTCTAGAGGAT"},{"entry":{}},{"entry":"(SEQ ID NO:3)"}]}}}}},"Naturally occurring V-genes isolated from human PBLs are constructed into a large library of antibody fragments which contain reactivities against polypeptides of the present invention to which the donor may or may not have been exposed (see e.g., U.S. Pat.

To rescue phages displaying antibody fragments, approximately 10harboring the phagemid are used to inoculate 50 ml of 2\u00d7TY containing 1% glucose and 100 ug\/ml of ampicillin (2\u00d7TY-AMP-GLU) and grown to an O.D. of 0.8 with shaking. Five ml of this culture is used to innoculate 50 ml of 2\u00d7TY-AMP-GLU, 2\u00d7108 TU of gene 3 helper phage (M13 gene III, see WO92\/01047) are added and the culture incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for 45 minutes without shaking and then at 37\u00b0 C. for 45 minutes with shaking. The culture is centrifuged at 4000 r.p.m. for 10 minutes and the pellet resuspended in 2 liters of 2\u00d7TY containing 100 ug\/ml ampicillin and 50 ug\/ml kanamycin and grown overnight. Phages are prepared as described in WO92\/01047.","M13 gene III is prepared as follows: M13 gene III helper phage does not encode gene III protein, hence the phage(mid) displaying antibody fragments have a greater avidity of binding to antigen. Infectious M13 gene III particles are made by growing the helper phage in cells harboring a pUC19 derivative supplying the wild type gene III protein during phage morphogenesis. The culture is incubated for 1 hour at 37\u00b0 C. without shaking and then for a further hour at 37\u00b0 C. with shaking. Cells are pelleted (IEC-Centra 8, 4000 revs\/min for 10 min), resuspended in 300 ml 2\u00d7TY broth containing 100 ug ampicillin\/ml and 25 ug kanamycin\/ml (2\u00d7TY-AMP-KAN) and grown overnight, shaking at 37\u00b0 C.

Tubes are blocked with 2% Marvel-PBS for 2 hours at 37\u00b0 C. and then washed 3 times in PBS. Approximately 10TU of phage are applied to the tube and incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature tumbling on an over and under turntable and then left to stand for another 1.5 hours. Tubes are washed 10 times with PBS 0.1% Tween-20 and 10 times with PBS. Phage are eluted by adding 1 ml of 100 mM triethylamine and rotating 15 minutes on an under and over turntable after which the solution is immediately neutralized with 0.5 ml of 1.0M Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Phages are then used to infect 10 ml of mid-log TG1 by incubating eluted phages with bacteria for 30 minutes at 37\u00b0 C. The are then plated on TYE plates containing 1% glucose and 100 ug\/ml ampicillin. The resulting bacterial library is then rescued with gene III helper phage as described above to prepare phage for a subsequent round of selection. This process is then repeated for a total of 4 rounds of affinity purification with tube-washing increased to 20 times with PBS, 0.1% Tween-20 and 20 times with PBS for rounds 3 and 4.","Characterization of Binders","Eluted phage from the 3rd and 4th rounds of selection are used to infect HB 2151 and soluble scFv is produced (Marks, et al., 1991) from single colonies for assay. ELISAs are performed with microtiter plates coated with either 10 pg\/ml of the polypeptide of the present invention in 50 mM bicarbonate pH 9.6. Clones positive in ELISA are further characterized by PCR fingerprinting (see e.g., WO92\/01047) and then by sequencing.","a) Hybridoma Technology","The antibodies of the present invention can be prepared by a variety of methods. (See, Current Protocols, Chapter 2.) As one example of such methods, cells expressing TR21 are administered to an animal to induce the production of sera containing polyclonal antibodies. In a preferred method, a preparation of TR21 protein is prepared and purified to render it substantially free of natural contaminants. Such a preparation is then introduced into an animal in order to produce polyclonal antisera of greater specific activity.","In the most preferred method, the antibodies of the present invention are monoclonal antibodies (or protein binding fragments thereof). Such monoclonal antibodies can be prepared using hybridoma technology. (Kohler et al., Nature 256:495 (1975); Kohler et al., Eur. J. Immunol. 6:511 (1976); Kohler et al., Eur. J. Immunol. 6:292 (1976); Hammerling et al., in: Monoclonal Antibodies and T-Cell Hybridomas, Elsevier, N.Y., pp. 563\u2013681 (1981).) In general, such procedures involve immunizing an animal (preferably a mouse) with TR21 polypeptide or, more preferably, with a secreted TR21 polypeptide-expressing cell. Such cells may be cultured in any suitable tissue culture medium; however, it is preferable to culture cells in Earle's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (inactivated at about 56 C), and supplemented with about 10 g\/l of nonessential amino acids, about 1,000 U\/ml of penicillin, and about 100 ug\/ml of streptomycin.","The splenocytes of such mice are extracted and fused with a suitable myeloma cell line. Any suitable myeloma cell line may be employed in accordance with the present invention; however, it is preferable to employ the parent myeloma cell line (SP2O), available from the ATCC. After fusion, the resulting hybridoma cells are selectively maintained in HAT medium, and then cloned by limiting dilution as described by Wands et al. (Gastroenterology 80:225\u2013232 (1981).) The hybridoma cells obtained through such a selection are then assayed to identify clones which secrete antibodies capable of binding the TR21 polypeptide.","Alternatively, additional antibodies capable of binding to TR21 polypeptide can be produced in a two-step procedure using anti-idiotypic antibodies. Such a method makes use of the fact that antibodies are themselves antigens, and therefore, it is possible to obtain an antibody which binds to a second antibody. In accordance with this method, protein specific antibodies are used to immunize an animal, preferably a mouse. The splenocytes of such an animal are then used to produce hybridoma cells, and the hybridoma cells are screened to identify clones which produce an antibody whose ability to bind to the TR21 protein-specific antibody can be blocked by TR21. Such antibodies comprise anti-idiotypic antibodies to the TR21 protein-specific antibody and can be used to immunize an animal to induce formation of further TR21 protein-specific antibodies.","It will be appreciated that Fab and F(ab\u2032)2 and other fragments of the antibodies of the present invention may be used according to the methods disclosed herein. Such fragments are typically produced by proteolytic cleavage, using enzymes such as papain (to produce Fab fragments) or pepsin (to produce F(ab\u2032)2 fragments). Alternatively, secreted TR21 protein-binding fragments can be produced through the application of recombinant DNA technology or through synthetic chemistry.","For in vivo use of antibodies in humans, it may be preferable to use \u201chumanized\u201d chimeric monoclonal antibodies. Such antibodies can be produced using genetic constructs derived from hybridoma cells producing the monoclonal antibodies described above. Methods for producing chimeric antibodies are known in the art. (See, for review, Morrison, Science 229:1202 (1985); Oi et al., BioTechniques 4:214 (1986); Cabilly et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567; Taniguchi et al., EP 171496; Morrison et al., EP 173494; Neuberger et al., WO 8601533; Robinson et al., WO 8702671; Boulianne et al., Nature 312:643 (1984); Neuberger et al., Nature 314:268 (1985)).","b) Isolation of Antibody Fragments Directed Against TR21 from a Library of scFvs","Naturally occurring V-genes isolated from human PBLs are constructed into a large library of antibody fragments which contain reactivities against TR21 to which the donor may or may not have been exposed (see e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,885,793 incorporated herein in its entirety by reference).","Rescue of the Library","A library of scFvs is constructed from the RNA of human PBLs as described in WO92\/01047. To rescue phages displaying antibody fragments, approximately 10harboring the phagemid are used to inoculate 50 ml of 2\u00d7TY containing 1% glucose and 100 ug\/ml of ampicillin (2\u00d7TY-AMP-GLU) and grown to an O.D. of 0.8 with shaking. Five ml of this culture is used to innoculate 50 ml of 2\u00d7TY-AMP-GLU, 2\u00d710TU of delta gene 3 helper (M13 delta gene III, see WO92\/01047) are added and the culture incubated at 37 C for 45 minutes without shaking and then at 37 C for 45 minutes with shaking. The culture is centrifuged at 4000 r.p.m. for 10 min. and the pellet resuspended in 2 liters of 2\u00d7TY containing 100 ug\/ml ampicillin and 50 ug\/ml kanamycin and grown overnight. Phages are prepared as described in WO92\/01047.","M13 delta gene III is prepared as follows: M13 delta gene III helper phage does not encode gene III protein, hence the phage(mid) displaying antibody fragments have a greater avidity of binding to antigen. Infectious M13 delta gene III particles are made by growing the helper phage in cells harboring a pUC19 derivative supplying the wild type gene III protein during phage morphogenesis. The culture is incubated for 1 hour at 37 C without shaking and then for a further hour at 37 C with shaking. Cells are spun down (IEC-Centra 8, 4000 revs\/min for 10 min), resuspended in 300 ml 2\u00d7TY broth containing 100 ug ampicillin\/ml and 25 ug kanamycin\/ml (2\u00d7TY-AMP-KAN) and grown overnight, shaking at 37 C. Phage particles are purified and concentrated from the culture medium by two PEG-precipitations (Sambrook et al., 1990), resuspended in 2 ml PBS and passed through a 0.45 um filter (Minisart NML; Sartorius) to give a final concentration of approximately 10transducing units\/ml (ampicillin-resistant clones).","Panning of the Library","Immunotubes (Nunc) are coated overnight in PBS with 4 ml of either 100 ug\/ml or 10 ug\/ml of a polypeptide of the present invention. Tubes are blocked with 2% Marvel-PBS for 2 hours at 37 C and then washed 3 times in PBS. Approximately 10TU of phage is applied to the tube and incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature tumbling on an over and under turntable and then left to stand for another 1.5 hours. Tubes are washed 10 times with PBS 0.1% Tween-20 and 10 times with PBS. Phage are eluted by adding 1 ml of 100 mM triethylamine and rotating 15 minutes on an under and over turntable after which the solution is immediately neutralized with 0.5 ml of 1.0M Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Phages are then used to infect 10 ml of mid-log TG1 by incubating eluted phage with bacteria for 30 minutes at 37 C. The are then plated on TYE plates containing 1% glucose and 100 \u03bcg\/ml ampicillin. The resulting bacterial library is then rescued with delta gene 3 helper phage as described above to prepare phage for a subsequent round of selection. This process is then repeated for a total of 4 rounds of affinity purification with tube-washing increased to 20 times with PBS, 0.1% Tween-20 and 20 times with PBS for rounds 3 and 4.","Characterization of Binders","Eluted phages from the 3rd and 4th rounds of selection are used to infect HB 2151 and soluble scFv is produced (Marks, et al., 1991) from single colonies for assay. ELISAs are performed with microtiter plates coated with either 10 pg\/ml of the polypeptide of the present invention in 50 mM bicarbonate pH 9.6. Clones positive in ELISA are further characterized by PCR fingerprinting (see e.g., WO92\/01047) and then by sequencing.","TR21 polypeptides can be detected in a biological sample, and if an increased or decreased level of TR21 is detected, this polypeptide is a marker for a particular phenotype. Methods of detection are numerous, and thus, it is understood that one skilled in the art can modify the following assay to fit their particular needs.","For example, antibody-sandwich ELISA assays are used to detect TR21 in a sample, preferably a biological sample. Wells of a microtiter plate are coated with specific antibodies to TR21, at a final concentration of 0.2 to 10 ug\/ml. The antibodies are either monoclonal or polyclonal and are produced using technique known in the art. The wells are blocked so that non-specific binding of TR21 to the well is reduced.","The coated wells are then incubated for >2 hours at RT with a sample containing TR21. Preferably, serial dilutions of the sample should be used to validate results. The plates are then washed three times with deionized or distilled water to remove unbound TR21.","Next, 50 ul of specific antibody-alkaline phosphatase conjugate, at a concentration of 25\u2013400 ng, is added and incubated for 2 hours at room temperature. The plates are again washed three times with deionized or distilled water to remove unbounded conjugate.","75 ul of 4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate (MUP) or p-nitrophenyl phosphate (NPP) substrate solution is then added to each well and incubated 1 hour at room temperature to allow cleavage of the substrate and fluorescence. The fluorescence is measured using a microtiter plate reader. A standard curve is prepared using the experimental results from serial dilutions of a control sample with the sample concentration plotted on the X-axis (log scale) and fluorescence or absorbance on the Y-axis (linear scale). The TR21 polypeptide concentration in a sample is then interpolated using the standard curve based on the measured fluorescence of that sample.","The present invention relates to a method for treating an individual in need of a decreased level of TR21 biological activity in the body comprising, administering to such an individual a composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of TR21 antagonist. Preferred antagonists for use in the present invention are TR21-specific antibodies.","Moreover, it will be appreciated that conditions caused by a decrease in the standard or normal expression level of TR21 in an individual can be treated by administering TR21, preferably in a soluble and\/or secreted form. Thus, the invention also provides a method of treatment of an individual in need of an increased level of TR21 polypeptide comprising administering to such an individual a pharmaceutical composition comprising an amount of TR21 to increase the biological activity level of TR21 in such an individual.","For example, a patient with decreased levels of TR21 polypeptide receives a daily dose 0.1\u2013100 ug\/kg of the polypeptide for six consecutive days. Preferably, the polypeptide is in a soluble and\/or secreted form.","The present invention also relates to a method for treating an individual in need of an increased level of TR21 biological activity in the body comprising administering to such an individual a composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of TR21 or an agonist thereof.","Antisense technology is used to inhibit production of TR21. This technology is one example of a method of decreasing levels of TR21 polypeptide, preferably a soluble and\/or secreted form, due to a variety of etiologies, such as cancer.","For example, a patient diagnosed with abnormally increased levels of TR21 is administered intravenously antisense polynucleotides at 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 and 3.0 mg\/kg day for 21 days. This treatment is repeated after a 7-day rest period if the is determined to be well tolerated.","One method of gene therapy transplants fibroblasts, which are capable of expressing soluble and\/or mature TR21 polypeptides, onto a patient. Generally, fibroblasts are obtained from a subject by skin biopsy. The resulting tissue is placed in tissue-culture medium and separated into small pieces. Small chunks of the tissue are placed on a wet surface of a tissue culture flask, approximately ten pieces are placed in each flask. The flask is turned upside down, closed tight and left at room temperature over night. After 24 hours at room temperature, the flask is inverted and the chunks of tissue remain fixed to the bottom of the flask and fresh media (e.g., Ham's F12 media, with 10% FBS, penicillin and streptomycin) is added. The flasks are then incubated at 37 C for approximately one week.","At this time, fresh media is added and subsequently changed every several days. After an additional two weeks in culture, a monolayer of fibroblasts emerge. The monolayer is trypsinized and scaled into larger flasks.","pMV-7 (Kirschmeier, P. T. et al., 7:219\u201325 (1988)), flanked by the long terminal repeats of the Moloney murine sarcoma virus, is digested with EcoRI and HindIII and subsequently treated with calf intestinal phosphatase. The linear vector is fractionated on agarose gel and purified, using glass beads.","The cDNA encoding TR21 can be amplified using PCR primers which correspond to the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 end encoding sequences respectively. Preferably, the 5\u2032 primer contains an EcoRI site and the 3\u2032 primer includes a HindIII site. Equal quantities of the Moloney murine sarcoma virus linear backbone and the amplified EcoRI and HindIII fragment are added together, in the presence of T4 DNA ligase. The resulting mixture is maintained under conditions appropriate for ligation of the two fragments. The ligation mixture is then used to transform HB101, which are then plated onto agar containing kanamycin for the purpose of confirming that the vector contains properly inserted TR21.","The amphotropic pA317 or GP+am12 packaging cells are grown in tissue culture to confluent density in Dulbecco's Modified Eagles Medium (DMEM) with 10% calf serum (CS), penicillin and streptomycin. The MSV vector containing the TR21 gene is then added to the media and the packaging cells transduced with the vector. The packaging cells now produce infectious viral particles containing the TR21 gene (the packaging cells are now referred to as producer cells).","Fresh media is added to the transduced producer cells, and subsequently, the media is harvested from a 10 cm plate of confluent producer cells. The spent media, containing the infectious viral particles, is filtered through a millipore filter to remove detached producer cells and this media is then used to infect fibroblast cells. Media is removed from a sub-confluent plate of fibroblasts and quickly replaced with the media from the producer cells. This media is removed and replaced with fresh media. If the titer of virus is high, then virtually all fibroblasts will be infected and no selection is required. If the titer is very low, then it is necessary to use a retroviral vector that has a selectable marker, such as neo or his. Once the fibroblasts have been efficiently infected, the fibroblasts are analyzed to determine whether TR21 protein is produced.","The engineered fibroblasts are then transplanted onto the host, either alone or after having been grown to confluence on cytodex 3 microcarrier beads.","Another aspect of the present invention is using in vivo gene therapy methods to treat disorders, diseases and conditions. The gene therapy method relates to the introduction of naked nucleic acid (DNA, RNA, and antisense DNA or RNA) TR21 sequences into an animal to increase or decrease the expression of the TR21 polypeptide. The TR21 polynucleotide may be operatively linked to a promoter or any other genetic elements necessary for the expression of the TR21 polypeptide by the target tissue. Such gene therapy and delivery techniques and methods are known in the art, see, for example, WO90\/11092, WO98\/11779; U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,693,622, 5,705,151, 5,580,859; Tabata H. et al., 35:470\u2013479 (1997); Chao J. et al., 35:517\u2013522 (1997); Wolff J. A. 7:314\u2013318 (1997); Schwartz B. et al., 3:405\u2013411 (1996); Tsurumi Y. et al., 94:3281\u20133290 (1996) (incorporated herein by reference).","The TR21 polynucleotide constructs may be delivered by any method that delivers injectable materials to the cells of an animal, such as, injection into the interstitial space of tissues (heart, muscle, skin, lung, liver, intestine and the like). The TR21 polynucleotide constructs can be delivered in a pharmaceutically acceptable liquid or aqueous carrier.","The term \u201cnaked\u201d polynucleotide, DNA or RNA, refers to sequences that are free from any delivery vehicle that acts to assist, promote, or facilitate entry into the cell, including viral sequences, viral particles, liposome formulations, lipofectin or precipitating agents and the like. However, the TR21 polynucleotides may also be delivered in liposome formulations (such as those taught in Felgner P. L., et al. 772:126\u2013139 (1995), and Abdallah B., et al. 85(1):1\u20137 (1995)) which can be prepared by methods well known to those skilled in the art.","The TR21 polynucleotide vector constructs used in the gene therapy method are preferably constructs that will not integrate into the host genome nor will they contain sequences that allow for replication. Any strong promoter known to those skilled in the art can be used for driving the expression of DNA. Unlike other gene therapy techniques, one major advantage of introducing naked nucleic acid sequences into target cells is the transitory nature of the polynucleotide synthesis in the cells. Studies have shown that non-replicating DNA sequences can be introduced into cells to provide production of the desired polypeptide for periods of up to six months.","The TR21 polynucleotide construct can be delivered to the interstitial space of tissues within the animal, including of muscle, skin, brain, lung, liver, spleen, bone marrow, thymus, heart, lymph, blood, bone, cartilage, pancreas, kidney, gall bladder, stomach, intestine, testis, ovary, uterus, rectum, nervous system, eye, gland, and connective tissue. Interstitial space of the tissues comprises the intercellular fluid, mucopolysaccharide matrix among the reticular fibers of organ tissues, elastic fibers in the walls of vessels or chambers, collagen fibers of fibrous tissues, or that same matrix within connective tissue ensheathing muscle cells or in the lacunae of bone. It is similarly the space occupied by the plasma of the circulation and the lymph fluid of the lymphatic channels. Delivery to the interstitial space of muscle tissue is preferred for the reasons discussed below. They may be conveniently delivered by injection into the tissues comprising these cells. They are preferably delivered to and expressed in persistent, non-dividing cells which are differentiated, although delivery and expression may be achieved in non-differentiated or less completely differentiated cells, such as, for example, stem cells of blood or skin fibroblasts. In vivo muscle cells are particularly competent in their ability to take up and express polynucleotides.","For the naked TR21 polynucleotide injection, an effective dosage amount of DNA or RNA will be in the range of from about 0.05 g\/kg body weight to about 50 mg\/kg body weight. Preferably the dosage will be from about 0.005 mg\/kg to about 20 mg\/kg and more preferably from about 0.05 mg\/kg to about 5 mg\/kg. Of course, as the artisan of ordinary skill will appreciate, this dosage will vary according to the tissue site of injection. The appropriate and effective dosage of nucleic acid sequence can readily be determined by those of ordinary skill in the art and may depend on the condition being treated and the route of administration. The preferred route of administration is by the parenteral route of injection into the interstitial space of tissues. However, other parenteral routes may also be used, such as, inhalation of an aerosol formulation particularly for delivery to lungs or bronchial tissues, throat or mucous membranes of the nose. In addition, naked TR21 polynucleotide constructs can be delivered to arteries during angioplasty by the catheter used in the procedure.","The dose response effects of injected TR21 polynucleotide in muscle in vivo is determined as follows. Suitable TR21 template DNA for production of mRNA coding for TR21 polypeptide is prepared in accordance with a standard recombinant DNA methodology. The template DNA, which may be either circular or linear, is either used as naked DNA or complexed with liposomes. The quadriceps muscles of mice are then injected with various amounts of the template DNA.","Five to six week old female and male Balb\/C mice are anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection with 0.3 ml of 2.5% Avertin. A 1.5 cm incision is made on the anterior thigh, and the quadriceps muscle is directly visualized. The TR21 template DNA is injected in 0.1 ml of carrier in a 1 cc syringe through a 27 gauge needle over one minute, approximately 0.5 cm from the distal insertion site of the muscle into the knee and about 0.2 cm deep. A suture is placed over the injection site for future localization, and the skin is closed with stainless steel clips.","After an appropriate incubation time (e.g., 7 days) muscle extracts are prepared by excising the entire quadriceps. Every fifth 15 um cross-section of the individual quadriceps muscles is histochemically stained for TR21 protein expression. A time course for TR21 protein expression may be done in a similar fashion except that quadriceps from different mice are harvested at different times. Persistence of TR21 DNA in muscle following injection may be determined by Southern blot analysis after preparing total cellular DNA and HIRT supernatants from injected and control mice. The results of the above experimentation in mice can be use to extrapolate proper dosages and other treatment parameters in humans and other animals using TR21 naked DNA.","Another method of gene therapy according to the present invention involves operably associating the endogenous TR21 sequence with a promoter via homologous recombination as described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,641,670, issued Jun. 24, 1997; International Publication Number WO 96\/29411; International Publication Number WO 94\/12650; Koller et al., 86:8932\u20138935 (1989); and Zijlstra et al., 342:435\u2013438 (1989). This method involves the activation of a gene which is present in the target cells, but which is not expressed in the cells, or is expressed at a lower level than desired. Polynucleotide constructs are made which contain a promoter and targeting sequences, which are homologous to the 5\u2032 non-coding sequence of endogenous TR21, flanking the promoter. The targeting sequence will be sufficiently near the 5\u2032 end of TR21 so the promoter will be operably linked to the endogenous sequence upon homologous recombination. The promoter and the targeting sequences can be amplified using PCR. Preferably, the amplified promoter contains distinct restriction enzyme sites on the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends. Preferably, the 3\u2032 end of the first targeting sequence contains the same restriction enzyme site as the 5\u2032 end of the amplified promoter and the 5\u2032 end of the second targeting sequence contains the same restriction site as the 3\u2032 end of the amplified promoter.","The amplified promoter and the amplified targeting sequences are digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes and subsequently treated with calf intestinal phosphatase. The digested promoter and digested targeting sequences are added together in the presence of T4 DNA ligase. The resulting mixture is maintained under conditions appropriate for ligation of the two fragments. The construct is size fractionated on an agarose gel then purified by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation.","In this Example, the polynucleotide constructs are administered as naked polynucleotides via electroporation. However, the polynucleotide constructs may also be administered with transfection-facilitating agents, such as liposomes, viral sequences, viral particles, precipitating agents, etc. Such methods of delivery are known in the art.","Once the cells are transfected, homologous recombination will take place which results in the promoter being operably linked to the endogenous TR21 sequence. This results in the expression of TR21 in the cell. Expression may be detected by immunological staining, or any other method known in the art.","Fibroblasts are obtained from a subject by skin biopsy. The resulting tissue is placed in DMEM+10% fetal calf serum. Exponentially growing or early stationary phase fibroblasts are trypsinized and rinsed from the plastic surface with nutrient medium. An aliquot of the cell suspension is removed for counting, and the remaining cells are subjected to centrifugation. The supernatant is aspirated and the pellet is resuspended in 5 ml of electroporation buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.3, 137 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 0.7 mM NaHPO, 6 mM dextrose). The cells are recentrifuged, the supernatant aspirated, and the cells resuspended in electroporation buffer containing 1 mg\/ml acetylated bovine serum albumin. The final cell suspension contains approximately 3\u00d710cells\/ml. Electroporation should be performed immediately following resuspension.","Plasmid DNA is prepared according to standard techniques. For example, to construct a plasmid for targeting to the TR21 locus, plasmid pUC18 (MBI Fermentas, Amherst, N.Y.) is digested with HindIII. The CMV promoter is amplified by PCR with an XbaI site on the 5\u2032 end and a BamHI site on the 3\u2032end. Two TR21 non-coding sequences are amplified via PCR: one TR21 non-coding sequence (TR21 fragment 1) is amplified with a HindIII site at the 5\u2032 end and an Xba site at the 3\u2032end; the other TR21 non-coding sequence (TR21 fragment 2) is amplified with a BamHI site at the 5\u2032end and a HindIII site at the 3\u2032end. The CMV promoter and TR21 fragments are digested with the appropriate enzymes (CMV promoter\u2014XbaI and BamHI; TR21 fragment 1\u2014XbaI; TR21\u2014fragment 2\u2014BamHI) and ligated together. The resulting ligation product is digested with HindIII, and ligated with the HindIII-digested pUC18 plasmid.","Plasmid DNA is added to a sterile cuvette with a 0.4 cm electrode gap (Bio-Rad). The final DNA concentration is generally at least 120 \u03bcg\/ml. 0.5 ml of the cell suspension (containing approximately 1.5\u00d710cells) is then added to the cuvette, and the cell suspension and DNA solutions are gently mixed. Electroporation is performed with a Gene-Pulser apparatus (Bio-Rad). Capacitance and voltage are set at 960 \u03bcF and 250\u2013300 V, respectively. As voltage increases, cell survival decreases, but the percentage of surviving cells that stably incorporate the introduced DNA into their genome increases dramatically. Given these parameters, a pulse time of approximately 14\u201320 mSec should be observed.","Electroporated cells are maintained at room temperature for approximately 5 min, and the contents of the cuvette are then gently removed with a sterile transfer pipette. The cells are added directly to 10 ml of prewarmed nutrient media (DMEM with 15% calf serum) in a 10 cm dish and incubated at 37 C. The following day, the media is aspirated and replaced with 10 ml of fresh media and incubated for a further 16\u201324 hours.","The engineered fibroblasts are then injected into the host, either alone or after having been grown to confluence on cytodex 3 microcarrier beads. The fibroblasts now produce the protein product. The fibroblasts can then be introduced into a patient as described above.","Mouse bone marrow cells may be used as target cells to examine the effect of TR21 polypeptides of the invention on hematopoictic progenitor cells and\/or differentiation. Briefly, unfractionated bone marrow cells are first washed 2\u00d7 with a serum-free IMDM that is supplemented with 10% (V\/V) BIT (Bovine serum albumin, Insulin and Transferrin supplement from Stem Cell Technologies, Vancouver, Canada). The washed cells are then resuspended in the same growth medium and plated in the 96-well tissue culture plate (5\u00d710cells\/well) in 0.2 ml of the above medium in the presence or absence of cytokines and TR21. Stem cell factor (SCF) and IL-3 are included as positive mediators of cell proliferation. Cells are allowed to grow in a low oxygen environment (5% CO, 7% O, and 88% N) tissue culture incubator for 6 days. On the sixth day, 0.5 \u03bcCi of Tritiated thymidine is added to each well and incubation is continued for an additional 16\u201318 hours, at which point the cells are harvested. The level of radioactivity incorporated into cellular DNA is determined by scintillation spectrometry and reflects the amount of cell proliferation.","The studies described in this example test the activity of TR21 polypeptides of the invention. However, one skilled in the art could easily modify the exemplified studies to test the activity of TR21 polynucleotides (e.g., gene therapy), agonists, and\/or antagonists of TR21. Potential agonists would be expected to inhibit hematopoietic cell proliferation in the presence of SCF and\/or IL3 and\/or to increase the inhibition of cell proliferation in the presence of cytokines and TR21 in this assay. Potential antagonists would be expected to reduce the inhibition of cell proliferation in the presence of cytokines and TR21 in this assay.","To determine if TR21 polypeptides of the invention inhibit specific hematopoietic lineages, mouse bone marrow cells are first washed 2\u00d7 with a serum-free IMDM that is supplemented with 10% (V\/V) BIT (Bovine serum albumin, Insulin and Transferrin supplement from Stem Cell Technologies, Vancouver, Canada). The washed cells are then resuspended in the same growth medium and plated in the 96-well tissue culture plate (5\u00d710cells\/well) in 0.2 ml of the above medium in the presence of IL-3 (1 ng\/ml) plus SCF (5 ng\/ml) with or without TR21. Cells are allowed to grow in a low oxygen environment (5% CO, 7% O, and 88% N) tissue culture incubator, and after 7 days, analyzed for expression of differentiation antigens by staining with various monoclonal antibodies and FACScan.","The studies described in this example test the activity of TR21 polypeptides of the invention. However, one skilled in the art could easily modify the exemplified studies to test the activity of TR21 polynucleotides (e.g., gene therapy), agonists, and\/or antagonists of TR21. Potential agonists tested in this assay would be expected to inhibit cell proliferation in the presence of cytokines and\/or to increase the inhibition of cell proliferation in the presence of cytokines and TR21. Potential antagonists tested in this assay would be expected to reduce the inhibition of cell proliferation in the presence of cytokines and TR21.","A population of mouse bone marrow cells enriched in primitive hematopoietic progenitors can be obtained using a negative selection procedure, where the committed cells of most of the lineages are removed using a panel of monoclonal antibodies (anti cd11b, CD4, CD8, CD45R and Gr-1 antigens) and magnetic beads. The resulting population of cells (lineage depleted cells) are plated (5\u00d710cells\/ml) in the presence or absence of TR21 polypeptide of the invention (in a range of concentrations) in a growth medium supplemented with IL-3 (5 ng\/ml) plus SCF (100 ng\/ml). After seven days of incubation at 37 C in a humidified incubator (5% CO, 7% O, and 88% Nenvironment), cells are harvested and assayed for the HPP-CFC, and immature progenitors. In addition, cells are analyzed for the expression of certain differentiation antigens by FACScan. Colony data is expressed as mean number of colonies +\/\u2212 SD) and are obtained from assays performed in six dishes for each population of cells.","Generation of functional humoral immune responses requires both soluble and cognate signaling between B-lineage cells and their microenvironment. Signals may impart a positive stimulus that allows a B-lineage cell to continue its programmed development, or a negative stimulus that instructs the cell to arrest its current developmental pathway. To date, numerous stimulatory and inhibitory signals have been found to influence B cell responsiveness including IL-2, IL-4, IL5, IL6, IL-7, IL 10, IL-13, IL14 and IL15. Interestingly, these signals are by themselves weak effectors but can, in combination with various co-stimulatory proteins, induce activation, proliferation, differentiation, homing, tolerance and death among B cell populations. One of the most well studied classes of B-cell co-stimulatory proteins is the TNF-superfamily. Within this family CD40, CD27, and CD30 along with their respective ligands CD154, CD70, and CD153 have been found to regulate a variety of immune responses. Assays which allow for the detection and\/or observation of the proliferation and differentiation of these B-cell populations and their precursors are valuable tools in determining the effects various proteins may have on these B-cell populations in terms of proliferation and differentiation. Listed below are two assays designed to allow for the detection of the differentiation, proliferation, or inhibition of B-cell populations and their precursors.","In Vitro Assay","Purified TR21 polypeptides of the invention (e.g., soluble TR21) or agonists or antagonists thereof, are assessed for their ability to induce activation, proliferation, differentiation or inhibition and\/or death in B-cell populations and their precursors. The activity of TR21 polypeptides, or agonists or antagonists thereof on purified human tonsillar B cells, measured qualitatively over the dose range from 0.1 to 10,000 ng\/ml, is assessed in a standard B-lymphocyte co-stimulation assay in which purified tonsillar B cells are cultured in the presence of either formalin-fixed Cowan I (SAC) or immobilized anti-human IgM antibody as the priming agent. Second signals such as IL-2 and IL-15 synergize with SAC and IgM crosslinking to elicit B cell proliferation as measured by tritiated-thymidine incorporation. Novel synergizing agents can be readily identified using this assay. The assay involves isolating human tonsillar B cells by magnetic bead (MACS) depletion of CD3-positive cells. The resulting cell population is greater than 95% B cells as assessed by expression of CD45R(B220). Various dilutions of each sample are placed into individual wells of a 96-well plate to which are added 10B-cells suspended in culture medium (RPMI 1640 containing 10% FBS, 5\u00d710M \u03b2ME, 100 U\/ml penicillin, 10 ug\/ml streptomycin, and 10dilution of SAC) in a total volume of 150 ul. Proliferation or inhibition is quantitated by a 20 h pulse (1 uCi\/well) with H-thymidine (6.7 Ci\/mM) beginning 72 h post factor addition. The positive and negative controls are IL2 and medium respectively.","In Vivo Assay","BALB\/c mice are injected (i.p.) twice per day with buffer only, or 2 mg\/Kg of TR21 polypeptide (e.g., soluble TR21) or agonists or antagonists thereof. Mice receive this treatment for 4 consecutive days, at which time they are sacrificed and various tissues and serum collected for analyses. Comparison of H&E sections from normal and TR21 polypeptide-treated spleens identify the results of the activity of TR21 polypeptide on spleen cells, such as the diffusion of peri-arterial lymphatic sheaths, and\/or significant increases in the nucleated cellularity of the red pulp regions, which may indicate the activation of the differentiation and proliferation of B-cell populations. Immunohistochemical studies using a B cell marker, anti-CD45R(B220), are used to determine whether any physiological changes to splenic cells, such as splenic disorganization, are due to increased B-cell representation within loosely defined B-cell zones that infiltrate established T-cell regions.","Flow cytometric analyses of the spleens from TR21 polypeptide-treated mice is used to indicate whether TR21 polypeptide specifically increases the proportion of ThB+, CD45R(B220) dull B cells over that which is observed in control mice.","Likewise, a predicted consequence of increased mature B-cell representation in vivo is a relative increase in serum Ig titers. Accordingly, serum IgM and IgA levels are compared between buffer and TR21 polypeptide-treated mice.","The studies described in this example test the activity in TR21 polypeptide. However, one skilled in the art could easily modify the exemplified studies to test the activity of TR21 polynucleotides (e.g., gene therapy), and agonists, and\/or antagonists of TR21.","This example provides a co-stimulatory assay using Cowan 1 (SAC) as priming agent and Neutrokine-alpha (International Application Publication No. WO 98\/18921) or IL-2 as a second signal to assay for TR21 polypeptide antagonists of Neutrokine-alpha (or IL-2) mediated B cell proliferation.","A soluble TR21 polypeptide is prepared (e.g., a soluble form of TR21 corresponding to a portion of the TR21 extracellular domain linked to the Fc portion of a human IgG1 immunoglobulin molecule). The ability of this protein to alter the proliferative response of human B cells is assessed in a standard co-stimulatory assay. Briefly, human tonsillar B cells are purified by magnetic bead (MACS) depletion of CD3-positive cells. The resulting cell population is routinely greater than 95% B cells as assessed by expression of CD19 and CD20 staining. Various dilutions of rHuNeutrokine-alpha (International Application Publication No. WO 98\/18921) or rHuIL2 are placed into individual wells of a 96-well plate to which is added 105 B cells suspended in culture medium (RPMI 1640 containing 10% FBS, 5\u00d710M 2ME, 100 U\/ml penicillin, 10 ug\/ml streptomycin, and 10dilution of formalin-fixed Cowan I (SAC) also known as Pansorbin (Pan)) in a total volume of 150 ul. The TR21 polypeptide is then added at various concentrations and the plates are placed in the incubator (37\u00b0 C. 5% CO, 95% humidity) for three days. Proliferation is quantitated by a 20 h pulse (1 \u03bcCi\/well) of H-thymidine (6.7 Ci\/mM) beginning 72 h post factor addition. The positive and negative controls are SAC exposed B cells with rHuNeutrokine-alpha (or rHuIL2) and medium (in the absence of the TR21 polypeptide), respectively.","Antagonists of rHuNeutrokine-alpha (or rHuIL2) mediated B cell proliferation demonstrate a reduced level of B cell proliferation in the samples containing the TR21 polypeptides when compared to the positive control.","A CD3-induced proliferation assay is performed on PBMCs and is measured by the uptake of H-thymidine. The assay is performed as follows. Ninety-six well plates are coated with 100 \u03bcl\/well of mAb to CD3 (HIT3a, Pharmingen) or isotype-matched control mAb (B33.1) overnight at 4\u00b0 C. (1 \u03bcg\/ml in 0.05M bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.5), then washed three times with PBS. PBMC are isolated by F\/H gradient centrifugation from human peripheral blood and added to quadruplicate wells (5\u00d710\/well) of mAb coated plates in RPMI containing 10% FCS and P\/S in the presence of varying concentrations of TR21 protein (total volume 200 \u03bcl). Relevant protein buffer and medium alone are controls. After 48 hr. culture at 37\u00b0 C., plates are spun for 2 min. at 1000 rpm and 100 \u03bcl of supernatant is removed and stored \u221220\u00b0 C. for measurement of IL-2 (or other cytokines) if effect on proliferation is observed. Wells are supplemented with 100 \u03bcl of medium containing 0.5 \u03bcCi of H-thymidine and cultured at 37\u00b0 C. for 18\u201324 hr. Wells are harvested and incorporation of H-thymidine used as a measure of proliferation. Anti-CD3 alone is the positive control for proliferation. IL-2 (100 U\/ml) is also used as a control which enhances proliferation. Control antibody which does not induce proliferation of T cells is used as the negative controls for the effects of TR21 proteins.","The studies described in this example test the activity in TR21 protein. However, one skilled in the art could easily modify the exemplified studies to test the activity of TR21 polynucleotides (e.g., gene therapy), agonists, and\/or antagonists of TR21.","Dendritic cells are generated by the expansion of proliferating precursors found in the peripheral blood: adherent PBMC or elutriated monocytic fractions are cultured for 7\u201310 days with GM-CSF (50 ng\/ml) and IL-4 (20 ng\/ml). These dendritic cells have the characteristic phenotype of immature cells (expression of CD1, CD80, CD86, CD40 and MHC class II antigens). Treatment with activating factors, such as TNF-\u03b1, causes a rapid change in surface phenotype (increased expression of MHC class I and II, costimulatory and adhesion molecules, downregulation of FC\u03b3RII, upregulation of CD83). These changes correlate with increased antigen-presenting capacity and with functional maturation of the dendritic cells.","FACS analysis of surface antigens is performed as follows. Cells are treated 1\u20133 days with increasing concentrations of TR21 or LPS (positive control), washed with PBS containing 1% BSA and 0.02 mM sodium azide, and then incubated with 1:20 dilution of appropriate FITC- or PE-labeled monoclonal antibodies for 30 minutes at 4\u00b0 C. After an additional wash, the labeled cells are analyzed by flow cytometry on a FACScan (Becton Dickinson).","Effect on the production of cytokines. Cytokines generated by dendritic cells, in particular IL-12, are important in the initiation of T-cell dependent immune responses. IL-12 strongly influences the development of Th1 helper T-cell immune response, and induces cytotoxic T and NK cell function. An ELISA is used to measure the IL-12 release as follows. Dendritic cells (10\/ml) are treated with increasing concentrations of TR21 for 24 hours. LPS (100 ng\/ml) is added to the cell culture as positive control. Supernatants from the cell cultures are then collected and analyzed for IL-12 content using commercial ELISA kit (e.g., R & D Systems (Minneapolis, Minn.)). The standard protocols provided with the kits are used.","Effect on the expression of MHC Class II, costimulatory and adhesion molecules. Three major families of cell surface antigens can be identified on monocytes: adhesion molecules, molecules involved in antigen presentation, and Fc receptor. Modulation of the expression of MHC class II antigens and other costimulatory molecules, such as B7 and ICAM-1, may result in changes in the antigen presenting capacity of monocytes and ability to induce T cell activation. Increase expression of Fc receptors may correlate with improved monocyte cytotoxic activity, cytokine release and phagocytosis.","FACS analysis is used to examine the surface antigens as follows. Monocytes are treated 1\u20135 days with increasing concentrations of TR21 or LPS (positive control), washed with PBS containing 1% BSA and 0.02 mM sodium azide, and then incubated with 1:20 dilution of appropriate FITC- or PE-labeled monoclonal antibodies for 30 minutes at 4\u00b0 C. After an additional wash, the labeled cells are analyzed by flow cytometry on a FACScan (Becton Dickinson).","Monocyte activation and\/or increased survival. Assays for molecules that activate (or alternatively, inactivate) monocytes and\/or increase monocyte survival (or alternatively, decrease monocyte survival) are known in the art and may routinely be applied to determine whether a molecule of the invention functions as an inhibitor or activator of monocytes. TR21, agonists, or antagonists of TR21 can be screened using the three assays described below. For each of these assays, Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) are purified from single donor leukopacks (American Red Cross, Baltimore, Md.) by centrifugation through a Histopaque gradient (Sigma). Monocytes are isolated from PBMC by counterflow centrifugal elutriation.","Monocyte Survival Assay. Human peripheral blood monocytes progressively lose viability when cultured in absence of serum or other stimuli. Their death results from internally regulated process (apoptosis). Addition to the culture of activating factors, such as TNF-alpha dramatically improves cell survival and prevents DNA fragmentation. Propidium iodide (PI) staining is used to measure apoptosis as follows. Monocytes are cultured for 48 hours in polypropylene tubes in serum-free medium (positive control), in the presence of 100 ng\/ml TNF-alpha (negative control), and in the presence of varying concentrations of the compound to be tested. Cells are suspended at a concentration of 2\u00d710\/ml in PBS containing PI at a final concentration of 5 \u03bcg\/ml, and then incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes before FAC Scan analysis. PI uptake has been demonstrated to correlate with DNA fragmentation in this experimental paradigm.","Effect on cytokine release. An important function of monocytes\/macrophages is their regulatory activity on other cellular populations of the immune system through the release of cytokines after stimulation. An ELISA to measure cytokine release is performed as follows. Human monocytes are incubated at a density of 5\u00d710cells\/ml with increasing concentrations of TR21 and under the same conditions, but in the absence of TR21. For IL-12 production, the cells are primed overnight with IFN-\u03b3 (100 U\/ml) in presence of TR21. LPS (10 ng\/ml) is then added. Conditioned media are collected after 24 h and kept frozen until use. Measurement of TNF-\u03b1, IL-10, MCP-1 and IL-8 is then performed using a commercially available ELISA kit (e.g., R & D Systems (Minneapolis, Minn.)) applying the standard protocols provided with the kit.","Oxidative burst. Purified monocytes are plated in 96-well plate at 2\u22121\u00d710cell\/well. Increasing concentrations of TR21 are added to the wells in a total volume of 0.2 ml culture medium (RPMI 1640+10% FCS, glutamine and antibiotics). After 3 days incubation, the plates are centrifuged and the medium is removed from the wells. To the macrophage monolayers, 0.2 ml per well of phenol red solution (140 mM NaCl, 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.0, 5.5 mM dextrose, 0.56 mM phenol red and 19 U\/ml of HRPO) is added, together with the stimulant (200 nM PMA). The plates are incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for 2 hours and the reaction is stopped by adding 20 \u03bcl 1N NaOH per well. The absorbance is read at 610 nm. To calculate the amount of HOproduced by the macrophages, a standard curve of a HOsolution of known molarity is performed for each experiment.","The studies described in this example test the activity in TR21 protein. However, one skilled in the art could easily modify the exemplified studies to test the activity of TR21 polynucleotides (e.g., gene therapy), agonists, and\/or antagonists of TR21.","On day 1, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) are seeded at 2\u22125\u00d710cells\/35 mm dish density in M199 medium containing 4% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 16 units\/ml heparin, and 50 units\/ml endothelial cell growth supplements (ECGS, Biotechnique, Inc.). On day 2, the medium is replaced with M199 containing 10% FBS, 8 units\/ml heparin. TR21 protein of SEQ ID NO. 2, and positive controls, such as VEGF and basic FGF (bFGF) are added, at varying concentrations. On days 4 and 6, the medium is replaced. On day 8, cell number is determined with a Coulter Counter. An increase in the number of HUVEC cells indicates that TR21 may proliferate vascular endothelial cells.","The studies described in this example test the activity in TR21 protein. However, one skilled in the art could easily modify the exemplified studies to test the activity of TR21 polynucleotides (e.g., gene therapy), agonists, and\/or antagonists of TR21.","For evaluation of mitogenic activity of growth factors, the colorimetric MTS (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)H-tetrazolium) assay with the electron coupling reagent PMS (phenazine methosulfate) was performed (CellTiter 96 AQ, Promega). Cells are seeded in a 96-well plate (5,000 cells\/well) in 0.1 ml serum-supplemented medium and are allowed to attach overnight. After serum-starvation for 12 hours in 0.5% FBS, conditions (bFGF, VEGFor TR21 in 0.5% FBS) with or without Heparin (8 U\/ml) are added to wells for 48 hours. 20 mg of MTS\/PMS mixture (1:0.05) are added per well and allowed to incubate for 1 hour at 37\u00b0 C. before measuring the absorbance at 490 nm in an ELISA plate reader. Background absorbance from control wells (some media, no cells) is subtracted, and seven wells are performed in parallel for each condition.

However, one skilled in the art could easily modify the exemplified studies to test the activity of TR21 polynucleotides (e.g., gene therapy), agonists, and\/or antagonists of TR21.","HAoSMC proliferation can be measured, for example, by BrdU incorporation. Briefly, subconfluent, quiescent cells grown on the 4-chamber slides are transfected with CRP or FITC-labeled AT2-3LP. Then, the cells are pulsed with 10% calf serum and 6 mg\/ml BrdU. After 24 h, immunocytochemistry is performed using the BrdU Staining Kit (Zymed Laboratories). In brief, the cells are incubated with the biotinylated mouse anti-BrdU antibody at 4\u00b0 C. for 2 h after exposing to denaturing solution and then with the streptavidin-peroxidase and diaminobenzidine. After counterstaining with hematoxylin, the cells are mounted for microscopic examination, and the Positive-positive cells are counted. The Positive index is calculated as a percent of the Positive-positive cells to the total cell number. In addition, the simultaneous detection of the Positive staining (nucleus) and the FITC uptake (cytoplasm) is performed for individual cells by the concomitant use of bright field illumination and dark field-UV fluorescent illumination.

Polyvinylpyrrolidone-free polycarbonate filters with a pore size of 8 um (Nucleopore Corp. Cambridge, Mass.) are coated with 0.1% gelatin for at least 6 hours at room temperature and dried under sterile air. Test substances are diluted to appropriate concentrations in M199 supplemented with 0.25% bovine serum albumin (BSA), and 25 ul of the final dilution is placed in the lower chamber of the modified Boyden apparatus. Subconfluent, early passage (2\u20136) HUVEC or BMEC cultures are washed and trypsinized for the minimum time required to achieve cell detachment. After placing the filter between lower and upper chamber, 2.5\u00d710cells suspended in 50 ul M199 containing 1% FBS are seeded in the upper compartment. The apparatus is then incubated for 5 hours at 37\u00b0 C. in a humidified chamber with 5% CO2 to allow cell migration. After the incubation period, the filter is removed and the upper side of the filter with the non-migrated cells is scraped with a rubber policeman. The filters are fixed with methanol and stained with a Giemsa solution (Diff-Quick, Baxter, McGraw Park, Ill.). Migration is quantified by counting cells of three random high-power fields (40\u00d7) in each well, and all groups are performed in quadruplicate.","The studies described in this example test the activity in TR21 protein.

Calibration of the NO element is performed according to the following equation:\n\n2KNO+2KI+2HSO6 2NO+I+2HO+2KSO\n","The standard calibration curve is obtained by adding graded concentrations of KNO(0, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 250, and 500 nmol\/L) into the calibration solution containing KI and HSO. The specificity of the Iso-NO electrode to NO is previously determined by measurement of NO from authentic NO gas. The culture medium is removed and HUVECs are washed twice with Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline. The cells are then bathed in 5 ml of filtered Krebs-Henseleit solution in 6-well plates, and the cell plates are kept on a slide warmer (Lab Line Instruments Inc.) to maintain the temperature at 37\u00b0 C. The NO sensor probe is inserted vertically into the wells, keeping the tip of the electrode 2 mm under the surface of the solution, before addition of the different conditions.

The excision of the femoral artery results in retrograde propagation of thrombus and occlusion of the external iliac artery. Consequently, blood flow to the ischemic limb is dependent upon collateral vessels originating from the internal iliac artery (Takeshita, S. et al., 147:1649\u20131660 (1995)). An interval of 10 days is allowed for post-operative recovery of rabbits and development of endogenous collateral vessels. At 10 day post-operatively (day 0), after performing a baseline angiogram, the internal iliac artery of the ischemic limb is transfected with 500 mg naked TR21 expression plasmid by arterial gene transfer technology using a hydrogel-coated balloon catheter as described (Riessen, R. et al., 4:749\u2013758 (1993); Leclerc, G. et al., 90: 936\u2013944 (1992)). When TR21 is used in the treatment, a single bolus of 500 mg TR21 protein or control is delivered into the internal iliac artery of the ischemic limb over a period of 1 min. through an infusion catheter. On day 30, various parameters are measured in these rabbits: (a) BP ratio\u2014The blood pressure ratio of systolic pressure of the ischemic limb to that of normal limb; (b) Blood Flow and Flow Reserve\u2014Resting FL: the blood flow during undilated condition and Max FL: the blood flow during fully dilated condition (also an indirect measure of the blood vessel amount) and Flow Reserve is reflected by the ratio of max FL: resting FL; (c) Angiographic Score\u2014This is measured by the angiogram of collateral vessels.

Alteration of TR21 expression is investigated in situ. The experimental protocol includes:","a) The heart is exposed through a left-side thoracotomy in the rat. Immediately, the left coronary artery is occluded with a thin suture (6-0) and the thorax is closed.","b) TR21 protein, in a dosage range of 20 mg\u2013500 mg, is delivered intravenously and\/or intramuscularly 3 times (perhaps more) per week for 2\u20134 weeks.","c) Thirty days after the surgery, the heart is removed and cross-sectioned for morphometric and in situ analyzes.","The studies described in this example test the activity in TR21 protein.

Diabetic db+\/db+ Mouse Model.","To demonstrate that TR21 accelerates the healing process, the genetically diabetic mouse model of wound healing is used. The full thickness wound healing model in the db+\/db+ mouse is a well characterized, clinically relevant and reproducible model of impaired wound healing. Healing of the diabetic wound is dependent on formation of granulation tissue and re-epithelialization rather than contraction (Gartner, M. H. et al., 52:389 (1992); Greenhaigh, D. G. et al., 136:1235 (1990)).","The diabetic animals have many of the characteristic features observed in Type II diabetes mellitus. Homozygous (db+\/db+) mice are obese in comparison to their normal heterozygous (db+\/+m) littermates. Mutant diabetic (db+\/db+) mice have a single autosomal recessive mutation on chromosome 4 (db+) (Coleman et al. 77:283\u2013293 (1982)). Animals show polyphagia, polydipsia and polyuria. Mutant diabetic mice (db+\/db+) have elevated blood glucose, increased or normal insulin levels, and suppressed cell-mediated immunity (Mandel et al., 120:1375 (1978); Debray-Sachs, M. et al., 51(1):1\u20137 (1983); Leiter et al., 114:46\u201355 (1985)). Peripheral neuropathy, myocardial complications, and microvascular lesions, basement membrane thickening and glomerular filtration abnormalities have been described in these animals (Norido, F. et al., 83(2):221\u2013232 (1984); Robertson et al., 29(1):60\u201367 (1980); Giacomelli et al., 40(4):460\u2013473 (1979); Coleman, D. L., 31 (Suppl):1\u20136 (1982)). These homozygous diabetic mice develop hyperglycemia that is resistant to insulin analogous to human type II diabetes (Mandel et al., 120:1375\u20131377 (1978)).","The characteristics observed in these animals suggests that healing in this model may be similar to the healing observed in human diabetes (Greenhalgh, et al., 136:1235\u20131246 (1990)).","Genetically diabetic female C57BL\/KsJ (db+\/db+) mice and their non-diabetic (db+\/+m) heterozygous littermates are used in this study (Jackson Laboratories). The animals are purchased at 6 weeks of age and were 8 weeks old at the beginning of the study. Animals are individually housed and received food and water ad libitum. All manipulations are performed using aseptic techniques. The experiments are conducted according to the rules and guidelines of Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and the Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.","Wounding protocol is performed according to previously reported methods (Tsuboi, R. and Rifkin, D. B., 172:245\u2013251 (1990)). Briefly, on the day of wounding, animals are anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of Avertin (0.01 mg\/mL), 2,2,2-tribromoethanol and 2-methyl-2-butanol dissolved in deionized water. The dorsal region of the animal is shaved and the skin washed with 70% ethanol solution and iodine. The surgical area is dried with sterile gauze prior to wounding. An 8 mm full-thickness wound is then created using a Keyes tissue punch. Immediately following wounding, the surrounding skin is gently stretched to eliminate wound expansion. The wounds are left open for the duration of the experiment. Application of the treatment is given typically for 5 consecutive days commencing on the day of wounding. Prior to treatment, wounds are gently cleansed with sterile saline and gauze sponges.","Wounds are visually examined and photographed at a fixed distance at the day or surgery and at two day intervals thereafter. Wound closure is determined by daily measurement on days 1\u20135 and on day 8. Wounds are measured horizontally and vertically using a calibrated Jameson caliper. Wounds are considered healed if granulation tissue is no longer visible and the wound is covered by a continuous epithelium.","TR21 is administered using at a range different doses of TR21, from 4 mg to 500 mg per wound per day for 8 days in vehicle. Vehicle control groups received 50 mL of vehicle solution.","Animals are euthanized on day 8 with an intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital (300 mg\/kg). The wounds and surrounding skin are then harvested for histology and immunohistochemistry. Tissue specimens are placed in 10% neutral buffered formalin in tissue cassettes between biopsy sponges for further processing.","Three groups of 10 animals each (5 diabetic and 5 non-diabetic controls) are evaluated: 1) Vehicle placebo control, 2) TR21.","Wound closure is analyzed by measuring the area in the vertical and horizontal axis and obtaining the total square area of the wound. Contraction is then estimated by establishing the differences between the initial wound area (day 0) and that of post treatment (day 8). The wound area on day 1 was 64 mm, the corresponding size of the dermal punch. Calculations were made using the following formula:\n\n[Open area on day 8]\u2212[Open area on day 1]\/[Open area on day 1]\n","Specimens are fixed in 10% buffered formalin and paraffin embedded blocks are sectioned perpendicular to the wound surface (5 mm) and cut using a Reichert-Jung microtome. Routine hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining is performed on cross-sections of bisected wounds. Histologic examination of the wounds are used to assess whether the healing process and the morphologic appearance of the repaired skin is altered by treatment with TR21. This assessment included verification of the presence of cell accumulation, inflammatory cells, capillaries, fibroblasts, re-epithelialization and epidermal maturity (Greenhalgh, D. G. et al., 136:1235 (1990)). A calibrated lens micrometer is used by a blinded observer.","Tissue sections are also stained immunohistochemically with a polyclonal rabbit anti-human keratin antibody using ABC Elite detection system. Human skin is used as a positive tissue control while non-immune IgG is used as a negative control. Keratinocyte growth is determined by evaluating the extent of reepithelialization of the wound using a calibrated lens micrometer.","Proliferating cell nuclear antigen\/cyclin (PCNA) in skin specimens is demonstrated by using anti-PCNA antibody (1:50) with an ABC Elite detection system. Human colon cancer served as a positive tissue control and human brain tissue is used as a negative tissue control. Each specimen included a section with omission of the primary antibody and substitution with non-immune mouse IgG. Ranking of these sections is based on the extent of proliferation on a scale of 0\u20138, the lower side of the scale reflecting slight proliferation to the higher side reflecting intense proliferation.","Experimental data are analyzed using an unpaired t test. A p value of <0.05 is considered significant.","B. Steroid Impaired Rat Model","The inhibition of wound healing by steroids has been well documented in various in vitro and in vivo systems (Wahl, S. M. Glucocorticoids and Wound healing. In: Anti-Inflammatory Steroid Action: Basic and Clinical Aspects. 280\u2013302 (1989); Wahl, S. M. et al., 115: 476\u2013481 (1975); Werb, Z. et al., 147:1684\u20131694 (1978)). Glucocorticoids retard wound healing by inhibiting angiogenesis, decreasing vascular permeability (Ebert, R. H., et al., 37:701\u2013705 (1952)), fibroblast proliferation, and collagen synthesis (Beck, L. S. et al., 5: 295\u2013304 (1991); Haynes, B. F. et al., 61: 703\u2013797 (1978)) and producing a transient reduction of circulating monocytes (Haynes, B. F., et al., 61: 703\u2013797 (1978); Wahl, S. M., \u201cGlucocorticoids and wound healing\u201d, In: Anti-inflammatory Steroid Action: Basic and Clinical Aspects, Academic Press, New York, pp. 280\u2013302 (1989)). The systemic administration of steroids to impaired wound healing is a well establish phenomenon in rats (Beck, L. S. et al., 5: 295\u2013304 (1991); Haynes, B. F., et al., 61: 703\u2013797 (1978); Wahl, S. M., \u201cGlucocorticoids and wound healing\u201d, In: Anti-inflammatory Steroid Action: Basic and Clinical Aspects, Academic Press, New York, pp. 280\u2013302 (1989); Pierce, G. F. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86: 2229\u20132233 (1989)).","To demonstrate that TR21 can accelerate the healing process, the effects of multiple topical applications of TR21 on full thickness excisional skin wounds in rats in which healing has been impaired by the systemic administration of methylprednisolone is assessed.","Young adult male Sprague Dawley rats weighing 250\u2013300 g (Charles River Laboratories) are used in this example. The animals are purchased at 8 weeks of age and were 9 weeks old at the beginning of the study. The healing response of rats is impaired by the systemic administration of methylprednisolone (17 mg\/kg\/rat intramuscularly) at the time of wounding. Animals are individually housed and received food and water ad libitum. All manipulations are performed using aseptic techniques. This study is conducted according to the rules and guidelines of Human Genome Sciences, Inc. Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and the Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.","The wounding protocol is followed according to section A, above. On the day of wounding, animals are anesthetized with an intramuscular injection of ketamine (50 mg\/kg) and xylazine (5 mg\/kg). The dorsal region of the animal is shaved and the skin washed with 70% ethanol and iodine solutions. The surgical area is dried with sterile gauze prior to wounding. An 8 mm full-thickness wound is created using a Keyes tissue punch. The wounds are left open for the duration of the experiment. Applications of the testing materials are given topically once a day for 7 consecutive days commencing on the day of wounding and subsequent to methylprednisolone administration. Prior to treatment, wounds are gently cleansed with sterile saline and gauze sponges.","Wounds are visually examined and photographed at a fixed distance at the day of wounding and at the end of treatment. Wound closure is determined by daily measurement on days 1\u20135 and on day 8. Wounds are measured horizontally and vertically using a calibrated Jameson caliper. Wounds are considered healed if granulation tissue was no longer visible and the wound is covered by a continuous epithelium.","TR21 is administered using at a range different doses of TR21, from 4 mg to 500 mg per wound per day for 8 days in vehicle.

The wounds and surrounding skin are then harvested for histology. Tissue specimens are placed in 10% neutral buffered formalin in tissue cassettes between biopsy sponges for further processing.","Four groups of 10 animals each (5 with methylprednisolone and 5 without glucocorticoid) were evaluated: 1) Untreated group 2) Vehicle placebo control 3) TR21 treated groups.","Wound closure is analyzed by measuring the area in the vertical and horizontal axis and obtaining the total area of the wound. Closure is then estimated by establishing the differences between the initial wound area (day 0) and that of post treatment (day 8). The wound area on day 1 was 64 mm, the corresponding size of the dermal punch. Calculations were made using the following formula:\n\n[Open area on day 8]\u2212[Open area on day 1]\/[Open area on day 1]\n","Specimens are fixed in 10% buffered formalin and paraffin embedded blocks are sectioned perpendicular to the wound surface (5 mm) and cut using an Olympus microtome. Routine hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining was performed on cross-sections of bisected wounds. Histologic examination of the wounds allows assessment of whether the healing process and the morphologic appearance of the repaired skin was improved by treatment with TR21. A calibrated lens micrometer is used by a blinded observer to determine the distance of the wound gap.","Experimental data are analyzed using an unpaired t test. A p value of <0.05 is considered significant.","The studies described in this example test the activity in TR21 protein., However, one skilled in the art could easily modify the exemplified studies to test the activity of TR21 polynucleotides (e.g., gene therapy), agonists, and\/or antagonists of TR21.","The purpose of this experimental approach is to create an appropriate and consistent lymphedema model for testing the therapeutic effects of TR21 in lymphangiogenesis and re-establishment of the lymphatic circulatory system in the rat hind limb. Effectiveness is measured by swelling volume of the affected limb, quantification of the amount of lymphatic vasculature, total blood plasma protein, and histopathology. Acute lymphedema is observed for 7\u201310 days. Perhaps more importantly, the chronic progress of the edema is followed for up to 3\u20134 weeks.","Prior to beginning surgery, blood sample is drawn for protein concentration anaylsis. Male rats weighing approximately \u02dc350 g are dosed with Pentobarbital. Subsequently, the right legs are shaved from knee to hip. The shaved area is swabbed with gauze soaked in 70% EtOH. Blood is drawn for serum total protein testing. Circumference and volumetric measurements are made prior to injecting dye into paws after marking 2 measurement levels (0.5 cm above heel, at mid-pt of dorsal paw). The intradermal dorsum of both right and left paws are injected with 0.05 ml of 1% Evan's Blue. Circumference and volumetric measurements are then made following injection of dye into paws.","Using the knee joint as a landmark, a mid-leg inguinal incision is made circumferentially allowing the femoral vessels to be located. Forceps and hemostats are used to dissect and separate the skin flaps. After locating the femoral vessels, the lymphatic vessel that runs along side and underneath the vessel(s) is located. The main lymphatic vessels in this area are then electrically coagulated or suture ligated.","Using a microscope, muscles in back of the leg (near the semitendinosis and adductors) are bluntly dissected. The popliteal lymph node is then located.","The 2 proximal and 2 distal lymphatic vessels and distal blood supply of the popliteal node are then and ligated by suturing. The popliteal lymph node, and any accompanying adipose tissue, is then removed by cutting connective tissues.","Care is taken to control any mild bleeding resulting from this procedure. After lymphatics are occluded, the skin flaps are sealed by using liquid skin (Vetbond) (A J Buck). The separated skin edges are sealed to the underlying muscle tissue while leaving a gap of \u02dc0.5 cm around the leg. Skin also may be anchored by suturing to underlying muscle when necessary.","To avoid infection, animals are housed individually with mesh (no bedding). Recovering animals are checked daily through the optimal edematous peak, which typically occurred by day 5\u20137. The plateau edematous peak are then observed. To evaluate the intensity of the lymphedema, the circumference and volumes of 2 designated places on each paw before operation and daily for 7 days are measured. The effect plasma proteins on lymphedema is determined and whether protein analysis is a useful testing perimeter is also investigated. The weights of both control and edematous limbs are evaluated at 2 places. Analysis is performed in a blind manner.","Circumference Measurements: Under brief gas anesthetic to prevent limb movement, a cloth tape is used to measure limb circumference. Measurements are done at the ankle bone and dorsal paw by 2 different people then those 2 readings are averaged. Readings are taken from both control and edematous limbs.","Volumetric Measurements: On the day of surgery, animals are anesthetized with Pentobarbital and are tested prior to surgery. For daily volumetrics animals are under brief halothane anesthetic (rapid immobilization and quick recovery), both legs are shaved and equally marked using waterproof marker on legs. Legs are first dipped in water, then dipped into instrument to each marked level then measured by Buxco edema software(Chen\/Victor). Data is recorded by one person, while the other is dipping the limb to marked area.","Blood-plasma protein measurements: Blood is drawn, spun, and serum separated prior to surgery and then at conclusion for total protein and Ca2+ comparison.","Limb Weight Comparison: After drawing blood, the animal is prepared for tissue collection. The limbs were amputated using a guillotine, then both experimental and control legs were cut at the ligature and weighed. A second weighing is done as the tibio-cacaneal joint was disarticulated and the foot was weighed.","Histological Preparations: The transverse muscle located behind the knee (popliteal) area is dissected and arranged in a metal mold, filled with freezeGel, dipped into cold methylbutane, placed into labeled sample bags at \u221280EC until sectioning. Upon sectioning, the muscle was observed under fluorescent microscopy for lymphatics. Other immuno\/histological methods are currently being evaluated.","The studies described in this example test the activity in TR21 protein.
