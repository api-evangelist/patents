title: Method and apparatus for call recovery in a wireless communication system
abstract: A method and apparatus for call recovery in a wireless communication system (). When the communication link between a mobile station () and a base station () is in trouble, the mobile station and the infrastructure prearrange potential rescue base stations (). The source cell base station contacts all recovery-capable neighbors as potential rescuers. Each rescue base station is instructed to use a default channel for rescue transmissions. The rescue transmission is considered a call recovery operation. The mobile station establishes a soft hand-off with rescue base station, wherein the FL uses the default channel and an alternate channel. Once hand-off is complete the rescue base station discontinues use of the default channel. In one embodiment, the source cell base station provides the mobile station with the list of recovery-capable neighbors as overhead during transmissions and prior to development of the communication link problem.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["REFERENCE TO CO-PENDING APPLICATIONS","FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The present invention is related to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60\/251,537 filed on Dec. 5, 2000, entitled \u201cCALL RECOVERY,\u201d having assigned to the assignee hereof and hereby expressly incorporated by reference.","The present invention relates to wireless voice and data communication. More particularly, the present invention relates to a novel and improved method and apparatus for call recovery in a wireless communication system.","A wireless communication system typically includes a plurality of Base Stations (BSs), each associated with a cell and\/or sector, communicating with multiple Mobile Stations (MSs). The base stations are controlled by a Base Station Controller (BSC). As a mobile station moves throughout the system the quality of signals received from the base stations fluctuates. When a communication link between a base station and a given mobile station deteriorates, it is possible to prevent losing the communication by establishing a link with at least one other base station. A hand-off process provides for initiation of such alternate communication link(s). In a hand-off situation, the infrastructure negotiates with the various base stations and the mobile station. However, often the signal quality deteriorates too quickly for negotiation to proceed.","There is a need, therefore, for a method and apparatus for call recovery in a variety of situations. Further, there is a need for an reliable method for call recovery in a wireless communication system.","The disclosed embodiments provide a novel and improved method for recovery distressed calls in a wireless communication system. According to one aspect, in a wireless communication system having a plurality of base stations, each of the plurality of base stations having a neighbor set comprising neighboring base stations, each of the neighboring base stations having a default channel, a method includes transmitting default channel information to a mobile station; detecting occurrence of a call recovery trigger; and instructing all base stations in the neighbor set to transmit on respective default channels.","In one aspect, a wireless apparatus includes an antenna; a processor coupled to the antenna; transmit circuitry coupled to the antenna and the processor; receiver circuitry coupled to the antenna and the processor; a first set of computer readable instructions executable by the processor to receive a list of neighbors for a base station, the list including default channel assignments for each of the neighbors; a second set of computer readable instructions executable by the processor to identify a call recovery trigger and disable a transmit circuitry in response; and a third set of computer readable instructions executable by the processor to establish hand-off with at least one of the neighbors.","In another aspect, a wireless apparatus includes a transmitter circuit; a recovery adjust unit operative subsequent to a call recovery operation to generate a predetermined power control instruction; and a power adjust unit coupled to the recovery adjust unit and the transmitter circuit, the power adjust unit operative to adjust the transmitter circuit in response to the power control instruction.","In still another aspect, a computer program is embodied on a computer-readable medium containing computer-executable instructions, wherein the program includes a first set of instructions operative to identify a special event; a second set of instructions operative to disable call recovery during the special event; and a third set of instructions operative to notify a wireless communication system of the special event.","A method for call recovery in a wireless system according to one embodiment provides information regarding neighboring cells and\/or sectors that are available and capable of call recovery for a mobile station that is potentially at risk for losing a communication link. Each of the call recovery-capable base stations has a default forward call recovery channel, identified by a predetermined code. In another embodiment, more than one default forward call recovery channel is assigned per neighbor and the mobile station uses a hash function with IMSI (International Mobile Station Identification), TIMSI (Temporary International Mobile Station Identification), ESN (Electronic Serial Number), system time, or a combination thereof to deterministically decide which channels to use to receive transmissions from each recovery-capable base station. The mobile station then may use that channel to receive signals from a recovery base station. The mobile station may be instructed to combine the power control subchannels from multiple neighboring recovery base stations by overhead messages as the mobile station accesses the base station. This may also occur as the mobile station moves into the coverage area of the base station while the mobile station is in an idle state, i.e. without continuous communication links, by traffic channel messages on call initiation, or upon hand-off when the active set changes for the mobile station.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","12","14","16","18","20","22","24","12","14","16","18","20","22","24","26","12","14","16","18","20","22","24","18","12","14","16","20","22","24"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["10","32","1","38","1","32","18","34","36","2","3","16","24","1","32","38","38","1","32","38","10","1","32","38","1","32","2","34","3","36"]},"Signal quality is generally measured as Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) and may be expressed as pilot signal energy per chip to total received power density (E\/I).  illustrates a plot of signal quality as measured at MS  for BS  and BS . The signal quality for BS  begins to increase at time t and continues to increase above a threshold level, labeled T_ADD, by time t. The threshold level, T_ADD, provides a reference signal quality above which MS  is instructed to notify the base station to add a base station to its Active Set (AS). The AS is made up of base stations that are actively communicating with MS , both transmitting and receiving communications. The AS is typically selected from base stations that are in a Candidate Set (CS). The CS includes base stations that are candidates to become active communicators with MS . The CS is typically selected from base stations in the Neighbor Set (NS).","Continuing with , while the signal quality of BS  is improving, the signal quality of BS  is deteriorating. The increase in the energy level of the signals received from BS  add to the deterioration of the signals from BS , as the signal quality for a given base station is a comparison of the signal energy from that base station to all other signals present. At time t, MS  measures the signal energy of BS  above T_ADD. This indicates to the MS  that appropriate action is required, i.e., is a trigger for hand-off. At time t MS  transmits to BS  and BSC  a Pilot Strength Measurement Message (PSMM) containing measurement information for both BS  and BS . At time t, BSC  sets up a link from BSC  to BS  for MS . The BSC  contains a selector. The BSC  sets up a communication link forming a \u201cback haul\u201d communication network between the BS , BS  and BSC  with respect to MS . At time t BS  sends a Handoff Direction Message (HDM) containing information identifying BS  and BS  and their associated code indices for the Forward Link (FL) channels from BS  and BS . This information allows MS  to receive and demodulate signals from both BS  and BS . At time t MS  receives the HDM from BS  and begins to demodulate signals from BS  in addition to those from BS . Note that in this example there is only one new base station involved in the handoff. However, there may be any number of base stations involved in such a handoff situation, wherein those base stations communicating with MS  form an AS. When the MS  receives signals, including symbols, from multiple base stations in the AS, MS  may combine these signals resulting in a stronger signal. The combination process is referred to as \u201csoft combination\u201d of the FL and is usually carried out in optimal ratio combining, i.e., with weighting based on signal quality. At time t the MS  sends an acknowledgement for the HDM received from BS  or an Handoff Completion Message (HCM) indicating the successful completion of the handoff.","Referring again to , a situation may arise wherein the signal quality of BS  increases too quickly. In this case, the signal strength of BS  with respect to that of BS  encourages deterioration of the signal quality of BS . The MS  is hindered from communicating with the infrastructure prior to receiving information necessary for hand-off, such as the Pseudorandom Noise (PN) offset necessary to identify BS  or the channel used by BS  for MS .","In a typical CDMA hand-off process, as a mobile station moves from the coverage area of one base station to the coverage area of another base station, hand-off prevents loss of the communication link. In one type of hand-off, soft hand-off, the mobile station simultaneously maintains connections with two or more base stations. The current location of the mobile station may be considered the source cell, while the next cell that the mobile station moves to may be referred to as the target cell. The mobile station uses a rake type receiver to demodulates the multiple signals received on the FL of the multiple base stations. The two signals are combined resulting in a composite signal with improved quality. While each of the multiple base stations involved in soft hand-off demodulates the signal received separately, each sends the demodulated and decoded information to a BSC. The BSC contains a selector that selects the best frame from the multiple frames received. Other types of hand-off may be used for a variety of conditions and system requirements.","In Mobile-Assisted Hand-Off (MAHO), the mobile station makes a measurement of the signal quality for the FL pilot signals from multiple mobile stations. This information is reported to the source base station. The signal qualities are compared to various thresholds to make decisions for adding base stations to the AS. If the signal quality of a given pilot is greater than a pilot detection threshold, T_ADD, then the pilot is added to the AS. In an alternate embodiment, the pilot may be added to the CS first and then to the AS. In effect, the threshold allows for transfer of the status of a base station from one set to another.","Call recovery provides information to the mobile station ahead of time, in the case when hand-off negotiation is not possible. Call recovery is initiated in a variety of situations. In normal operation the mobile station and the base station use triggers to determine their proper operation. For example, mobile stations operating within system  use a variety of thresholds for decision making with regard to what information is reported back to the base station. One threshold, discussed hereinabove, T_ADD, indicates a signal quality level for adding a base station to the AS. When the mobile station receives a signal that measures above T_ADD, the mobile station moves that base station into the CS, searches more frequently for that base station, and reports this condition to the system through its existing AS. Another threshold, T_DROP, provides a signal quality level below which a base station will be dropped from the AS. When the mobile station receives a signal that measures below T_DROP for a duration longer than T_TDROP, the mobile station reports this condition to the system through the existing AS. In each case, the base stations in the AS relay this information to a base station controller.","For call recovery, the base station in an AS looks for any of a variety of possible triggers. A first type of call recovery trigger occurs when the FL signal quality is below a threshold level for a duration longer than another threshold. This type of trigger includes when the base station receives continuous Power Control (PC) requests from the mobile station to increase the transmit level at the base station. Often the base station is already transmitting to the mobile station at a maximum ceiling power level. For example, the FL traffic transmission is maintained at a high level for a predetermined time period. The mobile station may send many requests to increase the power, i.e., UP commands. Alternately, the mobile station may report an abundance of erasures. An erasure occurs when more than a threshold level of bits are received without confidence of the intended value. In another case, the mobile station transmits messages indicating to the base station that its outer loop set-point is high or at its maximum allowed level, or at those levels for an extended time.","A second type of trigger occurs when a certain response is expected from the mobile station, but no response, or a different response, is received. This type of trigger includes lack of acknowledgement from the mobile station to a message sent by the base station that requires an acknowledgement. The message may be re-sent a predetermined number of times prior to satisfying the trigger. This predetermined number may be fixed or variable and changeable over the air. Similarly, the base station may receive repeated RL messages from the mobile station that require an acknowledgement, wherein the messages are received subsequent to base station transmission of an acknowledgement.","A third type of trigger relates to low quality of the reverse link, e.g., when the Frame Error Rate (FER) of the RL is above a threshold level. Alternately, the RL may be maintained at a high level for a predetermined time period. Still another situation may have a high RL set-point. The base station to be added to an AS also has call recovery triggers that initiate recovery action. The most significant trigger is a notification from the BSC that a potential problem exists with a given mobile station. On such an occurrence, the base station begins to search for signals from the mobile station.","The mobile station may also use a variety of call recovery triggers to enter call recovery. A first type of trigger occurs when there are abnormal number of errors in the received signals. For example, FL erasures over a moving window may exceed a predetermined threshold level. In one embodiment, the threshold level is 12 consecutive frames experiencing erasure. In this case, the mobile station will turn off the transmitter portion of the mobile station, and may turn the transmitter back on when at least two FL consecutive frames have no erasures.","A second type of recovery trigger for the mobile station occurs when the mobile station receives PC commands from the base instructing increases in power. The base station may be having difficulty receiving the RL signals due to large path losses from the mobile station.","A third type of recovery trigger occurs when one or more RL messages that require acknowledgement from the base station are not being acknowledged. This is referred to as retransmission retry trigger. Similarly, there may be an inappropriate response or no response from the base station to a message from the mobile station. A similar type of trigger occurs on receipt of repeated FL messages requiring an acknowledgement, subsequent to the mobile station actually transmitting the acknowledgement.","A fourth type of recovery trigger occurs when the mobile station transmits at a high level for a predetermined time period. In this case it is assumed that the RL is not getting through to the base station with sufficient energy.","In one embodiment, flexible thresholds are implemented for the one or multiple of the various call recovery triggers. The call recovery triggers may be based on multiple attempts to transmit within a system . These attempts are often made in the link layer between signaling and the physical link. The link layer is referred to as Layer , and is discussed hereinbelow with respect to . In recovery-capable systems, such as system  of , MS  performs a recovery procedure to maintain a call when the communication link, such as the FL, is deteriorating. A trigger often initiates a recovery operation, wherein the trigger indicates when a parameter or metric passes a threshold. These thresholds may be dynamic, adapting to conditions of the system  and environment. Similarly, the thresholds may be adjusted based on a history or statistical record of operation of the system .","In one embodiment, the number of repeated transmissions on the RL, or the time between consecutive erasures, or the disabling of MS  transmitter may be in response to an instruction transmitted from the system  infrastructure, such as BS  and\/or BSC . In an alternate embodiment, a fixed parameter is defined for the particular action, such as a specified maximum number of allowable retransmissions. In another embodiment, the mobile condition and\/or location provides a trigger. The proximity of the current transmit level of MS  to a predetermined maximum value may trigger call recovery. Other triggers include the quality of the FL as measured by erasures of transmissions in the current AS, a deficit in inner loop power control, wherein the MS  desired SNR is different from that provided by the inner loop, etc. Still other embodiments may combine the specific parameter and the mobile condition as triggers.","The system  infrastructure may provide the MS  with operational type information helpful in determining the thresholds of call recovery triggers, and may use such information in selecting fixed parameters provided to the MS  to use as trigger thresholds. In one embodiment, the typical number of re-tries by call that are experiencing trouble or have been dropped. An alternate embodiment uses the loading of the RL to set and adjust thresholds. Still alternate embodiments may use the location of MS  within the system , such as the sector of a given cell. Still other embodiments consider the day of the week and\/or time of day in coordination with known mobile traffic patterns. A combination of any of these mechanisms may also be implemented where applicable or needed.","In the system , of , each base station, , ,  transmits overhead information to mobile stations with which it communicates. The overhead information for each BS , ,  includes its respective neighbor list. The neighbor list identifies the corresponding Pseudorandom Noise (PN) code offsets of the neighbors.","Referring to , BSC  responds to any of the variety of triggers by setting up a backhaul connection with BS  and BS . In accordance with one embodiment, method  of call recovery is initiated as illustrated in . The particular signal quality plot for one example is illustrated in . In this example, there is time to identify MS  as having a potential problem.","In the call recovery method  of one embodiment, illustrated in , at step  BS  sends default channel assignments for the set of neighboring base station(s) to MS . The base stations in the neighbor set are recovery-capable units, having the necessary software and\/or hardware to implement a call recovery and having coverage area(s) overlapping that of the base station sending the neighbor set. The default channel assignments identify the default channel code index used by base stations within the neighbor set, including the code for BS . Each of the base stations in the neighbor set that are recovery-capable have a default spreading code that will be used to identify a mobile station in need of call recovery. The spreading code of one embodiment is a specific Walsh code. The BS  sends a retransmission retry trigger to the MS  at step . The retransmission retry trigger dictates the number of retries that the MS  is to allow prior to initiating call recovery operations. The BS  then determines if a recovery trigger has occurred at decision diamond . If a recovery trigger has not occurred, processing waits for occurrence of a trigger. On the occurrence of a trigger, processing continues to step  to instruct all base stations in the NS of BS  to transmit on their respective default channels corresponding to the MS . Note that some of the base stations within the NS may not be able to establish a communication link due to the weakness of the FL or RL, however, each base station within the NS begins to transmit to the MS . The multiple transmissions provide a stronger FL signal at the MS  and a more reliable RL to BSC .","Note that according to the present embodiment, the number of retries of an RL message, or the amount of time allowed for consecutive erasures, are determined by the BSC  and provided to the MS  via radio link dedicated messages and broadcasts. An alternate embodiment uses a fixed parameter, distinct from other parameters. One embodiment incorporates a function of the mobile conditions. Mobile conditions may consider how close the actual transmission level of MS  is in comparison to a maximum transmit level. Similarly, another mobile condition considers the quality of the FL, such as erasures on the current AS. Still another mobile condition considers an inner loop deficit. The inner loop deficit is the difference between a target SNR and the SNR delivered by the inner loop PC. Another embodiment combines the mobile condition with the type of transmission.","The allowable number of retries may be adjusted according to statistics relating to dropped calls or troubled calls. For example, there may be an average number of retries above which a majority of troubled calls do not recover. Other considerations include the RL loading, the location of MS , and\/or the time of day, or date. In the latter case, certain mobile traffic patterns affect the number of mobiles requiring a fast call recovery.","Continuing with , the BSC  determines the current AS of MS at step . The BSC  then initializes an HDM timer at step  and transmits the HDM at step . At this point, the system  desires to move the communication links off the default channels. The default channels are available for use by any of the mobile stations within system  and therefore, use is to be optimized. While MS  utilizes a given default channel, that channel is not available for use by another mobile station. The base stations in the NS are instructed to initiate transmissions on an alternate or new channel in parallel with the transmissions on the default channel. This is the initiation of a hand-off condition.","If the BSC  has received a message from the MS  indicating the hand-off is complete at decision diamond , processing continues to step  to discontinue the MS  communication links with members of the NS on the default channels. Processing then continues to step . Conversely, if the hand-off complete message is not received, the BSC  checks if the HDM timer has expired at decision diamond . If the HDM timer has expired, the appropriate default channel terminates transmissions to MS , call recovery is cancelled at step , and usage of both the default channel and the new channel is discontinued at step . The normal operation resumes at step . If the timer has not expired at decision diamond , processing returns to wait for the hand-off complete message from MS  at decision diamond .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 6B","b":["100","110","130","26","38","132","134","138","130","144","132"]},"After the AS is set at step , if the RL is to be enhanced at decision diamond , BSC  determines if there are any neighbors not included in the PSMM that have acquired the MS  signal(s) at decision diamond . These neighbors are referred to as Hearing Neighbors (HN), and are added to the AS at step . Processing then returns to step  of .","If the timer expired without receiving a PSMM, BSC  determines, at decision diamond , if any neighbors acquired the RL MS  signal(s), i.e., HN. In this case, the AS is set to include these HN at step . If no HN is found at decision diamond , then call recovery terminates at step  and the call is terminated.","At decision diamond , the method determines if the transmitter of MS  is turned off. If the transmitter is off, the BSC  instructs the MS  to turn the transmitter on at step .","A mobile station call recovery method  for one embodiment is illustrated in . At step  the MS  communicates with base stations in the AS(). This identifies the current AS. If a recovery trigger has occurred at decision diamond , processing continues to decision diamond . The recovery trigger could be one of those discussed hereinabove, or an alternate indication that the MS  requires a rescue type operation, i.e., MS  is probably losing the FL communication link. If no trigger occurs, normal operation resumes at step . Decision diamond  determines if the transmitter of MS  is enabled. If the transmitter is enabled, processing continues to step , and if not, the MS  checks for a trigger condition at decision diamond . If a trigger condition exists that indicates MS  is to disable the transmitter, then appropriate action is taken at step  and processing continues to step . If no trigger indicates that the transmitter is to be disabled, then processing continues to step . At step  a wait timer is set. The wait timer is checked at decision diamond , and on expiration the recovery timer is started at step . If the wait timer has not expired, then processing continues to determine if the MS  has returned to a normal operating mode at decision diamond . Normal operation continues from step , else processing returns to wait for expiration of the wait timer.","Continuing with , from step  if the transmitter of MS  is disabled, at step  the transmitter is enabled. The MS  transmits a predetermined preamble for time period Y. The preamble provides information about the MS  transmission but no actual data or symbols. The MS  transmits the PSMM information at step . At decision diamond , if the HDM is received or if some acknowledgement is received confirming the PSMM, the MS  proceeds to wait a predetermined time period X, after which the AS is updated. If no HDM or PSMM acknowledgement is received at decision diamond , processing continues to decision diamond  to check that the PSMM has not been transmitted more than a maximum allowable number of times. If the PSMM can be resent, i.e., the maximum has not been reached, processing returns to step  and the PSMM is resent. However, if the maximum has been reached, processing continues to step  and the call recovery is terminated.","According to an alternate method of call recovery, BSC  notifies all of the recovery-capable neighbors of BS  of a potential problem. The BSC instructs the MS  to turn on the transmitter portion of MS  and instructs the base station(s) in the neighbor set to listen for the MS . On detection or acquisition of a signal from MS  each base station in the neighbor set transmits a report. The reports are received from a subset of base stations, wherein the subset may include all base stations in the neighbor set or a portion of base stations. The BSC  notifies the MS  of the default channels of each base station in the subset. The base stations of the subset then use the appropriate default channel to initiate communication with MS .","In still another method, a subset of the neighbor set is determined based on a most recently transmitted PSMM. A problem exists in that the last transmitted PSMM may not have been received correctly, in which case the PSMM used to identify the subset is incorrect. As an example, when the last received PSMM identifies BS  and BS , but MS  sent a subsequent PSMM identifying BS  and BS  that was not received, call recovery is thwarted. The BSC  sets up a backhaul network with BS  and BS  begins transmissions to MS  on a default channel. Unfortunately, MS  assumes that communication will be established with BS  for call recovery and prepares to except on a different default channel. The excess transmission from BS  is wasted and effectively creates more noise in the system .","When the call recovery is initiated by the MS , a timer may be used to delay such initiation subsequent to occurrence of a call recovery trigger. The time period of the timer may be sets by the BSC . On expiration of the timer, the MS  transmits a preamble on a RL pilot channel. The preamble includes a call recovery message. In one embodiment, the preamble is a predetermined constant that may be set by BSC . In an alternate embodiment, the preamble is a variable length determined by the system operator. Subsequent to transmission of the preamble, MS  sends a message regarding the FL change(s). The message may be a PSMM. The message may be sent a number of times to ensure receipt by BS .","Combinations of the above methods provide various advantages for call recovery. In one embodiment, a call recovery method is based on the radio transmission environment of the source cell base station. When the number of neighbors that are recovery-capable is small, e.g. 2, the BSC  will instruct all of the neighbors to transmit on respective default channels. The AS is updated and the MS  transmitter is enabled without a delay. For larger sets of neighbors that are recovery-capable, the BSC  will instruct the neighbors to listen for signals from MS . After a delay incurred in waiting for the neighbors to report on whether they can receive signals from MS , those hearing neighbors are instructed to use the default channels. Similarly, if a PSMM is received from MS  within a predetermined time period, those base stations identified by the PSMM are instructed to use default channels. Note that when the FL is operating properly, as defined by a fixed number of consecutive good frames, the PC commands sent via the PC subchannel are considered valid.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 1"],"b":["10","700","702","704","706","702","708","710","712","702","704","714","716","712","714","704","702","706","716","722","704","702","706","706","724"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 1","FIGS. 6A"],"b":["10","6","7","1","32","38","38","2","34","38","38","0","38","1","32","1","38","1","32","38","1","32","38","1","32","38","1","32","38","1","32"],"sub":["1 ","2"]},"When the trigger is identified at time t, the BSC  initiates a default channel transmission from the neighbor BS . At time t BS  begins transmitting on the default channel to MS . The transmission is parallel with the same transmission from BS . On occurrence of the trigger, the MS  disables the transmitter for a predetermined wait time period. At time t the wait period ends and the MS  transmits the preamble for a time period Y. At the same time, the AS of MS  is changed from AS() to AS(). The base stations identified in the AS() are all the base stations cited in the last PSMM. In an alternate embodiment, the AS() may be all of the neighbors of BS  and BS  itself.","At time t the preamble terminates, and the MS  begins transmitting the current PSMM. In response to receipt of the PSMM at time t, the BS  and the BS  transmit an HDM at time t. The HDM signals the change of the AS to AS() at time t. Note that a next PSMM is sent at time t, wherein PSMM are sent periodically or continuously to identify signals received at the MS .","At time t, the BS  begins transmission on the new channel for MS . The MS  transmits an HCM which triggers the termination of transmissions for MS  on the default channel at time t. In one embodiment, the HCM is transmitted periodically or continuously until its correct reception is acknowledged by the base station. In the scenario illustrated in , call recovery begins at time t and terminates at time t. At time t hand-off is completed and BS  is current source cell base station for MS .","An alternate scenario is illustrated for receiver channel Rx. Here the AS() remains active until time t. Subsequent to time t, the MS  continues to receive from AS() for a predetermined time period X, after which there is a change to AS(). This allows for extra time for the base station side to determine on a subset of the recovery-capable neighbors of BS  for the transmission to MS  for recovery. At time t there is a subsequent change in response to the HDM from AS() to AS(). This scenario corresponds to the method wherein only those neighbors able to acquire signals from the MS  are instructed to transmit via respective default channels.","Once call recovery is completed and the hand-off has been accomplished, the MS  must determine an initial transmission power level. According to one embodiment, the system  of  uses a closed loop power control for adjustment of transmission power levels. Alternate embodiments may use an additional open loop method of power control. Open loop refers to transmitter (either mobile or base station)-controlled operation where the receiver is not directly involved. For example, a particular reverse link open loop power control calls for the mobile to adjust reverse link transmit power based on the power level of signals received from the base station via the forward link. Closed loop power control expands open loop operation whereby the receiver actively participates in making the power adjustment decision. For example, for RL closed loop power control the base station compares the power level of signals received from a given mobile to a threshold value. The base station then instructs the mobile to increase or decrease the reverse link transmit power based on the comparison. Conversely, the mobile monitors the power level of signals received on the FL, and provides feedback on the quality of the FL to the base station. Closed loop operation is used to compensate for power fluctuations associated with fading, such as Raleigh fading, of a given link.","Immediately after wait timer expires and prior to the establishment of power control, the MS  begins transmitting at an initial power level. The RL transmit power level may resume from just prior to disabling the transmitter of MS . The power level may remain at this initial level until closed-loop power control resumes.","In an alternate embodiment, the power level is initiated at the last level prior to disabling the transmitter and then gradually increased at a predetermined rate until power control resumes. The speed of the increase is typically set by the BS  and\/or BS , and may be a fixed value or variable. The increases continue until the RL closed loop power control resumes.","Another embodiment starts recovery with open loop control based on total received power in the band. This procedure is similar to the access procedure defined in IS-95 and IS-2000. This may be corrected for multiple forward link base stations visible to MS . The open loop control continues until closed loop power control resumes.  illustrates the power adjustments according to this embodiment. The horizontal axis represents time and the vertical axis represents the transmission power level. At a first time t the transmit power is at an initial power level. After a first time period, at time t, the transmit power is increased by a predetermined increment value. The increment value may be a fixed value or may be variable, either increasing or decreasing with increasing time. In one embodiment, the increment value is adaptive and responds to the conditions of the system , wherein the increment value may increase or decrease from one time period to a subsequent time period. Finally, a predetermined maximum transmit power level may be reached after a predetermined number of time periods. The transmit power then is at a ceiling awaiting the resumption of the closed loop power control.","In still another embodiment, the initial transmit power is based on the signal quality of pilots received. The signal quality is measured by a pilot E\/Ior a pilot Efor the intended AS. In open loop power control, the transmit power typically has a relationship given as:\n\n=(\u2212)+\u2003\u2003(1)\n\nwherein k is a constant, Tx is the RL transmit energy and Rx is the FL received energy. For a closed loop power control method, the transmit power typically has a relationship given as:\n\n=(\u2212)+(),\u2003\u2003(2)\n\nand y(t) is an cumulative correction variable based on all the valid power control command received up to time t. The term (k+y(t)) is referred to as \u03b2. In an alternate form, the following relationship holds:\n\n(),\u2003\u2003(3)\n\nThe determination of an initial transmit power applies the \u03b2 of the previous transmissions to the new transmissions. The new transmit power level is then calculated as:\n\n()=(\u2212()+()+(),\u2003\u2003(4)\n\nwherein Tx() is the transmit energy prior to the call recovery, Rx() is the receive energy prior to the call recovery. In this way, the transmit power is adjusted according to the previous ratio of transmit power level to receive power level.\n","A wireless apparatus MS  operating in system  of , such as a cell phone or a personal digital assistant (PDA), is illustrated in . The MS  includes an antenna  for transmitting and receiving. The antenna  is coupled to a duplexor  for isolating the receiver path from the transmitter path. The duplexor is coupled to the receiver circuitry  forming the receiver path and is coupled to an amplifier  and transmit circuitry  forming the transmitter path. The amplifier  is further coupled to a power adjust unit  that provides the control of the amplifier . The amplifier  receives the transmission signals from the transmit circuitry .","Received signals via antenna  are provided to a power control unit  that implements a closed loop power control scheme. The power control unit  is coupled to a communication bus . The communication bus  provides a common connection between modules within the MS . The communication bus  is further coupled to a memory  and a recovery adjusts unit . The memory  stores computer readable instructions for a variety of operations and functions applicable to MS . The processor  performs the instructions stored in memory . For normal operating conditions, the power control unit generates a PC signal to power adjust  via multiplexor . The power adjusts  then transfers the PC signal as an amplification level to the amplifier .","When a call recovery occurs, the MS  may disable the transmitter. When the transmitter is re-enabled, a hand-off complete signal is provided to the recovery adjust unit . The hand-off complete signal instructs the recovery adjust unit  to generate a predetermined PC signal. The PC signal so generated may implement any of the schemes for initial RL transmit power generation discussed hereinabove, or may implement an alternate method. The hand-off complete signal is also provided to control the multiplexor . Subsequent to call recovery, the PC signal generated by the recovery adjust unit  is forwarded to the power adjust unit . In parallel, closed loop power control begins. Once closed loop power control has fully resumed, the hand-off complete signal is negated, and the multiplexor  selects the PC signal generated by power control unit  to provide to power adjust . The operation of recovery agent unit  may be performed by the microprocessor  operating on software instructions or may be implemented in hardware for efficient, reliable operation.","In one embodiment, specific operations of the MS  or BS  are considered special events. The special events include a variety of conditions and procedures that may cause false triggers to occur. In other words, special events may produce a situation where a call recovery trigger occurs, but the call is not distressed. One special event is a mobile position locator search. The MS  is instructed to search on an alternate frequency for a Global Position Systeme (GPS) signal. The GPS provides a location of the MS  or partial information of the location of the MS . The mobile position locator search is done periodically or aperiodically. Typically, the MS  has a priori information regarding the timing of such searches. Other events may include candidate frequency search in preparation for an inter-frequency hard handoff where the mobile station tunes to another frequency to search for signal from base stations on a different frequency.","Other events may include actions taken by the MS  during which a trigger is to be ignored. In these type events, the MS  notifies the source cell BS  of a special event. In one embodiment, a special event is a candidate frequency search, wherein MS  tunes to a different frequency to look for signals from neighbor base stations on that frequency. This allows a better transition between coverage on different frequencies, e.g. switching between a Personal Communication System (PCS) frequency and a cellular frequency. On occurrence of this type of mobile station initiated special event, the MS  notifies the source cell BS  to ignore triggers with respect to MS  during a specific time period or until further notification.","According to one embodiment, in order to avoid such false triggers during special events, the source cell base station, such as BS , grants the permission for the event and notifies the MS  the timing of the event, including at least when the event is to begin and the length of time allocated to the event. The MS  and the base stations in its AS disable the call recovery trigger(s) from initiating a call recovery during the special event.","In an alternate embodiment, MS  notifies the BS  of an upcoming special event or a set of these special events. In response to the notification the BS  may approve the special event, veto the event, or reschedule the event. Again, this provides the MS  and the base stations in its AS with sufficient information to disable the call recovery triggers during the special event.","Thus presented herein is a novel and improved method of maintaining communications within a wireless communication system. When the communication link between a mobile station and a corresponding source cell base station is in trouble, the mobile station and the infrastructure prearrange potential rescue base stations. The source cell base station contacts all recovery-capable neighbors as potential rescuers. A recovery-capable neighbor has a predefined default channel adapted for soft hand-off with a mobile station. The default channel is only used temporarily during the initial portion of hand-off. Each rescue base station is instructed to use a default channel for rescue transmissions. The rescue transmission is considered a call recovery operation. The mobile station establishes a soft hand-off with rescue base station, wherein the FL uses the default channel. The rescue base station then initiates transmissions on an alternate channel. Once hand-off is complete the rescue base station discontinues use of the default channel with respect to transmissions to the mobile station. In one embodiment, the source cell base station provides the mobile station with the list of recovery-capable neighbors as overhead during transmissions and prior to development of the communication link problem. In this way, for situations where the FL is lost prior to receipt of hand-off information, the mobile station has sufficient information to proceed with a hand-off.","In an alternate embodiment, more than one default channel is assigned to the neighbor BS . The use of multiple default or rescue channels increases the call recovery capability of a system . Each neighbor is then able to contribute to call recovery of more than one mobile station, such as MS . In operation, prior to call recovery, the source cell BS  provides to MS  an identifier corresponding to the multiple channels associated with BS . The MS  and BS  each store a deterministic function, such as a hash function, to map the identifiers to a specific channel. The use of a hash function in particular is a pseudorandom procedure. In addition, an electronic serial number is assigned to the MS . The electronic serial number may be stored in the MS  or may be provided to the MS  on call recovery. On call recovery, the source cell BS  provides the electronic serial number of MS  to the BS . The BS  and the MS  both apply the predetermined function to calculate the appropriate default channel.","A hash function for a data structure allows recognition of a key word in a set of words using exactly one probe into the data structure. A hash function maps its argument to a result of predetermined type. A hash function is deterministic and stateless. That is, the return value depends only on the argument, and equal arguments yield equal results. It is important for hash function to minimize collisions, wherein a collision is defined as two different arguments that hash to the same value. It is also important that the distribution of hash values be uniform; that is, the probability that a hash function returns any particular value of predetermined type should be roughly the same as the probability that it returns any other value. In alternate embodiments, other forms of cryptographic functions may be implemented for identification of the multiple default channels on call recovery.","As examples, the various illustrative logical blocks, modules, circuits, and algorithm steps described in connection with the embodiments disclosed herein may be implemented or performed with a digital signal processor (DSP), an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), a field programmable gate array (FPGA) or other programmable logic device, discrete gate or transistor logic, discrete hardware components such as, e.g., registers and FIFO, a processor executing a set of firmware instructions, any conventional programmable software module and a processor, or any combination thereof designed to perform the functions described herein.
