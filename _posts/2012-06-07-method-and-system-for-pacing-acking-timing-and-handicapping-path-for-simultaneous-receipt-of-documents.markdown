No. 13\/198,795, filed Aug. 5, 2011, which claims the benefit of U.S. provisional patent applications Nos. 61\/371,379, filed Aug. 6, 2010, 61\/371,412, filed Aug. 6, 2010, 61\/371,444, filed Aug. 6, 2010, 61\/371,487, filed Aug. 6, 2010, 61\/373,034, filed Aug. 12, 2010, 61\/379,961, filed Sep. 3, 2010, 61\/448,925, filed Mar. 3, 2011, and 61\/479,182, filed Apr. 26, 2011, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.","The present invention relates generally to a method and system for an information distribution service. More specifically, the present invention relates to providing simultaneous receipt of impactful information by a plurality of recipients over either a \u201cpush\u201d or a \u201cpull\u201d network of multiple servers.","Many businesses, particularly financial institutions, are dependent upon timely reception of information from government agencies (e.g., unemployment statistics) and from press release services reporting information and announcements concerning publicly traded companies (e.g., earnings reports, merger offers and possibilities, etc.). In many instances involving the distribution of material or sensitive information (e.g., information that may have an impact on the economy, markets, or a company's financial outlook\/status), if one intended recipient receives the disclosed information even a relatively short time before another, then the one recipient may gain an unfair advantage (e.g., a financial advantage) over the other intended recipient(s) of the information. In such cases, information distribution services may desire or be required to guarantee \u201csimultaneous disclosure\u201d of the information (e.g., a press release or other form of communication) to all or a subset of the intended recipients.","\u201cSimultaneous disclosure\u201d as used herein includes the distribution of information in a \u2018bias free\u2019 manner (i.e., distribution which \u201cplays no favorites\u201d) and wherein the disclosed information is received by all of the intended recipients within a \u2018tight time tolerance\u2019 (i.e., the intended recipients receive the information at substantially the same time within a small acceptable tolerance which may be predetermined based on the nature of the underlying information). The term \u201csimultaneous disclosure\u201d is not strictly limited to distribution of press releases, but may apply to any sensitive and actionable content, or any content announcing availability of limited resources, such as an announcement of an organization accepting applications for a job opening in which it is expected there will be many more applicants than available job openings, or an announcement of ticket availability for an event which is likely to be oversubscribed. Other applications include distributing general information in which the time allowed to prepare a response is limited (e.g. RFP's for competitive contracts) or announcing that the time to perform a particular action has commenced, and that actions will be judged or rewarded on a \u201cfirst-come, first-serve\u201d basis.","In August of 2000, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) promulgated Regulation Fair Disclosure (herein referred to as \u201cReg. FD\u201d) designed to prevent selective disclosure by public companies to market professionals and certain shareholders. To effectuate this purpose, Reg. FD requires \u201c[w]henever an issuer . . . discloses any material nonpublic information regarding that issuer or its securities . . . the issuer shall make public disclosure of that information . . . simultaneously, in the case of an intentional disclosure.\u201d In this regard, Reg. FD is often referred to as the \u201csimultaneous disclosure\u201d rule.","Conventional methods and systems have been developed in order to achieve \u2018simultaneous disclosure\u2019 as required by Reg. FD or otherwise. For example, the release of government statistics, such as unemployment data, the U.S. government instituted a technique referred to as the \u201clock up\u201d approach, wherein individuals with press credentials were brought into a \u201clock up room\u201d, presented with the information to be released, and given access to terminals (e.g., laptop computers) that each could be used to transmit the information at a specific time but with the transmission capability temporarily deactivated. Then, at the specific time of release (e.g., exactly 8:30 AM EST), a central switch controlling all terminals is then used to activate the transmission capability of each terminal all at once, permitting the information to be transmitted from each terminal to the journalists' offices, presumably at the same time. However, this approach has the drawback that not all computer equipment for transmitting the information has the same engineering such that the information is actually transmitted at the same time. Moreover, this approach requires an increase in expensive equipment and room for the system as the number of individuals increases.","Another conventional method for providing \u201csimultaneous disclosure\u201d is via satellite communication. Satellite transmission of information or data has the advantage of being at such a high altitude that bits appear to \u201crain down\u201d so that anyone who wishes to receive satellite data receives it essentially at the same time. For this reason, the business community largely adopted this form of communication by the mid-1970s. For example, the PR (press release) wire services began using satellites to build full domestic networks in the United States capable of sending financial information quickly to media outlets all over the country. As the PR wire services became the accepted and trusted information disseminator for corporations, the PR wire services took on the additional role as the official provider of \u201cdisclosure\u201d for public corporations.","Demand for corporate information continues to grow as news and investment firms compete for the public's attention. Therefore, the role of the PR wire services expanded to provide fast, electronic, and \u2018simultaneous\u2019 disclosure of certain disclosures and press release information. Satellite technology emerged as the primary method for simultaneously broadcasting the news and other information to the various media, investment, and research communities.","However, significant problems with using satellite technology for this purpose also emerged. Because satellite transmissions to normal recipients lacking high-powered uplinks are one-way broadcasts, there is no means to confirm that a transmission was successful. Therefore, wire service transmissions are sent out \u201cblind,\u201d having no verification message coming back from the media point to validate receipt of a communication. Several methods have been employed to try to overcome this lack of two-way communications, and therefore lack of an acknowledgement back channel (e.g., Forward Error Control, a separate terrestrial line for the acknowledgement channel), but all such methods lead to inefficiencies and higher costs of communication.","There were other cost considerations with regards to satellites. For many years, satellite distribution was lower in cost than terrestrial lines. However, with the increasing presence of mobile devices, demand for satellite bandwidth (because it is wireless and a good match for mobile applications) increased to the point that users have been forced to pay a large premium to use satellites. Therefore, transmission and reception of time-sensitive information having disclosure requirements has become increasingly and prohibitively expensive over satellites.","Introduction of the public Internet in the mid-1990's provided a new communications medium for the dissemination of news to the media community. As the Internet matured in the late 1990's, certain advantages over satellite technology became apparent, such as cheaper installation, widespread availability, high-speed, and full-duplex, two-way communication. Accordingly, Internet technology became the preferred alternative due to its faster, cheaper, global-reaching, and bi-directional characteristics.","However, the Internet has a major flaw that prohibits it from being accepted \u201cas-is\u201d as a viable communication vehicle for the dissemination of time-sensitive or Reg. FD-compliant information. The Internet's multi-point packet forwarded architecture does not ensure that information will reach multiple destinations\/recipients in a fair and simultaneous fashion. As such, there was a need for the ability to provide near simultaneous delivery of information over any packet routed network, the public Internet in particular.","Existing protocols for simultaneous disclosure of electronic documents\u2014described both in the open literature and in existing U.S. patents, such as, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 7,069,245 (hereinafter, the '245 patent), which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety\u2014rely on encryption and essentially flow from the fundamental work on time-lock cryptography first announced on USENET by Timothy May in 1994. These techniques use a form of \u201clock up,\u201d (i.e., an exact digital analog to the aforementioned physical \u201clock up\u201d used to guarantee simultaneous disclosure of U.S. government data). According to this approach, the entire compilation of information (e.g., the electronic document) is transmitted to all recipients in an encrypted form. The entire encrypted text is received by each recipient and stored on each recipient's local computer in advance of a pre-set release time, for example 10 A.M. EST. Next, at precisely the pre-set time (i.e., 10 A.M. EST in this example), the decryption (\u201cun-lock\u201d) key is sent to each recipient. Since decryption keys are small enough to fit in a single packet, transmission of the key alone requires very little bandwidth. As such, any difference in arrival times due to Internet transmission speed and quality are assumed to be negligible, since those differences do not accumulate over multiple packets, as they would if an entire electronic document were transmitted.","Unfortunately, such encryption techniques fail the bias-free test, and the difference in arrival time is not truly negligible, since the owner of the fastest Internet connection always receives the key first. Furthermore, with encryption-based methods, a security break in the encryption used to safeguard the disclosed information results in the premature release of the information. It also appears that the encryption techniques used for simultaneous disclosure also suffer in theory from an additional serious flaw in that they use a single key for all the electronic documents (e.g., press releases) that are released in a given minute, and send the \u201ckey-for-that-minute\u201d once, in one packet. This approach exposes such techniques to a \u201cknown plaintext attack.\u201d In a \u201cknown plaintext attack,\u201d the perpetrator \u201cBlackhat\u201d conspires with a number of companies to send out press releases scheduled for release in the same minute as the release Blackhat wishes to break. This guarantees that Blackhat will have access to plain-text\/cipher-text pairs of messages all encrypted with the same key that Blackhat wishes to discover, in advance of the release minute. Powerful techniques exist to help Blackhat find the key given this type of data, which is usually not, and should not, be available.","A system which implements simultaneous reception of impactful information for a plurality of documents by a set of intended recipients may be implemented via a \u201cpush\u201d network. As used herein, a \u201cpush\u201d network presents information to a user without the user requesting the information.","Push networks implement \u201cpush services.\u201d A push service copies and distributes, to a plurality of user terminals, a packet sent by an information providing process, wherein the information providing process may transfer packets at a regular interval or at a prescribed time without knowing the state of the individual user terminals. Users can operate their user terminals whenever they wish and may extract the information that has been distributed. Since a push network is defined in advance, if it were built on top of fixed, dedicated lines, then the \u201cequality of network connection speed\u201d could be controlled or at least catered for. But if the push network is layered \u201cvirtually\u201d on top of the public Internet, then the speed and latency of the network connection to each would-be recipient cannot be controlled.","Alternatively, a system which implements simultaneous reception of impactful information for a set of documents by a plurality of intended recipients may be implemented via a \u201cpull\u201d network. As used herein, a \u201cpull\u201d network presents information to a user after the user requests the information. In effect, the network is \u201cpolled\u201d by the user. Typically the user may have an account with the system with a login and password. After the user logs in, the user makes a request for the information and expects to receive the information either immediately or at a specified time.","An example of a pull network may include a user computer connected to the public Internet, wherein the user makes a request for content from their Web browser which forwards the request over the Internet to a Web server via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). Simple Web servers handle requests sequentially, i.e., requests are received in a certain non-predetermined order, and then content is processed and sent to the recipients in the same order. Many modern Web servers use threads to process at least some of the requests that arrive approximately at the same time substantially simultaneously, but the time of delivery may vary based on connection speed, the server load, and the random order of the request arrivals, even if the requests are initiated by users at the same time.","When a press release is to be released via a Web server, by displaying it on a Web page, at a known time, thousands or even tens of thousands of users may use their Web browsers to request the document at the same time. A user with access to many computers or Web browsers may send many multiple requests, which would increase to near certainty the likelihood that at least one of that user's requests will be in a higher percentile of the requests to be processed first. This common practice gives motivated users an advantage over others with regard to access to content, thereby violating \u201cReg. FD\u201d. In fact, motivated users could write or employ off-the-shelf automated software to create multiple robotic \u201cusers\u201d, and deploy an entire army of robots to request the Web page. While there are Web server mechanisms to prevent access from robots, these mechanisms might make simultaneous disclosure worse by requiring further human interaction, thereby leading to even further lack of access-time consistency across all of the users. Worse, turning back an army of robots does nothing to defeat an army of real human users who are colluding to access the Web page before other users. Well-financed organizations could employ \u201ccrowd sourcing\u201d, marshalling thousands of individuals, potentially across many countries, to request the Web page. If an organization coordinates 1,000 users requesting the Web page at the moment it is available, the odds are significantly increased that the organization obtains one copy of the Web page before other users, and therefore the information that is supposed to be simultaneously disclosed is received before many of the other users. Furthermore, users with fast Internet connections may receive a document faster than those with slower connections, even if the slower connection is processed first by a Web server.","In the same manner, documents requested via the File Transfer Protocol (FTP) and other document transfer protocols have the same shortcomings and are likely to violate of \u201cReg. FD\u201d under circumstances similar to Web servers employing HTTP.","Accordingly, what would be desirable, but has not yet been provided, is a method and system configured to facilitate and confirm simultaneous receipt of certain sensitive information (i.e., electronic documents) by a plurality of intended recipients transmitted via a Web server over a \u201cpush\u201d and\/or a \u201cpull\u201d network, such as the Internet.","Financial traders and analysts may scan a press release for a single statement, such as a current earnings statement, and take an action based on a numeric value or other statement contained in the earnings statement. This value may be compared to an expected target value. This comparison effectively creates a condition upon which the trader or analyst takes a particular action. This action is usually related to the stock market, such as buying or selling a stock, but may include other actions such as calling someone on the telephone or making a notation of the company name for future research.","As used herein, an \u201caction markup\u201d is defined as placement of action message(s) (e.g., buy\/sell\/hold) directly into a document for a recipient to act upon. The inclusion of an action message(s) is intended to reduce the reaction time of a recipient needed to perform a certain task. Action markup is not strictly limited to the insertion of simple action messages, but may include computer implemented calculations and\/or decision making to produce action(s) based on one or more user settable conditions.","It would be desirable for a recipient to simply receive the value of interest, or better, for the recipient to receive a specific instruction at press release time. Unfortunately, current instruction delivery methods known in the art do not comply with \u201cReg. FD.\u201d For instance, if one recipient receives an entire earnings release, and a second recipient receives only an instruction, such as the word \u201csell,\u201d the first recipient may need to wait for the entire earnings release to download, and is therefore at a severe disadvantage. The time it takes the first recipient to download the entire earnings release and scan for the value of interest before making a decision permits the second recipient to have a greater opportunity to take an action before the first recipient.","A variation of the concept of \u201caction markup\u201d is \u201ceditorial markup.\u201d An \u201ceditorial markup\u201d is similar to an \u201caction markup\u201d wherein, instead of receiving an instruction to take an action, the recipient may receive editorial information\/messages, such as an editor's opinion or facts about the impactful content, including insight into other relevant information. Herein we refer to either \u201caction markup\u201d or \u201ceditorial markup\u201d as \u201ctrader markup\u201d.","What would be desirable, but has not yet been provided, is a method for providing trader markup within documents to be disclosed substantially simultaneously according to Reg FD.","What would also be desirable, but has not yet been provided, is a method and system configured to facilitate and confirm simultaneous receipt of certain sensitive information (i.e., electronic documents) by a plurality of intended recipients transmitted via a Web server over a \u201cpush\u201d and\/or a \u201cpull\u201d network, wherein the documents transmitted are in binary (non-ascii) formats.","Web servers may host Web pages with press release content as part of \u201cNotify and Access.\u201d As used herein, Notify and Access refers to the practice of employing a press release service to transmit to Web browsers associated with press release subscribers a URL or hyperlink that links to press release content, rather than transmitting the entire press release content over the press release service to the press release subscribers. Notify and Access notifies the press release subscribers that a press release is available on a Web page of a remote Web server, and through the press release, subscribers may then access the Web page and the press release through their Web browser.","A deficiency of currently employed Notify and Access services is that a Web server displaying a Web page with a press release may be unaware of when a notification has been sent to recipients, and consequently the Web server may make the Web page available before the notification is sent over the press release service. In such circumstances, automated Web crawling software or manual Web browser requests may be employed to view the Web page unfairly before press release subscribers have been notified that the press release (document) is available.","As a result, what would also be desirable, but has not yet been provided, is a method and system configured to facilitate and confirm simultaneous receipt of certain sensitive information (i.e., electronic documents) by a plurality of intended recipients transmitted via a Web server, or multiple Web servers in a Web server farm, over a \u201cpush\u201d and\/or a \u201cpull\u201d network, wherein the Web server posts the sensitive information (e.g., a press release) on at least one Web pages substantially simultaneously and wherein intended recipients substantially simultaneously receive a notification that the at least one Web page is available for viewing.","The above-described problems are addressed and a technical solution achieved in the art by providing a method for facilitating substantially simultaneous receipt of content included in at least one document by a plurality of intended recipients, comprising the steps of: delimiting at least one portion of impactful content in the document to define at least one impactful block (IBlock); delimiting a remaining portion of content to define at least one non-impactful block (NIBlock); inserting at least one action markup following the at least one IBlock; transmitting the at least one IBlock to each of the plurality of intended recipients; transmitting the action markup to at least one intended recipient; wherein the at least one IBlock is received substantially simultaneously by the plurality of intended recipients. The method may further comprise the step of synchronizing connections for each of the intended recipients following the at least one IBlock and the at least one NIBlock. The action markup may be transmitted to the at least one intended recipient while other intended recipients wait.","According to an embodiment of the present invention, the at least one IBlock comprises at least one IBlock unit, and wherein the step of transmitting the at least one IBlock includes the step of transmitting the at least one IBlock unit. The method may further comprise the steps of: receiving at least one acknowledgement packet after a round trip time (RTT); and calculating a handicap time for the at least one IBlock unit based on the RTT; wherein the at least one IBlock unit is transmitted after a delay equal to the corresponding handicap time of an intended recipient in order from a smallest handicap time to a largest handicap time. A handicap time may be set to a longest transmission time of about \u00bd of a longest RTT of an IBlock unit from among all of the intended recipients with a transmission time of an IBlock unit for a particular intended recipient subtracted.","According to an embodiment of the present invention, the at least one action markup may include an element identifier, a condition, and a message. The element identifier is a name corresponding to an impactful data element indicative of at least one of the type of impactful data element and a number reference. The condition includes a target value and a comparison, wherein target value is acted upon by the comparison.","According to an embodiment of the present invention, the method may further comprise the step of transmitting a message to the at least one of the intended recipients when the condition is met. The message may be communicated to the at least one intended recipient by at least one of a pop-up notification message, a changing of visual effects, and manipulating another program via an Application Programming Interface (API). The at least one document may include multiple types of action markups. The multiple types of action markups may correspond to one impactful data element. The at least one IBlock may include combinations of conditions and messages. XML-style tags may be inserted about the action markup.","According to an embodiment of the present invention, the method may further comprise the step of pacing the transmission of at least one IBlock unit. The step of pacing may further comprise the step of transmitting the at least one IBlock unit in a pacing time period. The pacing time period is equal to a reciprocal of a longest total transmission time taken for each intended recipient to receive all of IBlock units divided by each recipient's number of IBlock units. The handicap time period and\/or the pacing time period may be averaged or exponentially smoothed between sending of subsequent IBlock units.","According to an embodiment of the present invention, impactful content refers to any portion of the content included in an electronic information document that impacts a likelihood that an individual takes some form of a financial-related action. Impactful content includes at least one impactful data element. An impactful data element includes at least one of a key word, a character, a marker, a name, and a symbol. An impactful data element may be identified by employing a pattern matching method. The pattern matching method may include a regular expression matching method.","According to an embodiment of the present invention, a document may comprise two documents that have different formats. The least one IBlock for the two documents may have different lengths.","According to an embodiment of the present invention, the delimiting steps may further comprise the steps of: (a) inserting a tag indicating a start of an NIBlock at the beginning of a document and a tag indicating an end of an NIBlock at the end of the document, (b) scanning content until at least one impactful data element is found using a pattern matching method, wherein the pattern matching method returns at least a starting point index of a match to impactful content and a length of the impactful content, (c) inserting a tag indicating the end of a NIBlock and a tag indicating the start of an IBlock adjacent to the returned starting point index of impactful content, (d) calculating an end position of the at least one IBlock based on the start point index and the length of the impactful content, (e) inserting a tag indicating an end of an IBlock and a tag indicating a beginning of an NIBlock adjacent to the calculated end position of the at least one IBlock, and (f) repeating steps (b)-(e) until the end of the document is reached. The delimiting steps may further comprise the step of re-scanning the document and combining an IBlock and an adjacent NIBlock into a larger single IBlock if the total length of the adjacent NIBlock is below a predetermined length. The delimiting steps may further comprise the step of dividing an IBlock into at least two ISubBlocks if a length of the IBlock is larger than a predetermined length.","According to an embodiment of the present invention, alternatively, the delimiting steps may further comprise the step of: applying a match and replace method to a document to produce matched impactful content, wherein matched impactful content is replaced by the matched impactful content preceded and followed by a tagged string.","According to an embodiment of the present invention, the method may further comprise the step of: receiving at least one request from each of the plurality of intended recipients for a document during a predetermined period of time; and wherein the at least one IBlock unit is transmitted to each of the intended recipients after the predetermined period of time.","It is to be understood that the attached drawings are for purposes of illustrating the concepts of the invention and may not be to scale.","Modern fast multi-processor computers, fast multiple Network Interface Cards (NICs), and the low-latency of the current U.S. public Internet render satellite and encryption techniques unnecessary, as more straight-forward approaches based on timing are available for problems of realistic size.

Using handicapping, y's byte is sent 5 ms after y's byte, so that y and y receive a corresponding byte approximately after 10 ms have passed.

Alternatively, a byte transmission number (, , , etc.) may be assigned to calculate when each byte is sent.","According to an embodiment of the present invention, each of the IBlocks and NIBlocks may be further transmitted in preset units of bytes, or U's, a method herein designated as \u201cunit-by-unit send\u201d (UBUS).

Note that an individual U may have fewer than the designated preset number of bytes, such as the U .","According to an embodiment of the present invention, recipient transmissions may be synchronized (SYNCing or SYNC'ed) to ensure recipients are receiving data simultaneously. After either a U or an SEB (i.e., IBlock or NIBlock) of data is transmitted to each recipient, transmission is paused in order to allow each recipient to receive a previously sent U or SEB. SYNCing includes at least one method for detecting when a U or SEB has been transmitted. According to certain embodiments of the present invention, a non-exhaustive list of methods for SYNCing may include the following:","Monitoring a socket for an acknowledgement packet (also referred to as an \u201cACK\u201d): After a recipient receives data over TCP\/IP, the recipient responds with an ACK packet, which includes a sequence number and size in bytes of the data received. The sequence number is unique for each recipient and is used to ensure that the ACK corresponds to the data that was sent. The ACK size contained in the ACK packet contains the number of bytes successfully received. In a preferred embodiment, a received ACK packet should include the sequence number that matches a corresponding sequence number of a packet that was sent to the recipient and the ACK number should match the number of bytes sent to the recipient.","Monitoring a socket send buffer and waiting for it to be empty, which implies that data has been sent: Though this indicates that a U or SEB has been sent, it does not guarantee that the U or SEB was sent successfully. In circumstances where a recipient did not receive a U or SEB, the recipient will not acknowledge receipt and the socket will send the U or SEB again.","After a transmission, the sending machine may wait a specified amount of time for a recipient to respond. This wait period is likely to be two times the connection speed, or the expected Round Trip Time (RTT), plus a percentage for unexpected network latency. One having ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that ACK and RTT are well-known concepts in the electronic communication arts and a part of the \u201cnetwork layer\u201d of transmission code. In certain embodiments of the present invention, ACK's and RTT's are moved \u201cup\u201d the protocol stack to the \u201capplication layer\u201d for use by the document delivery system  and the recipient machines -. After this amount of time has passed, any connections that have not responded with an ACK may be dropped from a simultaneous disclosure group (i.e. a group of the recipient machines -, e.g., -). This ensures that other recipients are not delayed. Recipients dropped from the simultaneous disclosure group may either be sent an error message or may be pooled into a retransmission group to receive a retransmitted document after the simultaneous disclosure group has been processed. After every recipient has acknowledged receipt or has been dropped, the next round of transmission may begin.","According to an embodiment of the present invention, handicap times and pacing rates employed in the PATH method for transmitting IBlocks may be derived from information stored in ACK packets. The timing information stored in ACK packets permits the calculation of round trip time (RTT) for potentially each U packet. Since many ACKs may be received over the length of a document for substantially the same size packet, common smoothing\/averaging algorithms known in the art, an exponential smoothing algorithm, such as preferably, but not limited to a Kalman filter, may be used to calculate an overall average transmission time of a single U packet. Furthermore, the smoothed measurements are used to gate transmission orders that thread (multiplex) multiple electronic information documents over a single channel. The exponential smoothing filter examines a predetermined number of current and previous RTT times and weighs more recent RTT times more heavily than prior RTT times. In addition, according to an embodiment of the present invention, service order among recipient threads may be randomized.","Other methods for calculating the RTT include employing a timer, where the timer is started when a packet is transmitted, and stooped when it is received. Multiple timers may be employed for each packet transmitted, or a timer may be employed periodically or for one packet in each document.","Other methods for smoothing the RTT may be used, such as methods that include the recent history and variability of captured RTTs on the delivery circuit, as well as the knowledge of the routing and network hops used for that circuit.","Furthermore, traceroute may be used in conjunction with the PATH transmission software. The traceroute software permits PATH to determine the ping time of each hop between itself and the recipient. An advanced method for calculating RTT may be used by calculating the average over time of each hop, then adding the averages together to get a total RTT.","According to an embodiment of the present invention, the information distribution system is configured to detect one or more \u201claggard\u201d machines among the plurality of recipient machines. As used herein, the term \u201claggard\u201d or \u201claggard machine\u201d refers to a recipient machine that fails to return an acknowledgment packet to the document delivery system  within a period of time referred to as the \u201cacknowledgment threshold.\u201d As used herein, the term \u201cacknowledgment threshold\u201d refers to an initially predetermined and potentially subsequent adjustable amount of time in which receipt of the acknowledgment packet must occur. Upon detection of a laggard machine, the identified laggard machine is temporarily dropped from the simultaneous disclosure group, dropped only for the current electronic information document release, to prevent the laggard machine from delaying receipt by any of the other recipients.","Laggards may also be detected and removed from the simultaneous group before a document begins transmission. If a recipient's ping time is above a certain threshold, they may be removed from the simultaneous group. This threshold may be determined by using an exact ping time, such as any recipient with a ping time higher than 50 ms, or it may be determined dynamically, such as any recipient with a ping time higher than 20% above average, or any other method that could be used to determine outliers. Alternatively, a set number of recipients may be removed, such as the slowest five recipients or slowest 5% of recipients.","Machines that appear to be slow by intentionally delaying one way communication, through a modified TCP stack or low level networking device, and thereby falsifying their ping times, also need to be considered. These methods include any mechanism for delaying the receipt or transmission of content from or to the PATH software.","Optionally, the identification of any unusually long ACK response times are retained and used for forensic analysis to compensate sending time delays in addition to the exponential smoothing filter. Logs of all ping, transmission, receipt, and any other time logs may be used for analysis of machines that falsify times. These logs may be analyzed over the course of a time period to detect inconsistencies, such as, but not limited to determining patterns of increased or decreased ping times immediately before a release. Any abnormalities may result in expulsion of that machine from the simultaneous disclosure group until the problem is resolved.","Another method to determine inconsistencies between incoming and outgoing ping times is through the use of ping validation on the client software. The client can send a one way ping to the AMPS software, which would send a ping back to the client along with the first received ping time. The client can then compare the two for inconsistencies between the times and report any abnormalities back to the PATH software. Encryption may be used for transmitting the ping time to the client as well as the test results back to the PATH software to ensure the contents are not tampered with.","Another method for deterring the use of artificially inflated ping times to receive IBlocks faster is via splitting NIBlocks for transmission. If a cheating recipient is expecting alternating NIBlocks and IBlocks, and lowering their ping time in anticipation of receiving an IBlock, the PATH software may surprise and foil cheaters by splitting one or more NIBlocks into two or more parts for transmission. This method permits the PATH software to reduce the effectiveness of a recipient modifying their ping times between types of content.","Implementing traceroute in PATH could also be used to detect cheaters, where the recipient could be considered a cheater if one hop in their route is consistently taking longer than the others, or one hop makes up more than a certain percentage of the total RTT. This permits the PATH software to detect artificial lag in ACK responses created by recipients with a modified IP stack or a low level network repeater with an artificially delayed outgoing response.","Multiple simultaneous groups can be created, where transmission from the second group begins after transmission of the first group completes, either immediately or after a specified amount of time, and so on for the third, fourth, etc., groups. Laggards removed from a simultaneous group can be moved to the next simultaneous group for another transmission attempt, or they can be moved to the individual group after one or a specific number of attempts. The individual group is a group of recipients who have been removed from the simultaneous group or who are not part of the simultaneous group initially. The individual group is transmitted the document after one or all of the simultaneous groups have completed transmission, without using the PATH transmission protocol.","In order to transmit many small uniformly sized packets, e.g., 4 bytes, (i.e., the U's) and calculate a consistent RTT, in a preferred embodiment, Nagle's algorithm is disabled so that the U's may be inserted into individual TCP packets and sent along with whatever header information TCP adds.

In Step , at least one acknowledgement packet (e.g., an ACK) from each of the recipients y-yN is received by the document delivery system  for each of the U's transmitted. In Step , a transmission speed is calculated for each of the recipients y-yN based on a transmission time gathered from the acknowledgement packets associated with each of the recipients y-yN. In Step , connections for each of the recipients y-yN are synchronized (i.e. SYNC'ed). In Step , an average or exponentially smoothed RTT is calculated for each of the recipients y-yN based on the total number of ACKs received and their corresponding derived RTTs and stored in the document delivery system .

In Step , each of the remaining sets of SEBs of each of the corresponding documents is transmitted according to either Steps  or  until the last set of SEBs is transmitted.","In the context of applying the PATH method of the present invention in terms of U's, handicapping is defined as calculating a transmission delay for each recipient to compensate for different connection speeds. After calculating an RTT time of each recipient, the RTT may be halved (\u00bd RTT) to calculate the transmission time of one U for each recipient. To calculate the handicap for a particular recipient, the longest transmission time (\u00bd RTT) from among all of the recipients is determined and the particular recipient's transmission time (\u00bd RTT) is subtracted. Put another way, each recipient's handicap plus their transmission time is equal to the longest transmission time, ensuring each recipient receives the U at the same time.","In the context of applying the PATH method of the present invention in terms of U's, pacing is define as calculating the frequency of transmission of data for each recipient. Each recipient's data varies in size based on formatting (plaintext vs. HTML vs. XML, etc.). Data may be broken into equally sized U's, and therefore, each recipient has a different number of U's to be transmitted. The total time it takes each recipient to receive all of the U's in their content is calculated to determine the longest transmission time. This is calculated by multiplying the number of each recipients U's by their time to transmit one U, or half of RTT, to calculate an overall time for each recipient, one of which is a longest total transmission time. For each recipient, the longest total transmission time calculated above is divided by each recipient's number of U's to calculate a frequency to transmit U's for each recipient. The result is a time period for each recipient, so one U may be transmitted at each calculated time period for each recipient. Therefore, each recipient is sent a different number of U's at different frequencies, across the same time period as determined by the longest transmission time. Overall, recipients that receive larger sized formatted content (with more U's) will be sent a U more frequently than recipients with smaller formatted content (fewer U's). The smaller format recipients will have their U's transmitted father apart, or paced, since there are fewer U's in their content. The handicapping method may then be applied to each U across pacing to ensure that the last U is received at the same time for each recipient.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0201","num":"0200"},"figref":["FIGS. 9A and 9B","FIGS. 5A and 5B","FIGS. 10A and 10B","FIGS. 11A and 11B","FIGS. 10A and 10B"],"b":["1","2","1","2","1","2"]},"The example described hereinbelow illustrates an implementation of a \u201cdocument transmission\u201d stage that applies the PATH method to the first NIBlock and IBlock of the electronic documents shown in , respectively, according to an embodiment of the present invention.

Each recipient sends an ACK packet for each packet received, which results in a Round Trip Time (RTT) in milliseconds. For each ACK received, the system may store the RTT for each recipient.

The document delivery system  may need to store attributes associated with each recipient in a list so that the document delivery system  is configured to handle each type of recipient. One exemplary solution is to store for each recipient a flag attribute which may be either be a letter or number indicating the type of transmission (e.g., P for push, H for HTTP pull, F for FTP pull, etc).

According to an embodiment of the present invention, the PATH server software module  may be implemented and synchronized across multiple networked PATH servers while still ensuring that all recipients receive content substantially simultaneously. In such circumstances, each networked PATH server would both transmit content to its own list of recipients using the PATH method, and possibly (depending on the synchronization method used) and maintain a global list of all recipients being served by all the networked PATH servers. As a result, long transmission times that may result from using only a single server to serve a widely-geographically-dispersed set of recipients may be reduced.","In a networked multiple PATH server implementation, synchronization between PATH servers is needed to ensure transmission begins at the same time across each of the PATH server. One method of synchronization across multiple networked PATH servers is to employ a \u201chead-start\u201d transmission time for the content as a whole to be delivered to each of the PATH servers (but not to any recipients) before a release time to the recipients associated with each of the PATH servers. This ensures that each PATH server has received the content prior to a commencement of transmission to each of its respective recipients at a release time. For instance, if the content contains a publish time of 08:00:00 AM, the content source would send the content to each PATH server at 7:59:30 AM. The difference in the transmission \u201chead-start\u201d time and the publish time needs to be large enough to ensure that each PATH server receives the content before it must be transmitted. The clocks of all involved PATH servers need also to be synchronized to ensure transmission across the PATH servers starts at substantially the same time.","According to an embodiment of the present invention, a second method of synchronization across multiple networked PATH servers is to designate one of the PATH servers as a \u201cmaster\u201d PATH server and the remainder of the PATH servers as \u201cslave\u201d PATH servers with respect to transmission of content as a whole (i.e., without dividing the content into SEBs) from the \u201cmaster\u201d PATH server to the \u201cslave\u201d PATH servers. The master PATH server is configured to receive the content to be transmitted to a plurality of recipients from a content source server (not shown). The master PATH server transmits the document to the slave PATH servers using pacing and handicapping of the document as a whole. When each slave PATH server receives the last byte of the content substantially simultaneously, each of the slave PATH servers, in turn, formats and divides the document into SEBs according to the marking method described hereinabove, and then transmits SEBs according to the transmission method described above with respect to transmission, handicapping, and pacing of IBlocks to each of their recipients.","An aspect worth careful consideration with respect to the implementation of PATH across multiple servers is the synchronization of maximum ping time across multiple PATH instances. Each of the slave PATH servers is not only required to transmit based on a maximum handicap time across all of their own recipients, but also with respect to the longest handicap time across all of the recipients associated with each of the slave path servers that are to receive the same document. One method to accomplish this, using the master\/slave PATH implementation, is to employ a first modified version of the PATH server software module  on the master PATH server and a second modified version of the PATH server software module  on each of the slave PATH servers. The modified slave PATH server software module is adapted to maintain a list of ping times for each of its recipients, as used in the PATH method described hereinabove to calculate handicap times. The modified slave PATH server software module is also adapted to periodically transmit the ping data associated with each of its recipients back to the master PATH server, either in a form an entire ping list or only a maximum ping time. The master PATH server thus maintains a global list of ping times or maximum ping time for each slave PATH server. The master PATH server then calculates a master maximum ping time among of all ping times among all of the slave PATH servers. This master maximum ping time is then transmitted periodically back to each slave PATH server, or transmitted at the time content is transmitted. Each slave PATH server then calculates a handicap for each of its recipients based on the master ping time.","According to an embodiment of the present invention, another method for synchronizing maximum ping time across all of the slave PATH servers is via the use of a database. In such circumstances, there is no \u201cmaster\u201d PATH server, but a plurality of \u201cpeer\u201d PATH servers and a central database server. Each peer PATH server software module  may be configured to coordinate ping times with other peer PATH servers. This typically would be implemented with a database server, wherein each peer PATH server updates the central database server with the ping times of each recipient, then queries a table maintained by the database server that contains ping data associated with all of the peer PATH servers to retrieve a maximum ping time. The database may be queried periodically to update the locally stored maximum ping time of each of the peers PATH servers, or it may be queried before transmitting each document.","According to an embodiment of the present invention, another method for synchronizing maximum ping time across all of the slave PATH servers is for a database to be associated with each of the peer PATH servers. The peer PATH servers may periodically exchange database ping tables\/maximum ping times with each other. In such circumstances, each of the peer PATH servers merely queries its local database to obtain the maximum ping.","A person skilled in the art would appreciate that other methods may be envisioned for transmitting ping times between slave\/peer PATH servers, such as, but not limited to, transmitting flat files, using a Web service to retrieve maximum ping times from a centralized server, etc.","In such circumstances wherein a master PATH server\/slave-peer PATH server\/database server or a path therebetween fails, slave\/peer PATH servers may connect to other slave PATH servers to retrieve ping time data and\/or receive content. The connection between the master and slave PATH servers may be a dedicated or VPN connection to each slave PATH server. If a link between the master PATH server and a slave PATH server becomes unavailable, the slave PATH server may connect to a different slave PATH server to receive content. In this circumstance, the reconnecting slave PATH server may or may not apply PATH to transmission since the disclosure period has passed.","Slave PATH servers may be implemented in any part of the world, may be designed to handle any number of documents, and may have any number of recipients.","Certain embodiments of the present invention may be modified to work in conjunction with other methods of simultaneous disclosure, including an encryption method disclosed in the '245 patent. Handicapping in this case would be determined by the RTTs from ACK packets received after sending encrypted content.","One method for providing action markup that complies with Reg. FD is to include action markup in a method that already complies with Reg. FD. The SEB\/PATH method, as described hereinabove, may be modified to include action markup. The PATH method inherently ensures that each recipient receives impactful information, such as current earnings statements, substantially simultaneously. After every recipient has been guaranteed receipt of an impactful data block, or IBlock, via the SYNC'ing within the SEB\/PATH method, then it is \u201cfair\u201d to provide an action to at least one recipient. Such a method is Reg. FD compliant because all recipients have already received impactful information, and each recipient has a fair opportunity to act upon it. By placing an action markup after an IBlock, simultaneous disclosure is still assured for all impactful data.","According to an embodiment of the present invention, the \u201cmarking stage\u201d of the SEB\/PATH method would be modified to accommodate action markup by including an element identifier, a condition, and a message in addition to the encoding described above for demarcating impactful elements. Other optional attributes that may be associated with the action markup may include, but are not limited to, user identification information, company information, and applicable date filters.","An \u201celement identifier\u201d is a name corresponding to an \u201cimpactful data element\u201d described above, which may indicate the type of impactful data element, such as verbal description, e.g., \u201ccurrent_earnings\u201d, or a number reference. Element identifiers throughout a document should be unique. If an element identifier appears more than once in a document, the remaining action markup attributes (e.g., the \u201ccondition\u201d and the \u201cmessage\u201d) may be placed only once after the first instance of the impactful data elements having the same identifier, or, alternatively each instance may contain the full set of attributes of an \u201caction markup.\u201d Typically, the \u201celement identifier\u201d matches the name of the element tagged in the document, though this is not required.","The \u201ccondition\u201d comprises two parts: a \u201ctarget value\u201d and a \u201ccomparison.\u201d A \u201ctarget value\u201d is identified primarily, though not exclusively, by the recipient, which is typically a dollar amount or a number. The \u201ctarget value\u201d is acted upon by the \u201ccomparison.\u201d Examples of comparison elements include, but are not limited to, less than, greater than, equal to, etc. The format of the \u201ccondition\u201d attribute is determined and interpreted by the PATH client software (i.e., the PATH server software module  of , , and ). The \u201ccondition\u201d may include a complete text description, such as \u201cless than 1,750,000 million dollars\u201d, or it may be simplified to something like \u201cLT 1.75M\u201d. The \u201ccondition\u201d is formatted after the recipient enters their \u201caction markup information\u201d via a \u201ctrader interface\u201d to be described hereinbelow with respect to .","For each \u201ccondition,\u201d the recipient specifies a \u201cmessage\u201d to be transmitted in their received document if the \u201ccondition\u201d is met. The \u201cmessage\u201d is usually related to the stock market, such as buying or selling stock, but may include other messages such as a reminder to call someone on the phone, making a note of the company for future research, or other key words to be recognized by their client software.","The action markup may include other information (i.e., attributes) used by the PATH server software module , such as user identification information, company information, and date filters. Some attributes may be automatically created from the \u201ctrader interface\u201d, such as the user identification information, which may be taken from the \u201ctrader interface\u201d, after the recipient has logged in. Other optional attributes may include a company and date information, also enterable via the \u201ctrader interface\u201d. The company and date information may be used to determine which documents to be sent to the recipient have an embedded action markup.","Since a document may have multiple IBlocks, a document may contain multiple types of action markups. Similarly, a document may contain multiple action markups for the same \u201cimpactful data element\u201d or IBlock that may comprise combinations of \u201cconditions\u201d and \u201cmessages.\u201d For example, when comparing an earnings statement element to a target value of $450,000, two \u201caction markups\u201d may be created for the earnings statement, e.g., (1) if the earnings statement is less than $450,000, set the action \u201cmessage\u201d to \u201csell\u201d, and (2) if the earnings statement is greater than or equal to $450,000, set the action \u201cmessage\u201d to \u201cbuy\u201d.","A document is modified to include at least one action markup during the \u201cmarking stage\u201d of the SEB\/PATH method during or just after the identification of \u201cimpactful data elements\u201d that may require an action on the part of a recipient but before the document is divided into SEBs, such as, but not limited to earnings statements, sales figures, dollar values etc. An impactful data element that is to include an action markup may be delimited by tags which are placed directly into the document surrounding the element.

In such circumstances, the Web server may have installed and be running a software package that is configured to receive documents. To effect simultaneous receipt of the notification document along with a simultaneous group of intended recipients, the Web server may be included in the simultaneous group that employs the PATH protocol described previously. In certain embodiments of the trigger mechanism, a software module that is to receive the notification document may be located on another server distinct from the Web server that is configured to communicate with the Web Server or is operable to make the source document available through another method to be described hereinbelow.","Notice Exact Access Timing (NEAT)","As used herein, the term Notice Exact Access Timing (NEAT) refers to a method of including a Web server in a simultaneous group employing PATH, such that the Web server receives a notification document substantially simultaneously with all of the intended recipients in the simultaneous disclosure group (who may be receiving the notification or the source document). The notification document sent to the Web server acts a trigger for the Web server to display a source document on a Web page, and the notification document sent to a selection of other intended recipients in the simultaneous disclosure group includes a hyperlink linking to that Web page. By employing the PATH protocol in transmitting the notification document, the Web page containing the source document is posted on the Web server and the other recipients receive the hyperlink substantially simultaneously.","The Notification Document","According to an embodiment of the present invention, a notification document including a hyperlink linking to a source document may include, but is not limited to, the following:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0421","num":"0420"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00080","num":"00080"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"175pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"\u201cCompany A Press Release"]},{"entry":[{},"The press release can be viewed at"]},{"entry":[{},"www.CompanyA.com\/PressRelease.html\u201d"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}}},"In such circumstances, the hyperlink is operable to link to a Web page located on the same Web server included in the simultaneous disclosure group. As a result, the Web server may receive a notification document (which may take one of many forms to be described hereinbelow, and which may or may not take the same form as a notification document sent to other intended recipients) substantially simultaneously as the notification document received by a selection of the rest of the intended recipients of the simultaneous disclosure group. As a result, the Web server may post a Web page containing a source document (i.e., the press release) at substantially the same time that the other recipients receive the link (i.e., the notification document).","According to an embodiment of the present invention, the notification document sent to the Web server may take the form of an HTML document that includes a source document linked to in the notification document sent to the other intended recipients. In such circumstances, the Web server may receive the source document and copy or move it to a directory recognized by the Web server to make it available to the other intended recipients. The HTML document may or may not include an action markup appended to the end of source document, after the HTML content. If included, the action markup may be used to specify special directions to the Web server, such as date and time to release the source document, or it may reiterate that the source document is a trigger and it needs to be posted for the other intended recipients to access. A non-limiting example of such an action markup is listed as follows:","\u201c<html>HTML Content<\/html><Action Element,\u201d notice \u201cMessage=\u201caccess\u201d\/>\u201d","In another embodiment of NEAT, the Web server may already have access to a stored source document that needs to be posted. In such circumstances, a notification document is sent to the Web server which need not include a source document. The notification document may simply be a message identifying the stored source document, or even the same URL link sent to the rest of the simultaneous disclosure group. A non-limiting example of a notification document may include the following:","\u201c<ReleaseDoc name=\u201cDocumentName\u201d\/>\u201d","In circumstances in which a tag is used, the Web server is expecting a specific tag to identify the stored source document and release it. The Web server may parse the notification document to extract the stored source document name or a Web page address, and unlock or release the stored source document for access from a Web browser. The tag may include optional attributes such as a date and time stamp indicating a time to release the stored source document by the Web server.","Source Document Release","On the Web server, software modules such as, but not limited to, Apache HTTP Server, Internet Information Services (IIS), Lighttpd, Nginx, Documentum, SharePoint, and Alfresco are designed to serve Web pages and documents using HTTP to requesting Web browsers. Most Web server software packages and content or document management systems provide a mechanism to lock documents present on the Web server and prevent the locked documents from being viewed by requesting Web browsers. The Web server may have file system directories which are not available to the Web server software, or a lock file may be located in the same file system directory as the Web page. The Web server software may also be configured to block a particular file or directory from being available to requesting Web browsers.","Because there are several methods available in the art for Web server software to prevent a document from unauthorized access, such methods may be employed to enable access to a source document that has been locked. File and directory locking methods vary between Web servers, a few of which are described hereinbelow for illustrative purposes. Many of these mechanisms may be described as server side scripting or processing and atomic file operations.","If the source document is received by the Web server via a notification document and via receiving software located on the Web server, the source document may be moved into a file system directory that is recognized by the Web server software. The Web server may execute a move or copy command to place the source document in a Web server directory, permitting it to be available to an external Web browser. If the receiving software is located on another server, the source document may be transmitted to the Web server via any suitable file transmission method, including, but not limited to, SCP, FTP, or socket streaming and placed in a server directory. A directory containing the source document may be moved under a directory used by the Web server to render the source document available.","In one embodiment, a Web server may already include the source document stored thereon and may be waiting for a release notification. In such circumstances, the source document may be unlocked by removing a file lock from a directory where the source document is located, such as, but not limited to, an .htaccess file. Removing the file lock permits the Web server to make documents in the same directory available to requesting Web browsers. In another embodiment, the Web server, having an unlocked copy of the source document, may employ a move or copy command to place the source document in a Web server directory when the trigger is received.","In an advanced method for unlocking content, a Web page may be available before the release of the source document, but the Web page may employ a scripting language, such as PHP or Javascript, or other Web programming language, to request the source document from another source, such as a database or other content feeder. In such circumstances, when the Web server or another server receives the trigger, an unlock flag field is set in the database corresponding to the source document.","When a request is made for a source document from an external Web browser, the Web server requests the content (i.e., the source document) from its database or other content source to display the source document on the requesting Web page. If the source document is requested before the trigger has been received and the unlock flag is set, the external Web browser receives an unavailable message. When the unlock flag is set, the external Web browsers is permitted to view the source document. This method also works in circumstances where the source document is received when employing PATH protocol and is loaded into the database and the unlock flag is set immediately. Scripting software within a requesting Web page may already contain the source document, but does not display the source document unless a configuration file or other locking mechanism is found on the Web server to enable the source document to be displayed.","In an embodiment, another method for unlocking a source document is via a Web server that permits requests to an external Web page but withholds the transmission of the source document over the requesting connection or channel until such time that a Web server process receives a signal to release the requested source document. The Web server may return ephemeral content to the Web browser specifying a refresh period until the source document is available. External Web browsers requesting the source document will not view any content until the Web browser discontinues returning refreshes, such as a meta-refresh, and returns the requested source document.","In an embodiment, the Web server may be unlocked when the receiving software starts the Web server software if it was not running, or the Web server may enable itself at a specified time.","A person skilled in the art would appreciate that there are numerous methods by which the source document may be make available on a Web server, with each Web server software package operable to release a source document after receiving the source document or a trigger through Action Markup and PATH.","When a trigger includes a date and time attribute, the receiving software may wait until a specified time to execute any of the above unlocking methods. Other attributes may affect the execution of the above unlocking methods.","It is to be understood that the exemplary embodiments are merely illustrative of the invention and that many variations of the above-described embodiments may be devised by one skilled in the art without departing from the scope of the invention. It is therefore intended that all such variations be included within the scope of the following claims and their equivalents."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The present invention may be more readily understood from the detailed description of an exemplary embodiment presented below considered in conjunction with the attached drawings and in which like reference numerals refer to similar elements and in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIGS. 1A-1C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":["FIGS. 2A-2D","FIGS. 1A-1C"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIGS. 3A and 3B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":["FIGS. 3C and 3D","FIGS. 3A and 3B"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIGS. 5A and 5B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIGS. 3C and 3D"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":"FIGS. 8A and 8B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":["FIGS. 9A and 9B","FIGS. 5A and 5B"],"b":["1","2","1","2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":"FIGS. 10A and 10B","b":["1","2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":["FIGS. 11A and 11B","FIGS. 10A and 10B"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIG. 12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":["FIG. 13","FIG. 12"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"figref":"FIGS. 15A and 15B"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
