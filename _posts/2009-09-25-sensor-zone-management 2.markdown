{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present invention generally relates to systems and methods for tracking items. More particularly, the present invention relates to systems and methods for tracking items using a sensor device and using historical information to modify existing or future shipments.","Asset management has always been an important part of commerce. For example, tracking packages is important to organizations of all kinds, whether it be a company keeping track of inventory to be sold in its stores, or a package delivery provider keeping track of packages being transported through its delivery network. To provide quality service, an organization typically creates and maintains a highly organized network for tracking its packages. Effective management of such networks allows lower cost, reduced delivery time, and enhanced customer service.","In addition to tracking packages, parties that ship and receive packages may also need information regarding the conditions of the packages, such as the temperature and humidity of the package. For example, a customer that has ordered a box of wine may want to monitor the temperature of the contents of the box to determine if the temperature and\/or humidity goes above or below a set range. Likewise, the party that ships the package may also want to monitor the conditions of the package to ensure that the content arrives in the proper condition.","Technological advances have enabled items to be tracked in ways that far exceed the functionality of a simple list. A rich information framework now can be applied to describe the item's interaction with its surroundings, such as transportation and custodial handoffs.","Bar codes are one way organizations keep track of items. A retailer, for example, may use bar codes on items in its inventory. For example, items to be sold in a retailer's store may each be labeled with a different bar code. In order to keep track of inventory, the retailer typically scans the bar code on each item. In addition, when an item is sold to a consumer, the bar code for that item is scanned.","Similarly, a package delivery provider may utilize bar codes by associating a bar code with packages to be delivered to a recipient. For example, a package may have a bar code corresponding to a tracking number for that package. Each time the package goes through a checkpoint (e.g., the courier taking initial control of the package, the package being placed in a storage facility, the package being delivered to the recipient, etc.), the package's bar code may be scanned. Bar codes, however, have the disadvantage that personnel must manually scan each bar code on each item in order to effectively track the items.","Radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags are an improvement over typical bar codes. RFID tags do not require manual scanning that is required by typical bar codes. For example, in a retail context, an RFID tag on an inventory item may be able to communicate with an electronic reader that detects items in a shopping cart and adds the cost of each item to a bill for the consumer. RFID tags have also been used to track things such as livestock, railroad cars, trucks, and even airline baggage. These tags typically only allow for basic tracking and do not provide a way to improve asset management using information about the environment in which the items are tracked.","Sensor-based tracking systems are also known which can provide more information than RFID systems. Such systems, however, can be expensive, and may provide extraneous and redundant item information.","Shippers, carriers, recipients, and other parties often wish to know the location, condition, and integrity of shipments before, during, and after transport to satisfy quality control goals, meet regulatory requirements, and optimize business processes. Moreover, parties may want to use this information to modify existing or future shipments to increase the efficiency and timeliness of transportation. To address these requirements, a system is needed that allows parties to receive information regarding past shipments and use this information to modify existing and\/or future shipments.","In one exemplary embodiment, there is provided a method for using tracking information of a shipment to update shipping information. The method may include periodically detecting sensor information of an item by a sensor device. The method may also include periodically transmitting the sensor information by the sensor device. The method may also include receiving the sensor information at a tracking center, storing the sensor information in a database, and reviewing the stored sensor information. The method may further include using the stored sensor information to update shipment information for a package.","It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are not restrictive of the invention, as claimed.","The following detailed description refers to the accompanying drawings. Wherever possible, the same reference numbers are used in the drawings and the following description to refer to the same or similar parts. While several exemplary embodiments and features are described herein, modifications, adaptations and other implementations are possible, without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. For example, substitutions, additions or modifications may be made to the components illustrated in the drawings, and the exemplary methods described herein may be modified by substituting, reordering or adding steps to the disclosed methods. Accordingly, the following detailed description does not limit the invention. Instead, the proper scope of the invention is defined by the appended claims.","System Architecture","By way of a non-limiting example,  illustrates a system  in which the features and principles of the present invention may be implemented. The number of components in system  is not limited to what is shown and other variations in the number of arrangements of components are possible, consistent with embodiments of the invention. The components of  may be implemented through hardware, software, and\/or firmware. System  may include sensor devices -, a tracking center , a network , and clients -","Network  provides communications between the various entities depicted in system . Network  may be a shared, public, or private network and may encompass a wide area or local area. Network  may be implemented through any suitable combination of wired and\/or wireless communication networks (including Wi-Fi networks, GSM\/GPRS networks, TDMA networks, CDMA networks, Bluetooth networks, or any other wireless networks). By way of example, network  may be implemented through a wide area network (WAN), local area network (LAN), an intranet, and\/or the Internet. Further, the entities of system  may be connected to multiple networks , such as, for example, to a wireless carrier network, a private data network, and the public Internet.","Sensor devices -may be devices for use in tracking various items, and may be attached to or included in the items that are to be tracked. For example, sensor device may be attached to or enclosed in a package that is being sent to a recipient using a delivery service such as Federal Express Corporation, (\u201cFedEx\u201d). Alternatively, sensor device may be attached to or enclosed in a container holding inventory being delivered to a retailer. The aforementioned items are exemplary and may comprise any deliverable elements.","Sensor device may store information associated with an item tracking number for a corresponding item. The item tracking number may be a FedEx tracking number or similar tracking number. Sensor device may also store information indicative of other sensor devices which are currently within a given proximity. For example, when an item with a corresponding sensor device is placed inside a vehicle or storage facility that includes at least one other sensor device , sensor device may sense that another sensor device is within a proximity that indicates that the corresponding item is now in the vehicle or storage facility. Information reflecting an association between sensor device and sensor device may then be stored in a memory located at one or more of sensor device , sensor device , and\/or tracking center .","In one embodiment, sensor device may be capable of measuring or detecting one or more conditions such as location, temperature, light level, motion, pressure, humidity, acceleration, gas level, airflow, vibration, or other environmental conditions. Sensor device may also have the ability to directly transmit and receive information to\/from tracking center  via network  by, for example, wireless communications. For example, sensor device may be implemented using a wireless sensor available from Crossbow Technology. One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that alternative sensor devices may be used.","Tracking center  may provide a platform for tracking items being delivered to a recipient. Tracking center  may be implemented using a combination of hardware, software, and\/or firmware, and may be operable to receive and store sensor data from various sensor devices -. For example, sensor device may periodically send tracking center  sensor data reflecting conditions measured or detected by sensor device . Such sensor data may include location, temperature, light level, motion, pressure, humidity, gas level, airflow, vibrations, or other environmental conditions.","Tracking center  is also operable to respond to requests for sensor data. For example, a customer may use client to enter a request for sensor data stored at tracking center . The request may include one or more triggering parameters, which can be used to find the requested sensor data. Exemplary triggering parameters may include a sensor identification number, item tracking number, location, temperature, light level, humidity, acceleration, pressure, gas level, airflow, vibrations, etc. Accordingly, by way of example, a customer may request temperature measurements within a certain range of a specific location. The distance from the specific location is the triggering parameter in that case.","When tracking center  receives a request for sensor data from client , tracking center  may search a database resident at tracking center  and return the requested sensor data, if found. Access to the sensor data may be managed or open. For example, if access is managed, client and\/or the customer is authenticated before sensor data is made available to client and\/or the customer. In addition to or instead of searching a database for sensor data, tracking center  may request sensor data directly from the relevant sensor device ","Tracking center  may also provide updated and\/or new programming for sensor device . Programming, for example, may specify the manner in which a device senses environmental conditions. Programming of the aforementioned device may be altered, for example, by storing new or modified instructions in a memory (not shown) located at the respective device. Programming changes may be made arbitrarily (e.g., at the discretion of a programmer) or in response to a detected condition. For example, suppose sensor device detects a temperature above a certain level. When sensor device reports the temperature level to tracking center , an alarm or alert may be triggered to bring this information to the attention of personnel associated with tracking center . Tracking center , in turn, may alter the programming of sensor device to check the temperature more frequently. One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that other parameters can be used as the basis for altering programming.","Clients -provide users with an interface to network . By way of example, clients -may be implemented using any device capable of accessing a data network, such as a general purpose computer or personal computer equipped with a modem or other network interface. Clients -may also be implemented in other devices, such as a Blackberry\u2122, Ergo Audrey\u2122, mobile phones (with data access functions), Personal Digital Assistant (\u201cPDA\u201d) with a network connection, IP telephony phone, or generally any device capable of communicating over a data network.","Clients -may be utilized by users to request sensor data from tracking center . For example, a user may subscribe to a service that allows the user to access up-to-date information about one or more sensors. Alternatively, a subscription to a service is not necessary to access the information. In order to request sensor data, the user may enter information on client indicative of the desired sensor data. For example, the user may enter information requesting the current location and temperature of all sensors within a certain radius of a specified sensor. After the customer enters this information, client may send a request to tracking center , which in turn may search its database or request the information directly from the sensors. When tracking center  finds the requested information, it may send the information back to client ","Sensor device may be operable to periodically determine whether there are any sensor devices within a certain proximity of sensor device . When sensor device determines that sensor device (e.g. sensor device ) is within its range, sensor device may store information indicative of an association between the two devices. Sensor device may also send this information to tracking center  via network . When sensor device determines that sensor device is no longer within its range, it may update the stored information resident at sensor device and tracking center  to reflect that the devices are no longer associated with each other.","In addition to sending information to tracking center  regarding the association between sensor device and sensor device , sensor device may also receive condition information from sensor device and also transmit that information to tracking center . For example, if sensor device does not have communication rights or the ability to communication with tracking center  (e.g. out of range), sensor device may transmit condition information to sensor , and sensor device may transmit condition information of sensor device and sensor device to tracking center .","According to the above example, sensor device may send condition information, or any other type of information, to sensor device for subsequent transmission to tracking center . However, before sensor device can transmit information to sensor device , an energy management calculation may be invoked (e.g. automatically, at a scheduled time, or based on instructions received from tracking center ) to determine that sensor device has the needed battery power to fulfill its reporting requirements as well as reporting information received from sensor device . If sensor device has sufficient battery power, sensor device may transmit information to sensor device along with a temporarily issued communication right. This temporarily issued communication right may be sent to sensor device from tracking center .","Sensor devices -may also determine the location of other sensor devices. For example, sensor devices -may listen for signals from other sensor devices that may be located in the vicinity of sensor devices -. The signal may be a wireless signal periodically transmitted from one or more other sensor devices. In this manner, the one or more other sensor devices essentially periodically inform sensor devices -that they are located in the vicinity of sensor devices -. Upon receipt of the signal, sensor devices -may use triangulation to determine the location of the one or more additional sensor devices. One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that devices -may use other ways of detecting additional sensor devices.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["104","202","204","206","208","210","212","214","216","218","220","104"]},"Communication server  may be a web server that provides functionality for receiving traffic over a network, such as the internet. For example, communication server  may be a standard web server that a user may access at client using a web browser program, such as Safari, Internet Explorer, or Netscape Communicator. Communication server  is operable to receive requests for sensor data from clients, and pass the requests on to databases -, certificate server , and\/or rules engine  for processing. Communication server  may also send and receive messages for configuration, management, and monitoring of sensor devices -","User management database  may maintain a list of users of the system, user profiles, roles and permissions within the system, user organizations, and the relationship between users and\/or other parties.","Sensor device management database  may maintain a per-party inventory of sensor devices -used to provide monitoring information. Sensor device management database  may also store sensor data received from various sensor devices -. Sensor device management database  may also store association information indicative of associations between sensor devices -","For example, sensor device may periodically send sensor data to tracking center , where it is stored in sensor device management database . Exemplary sensor data may include location, temperature, light level, motion, pressure, humidity, acceleration, gas level, airflow, vibrations, or other environmental conditions. Sensor data that is transmitted to sensor device management database  may be accompanied by information identifying the sensor device -that detected the sensor data.","Association data stored by sensor device management database  may also be periodically sent by sensor devices -. For example, when an activated sensor device becomes positioned within a predetermined proximity of another sensor device , sensor device and\/or sensor device may locally store information reflecting this proximity association. Sensor device may then send tracking center  information indicative of the association. Additionally or alternatively, sensor device may send tracking center  information indicative of the association.","When tracking center  receives a request for sensor data from client , sensor device management database  may be searched for the requested data. If that data is found, it may be sent back to client ","Shipment management database  may contain configuration parameters for one or more shipments. Data management database  may contain data generated by the monitoring of the shipments. This data may be augmented by other systems such as third-party package tracking systems and border-crossing systems (not shown).","Analysis database  may contain an aggregation of all system information for use in analyzing past activities, adjusting configuration parameters, defining new monitoring activities, and predicting future trends. Audit database  may contain information that allows parties to review the monitoring of shipments for conformance to regulations and quality metrics. Archive database  may contain information that provides long-term storage and access of historical data, and a communication sub-system that sends and receives messages for configuration, management, and monitoring to sensor devices -and network .","Certificate server  may be operable to control access to data resident in sensor device management database . For example, client or a user of client may only be authorized to receive sensor data that corresponds to sensor devices -. When that user requests a set of sensor data that includes data for which the client or user has no authorization to access, certificate server  recognizes the lack of authorization and only allows tracking center  to send the client or user the portion of the requested sensor data for which the client or user has authorization.","Rules engine  may be operable to, among other things, send queries to sensor device management database  based on requests for sensor data from client , send requested sensor data to clients -after receiving it from sensor device management database , process sensor data received from sensor devices -, request sensor data from sensor devices -, and alter the programming of sensor devices -",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":"108","i":"a "},"For example, client may include components such as a central processing unit (CPU) , a memory , an input\/output (I\/O) device(s) , an application programming interface (API) , and a database  that can be implemented in various ways. For example, an integrated platform (such as a workstation, personal computer, laptop, etc.) may comprise CPU , memory , I\/O devices , API , and database , interconnected by a local bus . In such a configuration, components , , , , and  may connect through a local bus interface.","CPU  may be one or more known processing devices, such as a microprocessor from the Pentium family manufactured by Intel\u2122 or a mainframe-class processor. Memory  may be one or more storage devices configured to store information used by CPU  to perform certain functions, operations, and steps related to embodiments of the present invention. Memory  may be a magnetic, semiconductor, tape, optical, or other type of storage device. In one embodiment, memory  includes one or more software application programs  that, when executed by CPU , perform various processes consistent with the present invention.","Methods, systems, and articles of manufacture consistent with the present invention are not limited to programs configured to perform dedicated tasks. For example, memory  may be configured with a program  that performs several functions consistent with the invention when executed by CPU . Alternatively, CPU  may execute one or more programs located remotely from client . For example, client may access one or more remote programs that, when executed, perform functions related to embodiments of the present invention. The configuration and number of programs implementing processes consistent with the invention are not critical to the invention.","Memory  may be also be configured with an operating system (not shown) that performs several functions well known in the art when executed by CPU . By way of example, the operating system may be Microsoft Windows\u2122, Unix\u2122, Linux\u2122, an Apple\u2122 operating system such as MAC OSX\u2122, Personal Digital Assistant operating system such as Microsoft CE\u2122, or other operating system. The choice of operating system, and even the use of an operating system, is not critical to the invention.","I\/O device(s)  may comprise one or more input\/output devices that allow data to be received and\/or transmitted by client . For example, I\/O device  may include one or more input devices, such as a network connection, keyboard, touch screen, mouse, microphone, disk reader, and the like, that enable data to be input or received from a user. Further, I\/O device  may include one or more output devices, such as a network connection, display screen, printer, speaker devices, and the like, that enable data to be output or presented to a user. The configuration and number of input and\/or output devices incorporated in I\/O device  are not critical to the invention.","API  is an interface used by client to execute user requests. API  may be used in conjunction with I\/O device  to define, for example, monitoring parameters, events, and notifications with respects to shipments. In addition, API  may query and receive information regarding shipments in response to information received at I\/O device . API  may also update information stored in databases -.","Database  may comprise one or more databases that store information and are accessed and managed through system . By way of example, database  may be an Oracle\u2122 database, a Sybase\u2122 database, or other relational database. As illustrated in , databases - may located within tracking center . However, the information stored in databases - may also be located in database .","Parties","According to one embodiment, a \u201cparty\u201d may refer to an individual, a group, a division, a company, or any combination of individuals, groups, divisions, or companies. For example, when a user sends or receives a shipment, the user may join system . When the user joins, the user may enter his company name, and a party corresponding to the company may be created. After creation of the party, the user may be assigned to the party. When other users that belong to the same company join system , they may also be added to the party.","A party may use system  to collaborate with other business partners. To do so, the party may either identify other parties already present in the system via a search feature, or they can invite users into system . New parties may create collaboration profiles that specify their default policies for sharing information and access to their sensor devices. In addition, parties may also change their profiles at any time. For example, a party may change their profile on a per-shipment basis or may create profiles specific to one or more business partners. Collaboration profiles contain rules that may be invoked against a permission mechanism to enable and restrict access by business partners to information defined or created by other parties.","For example, a party may choose to make information about all of their monitored shipments available to all other parties in the system. Conversely, a party may restrict access to each monitored shipment to only the parties participating in the shipment (e.g. recipient and carrier). This may prevent other parties from accessing the information. The system also contains a mechanism used to govern the amount and level of detail of information access on a per-user basis; this mechanism is discussed further in this document.","The system may also allow the creation of communities of parties which cross organizational boundaries. To do so, users may search for other parties by name, description, or by settings in their collaboration profile that may indicate organizations willing to cooperate in fulfilling some need, such as providing intervention services to assure shipment integrity. To aid the collaborative process, party profiles may include information about the duration of a party's membership in the system and reputation information as expressed by their fellow members. The party profiles may also include operational information, such as the certificates or other configuration information necessary to leverage their telecommunications or computer networks. By granting access to their networks, a party may allow other parties to use them to transmit and receive monitoring and system data.","Permissions","System  may also include a permission mechanism that may be used to implement a set of permissions that grant or deny parties the ability to perform actions related to sensor devices -and databases -. The permission mechanism may be implemented by certificate server . For example, each party may have access to administrative functions that may include defining new parties in the system, adding or removing sensor devices -, and\/or the restricting or permitting access to party shipment information by other parties. Accordingly, permissions may allow a party to grant administrative functions to other parties, such that a party can, for instance, define a set of parties and restrict their ability to view, create, or update sensor devices -, or to create, view, or update one or more shipments or sets of shipments.","This permission mechanism may be used to implement a set of collaboration policies within the system. Organizations, users, devices, shipments, and information stored within the system are created, viewed, modified, and deleted according to rules that take into account the object of the action and the entity performing the action. Rather than exhaustively specify the ability or inability of all other parties to perform such actions, these permissions can refer to roles that imply group membership (e.g. the set of all users belonging to a certain organization, all members of all organizations, all shipments in which a particular organization is a party, etc.). This system allows shared access to information and enables parties to act on this information. Parties collaborate by either actively seeking permission to access and act on data or by being passively granted permission by default. Collaboration policies specify what the default roles and permissions are for entities in the system.","Sensor Device","As previously stated, sensor device may be placed inside a package with the contents of the package. Sensor device may measure or detect one or more conditions such as location, temperature, light level, motion, pressure, humidity, gas level, airflow, vibrations, or other environmental conditions.","Sensor device may report data in several different ways. For example, sensor device may report data based on measurements of at least one of physical quantities (e.g. temperature of 72\u00b0 F.), qualitative assessments (e.g. \u201chot\u201d), relative observations based on a predetermined threshold (e.g. greater than 85\u00b0 F.), a calculated threshold (e.g. average greater than 80\u00b0 F.), and business-events provided by third-party systems (e.g. proof-of-delivery of a shipment). This data may be correlated with the shipment and may be used to report any changes in shipment status or a lack of changes in the status.","Depending upon the capabilities of sensor device , these measurements may be calculated directly by sensor device . However, other measurements may be calculated based on party requirements entered at I\/O device  and processed by API . According to one embodiment, all observations are confirmed by API  because different measurements may be of interest to different parties. For example, a shipping party may wish to know when sensor device measures the presence of 50% relative humidity. However, a receiving party may wish to know when sensor device measures the presence of 80% relative humidity. If sensor device cannot be configured to report against multiple measurement thresholds, then API  may be responsible for performing these calculations.","Parties with sufficient permission can define new sensor devices -within the system by creating a sensor profile. A sensor profile may include a list of monitoring capabilities of sensor device that may describe the conditions that sensor device may observe (e.g. temperature, humidity, location, movement, etc.), the frequency that sensor device may make observations, and the frequency that sensor device reports the observations.","Sensor device may be \u201cowned\u201d by a party because a party may govern access to data even if access is currently unrestricted. For example, some websites may publish weather information by ZIP code. This weather information may be correlated with temperature readings from another sensor device to warn one or more parties of weather conditions. In this example, access may simply be the availability of the website to respond to requests.","In another embodiments, sensor device may be \u201cowned\u201d by a party to the shipping process (e.g. a shipper, recipient, carrier, or logistics provider). In this embodiment, the sensor profile would indicate sensor device ownership and allow that ownership to transfer to a different party upon completion of use. For example, a shipper might use sensor device to assure the integrity of a high-value merchandise to a recipient. Upon proof of delivery to the recipient, the shipper may automatically transfer ownership of sensor device to the recipient. Conversely, a different shipper might want retain ownership of sensor device and this shipper may not transfer ownership of sensor device to the recipient. A shipper may not transfer ownership so that the shipper would be able to use sensor device to aid in a return of defective merchandise.","Some sensor devices -may support inter-device communication using short-range communication mechanisms such as ZigBee. These sensor devices -may use this capability to support business-level activities, such as ensuring the integrity of a set of shipments by mutual visibility and communication. Sensor device owners may also allow shared access to this feature by other sensor devices , particularly sensor devices that are owned by other parties. Sensor devices -with networking capability may also transmit their observations using other sensor devices as communication gateways.","The system may also support profiles describing static (e.g. fixed) and configurable sensor devices -. Via API , the system may define mechanisms and messages that may be used to configure sensor devices -. These messages may include information used to identify the sensor device that is the subject of the message and parameters to define thresholds for measuring observations, reporting observations, and reporting frequency.","Whenever possible, sensor profiles include a description of the power requirements over time of particular monitoring functions, such as the use of a GPS sensor to determine location. When provided, this information can be used to estimate the total power usage over a set of monitoring functions, and this information may be used to estimate the maximum duration of monitoring by sensor device and may be used to assist a party in defining monitoring parameters. If this information cannot be provided, but sensor device can provide diagnostic information specifying the power usage or level over time, historical data may be used to estimate the power requirements for particular sets of commonly used monitoring parameters.","Depending upon the capabilities of sensor device , additional messages can be sent to sensor device providing power and cost management information. This information may include time or location-based periods during which sensor device functions may be reduced in frequency or idled, or during which communication can be restricted or switched to lower cost channels.","These messages may be sent during the initial receipt and setup of sensor device as part of an inventory management function. These messages may also be sent during configuration of sensor device dedicated to a specific kind of transport, storage, value chain production, or other logistics function. Sensor device configuration can be a one-time activity or real-time, dynamic activity reflecting changing conditions or needs of system users or in response to system calculations.","Sensor Device Configuration","The permission mechanism may govern access to particular sensor devices -on a per-user basis, and the permission mechanism may also provide the ability to configure sensor devices -. This configuration information may consist of specifying which capabilities should be used in monitoring information of a particular shipment (e.g. movement, temperature, and humidity) in addition to the actual observation and reporting frequency to employ when providing information. This configuration information may be transmitted to sensor devices -via a device configuration system (not shown). Device configuration system may use an intermediate communication gateway as needed to communicate with sensor devices -. Alternatively, sensor devices -may be configured by a plug-in connection to a programming device, such as a PC having a computer-readable media reader.","After configuration, sensor device may transmit information to a data receiving system which may record the data and make that data available to parties with sufficient permission to view the data. The data may also be passed to a notification system that may compare the data against monitoring parameters. The notification system may also perform further actions, as needed, based on the result of the comparison. These actions may include triggering external system activities, performing calculations that result in new configuration information being sent to sensor device , performing calculations that result in new configuration information for use in further monitoring, and correlating data from sensor devices -or historical data. The system may also supplement data provided by sensor devices -with information provided by the carrier or other external systems, either by receiving messages via the API or by querying these systems for data. This information may be viewed as third-party information and it may be combined with the sensor information and presented to the appropriate parties.","In addition to configuring a single sensor device , the system may also transmit future configuration parameters for storage on sensor device based on the capabilities of sensor device . For example, if the monitoring frequency of sensor device should change during shipment to allow more precise monitoring of its location as it nears a destination of the recipient, these parameters may be sent to sensor device and sensor device may automatically modify the reporting configuration.","Sensor device configuration and access to data may be defined either collaboratively or on a per shipment basis. For example, in a particular shipment, both the shipper and the receiver may want to define monitoring parameters that may not be consistent. One way to accomplish this may be to use two sensor devices and , where sensor device provides data to the shipper and sensor device provides data to the receiver. However, using two sensor devices is not efficient. Therefore, rather than using two sensor devices to monitor and transmit data, the shipper and the receiver may share a single sensor device ","Rules may be defined within the system that limit or force the shipper and the receiver to negotiate the implemented monitoring configuration parameters. The system can allow the shipper and the receiver to be effectively unaware that sensor device is being shared. This may be accomplished by restricting the data available to the shipper and the receiver by events and thresholds defined by each party. For example, a receiver may desire location reporting at city-level at half-hour intervals, and the shipper may desire address-level reporting at hourly intervals. Sensor device may be configured to report address-level reporting at half-hour intervals, but each party would only see information at the requested level (e.g. address vs. city) and requested frequency (e.g. half-hour vs. hour).","According to another embodiment, a shipper may define the reporting configuration of sensor device to restrict the receiver from viewing data regarding the shipment to certain locations or during certain times. In addition, the configuration of sensor device may also permit the receiver to view all data of the shipment once it has entered within a certain radius of the delivery location.","As previously stated, parties may define a shipment within the system. Examples of shipments may include the delivery of goods, the return shipment of any sensor device and\/or goods to the shipment origin or other location, the shipment of multiple items from a common origin through common intermediate points to multiple independent destinations, the aggregation of multiple shipments from separate origins to a common destination, and combinations of these scenarios.","These events may range from simple matching (e.g. the temperature of sensor device has reached a certain threshold) to complex chains of independent or related events (e.g. a shipment has moved after 5 PM on certain day and the temperature and humidity have not exceeded a certain threshold after 20 minutes of movement). Since the specification of these events may be limited based on the capabilities of sensor device , the system may prevent parties from attempting to specify events that cannot be provided by sensor device . A party that owns sensor device may modify the device's profile to limit the volume of monitoring observations provided to other parties. The party may also limit the specificity of data provided and the frequency of data reporting by specifying a delay before another party may view or interact with data from sensor device ","A party may also only partially specify the configuration information for later use. This configuration information may act as a template where certain values may be specified, such as the origin of the shipment, the type of sensor device to use for monitoring the shipment, and the type and frequency of monitoring data to collect. While this information may be specified during configuration, one of ordinary skill would appreciate that this information may be modified by the party during shipping.","Parties may also define relationships between shipments, such that two or more shipments originating from different locations and traveling to a common destination may be defined and queried by API  and viewed via UI  as a group. Likewise, multiple shipments traveling together from an origin to destination may be similarly grouped, and multiple shipments starting from a common point but ultimately arriving at more than one destination may be similarly grouped. This association of shipments may allow the party to define common configuration parameters across the group and may also simplify viewing, updating, and other operations. Multiple shipments may also be aggregated to provide a \u201csafety net\u201d feature. A \u201csafety net\u201d feature may be preferable when tracking shipments because this feature may reflect multiple activities, locations, and other monitoring data. Moreover, too great a variance in any of these data parameters could be used by a party to determine an error in the logistics process.","For example, a shipment of goods may be sent from three different plants A, B, and C and may all travel to a common intermediate point D (e.g. an assembly plant). Intermediate point D may ship the entire shipment of goods to a distributor E, and distributor E may separate the goods into three different shipments sending the goods to a return location F, a warehouse G, and a warehouse H. After return location F, warehouse G, and warehouse H receive the appropriate shipments, return location F may send the shipment back to plant A. In addition, warehouse G may send the shipment to a retailer I, and warehouse H may keep the shipment.","When defining common destination of multiple shipments, the system may optimize the use of sensor devices -to meet the monitoring requirements of different parties while also minimizing the number of sensor devices -in use. Optimizing the use of sensor devices -may also minimize the overall power used by sensor devices -and the aggregate number of communications required to report the status of the shipments. While the above examples have explained the use of a single sensor device to monitor several shipments, one of ordinary skill would appreciate that a party may choose to monitor a single shipment using multiple sensor devices -to ensure monitoring parameters by calculating information from each of sensor devices -or performing more sophisticated analysis based on known capabilities, accuracy, and precision of sensor devices -","According to another embodiment, sensor devices -may each be placed in separate packages for shipping and may travel together when each of the packages is transported as a group (e.g. cartons on a pallet). In this embodiment, sensor devices -may be configured to determine a master sensor device that may receive information from other sensor devices. Based on this configuration, sensor devices -may all communicate with each other, but only sensor device transmits information to tracking center .","Sensor devices -may also be configured to opportunistically take advantage of third-party communication networks, such as WiFi networks. Sensor devices -may sense and report third-party communication networks that may provide compatible communication channels during transport back to tracking center . If these channels are open for communication, sensor devices -may use them if other preferred channels are not open or if they can be used to reduce power consumption and\/or cost. If these networks belong to parties in system , a party with sufficient permission may view these networks and obtain appropriate credentials to enable the use of these networks. If the credentials are approved, the information regarding these networks may be sent and downloaded by sensor devices -","Databases - may act as a feedback mechanism for sensor devices -. Based on data transmitted from sensor devices -to the databases -, information derived from sensor devices -either alone or in combination with information from other sensor devices -, information derived from third party systems, or historical information from sensor devices -used in monitoring similar shipments (e.g. matching the origin and destination of a current shipment or matching the shipper and recipient), system  may transmit new or updated configuration parameters to sensor devices -","For example, if system  notices that the temperature reported by a sensor device is trending upward, system  may reconfigure sensor device to increase the rate and\/or precision of temperature measurement and reporting based on the capabilities of sensor device . This ability to reconfigure sensor device is especially important if a party indicated that the temperature should be monitored and sensor device should provide information if the temperature is approaching a critical threshold. System  may also use historical measurements to detect anomalous events. For example, an average transit time from origin to a particular mid-point may be 15 hours with a standard deviation of an hour based on historical data. However, a particular shipment may taking longer (e.g. 17 hours). If this occurs, parties monitoring the shipment may be alerted even though the parties had not requested notification of such an event in advance. Historical data may also be used to determine unusual data, such as delays in movement that might be the result of an accident.","In addition to monitoring shipments, system  may use historical information to modify existing shipments and\/or plan future shipments. For example, if stored condition information indicates that shipments being routed through Phoenix in the summer experience increased temperature and vibration, the shipper may use this information to adjust routing habits. Instead of routing a package from Memphis to Los Angeles through Phoenix, the shipper may instead route the package from Memphis to Los Angeles through Minneapolis. In addition, system  may use condition information to avoid other locations along the route based on additional seasonality conditions that may interfere with the integrity of the shipment. System  may route a shipment that is currently in route and may also use condition information to modify future shipments to avoid certain areas or zones.","By using historical condition information received from one or more sensor devices over a period of time, the parties may be able to avoid known locations that may present challenges to the shipping process. In addition to seasonal conditions, historical information may also provide the parties with information regarding country specific rules, such as encryption rights and regulations of different countries or zones. For example, if a shipment is being set to China, China may have different encryption rights and regulations. Based on past shipments, system  may determine the encryption rights and regulations of China, and tracking center  may send instructions to sensor device to reconfigure the encryption rights of sensor device to meet the new requirements. This reconfiguration may be done in real-time as the shipment enters China. A further description of real-time monitoring is discussed below. In addition to real-time reconfiguration, system  may use encryption rights and regulations to modify to configuration of sensor device before shipment.","Sensor device may also transmit other data to system  even though this data might not be individually identifiable or actionable. For example, sensor device may report the number and type of observations they have made using standard or custom units of measure (e.g. observations per hour). This data may be transmitted in the same manner as other sensor data. However, the party that currently \u201cowns\u201d sensor device (e.g. the party that is authorized to control sensor device ) may choose whether this data is stored with the other data. If it is, the party may, based on the party profile, make this data available to other parties both during shipment and afterwards as historical data.","Parties may record information about communication networks, such as WiFi or other wireless networks, for use by sensor device for sending and receiving monitoring and other system information. This information may include the location of wireless access points or other communication gateway devices, security credentials, certificates, and other security information necessary to use the network. This information may also include specifications regarding limits on the amount of data that can be transferred by parties over the network, the duration of use within certain timeframes, and other information necessary to ensure proper use.","For system  to report the information about a shipment, an association may be made between the sensor device that is monitoring the shipment and a shipment identifier. This would typically be done at the time the shipment is created when a tracking number for the shipment is generated and the package is ready to be sealed. This process may occur at I\/O  where the party may input or select a unique sensor identifier and a shipment identifier. The sensor identifier can be any unique number such as the hardware ID, SIM card number, or the device phone number. The shipment identifier can be the tracking number, freight shipment number, customer order number, or any unique identifier for that package. A sensor device may also be associated with groups of individual shipments or consolidated packages traveling together under one shipment, such as a pallet. Likewise, multiple sensors devices -may be associated to a single shipment if, for example, battery life of one of sensors devices -is inadequate to cover the entire route.","The association may also take place prior to the time a shipment is ready to be sent. This may occur if the shipper wants to monitor conditions during manufacturing or assembly but shipment details for the product have not been determined yet. In this example, the association could be between at least one of sensors devices -and the shipper's internal order identifier. After the order has been completed and prepared for shipment, the shipment number could be added to the shipment to complete the associations. A similar process may also occur when monitoring a product after the end of a shipment.","The shipper may also define a termination point of the shipment (e.g. at the recipient). When the shipment arrives at the termination point, the association between sensor device and the shipment identifier would cease. At this time, sensor device may be available to be associated with another shipment. One of ordinary skill would appreciate that the termination point may be negotiable between the shipper and recipient if the detailed information about the shipment is of interest to both parties.","Real-Time Monitoring","After an association occurs, sensor device may report data on a periodic basis, and this data may be available to the appropriates parties via I\/O . This data is presented as a set of information about that shipment and may include, for example, multiple environmental elements, location, progress of the shipment, and overall status. This information may be presented graphically, in table format, or via a map view.","The timeliness of the data is contingent both on network availability and latency. When cellular backhaul is the sole communication method, data availability may be impacted by network conditions. Short range communication options such as WiFi and Zigbee are also a possibility and may be used as either a primary transmission method or a secondary transmission method. When communication with a network is not possible, the data received by sensor device may be logged and stored in sensor device and transmitted when communication is available.","In addition to specified monitoring parameters (e.g. location, temperature, and humidity), sensor device may also transmit other data as part of the monitoring information. This data may be transmitted to system  via messages, and the message formats and receiving mechanisms may be specified by API  via I\/O) . This data is stored as part of the monitoring information and is accessible to all parties having access to the shipment data.","The monitoring frequency may be determined by the party at the start of the shipment and may differ from the communication frequency. These frequencies may also be altered during the shipment if two-way communication with sensor device is available. During monitoring, if sensor device recognizes that its data storage space is limited, sensor device may be configured to cease monitoring, reduce the frequency of observation, begin overwriting past observations, calculate new observations that attempt to summarize the values of previous observations (e.g. the average temperature over multiple observations and location based on a set of latitude\/longitude locations), or any combination.","Parties may also choose to view the information generated during the monitoring of a shipment using filters that limit or narrow the type and number of observations presented. For example, a party may choose to view information generated or calculated during a specific time period, or a party may chose to only view information that meets criteria such as a measurement being above a threshold value. Moreover, parties may also view lists of shipments, inventory, or other monitored goods using these same criteria. Parties may sort and filter these lists, which may provide for separate viewing of information regarding, for example, shipments that are in motion and shipments that have generated a notification.","Sensor device may also be used to observe the status of a package both before and after the shipping process. For example, sensor device may monitor the status of a package stored in a warehouse after manufacture or in a distribution center after delivery. This is useful for performing asset or inventory management. Monitoring a package after shipment may require additional configuration parameters, such as a delivery event notification via a third party API or manual intervention by the third party to determine when the monitoring period begins.","For example, a third party system may be a warehouse management system that tracks the arrival or departure of shipments from a facility. This information may be used as another source of shipment status (e.g. shipped, received) or as indication of location if GPS or other location sensors could not work due to building interference or other factors. Another example of a third party system may be a temperature monitoring system within a building that provides an network-accessible source of information regarding the temperature and humidity status of a room. This information may provide additional information (e.g. ambient environmental condition) or as a correlation factor in confirming the condition of a shipment.","When a third party system is used to provide monitoring information, this information must be correlated with other monitoring information and\/or the shipment. For example, if the shipper uses a carrier with shipment tracking service, the tracking service may report information based on a shipment tracking number, rather than sensor device . Accordingly, when a third party system is used as a data source to provide additional information, the information may be transmitted to system  along with the shipment tracking number so that the information from the third party system may be correlated with the shipment.","Events and Notification","As appreciated by those of skill in the art, the monitoring process may include an active notification of parties or systems in response to a change in the status of a shipment. Notifications may be generated by system  based on the information collected by the sensor devices -or based on non-sensor activities. These notifications may include a notification of new data that may include a signal indicating an alert condition (e.g. change in light, temperature, humidity). The timely departure from pre-defined location may generate a geofence notification (e.g. movement in or out of a specified area) whereas a temperature sensor reading exceeding the defined thresholds may trigger an environmental alert. These messages may be transmitted to the appropriate party or parties using multiple methods depending on the severity of the message. Notifications may be presented to the appropriate party or parties via email, Short Message Service (SMS), display on I\/O , and presentation to a third party system via mechanisms specified by the appropriate party.","When defining a shipment, a party may specify start, intermediate, and end points based on either static or dynamic criteria. For example, a recipient may define the origin of a shipment as an address or a geofence boundary enclosing a particular area. In addition, the recipient may define the destination as the region \u201c30 minutes\u201d from a delivery address, where the \u201c30 minute\u201d boundary would be determined during shipment by the speed of sensor device , a vehicle containing the shipment, or some other mechanism. Start, intermediate, and end points may be defined using simple criteria, such as a reading from a clock, or by combining multiple criteria in complex ways. For example, the start of a shipment may be described as the movement of sensor device after a certain time. The definition of any of these conditions may be specified as requiring all of them (a logical AND), any one of them (logical OR), as following a pre-defined sequence of occurrence, or as the lack of an occurrence within a specified time window (logical NOT). The intermediate points may represent logistics process steps, such as distribution or manufacturing locations, or time periods where particular readings are expected.","Arbitrary regions may be also be defined by applying restrictions on shipment data visibility. For example, a carrier may wish to restrict visibility to its shipping network. Therefore, the carrier may define regions covering its facilities or time periods covering modes of shipment. These regions may be defined independent of any particular shipment and may then be applied to individual shipments or set as a default setting applying to all shipments that meet certain criteria.","Environmental thresholds and location boundaries may also be stored on sensor device and would not require activity from system . Sensor device may also alter its monitoring or reporting activity based on sensor data or location information. Other triggers for alerts may include movement as detected by sensor device , a schedule as calculated by system , or carrier information.","Alert settings for an individual shipment may be applied at the beginning of shipment and may be modified remotely by the party or automatically adjusted based on conditions detected by sensor device . System  may use these alerts to control monitoring as well. For instance, if a shipment is received at a customs clearing location and requires additional confirmation, sensor device may detect that the shipment is not moving and may transmit that information to system . Based on this information, system  may re-configure the sensor device to reduce power consumption, thus extending the monitoring ability of sensor device in an effort to guarantee that sensor device can still fulfill monitoring requirements once the shipment passes customs. If other shipments have sensor devices -that monitor the package through customs, historical monitoring data may be used to estimate the duration of this period. This may result in a more accurate reconfiguration and may provide interested parties with information to better describe the logistics process.","Alert notifications to parties and system  may be configured to require an acknowledgement of receipt. Notifications that are not acknowledged within a pre-configured timeframe may automatically transition their recipient to other parties or trigger other actions such as executing rules, generating other notifications, and sending messages to other systems.","Data","Aside from monitoring data, parties can choose to store other unstructured data in data management database . This data may include documents representing agreements between parties, reports covering shipments, shipment documents such as bills or proof of delivery, sensor device proof of ownership, and other information useful in the logistics process. This data is subject to the same collaborative sharing access rules as other information stored in data management database .","Archive","The information gathered and calculated during the monitoring of shipments (e.g. historical data) may be available to the party that configured the monitoring parameters for a configurable period after the monitoring ends. The duration of the configurable period is set by a party in system  with sufficient administrative permission. If multiple parties are collaborating in the monitoring of a shipment, all parties can view and interact with this information for the defined period. At the end of the defined period, the information may be archived in archive database . When the information is archived, the shipment information and its associated data does not appear in any lists presented by I\/O . Accordingly, archived data may be considered hidden from view. Parties may choose to prevent one or more shipments from being archived. In addition, parties may manually choose to archive shipments before system  would automatically archive the information or after having chosen previously to not archive the information. Archive database  may also aggregate all archived data for use in analysis by parties.","Historical data may also be used to create shipment \u201ctemplates.\u201d For example, when a shipper is configuring a shipment, the shipper may input numerous data elements (e.g. destination, carrier, etc.). However, some data elements may not be known until the shipping order is created (e.g. tracking number or date specific service levels like Saturday delivery). Accordingly, the shipment template, which is a named shipment configuration that has at least one of the shipment configuration elements input, may be missing data elements. Rather that spending the time and resources to recreate a shipment template, it may be easier to start with the configuration of a past, successful shipment and adjust or remove data elements as appropriate to adjust for other shipments that fit the intended profile. Alternatively, an automated process could cluster past, successful shipments based on configuration similarities to the shipment selected and assist the party by flagging the configuration values that are likely to require attention for a particular shipment.","By way of example, a shipper may notice that most shipments to a receiver are almost identical, and a data element corresponding to the carrier may depend on how quickly the receiver requires the shipment. Therefore, the shipper may create an shipment template based on a previous shipment, and the shipper may flag the carrier as unspecified in the shipment template so that the shipper may be required to set the carrier when he creates a new shipment.","According to another example, a shipper may have a new employee that may create a new shipment template for a shipment to a receiver. The employee may choose the wrong carrier. System  may access the historical data stored in archive database , and system  may notice that this shipment template is very similar to previous shipments, but the carrier has never been used before for this type of shipment. The shipper may then be prompted for confirmation that the carrier is correct. In response, the shipper may correct the mistake or, if he decides that the carrier is correct, he could confirm the selection.","In addition, access to historical data provides parties with the opportunity to detect deviations from specified monitoring parameters and to infer and suggest better parameters, such as more precise thresholds or more accurate location and time values. For example, a receiver may notice that a geofence describing the delivery destination encloses his entire distribution center, an area covering 15 acres. The historical data may indicate that the monitoring of the shipments ends within a much smaller area (e.g. several hundred square feet). The receiver may then update the parameters used to create new shipments with this smaller region. In addition, the carrier for these shipments may also realize that all shipments delivered to a particular address end up being delivering to a particular receiving dock location. The carrier may update their parameters to reflect this information.","Having access to historical data allows the opportunity to characterize recurring problems in similar shipments either by manual inspection or automatic data mining. For example, if a shipper is examining past shipments, he may discover that the percentage of packages above a predetermined temperature threshold increases during a certain time of year for ground shipments but not for express shipments. This information may alert the shipper to, for example, investigate if seasonal packaging with additional insulation is cheaper than simply switching the service level to express.","Analysis","In addition to viewing party data, sensor device , and shipment data, parties may also have access to historical data stored in analysis database . Subject to access permissions, parties may analyze current and historical data. For example, parties may view an aggregate depiction all of their organization's shipments. When other organizations create and monitor shipments, this data is also available for analysis, although these organizations may specify that their data is not identifiable. This may result in analysis database  replacing organization names and other identifiers with unique, generic values.","In addition to using GPS technology, the parties may also use Assisted GPS (A-GPS). A-GPS enhances the startup performance of a GPS satellite-based positioning system. In order to take advantage of A-GPS services, a receiver needs to have a general idea of its current position and a confidence interval that describes the confident the receiver has in knowing its current position. This allows the A-GPS service to determine what satellites the GPS receiver should be able to see, thereby allowing the receiver to avoid wasting resources searching the spectrum for satellites that are not currently visible to its location. Whenever a sensor device sends a GPS position to an application, a cell base station that is associated with sensor device is recorded along with identifying information for any other cell base station that is \u201cvisible\u201d to, that is within some of sensor device . Since the upper limit on cell size is known, it is possible for the application to calculate positions and confidence intervals for sensor device using historical position data.","In order for this to occur, the application may build a graph using previously seen cell sites as points (nodes) and creates edges (lines) between points that have been reported as visible to sensor device at the same time. For example, if sensor device is associated with cell A but can also see cells B, C, and D, then the points for A, B, C, and D are all connected to each other by graph edges. Once the graph is created, a table may be created by visiting each point in the graph and determining how many edges must be traveled from the given point to the nearest point that has had a valid GPS reading associated with it. The confidence interval may then be calculated by adding one half to the number of edges traversed and multiplying the result by the expected cell diameter. If multiple GPS associated points are equidistant from the current point, the GPS readings may be averaged.","When sensor device first connects to the application, the application may access the information based on the cell sites currently visible to the sensor device . If any of the visible cell sites have been previously seen and associated with a GPS reading, the application may use the calculated position and confidence interval as the seed position and confidence interval required by the A-GPS service.","Flowchart",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0118","num":"0117"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":"400"},"One or more sensor devices -are set up based on the requirements of a shipper (step ). For example, a party may require specific programming (specifying, for example, the manner in which a device detects environmental conditions) for sensor devices -that are to be associated with items to be sent to recipients.","Sensor devices -may be activated and associated with the item(s) being shipped (step ). For example, a courier or other employee of the shipper may turn on sensor device and place it in or attach it to packaging associated with a corresponding item. The courier or other employee may also associate sensor device with an item tracking number. For example, the courier or other employee may cause information to be stored at tracking center  that specifies that the item tracking number is currently assigned to an identification number for the item tracking device. Alternatively, no item tracking number is associated with sensor device ","As noted above with reference to , sensor device may include sensors that measure or detect one or more conditions such as location, temperature, light level, motion, pressure, humidity, gas level, airflow, vibrations, or other environmental conditions. Sensor device that includes such sensors may transmit the sensor data either periodically, on a specified schedule, or on demand. The data is then received by tracking center  (step ).","When tracking center  receives sensor data, tracking center  may store the data in device management database , and the information may also be stored in archive database  as described above. Tracking center  may also query analysis database . As stated above, analysis database  may contain an aggregation of all system information for use in analyzing past activities, adjusting configuration parameters, defining new monitoring activities, and predicting future trends. Using this aggregation of information, an application that may be stored on a computer-readable medium at, for example, tracking center  may review the information (step ).","Based on the aggregation of information, the application may determine possible locations or zones along the shipment route that may adversely affect the integrity of the shipment. As stated above, if stored condition information indicates that shipments being routed through Phoenix in the summer experience increased temperature and vibration, the application may provide this information to the shipper, and the shipper may use this information to adjust routing habits. Instead of routing a package from Memphis to Los Angeles through Phoenix, the shipper may instead route the package from Memphis to Los Angeles through Minneapolis. If the shipper decides to modify the route of an existing shipment or a future shipment, the shipper may indicate this information to the application, and the application may update shipment information of an existing shipment or a future shipment (step ). As previously stated, this update may occur in real-time.","While the above example indicated that the shipper modified the route, the use of the shipper (or any other party) is not needed. For example, the application may determine that the package should be re-routed, and the tracking center  may provide this information directly to sensor device ","In addition to updating shipment information, the application may also update sensor device . Based on encryption rights and regulations of different countries or zones, the application may determine the necessary encryption rights and regulations for sensor device , and tracking center  may send instructions to sensor device to reconfigure the encryption rights of sensor device to meet the new requirements. This reconfiguration may be also be done in real-time. In addition to real-time reconfiguration, tracking center  may use encryption rights and regulations to modify the configuration of sensor device before shipment.","While certain features and embodiments of the invention have been described, other embodiments of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art from consideration of the specification and practice of the embodiments of the invention disclosed herein.
