title: Container conveyor load transfer
abstract: A wheel supported conveyor having a central platform crane section disposed between opposite end crane sections is positioned in underlying relation to a container holding spreader of a dockside terminal crane for transfer of containers to and from the chassis of trucks moved into loading positions without obstruction along parallel spaced passage lanes formed in the end crane sections. Sections of a roller track are respectively associated with each of the conveyor crane sections for displacement of the containers laterally between a common track path and the truck passage lanes. Container spreaders are slidably mounted on the end crane sections effecting said lateral displacement of containers between the truck passage lanes and the common roller track path.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefore.","The present invention relates to the transfer of standard load containers between adjacent locations such as dockside positioned cranes and land-based vehicles.","Current arrangements for transfer of containers to and from dockside located marines vessels or ships involve use of a relatively large marine terminal crane. In large sea ports, delivery and retrieval of containers from the marine terminal crane is a bottleneck so as to require use of additional equipment and time consuming container transfer, leading to a line up of delivery vehicles awaiting container pickup. It is therefore an important object of the present invention to provide a method and apparatus for more efficient and less time consuming transfer of containers between a marine terminal crane and land based vehicles such as trucks and railroad trains.","Pursuant to the present invention, a roller track is formed by aligned track sections respectively underlying wheeled crane units of a wheeled conveyor to which such track sections are respectively connected for transfer of containers therebetween. The central crane unit features a prepping platform through which containers of different sizes on its roller track section may be adjustably positioned in alignment under the spreader bar of a marine terminal crane for vertical transfer of containers to and from the central crane unit after the containers are delivered to and from a pair of end crane units through which parallel spaced track lanes are established on opposite sides of the prepping platform on the central crane unit for passage of trucks with containers thereon. Containers are transferred, by laterally slidable spreaders, between vehicle trucks and the roller track sections associated with the end crane units without obstruction.","Referring now to the drawings in detail,  illustrate through side and bottom elevation views a wheeled conveyor  before transfer thereto of three containers ,  and  as shown positioned thereon in , illustrating the conveyor  at a location underlying a spreader bar  depending from a conventional type of marine terminal crane as generally known in the art. The conveyor  as shown in  has two end crane units  and  interconnected by a prepping platform type of central crane unit . The conveyor crane units ,  and  are respectively provided with a roller track section ,  and  secured to the bottom portions of the crane units ,  and  in alignment so as to establish a common roller path , as denoted in , along which movement of containers may be guided during travel between the conveyor crane end units  and  to and from the central crane unit .","Each of the conveyor crane units ,  and  is of a similar construction having wheel support. Thus, the end crane units  and  have rectangular top frames  and  from which gantry legs  extend downwardly to lower ends on which wheels  are mounted for travel surface support of the end crane units  and  with their top frames  and  in horizontal alignment with each other at an upper level as shown in FIG. . Such top frames  and  are of a width greater than that of a top frame  associated with the central crane unit  positioned at a lower level below the horizontally aligned top frames  and  of the end crane units  and  as shown in . Gantry legs  extend downwardly from the top frame  of the central crane unit , with wheels  mounted thereon for travel surface support of the central crane unit  with the horizontal top frames  and  of the end crane units  and , projecting laterally in opposite directions from the top frame  of the central crane unit  as shown in . A pair of parallel spaced travel lane paths  and  as designated in  are thereby established underlying the top frames  and  for load transport trucks, such as the motor truck  as shown in  having the container  positioned on its chassis. The width dimensions of the end crane units  and  established by their top frames  and  relative that of the top frame  of the central unit  is such as to accommodate passage of the trucks  along the travel paths  and  past opposite sides of the central unit  with the container  or  thereon.","Each of the end crane units  and  also has a stack spreader  slidably suspended from the top frames  and  by spreader support elements  which are slidably displaceable laterally along the width of the top frames  and  between track bars  as shown in FIG. . Thus, the container  attachable to the spreader  may be displaced between a position overlying the truck  and the roller track  supported by wheels  on the truck  as shown in  to establish the roller track travel path  or  in laterally spaced relation to each other as shown in FIG. .","The top frame  of the central crane unit  has a pair of alignment hopper guides  as shown in ,  and  adjustably mounted thereon through which containers of different size, such as the smaller container , may be vertically transferred by the crane spreader bar  between a marine terminal crane and the roller track section  associated with the central crane unit . As shown in , such roller track section  has recesses  at selected locations thereon to accommodate lock installation and removal.","It will be apparent from the foregoing description that the conveyor  provides two truck lanes along the travel paths  and  laterally spaced from the common track roller path  for use of the three crane units ,  and  so as to substantially reduce the time required for transfer of different sized containers to and from a truck chassis positioned under the top frames  and  of the crane units  and . The central crane unit  is positioned in alignment under the crane spreader bar  by movement of the conveyor  aided by use of the hopper guides . Furthermore, the two longer containers  and  of a 40-foot length for example, may be off-loaded at the same time from the roller track path established by the three track sections ,  and . A different length container , of a shorter 20-foot length for example as shown in , may also be handled with the central crane unit  positioned as the prepping platform.","Obviously, other modifications and variations of the present invention may be possible in light of the foregoing teachings. It is therefore to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING","p":["A more complete appreciation of the invention and many of its attendant advantages will be readily appreciated as the same becomes better understood by reference to the following detailed description when considered in connection with the accompanying drawing wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIGS. 1 and 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
