title: Pyrochlore catalysts for hydrocarbon fuel reforming
abstract: A method of catalytically reforming a reactant gas mixture using a pyrochlore catalyst material comprised of one or more pyrochlores having the composition ABB′B″O, where y>0 and z≧0. Distribution of catalytically active metals throughout the structure at the B site creates an active and well dispersed metal locked into place in the crystal structure. This greatly reduces the metal sintering that typically occurs on supported catalysts used in reforming reactions, and reduces deactivation by sulfur and carbon. Further, oxygen mobility may also be enhanced by elemental exchange of promoters at sites in the pyrochlore. The pyrochlore catalyst material may be utilized in catalytic reforming reactions for the conversion of hydrocarbon fuels into synthesis gas (H+CO) for fuel cells, among other uses.

No. 12\/422,346 filed on Apr. 13, 2009 now U.S. Pat. No. 8,133,463, and which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.","The United States Government has rights in this invention pursuant to the employer-employee relationship of the Government to the inventors as U.S. Department of Energy employees and site-support contractors at the National Energy Technology Laboratory.","A method of catalytically reforming a reactant gas mixture using a pyrochlore catalyst material comprised of one or more pyrochlores having the composition ABB\u2032B\u2033O. Distribution of catalytically active metals throughout the structure at the B site creates an active and well dispersed metal locked into place in the crystal structure. This greatly reduces the metal sintering that typically occurs on supported catalysts used in reforming reactions, and reduces deactivation by sulfur and carbon. Further, oxygen mobility may also be enhanced by elemental exchange of promoters at sites in the pyrochlore. The pyrochlore catalyst material may be utilized in catalytic reforming reactions for the conversion of hydrocarbon fuels into synthesis gas (H+CO) for fuel cells, among other uses.","The combustion of fossil fuels (i.e. coal, petroleum and natural gas) is the primary source of power production in transportation and stationary power applications. However, combustion is relatively inefficient compared to advanced processes, due to significant heat and frictional losses during the conversion process. Furthermore, the products of combustion, including NO, SO, particulate matter, CO, and CO, are the subject of current and anticipated regulations. There is therefore an interest in energy conversion technologies that utilize fossil fuel resources more efficiently with less of an environmental impact.","For example, one effective means of using fossil fuels as an energy source is to catalytically reform them into synthesis gas (H+CO), which can then be converted to electrical power in a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC). Of the available alternative technologies, no other energy production method offers the combination of clean energy and efficiency provided by a SOFC. Because a wide range of fuels can be used, SOFCs have proven to be versatile, and can be used in such applications as auxiliary power units (APUs) for diesel trucks, as well as decentralized stationary power for commercial and military applications.","Three main catalytic reforming reactions can be used to convert hydrocarbon fuels into synthesis gas (H+CO) for fuel cells: steam reforming (SR), catalytic partial oxidation (CPOX), and autothermal reforming (ATR).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"30.06mm","wi":"68.07mm","file":"US08241600-20120814-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"The choice of reforming reaction depends on the application. For fuel cell applications listed where fast light-off, kinetics, quick dynamic response and compactness are of most benefit, CPOX is generally favored. For applications that favor efficiency, SR is generally favored due to its ability to utilize system heat in the reformer. In other applications, ATR or some other degree of oxidative steam reforming (OSR) is desired because of the ability to control the reformate gas composition and minimize heat transfer limitations.","A wide variety of hydrocarbons can be reformed to produce synthesis gas, including natural gas, coal, gasoline and diesel. Of these fuels, diesel is an attractive and practical choice in many cases, because of its high hydrogen density and well developed distribution infrastructure. Again, the choice is application dependent. However, it is also the most difficult fuel to reform because diesel fuel is a mixture of a wide variety of paraffin, naphthene, aromatic and organosulfur compounds, each of which reacts differently in a CPOX reaction sequence. The specific nature of each of these components, i.e. chain length of n-paraffins, substituents attached to hydrocarbon rings, and degree of saturation of aromatic compounds affects the overall fuel conversion. Some of these constituents are also known to deactivate reforming catalysts through carbon formation and sulfur poisoning.","Thus, the challenge in reforming diesel is to develop a catalyst that can maintain high product selectivity to Hand CO in the presence of aromatics and sulfur species, while being robust enough to operate at reforming conditions, typically 800-1000\u00b0 C.","Reforming catalysts have typically been nickel or Group-VIII noble metals supported by various high surface area oxide substrates such as aluminas, silicas, and mixed metal oxides. In some cases, pyrochlores are included as suitable supports for the catalytically active metals. See e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 6,238,816, issued to Cable et al, issued May 29, 2001; U.S. Pat. No. 6,409,940, issued to Gaffney et al, issued Jun. 25, 2002. The metal is dispersed onto the support surface in small crystallites to maximize the amount of active metal exposed. However, this design of the catalyst may be predisposed to carbon formation and deactivation by sulfur. The adsorption of sulfur and carbon has been shown to be structure sensitive. Specifically, both carbon and sulfur adsorption have been linked to the metal cluster size, with larger clusters more prone to deactivation. See Barbier et al, \u201cEffect of presulfurization on the formation of coke on supported metal catalysts,\u201d 102 (1986), among others. In these applications, pyrochlore structures have been utilized as supports for the active elements rather than as catalytic compounds having the active elements as an integral component in the pyrochlore structure, in order to avoid potential structure breakdown during reforming operations. See, Ashcroft et al., \u201cAn in situ, energy-dispersive x-ray diffraction study of natural gas conversion by carbon dioxide reforming,\u201d 97 (1993), demonstrating the instability of a PrRuOpyrochlore under CPOX conditions. Such instability derives from the decomposition of the pyrochlore phase under the reducing reaction conditions, creating a metal enriched surface and leading to the formation of an essentially supported metal catalyst, which should be avoided due to the increased tendency towards deactivation by carbon and sulfur. See also U.S. Pat. No. 5,500,149, issued to Green et al, issued on Mar. 19, 1996; U.S. Pat. No. 5,149,464, issued to Green et al, issued on Sep. 22, 1992; U.S. Pat. No. 5,015,461, issued to Jacobson et al, issued on May 14, 1991; and U.S. Pat. No. 4,959,494, issued to Felthouse, issued on Sep. 25, 1990. Similarly, this behavior has also been observed in perovskite (ABO) catalysts, where various metals are substituted into the A and B sites. See Liu and Krumpelt, \u201cActivity and Structure of Perovskites as Diesel-Reforming Catalysts for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,\u201d ., Vol 4 (2), (2005), and see Erri et al, \u201cNovel Perovskite-based catalysts for autothermal JP-8 fuel reforming,\u201d 61 (2006), among others. In these attempts, analyses following catalytic tests demonstrate that the perovskite structure is not maintained and separation of the active metals from the structure is observed.","It would be advantageous to provide a pyrochlore structure which displays the chemical and thermal stability necessary to maintain integral metal substitutions under reforming conditions, without the attendant necessity of catalytic agents supported on the surface of the pyrochlore. The development of a pyrochlore catalyst with spatially distributed active metal components in a structure that resists decomposition at high reforming temperatures would provide a more durable and effective catalyst compared to simple supported metal clusters. Resistance to decomposition would maintain the spatially distributed active metal components as structural components in the pyrochlore, and significantly minimize the migration of active metal components to the surface. This could largely avoid the undesirable defacto formation of a supported metal catalyst from some initially oxide-based catalyst systems at the reforming conditions, and could greatly reduce the tendency towards deactivation by carbon and sulfur. It would also hold potential as a long-life reforming catalyst.","Provided herein is a method for catalytically reforming a reactant gas mixture using a pyrochlore catalyst material comprised of one or more pyrochlores having the composition ABB\u2032B\u2033O, where A is an element in the A-site of the one or more pyrochlores, and where:","B is a tetravalent ion of an element selected from the group consisting of Ti, Cr, Mn, Zr, Mo, Os, Ir, Si, Ge, Sn, and Pb,","B\u2032 is a trivalent ion or a tetravalent ion of an element selected from the group consisting of Rh, Ru, Ni, Pt, Os, Co, Ir, and Pd, wherein if B\u2032 is a tetravalent ion then B\u2032 is an element not equivalent to B, and wherein 0<y\u22661,","B\u2033 is a divalent ion, a trivalent ion, or a tetravalent ion of an element selected from the group consisting of Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba, Y, Ce, Re, Cr, Ti, Zr, Ni, Co, V, and Mo, wherein if B\u2033 is a trivalent ion B\u2033 is an element not equivalent to B\u2032, and if B\u2033 is a tetravalent ion than B\u2033 is an element not equivalent to B\u2032 and not equivalent to B, wherein 0\u2266z<1 and y+z\u22661, and where \u0394 is a number that renders the composition charge neutral,","where an average ionic radius ratio of ions in the A-site to the B, B\u2032 and B\u2033 ions in the B-site is between 1.46 and 1.80.","The distribution of catalytically active metals throughout the structure of a pyrochlore creates an active and well dispersed metal bound in the crystal structure, reducing the metal sintering that typically occurs on supported catalysts used in reforming reactions. It is believed that smaller metallic sites are less susceptible to poisoning by sulfur or carbon than larger ones, thus, distributing the metal throughout the structure may decrease catalyst deactivation by sulfur and carbon. Further, oxygen mobility may also be enhanced by the exchange of various elements at B sites in the pyrochlore.","Exemplary pyrochlore material catalyst preparation and use in reforming are demonstrated herein. The pyrochlore material catalysts exhibit stable performance under the reaction conditions utilized for catalytic partial oxidation (CPOX), steam reforming (SR), dry reforming (DR), and oxidative steam reforming (OSR).","The various features of novelty which characterize this disclosure are pointed out with particularity in the claims annexed to and forming a part of this disclosure. For a better understanding of the invention, its operating advantages and specific objects attained by its uses, reference is made to the accompanying drawings and descriptive matter in which a preferred embodiment of the disclosure is illustrated.","The following description is provided to enable any person skilled in the art to use the invention and sets forth the best mode contemplated by the inventors for carrying out the invention. Various modifications, however, will remain readily apparent to those skilled in the art, since the principles of the present invention are defined herein specifically to provide a method of catalytically reforming a reactant gas mixture using a pyrochlore catalyst material with catalytically active metals substituted within the structure of the pyrochlore, to produce a gaseous mixture comprised of at least hydrogen and carbon monoxide using a thermally stable catalyst having resistance to both sulfur poisoning and carbon deposition.","The disclosure provides a catalyst system consisting of a pyrochlore lattice wherein B-site substitutions provide active metal dispersion and improved oxygen-ion conductivity. The substitutions disclosed result in a highly active catalyst in an advantageous structure, and the specific B-site elements utilized allow the advantageous pyrochlore structure to resist decomposition at high reforming temperatures, maintaining the spatially distributed active metal components as structural components in the pyrochlore lattice. This largely avoids the undesirable defacto formation of a supported metal catalyst, and greatly reduces the tendency towards deactivation by carbon and sulfur.","The instant disclosure establishes that a range of active elements can be substituted into the pyrochlore lattice while maintaining the distinctive pyrochlore structure. A-site elements provide for improved oxygen-ion conductivity and carbon oxidation at elevated temperatures, limiting carbon accumulation during the reforming reaction, while B-site substitutions improve the catalytic activity of the material, and significantly reduce carbonaceous deposits on the pyrochlore catalyst. Additionally and significantly, the disclosure provides the range of active elements incorporated as a structural element within the pyrochlore composition, and achieves a structural stability under reforming conditions which allows for continued dispersion and separation of the active metals necessary for high catalytic activity.","As used herein, the term \u201cpyrochlore material catalyst\u201d means a catalyst material comprised of one or more pyrochlores having the composition ABB\u2032B\u2033O, where A represents the A-site of the pyrochlore structure and where B, B\u2032, and B\u2033 represent the B-site of the pyrochlore, and where y>0 and z\u22670. As a result, at a minimum, the pyrochlore material catalyst provides a pyrochlore where B and B\u2032 combine at the B-site in order to provide a thermally and chemically stable pyrochlore while additionally providing for catalytic activity based on the additional inclusion of catalytically active metals as an integral component of the pyrochlore lattice. Generally, in the ABB\u2032B\u2033O formulation, the B element typically provides for thermal and chemical stability while at least the B\u2032 element typically provides the catalytically active metal.","The pyrochlore material catalyst may be either self-supported or structurally supported on a substrate such as aluminas, silicas, mixed metal oxides, and other substrates known in the art, and combinations thereof. The pyrochlore material catalyst may be further comprised of one or more of an other crystal phase including simple oxide, perovskite, fluorite, weberite, and others, where the other crystal phases and wherein the pyrochlore material catalyst may be either self-supported or structurally supported on a substrate such as aluminas, silicas, mixed metal oxides, and other substrates known in the art, and combinations thereof. However, the pyrochlore material catalyst disclosed is expected to provide sufficient catalytic activity in the absence of other crystal phases or catalytic agents.","The improved performance of the pyrochlore material catalyst disclosed herein results from the distribution of specific catalytically active metals throughout the structure of a pyrochlore, creating an active, stable, and well dispersed metal incorporated within the crystal structure itself. This greatly reduces the metal sintering that typically occurs on supported catalysts used in reforming reactions, and reduces deactivation by sulfur and carbon. Generally speaking, and without being bound by theory, it is believed that smaller metallic sites are less susceptible to poisoning by sulfur or carbon than larger ones. Further, oxygen mobility may also be enhanced by elemental exchange at the B site in the pyrochlore. Oxygen mobility is also an identified mechanism for the reduction of carbon accumulation on the surface in reforming reactions.","A pyrochlore is composed of \u00bd trivalent cations and \u00bd tetravalent cations in a cubic cell structure, with the general stoichiometry ABO. The A-site is usually a large cation (typically rare earth elements) and is coordinated with eight oxygen atoms. The B-site cation has a smaller radius (usually transition metal) and is coordinated with six oxygen atoms. In order to form a stable pyrochlore, A and B cations must have an ionic radius ratio r\/rbetween 1.46 and 1.80. When more than one A and\/or B metal cations are present in the pyrochlore, these radii are calculated as the average weighted radii by the relative amounts of each species present therein. A typical pyrochlore structure is shown at . See also Subramanian et al, \u201cOxide Pyrochlores\u2014A Review,\u201d 15 (1983).","Applicants have found that substituting for B-site cations alters the catalytic activity and resistance to deactivation in reforming reactions. A wide range of elements can be substituted into the pyrochlore lattice while maintaining the distinctive pyrochlore structure. With the proper selection, A-site cations generate improved oxygen-ion conductivity and promote carbon oxidation in the material at elevated temperatures, which limits carbon accumulation during the reforming reaction, while B-site cations and B-site substitutions with an active reforming metal can be used to improve the catalytic activity of the material. Metal substituted into the B-site retains high activity and selectivity after substitution into the pyrochlore, and significantly reduce carbonaceous deposits on the pyrochlore catalyst.","Generally speaking and without being bound by theory, Hand CO yields for the pyrochlore material catalysts do not decrease continuously in the presence of aromatic and organic sulfur compounds, but rather slightly drop to lower, but stable, levels. This is evidence of kinetic inhibition of the active catalytic sites by the contaminants rather than catalyst deactivation. In addition, olefins\u2014a product of non-catalytic reforming\u2014remain low after aromatic and organic sulfur contaminant species are added to the reactant gas mixture, indicating that the B-site dopants in the pyrochlore structure help retain catalytic activity in the presence of the contaminants. Further, after the contaminants are removed, olefin yields return to essentially zero concentration and the Hand CO yields produced recover. Collectively, these results could be explained by a rapid (but limited) deposition of surface species derived from or caused by the aromatic and organic sulfur compounds, which limits the approach to equilibrium Hand CO yields on the pyrochlore while not continuously accumulating on the surface of the doped pyrochlore.","Thus, provided herein is a method for catalytically reforming a reactant gas mixture using a pyrochlore catalyst material comprised of one or more pyrochlores having the composition ABB\u2032B\u2033O, where A is an element in the A-site of the one or more pyrochlores, and where:","B is a tetravalent ion of an element selected from the group consisting of Ti, Cr, Mn, Zr, Mo, Os, Ir, Si, Ge, Sn, and Pb,","B\u2032 is a trivalent ion or a tetravalent ion of an element selected from the group consisting of Rh, Ru, Ni, Pt, Os, Co, Ir, Pd, and Cu, wherein if B\u2032 is a tetravalent ion then B\u2032 is an element not equivalent to B, and wherein 0<y\u22661,","B\u2033 is a divalent ion, a trivalent ion, or a tetravalent ion of an element selected from the group consisting of Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba, Y, Ce, Re, Cr, Ti, Zr, Ni, Co, V, and Mo, wherein if B\u2033 is a trivalent ion B\u2033 is an element not equivalent to B\u2032, and if B\u2033 is a tetravalent ion than B\u2033 is an element not equivalent to B\u2032 and not equivalent to B, wherein 0\u2266z<1 and y+z\u22661, and where \u0394 is a number that renders the composition charge neutral,","where an average ionic radius ratio of ions in the A-site to the B, B\u2032 and B\u2033 ions in the B-site is between 1.46 and 1.80.","Any suitable reaction regime may be applied in order to contact the reactant gas mixture with the pyrochlore material catalyst. One suitable regime is a fixed bed reaction regime, in which the catalyst is retained within a reaction zone in a fixed arrangement. Particles of the pyrochlore catalyst material may be employed in the fixed bed regime, retained using fixed bed reaction techniques well known in the art. Alternatively, the catalyst may be in the form of a pellet, foam, honeycomb, monolith, or other geometry advantageous in facilitating contact. The pyrochlore material catalyst may be supported on a substrate such as aluminas, silicas, and mixed metal oxides, and other substrates known in the art.","The reactant gas mixture is contacted with the pyrochlore material catalysts in a reaction zone maintained at conversion-promoting conditions effective to produce an effluent stream comprising carbon monoxide and hydrogen. The reactant gas mixture may be comprised of one or more of natural gas; methane, liquefied petroleum gas comprised of C2-C5 hydrocarbons; diesel, jet fuels, gasoline, JP fuels, tars, and kerosene comprised of C6+ heavy hydrocarbons; oxygenated hydrocarbons such as biodiesel, alcohols, and dimethyl ether, and methane. The reactant gas mixture may be comprised of diesel having a sulfur content greater than 14 parts per million by weight. The reactant gas mixture may be comprised of diesel and aromatics, where the aromatic content is greater than 20 weight percent, with greater than 35 weight percent of the aromatic content being multi-ring aromatics. It is understood that the foregoing examples constitute exemplary hydrocarbon sources only and are not meant to limit the disclosure herein.","The ratio of oxygen to carbon in the reactant gas mixture may vary, with the mixture dependent on the particular hydrocarbons chosen and the amount of oxygen necessary to conduct the particular partial oxidation reaction, as is known in the art. Preferably, the reactant gas mixture has an overall oxygen to carbon atomic ratio equal to or greater than 0.9.","The catalytic reforming process may be catalytic partial oxidation using one or more of air or oxygen as an oxidant. The catalytic reforming process may also be steam reforming using steam as an oxidant. The catalytic reforming process may also be oxidative steam reforming oxidant using one or more of air, oxygen, or steam as an oxidant. The catalytic reforming process may also be COreforming using carbon dioxide as an oxidant or any combination of oxidant thereof.","Catalysts may be prepared using the Pechini Method. See U.S. Pat. No. 3,330,697, issued to Pechini, issued on Jul. 11, 1967. An exemplary preparation method follows:","Metal nitrate precursors and citric acid are dissolved separately into deionized water. The citric acid\/metal molar ratio may be from 1.0-1.5, preferably about 1.2. Aqueous metal salts are then combined into a beaker and stirred. To this mixture, aqueous citric acid is added. The solution is then heated to 65\u00b0 C. under stirring. At 65\u00b0 C., ethylene glycol is added. The ethylene glycol\/citric acid ratio may be from 1.0-4.0, preferably about 1.0. The solution is then stirred continuously at temperature until most of the water has evaporated and a viscous, transparent resin remains. The beaker is then transferred into a heating mantle pre-heated to 65\u00b0 C. The temperature of the mantle is increased to 130\u00b0 C. to promote a polyesterfication reaction between the citric acid and the ethylene glycol. The formed catalyst intermediate is then placed into an oven to dry. Following drying, the organic precursor is calcinced at 1000\u00b0 C. Ramp rate for the calcination step is 5\u00b0 C.\/min.","An alternate preparation method is co-precipitation: Metal salt precursors are dissolved into de-ionized water to form a 1M solution. The metal solution is then added dropwise into a solution containing excess ammonium carbonate (1M). Next, the formed precipitate is aged for 6 hours at 60\u00b0 C., vacuum filtered to separate precipitate, then rinsed and dried. Precursor is then calcined at 1000\u00b0 C. for 8 hours using a ramp rate for calcination of 5\u00b0 C.\/min.","It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the foregoing preparation methods are presented by way of example only. Various alterations, improvements, and modifications to the presented preparation methods are within the scope and spirit of the present disclosure.","Catalyst Testing:","Catalysts synthesized by the exemplary methods were tested for catalytic partial oxidation (CPOX), steam reforming (SR), dry reforming (DR), and oxidative steam reforming (OSR) of a surrogate logistic fuel mixture, biodiesel, and commercial Diesel Fuel-2 (DF-2). The catalyst testing took place in a fixed-bed continuous-flow reactor, shown in . Mass flow controllers  and  were used to deliver Nand air\/COto the system, while the hydrocarbon fuel and water were fed to the reactor by syringe pumps  and . The feed components passed through pre-heating coils  through  as illustrated prior to the reactor inlet to ensure complete vaporization of the fuel and thorough heating of the gases. Nwas used as a carrier gas to transport the vaporized hydrocarbon to the reactor tube inlet, where the fuel\/Nand oxidant combined before they entered the catalytic reactor . A hot box  heated by convection heater  surrounded the catalytic reactor  to vaporize the fuel and maintain uniform inlet and product gas temperatures. The hot box temperature was set to 375\u00b0 C. and controlled by a programmable temperature controller. Fixed bed  containing the catalyst was positioned in the center of an 8 mm i.d. tubular catalytic reactor section and diluted with quartz sand (up to 3 ml) of the same particle size as the catalyst to minimize temperature gradients and channeling throughout the bed. Heat was supplied via a split tube furnace  encapsulating catalytic reactor . Bed temperature was measured by an axially centered thermocouple  and was controlled by a programmable controller. Reactor pressure was maintained by back pressure regulator  and pressure gauge  provided pressure indications.","Post-reactor, water was condensed out of the gas stream. Compositions of H, CO, CO, and CHin the dry gas were analyzed by a mass spectrometer . Larger hydrocarbon products (C-C) were measured by a gas chromatograph . Carbon balances for all experiments were 100\u00b110%.","The surrogate fuel mixture used in this testing was a combination of model compounds chosen to represent common diesel fuel components. n-Tetradecane (TD), 1-methlynaphthalene (MN), and dibenzothiophene (DBT) were the model compounds used in some of these studies, representing paraffin, aromatic, and sulfur compounds respectively.","Experimental conditions for catalytic partial oxidation (CPOX), steam reforming (SR), dry reforming (DR), and oxidative steam reforming (OSR) were as listed in Table 1.","Catalysis Testing Results\u2014CPOX:","CPOX results from catalysts prepared by the exemplary methods are presented below in Tables 2 and 3. H, CO, COand CHvalues in Table 2 are instantaneous values taken after 2 hours time on stream during the CPOX of a surrogate diesel fuel mixture and are presented as % dry gas volume. H, CO, COand CHvalues in Table 3 are instantaneous values taken after their respective listed times on stream (TOS) during the CPOX of a surrogate diesel fuel mixture, diesel fuel-2 or biodiesel and are presented as % dry gas volume. Results are presented with respect to the pyrochlore comprising the pyrochlore material catalyst. During extended runs listed in Table 3, the pyrochlore material catalysts exhibited stable performance under reaction conditions stated under CPOX in Table 1, in terms of Hand CO produced, for at least 9 hours on stream and up to 60 hours with minimal sign of deactivation (i.e. 5% loss from initial Hand CO product compositions). The amount of olefins formed is also a measure of activity loss. Their presence indicates gas-phase (non-catalytic) chemistry occurring in the reactor. Olefin yields remain low for some of the catalysts during the extended runs listed in Table 3, further indicating the potential stability of the respective pyrochlore material catalyst under these conditions.","Catalysis Testing Results\u2014SR:","The steam reforming of commercial low sulfur diesel fuel-2 was performed using 20 wt % LaCaZrRhYO supported on zirconium doped ceria (LaCaZrRhYO\/ZDC) are presented below in Table 4. H, CO, COand CHvalues are averaged over 48 hours time on stream and are presented as % dry gas volume in Table 4. Results are presented with respect to the pyrochlore comprising the pyrochlore material catalyst. Conditions for this testing were as presented under SR at Table 1. Results show that the pyrochlore catalyst produced stable yields under steam reforming conditions with substantially complete conversion of the diesel fuel.","Catalysis Testing Results\u2014OSR:","The oxidative steam reforming of commercial low sulfur diesel fuel-2 was performed using 20 wt % LaCaZrRhY\/ZDC. The catalyst demonstrated stable performance continuously for over 1000 hours. Resulting H, CO, COand CHvalues are presented in Table 5, and instantaneous H, CO, COand CHvalues over the 1000 hours are shown at , presented as % dry gas volume. Conditions for this testing were as presented under OSR at Table 1. Results show that the pyrochlore catalyst produced stable yields under oxidative steam reforming conditions with substantially complete conversion of the diesel fuel.","Catalysis Testing Results\u2014DR:","The dry reforming of commercial low sulfur diesel fuel-2 was performed using 20 wt % LaCaZrRhYO\/ZDC, and the results are presented below in Table 6. Conditions for this experiment were as presented under DR at Table 1. Results show that the pyrochlore catalyst can produce stable yields under dry reforming conditions with substantially complete conversion of the diesel fuel.","Thus, presented here is a method of catalytically reforming a reactant gas mixture using a pyrochlore catalyst material that is stable under reaction conditions. The pyrochlore catalyst material utilizes catalytically active metals substituted within the structure of a pyrochlore to produce a thermally stable catalyst that resists both sulfur poisoning and carbon deposition. The pyrochlore catalyst material maintains high product selectivity to Hand CO in the presence of aromatics and sulfur species. The pyrochlore catalyst material minimizes catalytically active metal migration to the surface, minimizing formation of a supported metal catalyst under reaction conditions. The pyrochlore material catalysts exhibit stable performance under the reaction conditions utilized for catalytic partial oxidation (CPOX), steam reforming (SR), dry reforming (DR), and oxidative steam reforming (OSR).","Having described the basic concept of the invention, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the foregoing detailed disclosure is intended to be presented by way of example only, and is not limiting.
