OFDM belongs to a family of transmission schemes called multi-carrier modulation. Multi-carrier modulation is based on dividing a given high bit-rate data stream into several parallel low bit-rate data streams and modulating each stream on separate sub-carriers.","The motivation for using multi-carrier modulation is to overcome the problem of inter-symbol interference (ISI). In wireless channels where radio signals from a transmitter traverse multiple paths to a receiver, all the signal energy does not necessarily arrive at the receiver at the same instant of time. This phenomenon of dispersion in a communication channel causes energy from one symbol duration to spill into succeeding symbol durations.","When a time delay due to dispersion is either a significant fraction of or more than the symbol time duration, the resultant ISI can be detrimental. ISI causes an irreducible error floor that cannot be overcome by simply changing a radio frequency (RF) parameter such as a transmit power, an antenna pattern or a frequency plan.","In an OFDM system, each sub-carrier can be viewed as a flat fading channel. A single tap equalizer can be used to equalize the transmitted signal in case of coherent demodulation. This requires the receiver to have knowledge of the channel on a per-sub-carrier basis.","The discrete baseband time representation of a transmitted OFDM signal is:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":"y","mrow":{"mi":["n","m"],"mo":","}},"mo":"=","mrow":{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":[{"mi":["k","o"],"mo":"="},{"mi":"N","mo":"-","mn":"1"}]},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"msub":{"mi":"x","mrow":{"mi":["k","m"],"mo":","}},"mo":"\u2062","msup":{"mi":"\u2147","mrow":{"mi":"j","mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}],"mn":"2","mrow":{"mi":"\u03c0","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":"k","mo":"-","mfrac":{"mi":"N","mn":"2"}}}},"mfrac":{"mi":["n","N"]}}}}}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"1"}}]}}}},"br":{},"sub":"k,m "},"The discrete version of the OFDM baseband signal shown in equation (1) is identical to the Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform (IDFT) of the sub-carrier symbols x.
