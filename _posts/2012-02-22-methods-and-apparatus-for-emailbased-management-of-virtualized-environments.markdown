{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Software for managing a virtualized data center is responsible for monitoring physical hosts and virtual machines (VMs) running in the physical hosts and, further, for performing management operations such as provisioning and configuration tasks. One example of such management software is vSphere\u2122 available from VMware, Inc. of Palo Alto, Calif. The set of hosts, VMs, data storage units, networks, and the organization of these elements into data centers, clusters, and resource pools, managed by such software, is commonly referred to as a virtualized computer inventory (hereinafter referred to as the \u201cinventory\u201d).","In a conventional virtualized data center, one or more administrators are responsible for monitoring and managing the operation of the virtualized data center. The administrators carry out such tasks typically using a management terminal having a graphical user interface or a command-line interface to interact with the management software. In response, the management terminal issues appropriate management instructions to the management software over a network, such as a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), a Virtual Private Network (VPN), or other suitable communication networks.","The ability to manage the virtualized data center from a remote device has become increasingly important, especially in scenarios where an administrator may be out of the office. Administrators may utilize a remote device (e.g., a smartphone, personal digital assistant, tablet computer) running a management terminal software application to interact with the management software. However, as remote devices proliferate and utilize a wide variety of hardware and software platforms, it becomes challenging to provide and support a management terminal software application that is compatible with all the different hardware and software platforms.","One or more embodiments of the invention provide a cross-platform technique for remotely managing virtual machines. The cross-platform technique employs a user interface (UI) of a rich e-mail client that is generated in response to a status communication received from a management server for the virtual machines. The UI includes a first region that displays a message from the management server and a second region that displays a UI element for causing a command to be generated and sent to the management server in response to a predetermined input made thereon.","A computing device according to an embodiment of the invention includes a display, and a processor programmed to generate a UI on the display, wherein the UI includes a first region for displaying a message from a management server for managing virtual machines, and a second region for displaying a UI element that causes a command to be generated and sent to the management server in response to a predetermined input made thereon.","A method of processing communications from a management server for managing virtual machines, according to an embodiment of the invention, includes the steps of detecting receipt of a status communication from a management server for managing virtual machines, generating a UI that includes a first region for displaying a message from the management server contained within the status communication and a second region for displaying a UI element, detecting a predetermined input on the UI element, and upon detecting the predetermined input on the UI element, generating a command and sending the command to the management server.","Embodiments of the present invention further include a non-transitory computer-readable storage medium storing instructions that when executed by a computer system cause the computer system to perform the method set forth above.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","108","104","108","106","108"]},"Each host computer  may include conventional components of a computing device, such as memory , a processor , a disk interface , and a network interface . Examples of the disk interface  are a host bus adapter and a network file system interface. An example of the network interface  is a network adapter, also referred to as a Network Interface Card (NIC). In some embodiments, a plurality of NICs is included in the network interface . Each host computer  provides a virtualization layer that abstracts processor, memory, storage, and\/or networking resources into multiple virtual machines (VMs) that run concurrently on the same host computer . As shown, one or more virtual machines are configured within the host computer , represented in  as VM , VM , and VM , which share the hardware resources of host computer .","The virtual machines run on top of a software interface layer  (referred to herein as a \u201chypervisor\u201d) that enables sharing of the hardware resources of the host computer  by the virtual machines. The hypervisor  may run on top of the operating system of the host computer  or directly on hardware components of the host computer . Each virtual machine includes a guest operating system and one or more guest applications running on top of the guest operating system. As also shown, an agent  is provided in the hypervisor , by which specific information pertaining to the virtualization settings and configurations of the host computer , and any VMs included therein, is transmitted to a VM management center , discussed below, according to a schedule or in response to queries by the VM management center .","The VM management center  is a computer program that resides and executes in a central server, which may reside in one of data centers , or alternatively, running as a VM in one of the host computers . The VM management center  is in communication with each of the data centers , clusters , and host computers , and carries out administrative tasks for the virtualized computer system  including, but not limited to, managing the data centers , managing the virtual machines running within each host computer , provisioning the virtual machines, migration of virtual machines from one host computer to another, allocating physical resources, such as processor and memory, load balancing between host computers  and clusters , and so on. In one embodiment, the VM management center  interacts with an agent included in the host computers , such as the agent , to exchange information using application programming interface (API) calls.","The VM management center  may perform administrative tasks for the virtualized computer system  autonomously, or may perform administrative tasks in response to one or more commands issued by a system administrator. A system administrator may access the VM management center  via an administrator terminal  that is connected to the management center via a local area network (LAN) connection or a wide area network (WAN) connection. The connection may be secured using a Virtual Private Network (VPN) or other suitable means. The administrator terminal  may be any computing device that includes conventional components, such as a processor, memory, storage, and network interface. To support a direct interface with the VM management center , the administrator terminal  may include a software application (depicted as an administrative client  in ), that produces a graphical user interface or a command-line interface. As discussed above, as new computing devices, particularly remote devices, proliferate and utilize a variety of hardware and software platforms, it may be challenging to implement and maintain an administrative client that is compatible with the variety of hardware and software platforms in the marketplace.","Accordingly, in one or more embodiments of the invention, a system administrator manages the VM management center  by receiving e-mail messages from and issuing commands to an administrator command server  that is in communication with the VM management center , which enables the system administrator to remotely manage the virtualized computing system  using, e.g., a remote device. In particular, embodiments of the invention integrate rich functionality into an e-mail client to enable the administrator to be notified when issues occur within the virtualized computing system , view information associated with the issues, and\/or issue commands to the virtualized computing system  via the e-mail client to alleviate the issues. Advantageously, because most e-mail clients include standardized interfaces that are understood by administrators, the inadequacies and learning curve common with traditional virtualization management software is eliminated.","In one embodiment, the administrator command server  is configured to communicate with the VM management center  to transmit messages (e.g., messages that include management instructions) to and receive messages (e.g., status messages) from the VM management center . The administrator command server  may be communicatively coupled to the VM management center  via an inter-process communication (IPC) system, including, but not limited to, network sockets, shared memory, remote procedure calls (RPC), and\/or a web services API (Application Program Interface). Details of the administrator command server  are discussed and shown in greater detail in . While the administrator command server  is depicted in  as a separate component that resides and executes on a separate central server, it should be recognized that the administrator command server  may alternatively reside in any one of the computing devices of the virtualized computing system , such as the same central server where the VM management center  resides.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["200","100","200","120","102","210","220","230","232","250","220","102","220","220","230","232","230","232","220","220","220"]},"According to one embodiment, the remote device  includes an administrator e-mail client  that receives from the e-mail server  e-mail messages that pertain to the operation of virtualized computer system . In some embodiments, the administrator e-mail client  may be a software application configured to generate, transmit, receive, and display e-mail messages via any of the e-mail techniques and protocols known in the art, including Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), Post Office Protocol (POP), and Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP). In one embodiment, the administrator e-mail client  is configured to support \u201cpush\u201d notifications to reduce communication between the administrator command server  and the remote device .","As is described in detail herein, the administrator e-mail client  is configured to provide a set of features through which embodiments of the invention may be implemented. In particular, administrator e-mail client  is configured to receive e-mails that are generated by administrator command server  and, among other features described herein, parse text in the body of the e-mails and established therein hyperlinks that, when selected by the administrator, cause the administrator e-mail client  to issue commands to and receive information from administrator command server .","In one embodiment, the e-mail module  is configured to generate e-mail messages containing output from the VM management center  and addressed to one or more recipients responsible for the VM management center , such as a system administrator. In one example, the e-mail module  generates and transmits an e-mail message containing an alert message (sometimes referred to as an \u201calert\u201d) that notifies system administrators of a condition in the VM management center  (e.g., system outage). In another example, the e-mail module  generates an e-mail message containing output from the VM management center  (herein referred to as \u201cstatus message\u201d) in response to a specific command received from the system administrators, which is described below in detail. For example, a status message indicating an uptime condition of the virtualized computer system  may be sent by the e-mail module  in response to receiving a command requesting \u201cstatus.\u201d In another example, a status message may be generated that contains a verbose output indicating a successful or unsuccessful execution of a command.","In one particular implementation, the e-mail module  utilizes one or more software libraries to programmatically interact with the e-mail server  and perform one or more e-mail related functions. For example, the e-mail module  may utilize Java APIs for fetching e-mail from the e-mail server , extracting e-mail metadata and data, generating new e-mail messages, and sending e-mail messages to recipients, such as the remote device , via the e-mail server . Embodiments of the invention may be extended to utilize other suitable software libraries, frameworks, and APIs for implementing the techniques described herein.","In one embodiment, the command controller  of the administrator command server  is configured to receive and process hypertext protocol (http) requests issued via administrator e-mail client . In one example, command controller  is configured to receive the http requests via network  at an internet protocol (IP) address, e.g., \u201c10.10.10.10\u201d, and a network port, e.g., \u201c9080\u201d. In this example, each http request is generated and transmitted to the command controller  when the administrator e-mail client  queries a uniform resource locator (URL) that is generated by the administrator e-mail client  according to the configuration of the command controller , one or more commands to be executed, and one or more entities to which the one or more commands refer. The one or more commands and one or more entities are specified via parameters included in the URL, which command controller  is configured to extract using, e.g., the \u201c&parameter_name=value\u201d paradigm. Though the techniques described herein utilize issuing commands via http requests, any suitable means for communication over a computer network may be used, including Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP), WebSocket Protocol, Remote Procedure Calls (RPC), and other similar technologies.","The command controller  is configured to invoke the command interpreter  to communicate with the VM management center  and execute commands based on the parameters included in the URL. The command interpreter  is configured to transmit commands to the VM management center  and\/or receive output resultant from the transmitted commands or otherwise unsolicited status output from the VM management center .","In one embodiment, the command controller  extracts parameters included in the URL, and, based on the extracted parameters, generates a script that is executable by the command line interpreter . Examples of the command interpreter  include PowerCLI, vSphere SDK for Perl for VMware vSphere available from VMware, Inc. of Palo Alto, Calif., or one of a variety of other suitable command-line interpreter systems.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","100","300","302","222","120","210","222","120","222","302","120","220","100","120","120","222"]},"In one embodiment, an authentication approach based on security tokens may be utilized. System administrators are issued a hardware or software mechanism for generating an authentication code, the mechanism referred to as a \u201ctoken.\u201d For example, the system administrator may have a smart card or a key fob configured to dynamically generate a secret value that is automatically and periodically changed. In this approach, administrator e-mail client  requires that the system administrator submits his or her token when logging into administrator e-mail client . The token value is thereafter included as a parameter in each of the URLs that are used to issue commands. To authenticate the sender, the administrator command server  first retrieves a token value from a security database storing a plurality of synchronous values based on the sender's purported identity, which is included as a parameter in the URL. The administrator command server  then compares the token value from the security database to the token value from the URL. After the administrator command server  verifies that the tokens match, then the administrator command server  may deem the identity of the sender of the command as being authenticated.","In another embodiment, an authentication approach based on \u201cpass codes\u201d may be utilized. A pass code generally refers to a predetermined value known only to the system administrator. Similar to the token approach discussed above, the URLs include a parameter for the pass code. In one embodiment, after the administrator command server  verifies the presence of the pass code in the URL and determines that the pass code corresponds to a value stored in a security database, then the administrator command server  may deem the identity of the sender of the command as being authenticated. Transmission of the pass code via a URL parameter can be protected from security threats using a variety of approaches, e.g., establishing a secure socket layer (SSL) communication path between the administrator command server  and the administrator e-mail client .","In still another embodiment, an authentication approach based on a trusted communications environment may be utilized. Embodiments of the invention may require a secure connection between the remote device  and the administrator command server , such as in VPN connections. In one embodiment, the administrator command server  may store a trusted network list comprising a pre-determined list of network addresses, subnet addresses, and other network domains that represent a trusted network environment. The administrator command server  may deem a command authentic if the command originates from within the trusted network environment, for example, inside a company's intranet. In this approach, no authentication parameters would be required to be included in the URL.","Referring back now to step , the received e-mail may have been generated, for example, by administrator command server  in response to an alert condition detected within the virtualized computer system . More specifically, the administrator command server , in response to receiving a notification from the VM Management Center  that an alert condition has been detected for the virtualized computing environment, directs the e-mail module  to generate an alert e-mail to one or more system administrators. In one embodiment, the administrator command server  may wait for a response back from at least one system administrator to which the alert has been communicated. In one embodiment, the administrator command server  utilizes a time-out timer wherein if no response to the alert e-mail is received by expiry of the time-out timer, then error handling procedures are invoked, such as resending the alert e-mail. In one embodiment, the time-out timer may be cancelled upon receipt of one or more \u201cread receipts\u201d from the administrator e-mail client  indicating successful delivery of the alert e-mail messages.","At step , the administrator e-mail client  parses text included in the body of the e-mail to identify, based on predefined regular expressions known to administrator e-mail client , text that references a specific entity included in the virtualized computer system , e.g., a VM, a host machine, a cluster, and the like. One example form of a regular expression might be \u201cVM-\\d\\d\\d\u201d, which would match the text \u201cVM-123\u201d that refers to a VM named \u201cVM-123\u201d included in virtualized computer system .","At step , the administrator e-mail client  replaces the text with one or more hyperlinks. In particular, the hyperlinks are established by administrator e-mail client  as objects within the e-mail body that are configured to detect mouse input events. In one embodiment, each predefined regular expression may have associated therewith a set of available commands that are displayed to the administrator when a mouse input even occurs at the hyperlink, an example of which is illustrated in Table 1.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"91pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 1"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Regular",{},{},{}]},{"entry":["Expression","Mouse Left-Click","Mouse Hover","Mouse Right-Click"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["\u201cVM-\\d\\d\\d\u201d","{generate_logBundle}","{get_statistics_chart}","{power_on, power_off,"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"suspend, reset, motion}"]},{"entry":["\u201cHC-\\d\\d\\d\u201d","{generate_logBundle}","{get_statistics_chart}","{enter_maintenance_mode}"]},{"entry":["\u201cDS-\\d\\d\u201d","{generate_logBundle}","{get_statistics_chart}","{increase_size}"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"As shown, in one embodiment, each regular expression has associated therewith, for each of three different types of mouse events (left-click, hover, right-click), one or more available commands that the administrator may issue to administrator command server  for execution. For example, the administrator may power on, power off, suspend, reset, or motion a VM that is identified through the regular expression \u201cVM-\\d\\d\\d\u201d. Each command, such as \u201cget_statistics_chart\u201d, is issued by administrator e-mail client  according to a set of instructions associated with the command, which is described in detail below at steps ,  or .","At step , the administrator e-mail client  receives a mouse input event at the hyperlink. In one embodiment, the mouse input event is received via one or more listener methods that are associated with the hyperlink and managed by the administrator e-mail client . The mouse input events include information specific to the mouse input, such as the mouse button that was clicked (i.e., left-click or right-click), or the amount of time that the mouse cursor was positioned over the hyperlink (i.e., hover).","At step , the administrator e-mail client  determines whether the mouse input event is a mouse left-click event, a mouse hover event, or a mouse right-click event. If, at step , the administrator e-mail client  determines that the mouse input event is a mouse left-click, then the method  proceeds to step . At step , administrator e-mail client  generates a URL based on a network address of the administrator command server , a selected command, and the specific entity on which the command is to be performed.","As described above, each of the available commands included in Table 1 is associated with a set of instructions that cause the appropriate command to be executed. For example, the command \u201cgenerate_logBundle\u201d may have associated therewith Javascript instructions that, when executed by administrator e-mail client , cause the URL to be generated and then queried. One example URL is \u201chttp:\/\/10.10.10.10:9080\/zSphere?action=generate_logBundle&entity_name=VM-123\u201d, where the IP address 10.10.10.10 and port 9080 of administrator command server  are known to administrator e-mail client , the entity name \u201cVM-123\u201d is identified as a regular expression at step , and generate_logBundle is the command selected by the administrator.","At step , the administrator e-mail client  causes the generated URL to be queried. In one embodiment, the administrator e-mail client  is capable of issuing the query via built-in http features, such as a web browser that is configured to manage http requests. In another embodiment, the administrator e-mail client  issues a call to the operating system on which it is executing, e.g., the operating system of remote device , to handle querying the generated URL.","In turn, the administrator command server  receives the request containing one or more commands for managing the virtualized computing environment . The command controller  receives the request from the administrator command server  and then proceeds to perform one or more procedures for validating the received command, according to embodiments of the invention.","As described above, the command controller  performs one or more authentication procedures to verify the identity of the user (i.e., sender of the command). If the command controller  determines that the command is not authorized, then the administrator command server  may initiate error handling by sending an error message to the user via the e-mail server . In one embodiment, the error message is a response e-mail notifying the user of an \u201cunauthorized command,\u201d \u201cunauthenticated command,\u201d and\/or other error reporting details.","After authenticating the administrator, the administrator command server  determines whether the administrator is authorized to submit and execute the one or more administrative commands for the VM management center  that are specified in the URL.","According to one embodiment, a plurality of users may be granted specific roles and permissions for operating the VM management center  via the administrator command server . By limiting the users, actions, and objects that can be manipulated by e-mail-based management, as well as limiting the frequency and\/or time periods with which commands may be issued, the administrator command server  may limit risk of access from an unauthorized channel or user. Such roles and permissions for managing components of the virtualized computing environment may be granted or denied to one or more users and\/or groups. For example, one user may be designated as a system administrator for a particular a data cluster, a particular host computer, and\/or for a virtual machine executing on one or more host computers. It is appreciated that responsibilities for specific virtualized computer inventory components, such as resource pools, can be delegated based on business organization or ownership. In one embodiment, the roles and permissions may be stored within and managed by the administrator command server  or the VM management center , or alternatively, may be stored separately, for example, in a lightweight directory access protocol (LDAP) database.","In one embodiment, the administrator command server  retrieves the roles and permissions associated with the sender of a command based on the sender's identity, e.g., as authenticated in the preceding step. Based on the retrieved permissions, the administrator command server  determines whether the sender has authorization to issue commands to the VM management center . For example, the administrator command server  may determine whether the sender is authorized to execute any administrative commands at all, whether the sender is authorized to execute the particular administrative commands specified in the received e-mail, whether the sender is authorized to execute commands on the one or more particular virtualized components identified in the commands, or some combination thereof. If the commands included in the email are permissible, then command is deemed authorized.","In some embodiments, rather than entirely allow or disallow a command based on roles and permission, the administrator command server  may determine that the command from a user requires further approval from a supervisor user. Users may be assigned supervisory-subordinate relationships such that a supervising user may have to review and authorize a command and\/or operation submitted by a subordinate user before the administrator command server  will process submitted commands. The administrator command server  may generate and send an approval request e-mail to a designated supervisor to request approval of the subordinate user's command. The approval request may contain a description of the commands requested by the subordinate user, a description of the subordinate user's identity, and instructions on how to approve the pending commands. In one embodiment, the instructions may include a hyperlink containing a custom identifier (e.g., hash code) to a web-accessible approval script. In another embodiment, the instructions include text indicating the supervisor user may reply directly to the approval request e-mail with an e-mail that contains a command word indicating approval or denial (e.g., \u201cAPPROVE\u201d, \u201cDENY\u201d) in the body of the e-mail. After the administrator command server  receives approval, through one of the embodiments described above, the administrator command server  deems the user authorized.","Administrator command server , upon determining that the user is authorized, translates the commands into instructions that are executable by VM management center , and transmits the instructions to VM management center  for execution. Administrator command server  may monitor the VM management center  while the instructions are executed or wait for the VM management center  to indicate that the instructions have been executed. When VM management center  completes the execution of the instructions, administrator command server  issues a response to administrator e-mail client . The response may include any type of data associated with the commands including, but not limited to, status information, statistical information, return data information, and the like.","Accordingly, at step , the administrator e-mail client  receives, processes and\/or displays information returned by administrator command server  in response to the command issued via the URL query at step . Continuing with the example of requesting a log bundle for the VM \u201cVM-123\u201d described above at step , the returned log bundle may be displayed within administrator e-mail client . Alternatively, administrator e-mail client  may receive a redirect to a URL of a temporary web page managed by administrator command server  that provides a detailed view of the log bundle for the VM \u201cVM-123\u201d.","Referring back now to step , if the administrator e-mail client  determines that the mouse input event is a mouse hover, then the method  proceeds to step . At step , the administrator e-mail client  generates a URL based on the network address of the client, a command to retrieve information, e.g., statistical information, and the specific entity on which information is to be retrieved. In some cases, administrator e-mail client  may be configured to further parse the body of the e-mail to identify keywords that help narrow the information that should be requested. For example, if the e-mail body indicates that a VM named \u201cVM-123\u201d has a high ready time, which is related to the VM's CPU usage, then the administrator e-mail client  may append to the generated URL a parameter that narrows the requested information to CPU usage only, e.g., \u201c&statistic_type=CPU_Usage\u201d. In some embodiments, administrator e-mail client  and\/or administrator command server  may be configured to automatically include knowledge base articles that are relevant to the information included in the body of the e-mail, such as typical causes for a VM experiencing a high ready time.","Next, administrator e-mail client  executes method step  using the URL generated at step  according to the techniques described above. At step , administrator e-mail client  receives and displays the returned information, such as a chart that highlights CPU usage data of the VM \u201cVM-123\u201d. Moreover, as described above, the chart may include knowledge base text and\/or hyperlinks to knowledge base articles. An example of such a chart is illustrated in .","Referring back now to step , if the administrator e-mail client  determines that the event type is a mouse right-click, then the method  proceeds to step . At step , the administrator e-mail client  displays a list of available command options that may be issued to the specific entity associated with the hyperlink on which the right-click mouse event occurred. In one embodiment, the list is displayed as a context menu located at or around the hyperlink. An example of the context menu is illustrated in , which corresponds to the available commands for a VM hyperlink on which a mouse right-click occurs.","At step , the administrator e-mail client  receives a selection of a command option included in the list, e.g., \u201cpower-on\u201d. Accordingly, at step , the administrator e-mail client  generates a URL based on the network address of the administrator command server  (e.g., \u201c10.10.10.10:9080\u201d), the command option (e.g., \u201cpower-on\u201d), and the specific entity on which the command is to be performed (the VM \u201cVM-123\u201d).","Next, administrator e-mail client  executes method step  using the URL generated at step . At step , administrator e-mail client  receives and displays information returned by the command, e.g., the status of the command's execution.","In some embodiments, the administrator command server  generates and sends confirmation messages to the administrator to notify the administrator that the command has been successfully received. For example, after an administrator selects an available command through the right-click context menu described above, administrator e-mail client  may continue to display the right-click context menu and update the status of the command, such as estimated time left to complete in execution.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 2"],"b":["100","200","200"]},"Step  is representative of operations that occur within a VM Data Center , such as VM migrations between host machines, new host machines being provisioned, new VMs being provisioned, and the like. At step , the administrator command server  receives a notification from the VM management center  that a potential issue, condition, and\/or problem has been detected in the VM data center . For example, the administrator command server  may receive a notification that a VM in the data center  is over-provisioned, experiencing overload, unresponsive, and\/or the like.","In one embodiment, responsive to detecting an alert condition, the e-mail module  of the administrator command server  generates at step  an e-mail alert message for one or more system administrators designated as contacts for such alert messages. The e-mail module  of the administrator command server  then connects to the e-mail server  and transmits the alert message. The alert e-mail includes an e-mail body containing a description of the alert condition, e.g., \u201cVM-123 High Ready Time.\u201d","In one embodiment, the e-mail module  generates an alert e-mail having additional metadata information for facilitating processing techniques described herein, such as automatic filtering of e-mails received by administrator e-mail client  into virtualization-specific folders, described in detail below in conjunction with . The e-mail module  may generate an alert e-mail having a unique reference identifier for the alert condition, referred herein as an \u201calert identifier.\u201d The alert identifier may be located in the e-mail body and\/or in the subject line (e.g., \u201cSubject: Alert #20110819.1547920A\u201d).

The administrator e-mail client  makes available the alert message for review by the system administrator according to the techniques described above in steps - of method . At some time later, the system administrator reads the alert message and responds to the alert message by interfacing with the rich e-mail features provided by the administrator e-mail client  described herein.","At step , the administrator e-mail client  generates a command based on input from the administrator according to the techniques described above in steps - of method . At step , administrator e-mail client  issues the command to administrator command server  by querying the generated URL, according to the method step  of method .","At step , the administrator command server  validates the command to determine whether to proceed with processing the received command. At optional step , the administrator command server  sends an acknowledgement message to notify the remote device  that command has been received. In the embodiment shown, the acknowledgment message is delivered via an http response message sent to the remote device  via the network .","At step , the administrator command server  identifies one or more commands based on parameters included in the URL query. In one embodiment, the command interpreter  of the administrator command server  interprets the parameters and, in response, generates one or more instructions that are executable by the VM management center . In one embodiment, the administrator command server  places the extracted commands into temporary storage, for example, such as in a queue. The command interpreter  at step  connects to the VM management center  to relay the instructions to the VM management center  for execution. At step , the VM management center  executes the instructions to perform one or more data center operations on the VM data center .","After the instructions have been executed, the VM management center  may provide at step  a summary of the actions taken and the post-execution status of the virtualized computer system  entities affected by the command. At step , the administrator command server  receives from the VM management center  the status results and\/or other output resultant from execution of the command. In some cases, the administrator command server  formats the information into a final form so that the administrator e-mail client  needs only to display the information received at step . For example, administrator command server  may generate an image of a statistical chart based on data received from VM data center  at step . In this way, the statistical chart can be viewed on any of the mobile devices ,  and , since the operating systems and\/or administrator e-mail clients  executing thereon are configured to interpret and display images (e.g., in JPEG format, BMP format, GIF format, etc.) according to well-known techniques.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0067","num":"0066"},"figref":["FIGS. 5A-5C","FIG. 5A"],"b":["500","222","222","222","222"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0067"},"figref":"FIG. 5B","b":["222","120","102"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0069","num":"0068"},"figref":"FIG. 5C","b":["222","222","100","222","222","220","210","100","120","222","222"]},"Embodiments of the invention advantageously provide a platform-independent command interface for managing a virtualized infrastructure via remote devices. Because the administrator is communicating with the command server via an administrator e-mail client, the need is reduced for an administrator to have a command interpreter running on his\/her remote device or to connect to a server using a VPN in order to perform system management tasks. Finally, as there are no platform requirements for the e-mail client of the remote device, an administrator may perform management commands using any device that has an e-mail client and is not limited to a particular platform, such as Android-based phones, iOS-based phones, or Windows-based phones.","Additionally, embodiments of the invention may be extended to include desktop computers, notebook computers, servers, and other suitable computing devices configured for network connectivity, and having available the administrator e-mail client as described herein.","The various embodiments described herein may employ various computer-implemented operations involving data stored in computer systems.
