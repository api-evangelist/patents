title: System and method for extracting categories of data
abstract: Lines of data that are from a historical document, such as a digitized city directory, have information extracted and stored in searchable data fields. Words and phrases within the lines of data are identified and tagged. Rendering rules are applied to the tagged words and phrases to extract names, addresses, occupations, spouse information and other data, and store that data in the searchable fields.

No. 13\/242,736, \u201cSystem and Method for Capturing Relevant Information from a Printed Document,\u201d filed on even date herewith, the complete disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.","With ever expanding use of the Internet, digital content services are becoming increasingly popular. Companies digitize books, official records, and other printed documents, and make them available to subscribing customers. Digitized records are often easier than traditional physical documents to review, search and analyze for various purposes, such as research. Thus, it has become desirable to digitize many historical records to facilitate research.","The most efficient method of digitizing printed records is to electronically scan them and use optical character recognition (OCR) to convert the scanned text to computer readable text. However, historical records are often difficult to use when scanned because of unique formatting of the original document, and also because of graphics and other material not relevant to the likely purpose of use\/research of the digitized document. Often some judgment needs to be exercised as to how formatting should be accommodated and as to what data is relevant, leading to a person having to manually review each record page (either before or after using OCR), or alternatively, manually entering data from the record at a keyboard (rather than using OCR).","One example of the difficulties in digitizing records are illustrated by historical \u201ccity directories.\u201d These directories were published by many different publishers across the United States from the late 1800's to the mid-1900's, and include listings by name of every resident (or nearly every resident\/head of household) in a given city. Such directories thus provide a historical snapshot of people and their respective addresses in that city at the time of publication and thus, collectively, are a valuable tool for tracking people across the United States during time periods covered by those city directories. However, city directories often include other, less useful information (unrelated to the names of residents) that make it difficult to use standard OCR methodologies to efficiently capture and use information. If a city directly is simply digitized (using OCR methodologies), the useful information (e.g., names) may be intermingled with less useful information and the format of data in the digitized directory may make the resulting data difficult to access and search by a user.","To illustrate the foregoing, reference is made to , which illustrates one page from a city directory for Los Angeles, Calif., published in 1891. As seen, the directory page 100 includes a listing  of names (ordered alphabetically by last name), each name appearing on a line, with some lines wrapping or continuing to the next line (without a person's name appearing on the wrapping line). The listing  includes information associated with each name, such as occupation and address (which associated information may also be useful to a researcher attempting to locate individuals by name).","The page 100 also includes information that would normally not be useful to a researcher or user (i.e., a user looking for individuals by name), such as advertising text  at the top of the page, adverting text  along the side, advertising text  at the bottom of the page and a header portion  with page number and directory identification. While not shown in , a typical city directory might include other information that would also not be useful, such as indexes, listings ordered by street or address (rather than names), pictorial or graphical advertising, and informational text concerning the city.","As discussed above, for purposes of digitizing the information on the directory page 100, it would be desirable to exclude the information that would not be useful to a user or researcher.","In addition, it would be useful (for purposes of access and retrieval) to have information on each person in the directory arranged as a single line or entry of computer readable text, ordered alphabetically by the last name of a person, and with each such line having any other useful information associated with the person. For example, as seen in , certain lines are indented (such as those designated by example as ,  and ), and thus are each a continuation or wrapping line of an immediately preceding line. It would be desirable for any such wrapping line to be combined or merged with its preceding line into a single line or entry of computer readable text.","Aforementioned U.S. application Ser. No. 13\/242,736, discloses the processing of scanned data from a printed directory, with irrelevant information removed and with wrapping lines (and lines with dittoed last names) reconstructed so that the resulting file or digitized document has a listing for each person in the directory as a single line or entry of computer readable text and has last names appropriately inserted (e.g., when missing due to dittos). For example, referring to , there are illustrated listings from the same page of the directory that is seen in , but with the scanned data now arranged so that the data for each person appears in a single line, using the systems and methods described in U.S. application Ser. No. 13\/242,736.","While such an arrangement makes the digitized document easier to use, it would be desirable to extract certain data from the lines and put them into searchable data fields to make that data more easily searched and accessed, for example by the use of standard database queries.","With such extraction, the data from many thousands of city directories could be combined, e.g., into a single database, so that a user trying to locate or track a person could enter one or more search terms and retrieve information, such as name, address and other information associated with the person found in any of the directories. However, because the listings are taken from many directories with many different formats (and different ordering of information on each line), the ability to extract certain information (for example, a name or an address) is difficult to do without human review and analysis.","The present invention provides systems and methods for extracting information from lines of computer readable text or data.","In one embodiment, a method is provided for the extracting information from a line of computer readable data and creating a searchable data field in which the extracted information is stored. The line of data includes words representing a name of a person and words representing other information related to the person.","The method includes: (a) starting at one end (or a beginning point) of the line of data and moving from left to right (in relation to the lines seen in ), sequentially capturing each word beginning with a capital letter, until a name delimiter is reached, (b) designating the sequentially captured words as the name of the person, (c) storing the designated name in a searchable data field, and (c) associating other information from the line of computer readable data with the designated name.","In one described embodiment, the line of computer readable data has been obtained from a historical document, such as a city directory. Information extracted from the line of data includes a name, an address, an occupation, and\/or other information relating to a person listed in the city directory.","Embodiments of the invention provide for the extraction of digitized information from a printed document, such as a historical record, to facilitate access and use of the information.","In one embodiment, lines or entries of data, each having computer readable text associated with a person (such as name, address, and\/or occupation), have certain data extracted. In one embodiment, the extracted data is the name of the person. The extracted name may be stored (and may also be associated with other data in that same line of data), to facilitate searching of and access to the data. In other embodiments, the extracted data may be addresses, occupations, or other information in the original document.","In some embodiments, a printed document (such as a historical document or record) is digitized. The document is scanned and image data is provide to an optical character recognition (OCR) system. Zones of text are removed (based on predetermined characteristics), and individual lines are classified, with some lines are removed and reconstructed based on the classification, so that there is a single line of data corresponding to each record entry (e.g., an entry for one person). Certain data or information is extracted from the individual lines of data so that the data can be more readily searched and accessed.","In one described embodiment, the printed document is a city directory that has been digitized into computer readable text. Lines of data (each corresponding to a person listed in the directory) have name, address and occupation data extracted and stored in order to facilitate searching of the digitized directory. Other data may be extracted based on the analysis of each line of data, such as gender, marital status, family relationships, and deaths.","While the described embodiment is directed to a city directory (as described earlier in conjunction with ), it should be appreciated that the features of the invention can be used in connection with many other types of printed documents, including both historical records (such as voter registration lists, military muster rolls, and vital statistics records), and non-historical records.","Turning briefly to , there is illustrated a simplified block diagram of a system  for carrying out aspects of the present invention. The system  includes a scanner  for scanning each page of a printed document, such as a city directory. The scanner  is conventional, and pages of the directory may be scanned individually, or automatically (such as by removing the spine of the directory and having the resulting stacked pages automatically fed and scanned at the scanner ). The system  further includes a document processing system  that includes an optical character recognition (OCR) system  for converting the scanned and digitized images received from the scanner  into computer readable text, and a document processor  that is programmed for processing the computer readable text from OCR system  in accordance with aspects of the invention. Data representing information from the directory (and as it may exist during or after various stages of processing) is stored in a memory system .","Turning now to , there is shown a general flow diagram of a process for digitizing a city directory. At step , the pages of the directory are optically scanned (using scanner ), and at step  the optically scanned data (in the form of images) is provided to the OCR system  within processing system  for converting the images to computer readable text.","At step , zones of text are then defined or created by the OCR system for each page of the directory, and at step  each zone is then evaluated by system  for characteristics that indicate the zone as having data that is likely to be irrelevant. At step  zones with irrelevant data are excluded or removed from the digitized directory. Briefly, creating text zones at step  can be based on analyzing blank and extraneous characters, white space around blocks of text (e.g., in relation to space between lines), separation borders or rulings, changes in font and alignment of characters, and other well known analysis. Six different zone characteristics are evaluated at step : (1) zone size characteristics, (2) zone format characteristics, (3) lower case characteristics, (4) index characteristics, (5) paragraph characteristics, and (6) address\/number first characteristics. Each zone having certain specified zone size characteristics, zone format characteristics, lower case characteristics, index characteristics, paragraph characteristics, and address\/number first characteristics, are then excluded or removed from the digitized directory at step . Further details on how zones are created, how zones characteristics are determined and evaluated, and how zones are removed can be found in the aforementioned U.S. application Ser. No. 13\/242,736.","At step , the lines of each remaining zone are reviewed for certain characteristics for the purpose of classifying the lines and certain words within the lines, and at step  the system processes dittos and processes line wraps (any line that is a continuation of a preceding line). At step , certain lines (not having useful information) are removed from the digitized document and at step  the remaining lines are reconstructed as appropriate, including appending any wrapped line to the prior line with which it is associated. Further details on how lines are reviewed, how dittos and line wraps are processed, and how lines are removed and reconstructed can likewise be found in the aforementioned U.S. application Ser. No. \/,. The data resulting from steps - are lines of data records or entries, each line corresponding to a person listed in the directory and having a name (and other useful information associated with that person). Examples of such lines of data are seen in previously referenced .","Finally, at step , certain data is extracted from the lines of data (such as those illustrated in ), in order to facilitate the access and use of that data. The manner of extracting various data in accordance with some embodiments will be described below in conjunction with . In one embodiment, names are extracted and then stored in memory system  (along with other information associated with that name), thus permitting a user to search by name (and retrieve matching names and other data associated with the matched names). In other embodiments, other information (such as addresses and\/or occupations) can be separately extracted, stored and also searched.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIG. 1","FIG. 2","FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["440","310"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":["FIGS. 6","FIG. 4","FIG. 3","FIG. 6","FIG. 7","FIG. 8"],"b":["7","8","440","308","304"]},"Turning to , there is illustrated a simplified flow diagram of an exemplary process for extracting a name from a line of data, such as one of the lines of data from a city directory that are seen in . The line of data (from which a name is to be extracted) is provided to the system at step . At step , the system indentifies capitalized words (e.g., first letter capitalized) in the line of data and then at step  identifies any name delimiter that appears in the line. A more complete explanation of both identifying capitalized words and indentifying delimiters will be given later in connection with , , ,  and . Briefly, a delimiter is a word, character, or symbol that has been predetermined (e.g., based on experience) as likely to identify the end or boundary of a person's name (in this case, likely for a city directory). Examples of delimiters will be provided later.","Next, the system sequentially captures each capitalized word, starting at one end of the line and moving from left to right (in relation to one of the lines of data seen in ), until reaching the delimiter. At steps  and , a surname and a given name are identified from the captured words. Again, a more specific and detailed explanation will be given later, but in general, the surname and given name are based on the word location within the string of words sequentially captured at step . At step , the surname and given name are stored in searchable data fields (such as the illustrated data fields in ). Finally, at step , other data from the same line may be stored in association with the name (surname and given name), in order to make the other information accessible when the name is retrieved or accessed. As an example of how the association of data at step  might be later used, if the system extracts names and stores them in searchable fields, a user of the system attempting to locate a person by name would also be able to retrieve at the same time any data stored in association with a located name (such additional data providing additional useful information on the person identified by the name).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 2","FIG. 5"],"b":["710","716","716","718","720","726","728"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 2","FIG. 8","FIG. 5","FIG. 8","FIG. 46"],"b":["810","812","818","820","824","820"]},"The embodiments of ,  and  have been simplified for purposes of describing the general features within system  for extracting data. As should be appreciated, for ease of description and understanding, some details have been omitted.","A more comprehensive embodiment (providing details omitted from ,  and ) will be described shortly with reference to . In such embodiment, a more extensive set of data fields, into which extracted data may be stored for each person, are as follows:\n\n","For purposes of the describing this embodiment (where the extraction process is used in conjunction with lines of data from a city directory), it should be understood that the extraction process generally involves three sub-processes. Those sub-processes are (1) identifying (tagging) certain types of words within the lines of data, (2) identifying certain types of phrases in which those words appear, and then (3) executing rendering rules for analyzing words and phrases in order to extract data that will be useful for populating data fields. It should be pointed out that the identification of certain words and phrases will be done with the reference to and use of pre-established dictionaries, and those dictionaries can be found in Appendices A-L at the end of this description.","Identifying Word Types","The following is a listing of word types or categories that may be found in each line of data (from a city directory), with a brief description of each word category, and reference to a figure in the drawings having specific examples of the word category.","Word","A Word is one or more alphanumeric characters grouped together (separated from other Words by a space). If a punctuation mark appears within a Word, it is ignored and is not part of a Word.  provides several examples of a Word in lines of data originating from a city directory.","Number","A Number is a Word having all numeric characters (0-9).  provides several examples of a Number in lines of data originating from a city directory.","NameWord","A NameWord is any Word having a proper case (any word where the first letter capitalized, or where all letters capitalized). A NameWord may only contain letter characters or contain characters found in the NameWord Dictionary (Appendix A).  provides several examples of a NameWord in lines of data originating from a city directory.","NumWord","A NumWord is any Word having both letter characters (alpha characters) and numeric characters.  provides several examples of a NumWord in lines of data originating from a city directory.","Month","A Month is a NameWord that appears in the Month Dictionary (Appendix B), and is either preceded or followed by a Number.  provides several examples of a Month in lines of data originating from a city directory.","Lparenthesis","An Lparenthesis is the character \u201c(\u201d.  provides examples of an Lparenthesis in lines of data originating from a city directory","Rparenthesis","A Rparenthesis is the character \u201c)\u201d.  also provides examples of an Rparenthesis in lines of data originating from a city directory.","Suffix","A Suffix is a Word or NameWord that appears in the Suffix Dictionary (Appendix C).  provides several examples of a Suffix in lines of data originating from a city directory.","Prefix","A Prefix is a Word or NameWord that appears in the Prefix Dictionary (Appendix D).  provides several examples of a Prefix in lines of data originating from a city directory.","Date","A Date is one of the following patterns below where N is a Number:\n\n","Widow","A Widow is a Word that appears in the Widow Dictionary (Appendix E).  provides several examples of a Widow in lines of data originating from a city directory.","Moccupation","An Moccupation is the first NameWord in the line of data (reading from the left) that can be found in the Moccupation Dictionary (Appendix F, which shows each Moccupation and a corresponding expanded or complete form of the Moccupation).  provides several examples of an Moccupation in lines of data originating from a city directory. As should be appreciated, this word category relates to a military occupation\/branch of service.","PNameWord","PNameWord is each of a series of sequential NameWords in the line of data (reading from left) until reaching a delimiter. In the case where the first Word in the line of data is not a NameWord, each Word to the right is read until a NameWord is detected.","A delimiter is defined as either:","any word that is not a NameWord, or","a comma.","In the case where only one PNameWord is detected and the delimiter is a comma, all additional words to the right are read until the next delimiter is reached and all read or captured Words are tagged as a single PNameWord.",{"@attributes":{"id":"h-0006","num":"0000"},"figref":"FIG. 20"},"Restype","A Restype is a Word that is either (1) the first Word in the line of data (reading from the left) that can be found in the Restype Dictionary (Appendix G) or (2) the first NumWord in the line of data (reading from the left) that begins with the character \u201ch\u201d or \u201cr\u201d, whichever appears first in a line of data (reading from left to right).  provides several examples of a Restype in lines of data originating from a city directory.","Identifying Phrase Types","The following is a listing of phrase types or categories, with a brief description of each phrase category, and reference to a figure in the drawings having specific examples of the phrase category.","MovedPhrase","A MovedPhrase is group of Words relating to a move or change of residence in a line of data. It is identified in a line by first looking for a pattern of Words as follows: one or more PNameWords, followed by a Word appearing the MovedPhrase Dictionary (Appendix H), followed by the Word \u201cto,\u201d followed by a NameWord.","If such a pattern is found, then a MovedPhrase is tagged or identified as the Word from the MovedPhrase Dictionary (found in the pattern) and all Words to the right of the Word from the MovedPhrase Dictionary.

Each rule may be used to render (identify and extract\/capture) specific data to be stored in a data field, based on identified (tagged) words and phrases. For each rendering rule there is given a description and reference to a figure having specific examples of an application of the rule to lines of data in a city directory.","It should be noted that there is reference in the rendering rules to a primary person and a secondary person. In each line of data (from a city directory) provided to the system, the entry is for the primary person. But as mentioned earlier, in some instances a secondary person (e.g., spouse) may be included in a line of data for the primary person. In such circumstances, and as will be more fully described below, the system will ultimately create two records, one for the primary person and one for the secondary person. Certain data (e.g., an address) will be taken from the data associated with the primary person and attributed to the secondary person (in order to create a separate set of data fields associated with the secondary person).","Surname Rendering","In the case where the PNamePhrase contains a comma, render all NameWords to the left of the comma as the \u201cSurname\u201d of the person.","If there is no comma, render the first word in PNamePhrase as the \u201cSurname\u201d of the person.

As a specific example (and as illustrated in ), if the words \u201cde la Hoya\u201d are in the PNamePhrase (and \u201cde\u201d and \u201cla\u201d are words in the Compound Surname Dictionary), the rightmost token is \u201cla,\u201d the only word to the left is \u201cde\u201d, and the word to the right of the rightmost component is \u201cHoya,\u201d and thus the rendered Surname is \u201cde la Hoya.\u201d","If any word in the rendered Surname is found in the Company Exclusion Dictionary (Appendix J), delete the entire entry. This circumstance arises, e.g., when the entry is not for a person but rather a business or company.  provides various examples of a Surname (\u201cs\u201d) extracted from various PNamePhrases.","Given Name Rendering","If there is no comma in the PNamePhrase, render all remaining words in PNamePhrase (after rendering\/extraction of the Surname) as the \u201cGiven Name\u201d on the primary person.","In the case where the PNamePhrase contains a comma, render all NameWords to the right of the comma as the \u201cGiven name.\u201d","However, if any word in the rendered Given Name is found in the Company Exclusion Dictionary, delete the entire entry.  provides various examples of a Given Name (\u201cg\u201d) extracted from various PNamePhrases.","Prefix Rendering","Where a Prefix word has been indentified (tagged) in a line of data as described earlier, render any tagged Prefix into the data field \u201cPrefix\u201d for the person in the listing.","For Prefix \u201cMiss\u201d or \u201cMrs,\u201d set the \u201cGender\u201d data field to \u201cFemale\u201d on the person.
