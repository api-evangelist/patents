The United States Government has certain rights in this invention.","Embodiments of the present invention relate to solar thermochemical fuel production and more particularly relate to a moving bed reactor for solar thermochemical fuel production.","Solar concentration systems typically entail optics (mirrors or lenses) to focus a large area of sunlight, or solar thermal energy, onto a small area. The solar thermal energy may drive a heat engine, such as a steam turbine, which may be further coupled to an electrical power generator to convert a portion of the solar thermal energy into electricity. Solar concentration systems may also drive a thermochemical reaction to generate a fuel that chemically stores a portion of the solar thermal energy. Water splitting, gasification of coal, and reforming of methane are all under investigation as potential solar thermochemical fuel production techniques. Solar concentration systems may drive other important reactions on an industrial scale as well, such as COreduction into CO, for example.","Many solar thermochemical reactions entail a redox cycle. In a water splitting reaction to produce hydrogen from water, a metal-oxide redox pair is thermally reduced and the reduced reactive media then drives decomposition of water. The metal oxide is then reduced again to repeat the cycle. While identifying advantageous metal-oxides is currently a subject of research, thermodynamic considerations dictate the thermal reduction portion of the cycle generally requires a high temperature, typically between 1000-2000\u00b0 C., depending on the reactive oxide chosen and other conditions in the system.","Solar thermochemical reactors can take many forms, affording more or less efficient fuel production, scalability, etc. One conventional system utilizes a honeycomb substrate that is coated with the reactive oxide. The honeycomb substrate is alternately exposed to collected solar energy to heat the system and reduce the reactive oxide, and to a reactant gas, such as HO in the case of water splitting, to generate fuel. Such a reactor is essentially a fixed bed, and as such, suffers temperature non-uniformities and low thermal efficiency because much of the solar energy  is expended on heating non-reactive portions of the bed (e.g., honeycomb substrate) and is ultimately rejected from the system as waste heat, rather than utilized for fuel production. Also, with each redox cycle, the entire system undergoes extreme thermal cycling, leading to component fatigue.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","110","115","105","110","150","140","120","110","150","110","130","100","140","140","110","105","140","105","110","105","100","110"],"sub":"2"},"A system which avoids many of the difficulties and efficiency limitations associated with existing reactors would advantageously advance the art of solar thermochemical fuel production.","Reactors and methods for solar thermochemical reactions are described herein. Embodiments of reactors provide at least two distinct reactor chambers between which there is at least a pressure differential. In embodiments, reactive particles are exchanged between chambers during a reaction cycle to thermally reduce the particles at first conditions and oxidize the particles at second conditions to produce chemical work from heat.","In one embodiment, reactive particles are thermally reduced in a thermal reduction chamber through direct illumination of concentrated solar energy. Coupled to the thermal reduction chamber is a fuel production chamber in which reduced particles are oxidized to reduce a reactant gas introduced into the fuel production chamber. A conveyance continuously moves the reactive particles between the thermal reduction chamber and the fuel production chamber with the chambers continually operating at their respective steady state conditions.","In embodiments, chambers of a solar thermochemical reactor are coupled to a heat exchanger to pre-heat the reactive particles prior to direct exposure to thermal energy. The heat exchanger transfers heat from reduced reactive particles to oxidized reactive particles as the reduced and oxidized particles are oppositely conveyed between the thermal reduction chamber and the fuel production chamber","In an embodiment, particle conveyance is in part provided by an elevator having an interior through which reactive particles are conveyed in a first direction while other reactive particles are conveyed in a second direction on an exterior shaft surface. In one such embodiment, the elevator further has the attributes of a heat exchanger to pre-heat the reactive particles.","Described herein are moving bed solar thermochemical reactors and methods of operation. In the following description, numerous details are set forth. It will be apparent, however, to one skilled in the art, that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details.

Furthermore, the particular features, structures, functions, or characteristics may be combined in any suitable manner in one or more embodiments. For example, a first embodiment may be combined with a second embodiment anywhere the two embodiments are not mutually exclusive.","The terms \u201ccoupled\u201d and \u201cconnected,\u201d along with their derivatives, may be used herein to describe structural relationships between components. It should be understood that these terms are not intended as synonyms for each other.

Although the reactive particles are not consumed significantly with each reaction cycle in the exemplary embodiments described herein, one of skill in the art will note the systems and techniques described herein enable particle continuous addition and are therefore readily adaptable to embodiments where the reactive particles may be consumed (e.g., volatilized) and replenished.

For the exemplary water splitting embodiment, the temperature differential between Tand Tadvantageously avoids a need to perform any subsequent separation of Hfrom O. In one exemplary ceria embodiment, operation  is performed at a fuel production temperature Tof approximately 1000\u00b0 C. In further embodiments, the fuel production pressure Pis maintained at a pressure higher than the reduction pressure P. A higher fuel production pressure Padvantageously improves reactor efficiency because the rate of reaction (2) is directly proportional to pressure. In one exemplary ceria embodiment, the fuel production pressure Pis at least 1 atm, and preferably about 3-6 atm, at a point where the reactant fluid  (e.g., steam) is introduced. In certain embodiments, countercurrent flow of the reactive particles and reactant fluid  (illustrated in  as opposing flow arrows within the fuel production chamber ) is provided to maximize the extent of the fuel production reaction.","With the reactor  maintaining the thermal reduction chamber  at a thermal reduction pressure Pbelow the fuel production pressure Pin the fuel production chamber  during steady state operation of the reactor , the reactor  may independently provide optimal processing conditions for the separate operations  and  of the redox cycle . For example, Pmay be designed to achieve a greater extent of reduction x without hampering the fuel production half of the redox cycle . FIG.  illustrates a curve  of the extent of reduction, x, (plotted on the secondary y-axis) for ceria particles, a reduction temperature Tof 1500\u00b0 C., and fuel production temperature Tof 1000\u00b0 C. as a function of Opartial pressure in pascals (Pa). As shown, reduction extent declines by a factor of 10 or more as Opartial pressure increases from 1 Pa to 100000 Pa, or about 1 atmosphere (atm). For one exemplary embodiment, a pressure differential of at least 1 atm is maintained between Pand Pduring steady state operation where the operations  and  are continuously performed and the reactive particles continuously transferred between the thermal reduction chamber  and the fuel production chamber .","As further illustrated in , the moving bed reactor  includes a conveyance  to move reactive particles between the thermal reduction chamber  and the fuel production chamber . The conveyance  is to provide pressure separation between the thermal reduction chamber  and the fuel production chamber  so that the differential between the pressure Pand Pis maintained while continually moving the first plurality of reactive particles through the chambers of the reactor . Being configured for continuous operation, the reactor  can be scaled to industrial capacities much more readily than can a system limited to achieving a pressure differential through patch mode operation (e.g., where pressure is varied between batches or modes of operation).","Pressure separation may be maintained by the conveyance  via a fluid flow restriction through which the reactive particles pass as they are transferred between the thermal reduction chamber and the fuel production chamber. Depending on the embodiment, the reactive particles may themselves form a fluid flow restriction, sustaining at least a portion of a desired pressure differential between Pand P. In further embodiments, pressure isolation is provided with a fluid flow restriction in the form of one or more airlocks disposed in the reactor  between the thermal reduction chamber  and the fuel production chamber . In an embodiment, a first airlock is provided between an outlet of the thermal reduction chamber  and an inlet of the fuel production chamber  with a reduced reactive particle (e.g., MO) to pass through the first airlock before entering the fuel production chamber . A second air lock may further be coupled between an outlet of the fuel production chamber  and an inlet of the thermal reduction chamber  with the reoxidized reactive particle (e.g., MO) to pass through the second airlock before entering the thermal reduction chamber .","In the exemplary embodiment illustrated in , the moving bed solar thermochemical reactor  further comprises a heat exchanger (HTX)  disposed between the thermal reduction chamber  and the fuel production chamber . The HTX  is to recover sensible heat within the reactor  by transferring heat energy Q from a reduced reactive particle (e.g., MO) to pre-heat a reoxidized reactive particle (e.g., MO) as they are oppositely conveyed between the chambers , . As further shown in , the hot and cold sides of the HTX  implement the additional operations A and B of the redox cycle . This ability to recover sensible heat improves efficiency of the reactor  considerably as the amount of solar flux rejected as waste heat is reduced in favor of fuel production.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"sub":["r ","2 ","1 ","2 ","r ","r","H2","H2 ","r "],"b":["210","200","200","215","400","460","480","490"]},"In one embodiment, the HTX  is a countercurrent exchanger having a hot side inlet coupled to an outlet of the thermal reduction chamber  and a hot side outlet coupled to an inlet of the fuel production chamber .

The vacuum chamber  is coupled to a vacuum source to remove the O from the reactor . The thermal reduction chamber  is physically coupled to an elevator . An annulus of thermal insulation  surrounds the elevator  the thermal reduction chamber  with a window on a top side of the thermal reduction chamber  and a bottom side interfacing with the elevator . In the illustrative embodiment, the elevator  is vertical, however the elevator slope may be a lesser non-zero value.","In one embodiment the elevator  includes an auger.  illustrates an expanded sectional view  of the elevator , in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. As shown, the elevator includes a hollow shaft  about a longitudinal axis . The hollow shaft  has an interior surface  to continually convey reduced reactive particles  (e.g., MO) in a downward direction along the longitudinal axis , away from the solar energy flux . The hollow shaft  further includes a continuous flighting  attached to an outside shaft surface to also continuously convey reactive particles  (e.g., MO) in an upward direction along the longitudinal axis , toward the solar energy flux . Downward conveyance may be motivated by gravity while an angular velocity of the flighting  relative to a surrounding external tube  is imparted by the elevator  to provide for upward conveyance.","In embodiments, the elevator  functions both as a countercurrent conveyance and as a countercurrent heat exchanger for the reactor . For such embodiments, the physical components of the elevator  (e.g., made of ceramic) transfer heat between the reactive particles being countercurrent conveyed through the elevator  to provide a heat exchanger efficiency of at least 50%. Heat recovery via the elevator  is improved at increased pressure. Generally, the pressure in a bottom of the heat exchanger is between the reduction pressure Pand the fuel production pressure P. Where the pressure at the bottom of heat exchanger is to be set in practice generally depends on the balance between the improved heat exchange, additional pumping work required to evacuate the reduction volume, and desired reduction chamber residence time ti. As such, the elevator pressure profile is further a function of the thermal conductivity of the reactive particles, physical components of the elevator , as well as the pumping efficiency.","Referring again to the expanded elevator view illustrated in , the interior surface  may further include fins  to increase surface area of the elevator  and thereby increase heat exchange efficiency. With the fins  extending radially from the interior surface  toward the longitudinal axis  and having a length L extending parallel to the longitudinal axis, the external tube  may be coupled to a mechanical drive to rotate the external tube  while maintaining the hollow elevator shaft  (and therefore the flighting ) stationary. This type of external drive advantageously minimizes the number of movable parts in the elevator which are exposed to high temperatures and vacuum. In particular embodiments, the elevator  has a ratio of flighting spacing H to flighting width W (as illustrated in ) that is less than 1:1 to further improve the exchanger efficiency. While exact flighting pitch:diameter (or spacing:width) is a matter of design choice, a smaller flighting spacing generally increases the residence time of a particle traversing the flighting  and larger fighting widths increase cold side surface area of the elevator  and increase particle throughput. The throughput requirements of the elevator  may be determined based on a desired reduction chamber residence time \u03c4.","Returning to , the hollow elevator shaft  is coupled to a rotary airlock . The rotary airlock  may be any known in the art which will ensure adequate pressure separation between the elevator  and the conduit A where the reactant fluid  is introduced. As such, pressure separation is provided in part by a pressure drop across the column of particles within the hollow elevator shaft  and in further part by the rotary airlock . As an example, steam may be introduced at approximately 400-600 kPa and depending on the pressure drop within the vacuum chamber  along the length of the elevator , the airlock  is to provide a fluid flow restriction sufficient to reach the desired reduction pressure P. The conduit A is functionally a portion of the fuel production chamber and is to conduct reactive particles  motivated by the reactant fluid . The length of the conduit A is based on the desired production chamber residence time \u03c4for optimal fuel production. For example, longer conduit  may be employed to increase the production chamber residence time  independently of the reduction chamber residence time \u03c4. As the optimal reduction chamber residence time \u03c4may deviate from the optimal production chamber residence time \u03c4by an order of magnitude or more depending on the particle reaction kinetics, residence time is another independent reactor design parameter (along with temperature and pressure) which may be optimized within the reactors  and  to avoid compromises leading to reduced reactor performance.","Coupled to the conduit A is a separator B, functioning as a second portion of the fuel production chamber. In the illustrated embodiment, the separator B is a commercially available cyclonic separator, though alternative separators known in the art may also be utilized. As illustrated, the separator B includes a fluid reaction product outlet, though which reaction product  is to be removed, and a particulate drain, through which the reactive particles are fed, by gravity and\/or a pressure differential, through a rotary airlock  into a hopper  monitored through low and high level sensors . As shown in , with the elevator  on the low pressure side of the airlocks  and , lengths of the heat exchanger (elevator ) are between the reduction pressure Pand oxidation pressure P, though in alternative embodiments the heat exchanger may be disposed on a high pressure side of a reactor.","With the reactor components illustrated in ,  illustrates a flow diagram of a method  that is continuously performed by the reactor  during operation, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Reactive particles  are continuously brought from the hopper  into direct illumination by the elevator  while reduced reactive particles continuously flow down through the elevator  to effect heat transfer between the particles at operation  (). Solar energy flux  is continuously received in the thermal reduction chamber  to thermally reduce the reactive particles , such as ceria particles, at operation  substantially as described elsewhere herein. The reduced reactive particles continuously pass through the rotary airlock  and are then blown with a reactive motive gas at operation . The reacted motive gas is collected at operation  and the reoxidized particles collected in the hopper  and gravity fed back into the elevator .","As so described, the artisan will appreciate that with many independent design parameters, a design protocol for the reactors described herein may include first determining thermal reduction properties of the reactive particles (e.g., reaction kinetics at a chosen reduction temperature and oxygen partial pressure). A solar concentrator power Q, overall particle mass flow rate through the reduction chamber, and oxygen pumping speed may be independently set to establish the desired reduction temperature, pressure, and residence time (T, P, \u03c4). With the particle mass flow rate fixed, a desired heat exchanger efficiency may be defined, and the heat exchanger length may be independently set. For the fuel production chamber, the production temperature T, and production residence time \u03c4may then be set by appropriate component sizing and adjusting the flow of the reactant fluid (two more independent parameters).","It is to be understood that the above description is illustrative, and not restrictive. For example, while flow diagrams in the figures show a particular order of operations performed by certain embodiments of the invention, it should be understood that such order is not required (e.g., alternative embodiments may perform the operations in a different order, combine certain operations, overlap certain operations, etc.). Furthermore, many other embodiments will be apparent to those of skill in the art upon reading and understanding the above description. Although the present invention has been described with reference to specific exemplary embodiments, it will be recognized that the invention is not limited to the embodiments described, but can be practiced with modification and alteration within the spirit and scope of the appended claims. The scope of the invention should, therefore, be determined with reference to the appended claims, along with the full scope of equivalents to which such claims are entitled."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["Embodiments of the present invention are illustrated by way of example, and not limitation, in the figures of the accompanying drawings in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 5"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 5"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
