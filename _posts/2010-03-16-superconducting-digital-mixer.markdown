title: Superconducting digital mixer
abstract: Digital mixers which permit mixing of asynchronous signals may be constructed of Rapid Single Flux Quantum (RSFQ) logic elements. The logic elements may include an RSFQ non-destructive readout cell (NDRO), an RSFQ D flip-flop, an RSFQ XOR circuit, and an RSFQ T flip-flop. A binary tree arrangement of T flip-flops can be used to provide in-phase and quadrature phase-divided replicas of a reference signal. The mixing elements can be either an XOR circuit, a dual port NDRO circuit functioning as a multiplexer or an RS type NDRO functioning as an AND gate. The RSFQ logic elements utilize Josephson junctions which operate in superconducting temperature domains.

No. 11\/243,019, filed Oct. 4, 2005, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,680,474, the entirety of which is expressly incorporated herein by reference.","This invention was made with Government support under Contract Numbers N00014-02-C-0005, N00014-03-C-0082 and N00014-03-C-0370 awarded by the Department of the Navy. The Government has certain rights in the invention.","1. Field of the Invention","The invention described herein relates to the field of superconductivity, and more specifically relates to circuits and techniques for implementing digital quadrature mixers using Josephson junctions.","2. Related Art","Josephson junctions are quantum-mechanical circuit elements of superconducting devices. The Josephson effect in particular results from two superconductors acting to preserve long-range order across a barrier, such as an insulating barrier. With a thin enough barrier, the phase of the electron wave function in one superconductor maintains a fixed relationship with the phase of the wave function in another superconductor. This linking up of phases is called phase coherence.","A Josephson junction is the interface between two superconducting materials separated by a non-superconducting barrier. A current may flow freely within the superconductors but the barrier prevents the current from flowing freely between them. However, a supercurrent may tunnel through the barrier depending on the quantum phase of the superconductors. The amount of supercurrent that may tunnel through the barriers is restricted by the size and substance of the barrier. The maximum value the supercurrent may obtain is called a critical current of the Josephson junction.","Josephson junctions have two basic electrical properties. The first is that the junctions have inductive reactance. That is, similar to inductors, the voltage difference across the junction is related to the time rate of change of the current. The second is that a constant voltage across the junction will produce an oscillating current through the barrier, and vice versa. Thus, Josephson junctions convert a direct current voltage to an alternating current.","A family of logic\/memory devices were proposed using Josephson junctions the IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity, Volume 1, Number 1, March 1991, by K. K. Likharev and V. K. Semenov in an article entitled, RSFQ Logic\/Memory Family: A New Josephson junction Technology For Sub-Terahertz-Clock-Frequency Digital Systems. That article is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety into specification of this application.","RSFQ circuits are widely recognized as the fastest digital circuits in any electronic technology, and this is also true of RSFQ digital mixers. The digital mixers described in the present invention constitute the first practical circuits for the implementation of digital mixers in a complete RSFQ digital receiver system, and have been demonstrated for clock speeds up to 40 GHz.","Prior art attempts at producing digital mixers in the superconducting domain required synchronism between an incoming signal and a reference signal.","The invention described herein is related to circuits and techniques for implementing digital mixers utilizing Josephson junction technology, which don't require synchronism between the incoming signal and a reference signal.","The purpose of the invention is to provide a digital quadrature mixer, which overcomes the problems of the prior art.","An important component of any digital receiver is a digital I\/Q Mixer for converting narrowband (about 5 MHz) signals down from a few GHz. To achieve this goal with maximum efficiency the invention uses a circuit that is similar in principle to the Gilbert quadrature mixer. See article by B. Gilbert, \u201cA Precise Four Quadrant Multiplier With Sub nanosecond Response,\u201d IEEE. J. Solid-State Circuits, Vol. SC-3, pp. 365-373, December 1968. The basic idea of this mixer is to use square waves as a local oscillator signal instead of sine waves. The mathematical representation of a square wave is G(t)=sign[sin(\u03c9\u00b7t)], where \u03c9\u00b7t is a local oscillator frequency. The digital version of such a mixer is comparably easy to implement in RSFQ in case of single-bit coding, such as at the output of a delta-sigma modulator.","The first implementation of a square wave digital mixer in RSFQ is shown in . The right side of the device on the block diagram serves as a single-bit square wave generator with quadrature outputs. Although,  is shown as a two channel I\/Q Mixer, the principles of the invention apply to a single channel mixer as well. As shown, the binary tree of resettable T flip-flops creates two (I and Q) local oscillator signals with 90 degree relative phase shift. The T flip-flops control RS-type NDRO cells, which, in turn, create digital square waves turning on and off a stream of SFQ pulses. A modulated signal gets mixed with 90 degree. shifted square waves in XOR cells, producing I channel and Q channel output products. An RS-type NDRO cell and a T flip-flop is used, instead of a T-type NDRO cell, in order to avoid a possible collision between the NDRO read-out pulse and reference pulse. Such a collision may cause a wrong phase shift between I and Q local oscillator signals. If such a problem occurs, the only way to correct it is by applying a RESET signal, and one would not want to do that too often. Despite its simple design, this version of the mixer has issues with timing, limiting its performance.","To avoid this problem, we have designed a second novel mixer performing single-bit-stream XOR multiplication (). In this case, we use the simple fact that A XOR 0=A and A XOR 1=\u0100. A Rapid Single-Flux-Quantum (RSFQ) D flip-flop with complementary outputs (DFFC) (schematics and optimal parameters are in Kirichenko et al., \u201cA 4-bit Single Flux Quantum Decoder,\u201d IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity, Vol. 5, No. 2, p. 2857, June 1995), converts the modulated signal into a single-bit data stream along with its inverted (complementary) representation. Multiplexing direct and inverted data outputs to the proper channel, it performs digital Quadrature signal down-conversion. After the modulated signal passes through a D flip-flop with complementary outputs (DFFC), it becomes asynchronous. Multiplexing direct and inverted data outputs to the proper channel, we effectively perform digital I\/Q signal down-conversion. The multiplexing is done by two multiplexer cells controlled by the same T flip-flop binary tree as in , providing a 90 degree phase shift between I and Q channels. Again this circuit can be applied to single channel mixing as well as to I\/Q quadrature mixing.","The multiplexer cell is shown in . This cell basically comprises a dual-port NDRO cell. From this cell, a designer can build either a demultiplexer by merging inputs A and B, or a multiplexer by merging outputs A and B. See article by Kirichenko et al., \u201cA 4-bit Single Flux Quantum decoder,\u201d IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity, Vol. 5, No. 2, p. 2857, June 1995.","We have designed and fabricated the  version of the digital I\/Q Mixer using the standard HYPRES 1 kA\/cmfabrication process. The same design was also converted to the standard HYPRES 4.5 kA\/cmfabrication process.","The multiplexing is done by two 2\u00d71 RSFQ switches. The basic switch cell shown in  comprises a dual-port RSFQ Non-Destructive Read-Out (NDRO) cell with merged outputs, i.e., electrically connected outputs , . Applying an SFQ pulse to the input \u201cSet A\u201d causes the switch to connect input terminal \u201cIn A\u201d to the output terminal \u201cOut A\u201d and disconnect terminal \u201cIn B\u201d. Applying an SFQ pulse to the input \u201cSet B\u201d causes the switch to connect input terminal \u201cIn B\u201d to the output terminal \u201cOut B\u201d and disconnect terminal \u201cIn A\u201d.
