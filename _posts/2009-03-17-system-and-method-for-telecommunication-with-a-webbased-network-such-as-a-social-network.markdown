{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Web-based social networks (SNs), such as FACEBOOK\u00ae, MYSPACE\u00ae, and SKYPE\u00ae, have become ubiquitous. Social networks typically provide a variety of ways for registered users to interact with one another, such as IM (Instant Messaging), voicemail, multimedia messaging (MMS), email, voice and\/or video calling. Furthermore, it is common for social networks to offer a contact list (e.g., a \u201cbuddy\u201d list or \u201cfriends\u201d list) application which is a collection of screen names that represent registered users on a respective SN. The contact list typically indicates the real-time presence status of the registered users (i.e., on-line or off-line) on the respective social network and serves as a shortcut to initiate communication, such as voice or video calling with a desired contact on the contact list.","Social network users may access social networks via PCs, handheld computers, mobile phones or any web-based device (e.g., smartphone). Computer users who are registered with multiple social networks must log on to each of the respective social network websites in order to access their accounts and respective contact lists. Currently, users of devices other than computers, such as mobile phones, smartphones or similar wired or wireless telecommunications devices, may log on to each respective social network website much like a computer user, or may install a client-specific (i.e., social network specific) software application on the device that enables access to the social networking services. The software application allows the device user to, for example, quickly and sometimes seamlessly login to the user's social network account to view and\/or access his\/her contact list, communicate with a desired contact by way of, for example, voice calling, and to receive an indication of the real-time presence status of the registered contacts. For instance, if a mobile phone user wishes to initiate a voice communication with a contact identified in a \u201cbuddy list\u201d associated with a social networking service, the mobile phone user must install the relevant application, run the application, select the relevant contact from the buddy list, and then initiate the voice communication.","The need exists for a system that eliminates these multiple steps and provides device users with the ability to initiate a variety of telecommunication services with one or more contacts without having to log on to a social networking service, install special applications enabling telecommunication services with the social networking service, select the contact(s) with whom to engage in a telecommunication session, etc. Overall, the examples herein of some prior or related systems and their associated limitations are intended to be illustrative and not exclusive. Other limitations of existing or prior systems will become apparent to those of skill in the art upon reading the following Detailed Description.","The headings provided herein are for convenience only and do not necessarily affect the scope or meaning of the claimed invention.","In the drawings, the same reference numbers and any acronyms identify elements or acts with the same or similar structure or functionality for ease of understanding and convenience. To easily identify the discussion of any particular element or act, the most significant digit or digits in a reference number refer to the Figure number in which that element is first introduced (e.g., element  is first introduced and discussed with respect to ).","Various examples of the invention will now be described. The following description provides specific details for a thorough understanding and enabling description of these examples. One skilled in the relevant art will understand, however, that the invention may be practiced without many of these details. Likewise, one skilled in the relevant art will also understand that the invention incorporates many other obvious features not described in detail herein. Additionally, some well-known structures or functions may not be shown or described in detail below, so as to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the relevant description.","The terminology used below is to be interpreted in its broadest reasonable manner, even though it is being used in conjunction with a detailed description of certain specific examples of the invention. Indeed, certain terms may even be emphasized below; any terminology intended to be interpreted in any restricted manner will, however, be overtly and specifically defined as such in this Detailed Description section.","System Description",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 1A"},"While aspects of the invention, such as certain functions, are described as being performed exclusively or primarily on a single device, the invention can also be practiced in distributed environments where functions or modules are shared among disparate processing devices, which are linked through a communications network, such as a Local Area Network (LAN), Wide Area Network (WAN), or the Internet. In a distributed computing environment, program modules may be located in both local and remote memory storage devices.","Aspects of the invention may be stored or distributed on tangible computer-readable media, including magnetically or optically readable computer discs, hard-wired or preprogrammed chips (e.g., EEPROM semiconductor chips), nanotechnology memory, biological memory, or other data storage media. Alternatively or additionally, computer implemented instructions, data structures, screen displays, and other data under aspects of the invention may be distributed over the Internet or over other networks (including wireless networks), on a propagated signal on a propagation medium (e.g., an electromagnetic wave(s), a sound wave, etc.) over a period of time, or they may be provided on any analog or digital network (packet switched, circuit switched, or other scheme).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 1A","b":["100","104","104","104","104","102","102","102","100","103","122","102"],"i":["a","b ","n ","a","b "]},"The web-based networks  may include social networking and blogging services utilizing SMS (Short Message Service), MMS (Multimedia Messaging Service), electronic mail (email), IM (instant message), voice message, and\/or voice and\/or video communication. A user may create respective accounts on the web-based networks . Each of these accounts may have an associated contact list (e.g., a \u201cbuddy\u201d list or \u201cfriends\u201d list) created by the user of the account. The contact list includes a list of registered users on the web-based network and known as \u201ccontacts\u201d, \u201cfriends\u201d or \u201cbuddies\u201d. In this case, contacts (e.g., Buddy , Buddy , . . . ,Buddy n) in the web-based network contact list are collectively referenced as , and contacts in the web-based network contact list are collectively referenced as . The contacts in the web-based networks  are collectively referenced as . It will be understood by those skilled in the art that the contacts  are not necessarily buddies or friends of the device user, but may include the device user's business associates, professional service providers, family members, etc. Additionally, contacts  can be the device user's MYFAVES\u00ae contacts or a set of telephone numbers associated with reduced rate calling plan for the calling party.","The service provider subsystem  comprises one or more devices , . . . (collectively referenced as ), a web portal , a gateway or messaging server , a network address book (NAB) server , and a database  (illustrated in ), all of which are configured to be communicatively coupled to a service provider network . The device  may, for example, be a fixed or mobile device, such as a wired, wireless or cordless phone, Unlicensed Mobile Access or UMA enabled device, portable computer, handheld computer, smartphone, media player, and the like. A user of the device  may be a subscriber to a telecommunications service provider servicing the SP subsystem . The user may additionally have a registered account with one of the web-based networks  or alternatively multiple registered accounts for multiple web-based networks . Furthermore, the user may have respective contact lists associated with the registered accounts. The device  includes one or more identifiers, such as a phone number or a Mobile Subscriber Integrated Services Digital Network (MSISDN) number, an International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) number, a MAC address, an IP address, or other identifiers capable of identifying the device  on either or both of service provider subsystem  and IP network subsystem .","The web portal  may, for example, be a webpage operated or owned by the telecommunication service provider servicing the service provider subsystem . Alternatively, the web portal  may be operated by a third party service provider. The web portal  is configured to allow the user to register for telecommunication service between-the device  and the web-based networks . In an embodiment, the user inputs registration information, either via the device  that will conduct telecommunications with the web-based networks  or via a computer or other internet-accessible device over an alternate network, into the web portal  corresponding to respective registration information used for registered accounts on the web-based networks . Alternatively or in addition, the device  may be configured to automatically provide all or part of such registration information into the web portal . The registration information may be respectively associated with one or more registered accounts on the web-based networks  and may, for example, include a username and password or other login credentials that were used to register the user accounts with the web-based networks . Alternatively and\/or additionally, the registration information may be setup information of one or more e-mail account types, instant messaging (IM) accounts, voicemail accounts. Further information related to set-up of one or more email accounts may be found in the assignee's U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/115,531, entitled, \u201cSYSTEM AND METHOD FOR ACCOUNT SETUP FOR MOBILE DEVICES, SUCH AS AN EMAIL ACCOUNT SETUP,\u201d filed May 5, 2008, which lists A. Bhalekar and M. Penwala as inventors. Additionally, the web portal  receives one or more device  identifiers, such as a phone number, MSISDN number, IMSI, MAC address, IP address or similar identifier associated with the device . The identifier may be input into the web portal  by the device  user or may be automatically provided by the device . The web portal  forwards or pushes the registration information and the identifier to the messaging server . Consequently, the device  does not require client-specific (i.e., web-based network ) software to be loaded thereon in order to retrieve the device  user's contacts  from respective ones of the web-based networks .","The messaging server  may, for example, be a Voice Instant Message (VIM) Gateway, or a Vendor Independent Messaging (VIM) server or gateway. The messaging server  may include a protocol (e.g., email protocol) to provide a common layer where dissimilar messaging programs can share data and back-end services. The messaging server  maps the device  identifier(s) with the registration information associated with web-based network(s)  and stores such mapping in one or more database(s) .","As illustrated in , the stored mapping may take the form of a table stored in the database . While a table is shown, other data structures may, of course, be used. The database  may be maintained by the service provider servicing the service provider subsystem . The database  may be accessible to the messaging server  via the service provider (SP) network  or, alternatively, the database  may be embedded within the messaging server . In one embodiment, in response to the device  being powered and\/or switched ON, the messaging server  accesses the database  to determine the respective registration information associated with the accounts on the web-based networks . In an embodiment, the messaging server  may access the database  to determine the respective registration information associated with the accounts on the web-based networks  when the device  user attempts to initiate telecommunication with a contact .","The messaging server  may use the registration information in the database  to log into the web-based networks  and retrieve the user's contacts  and their associated presence information. The retrieved contacts  and associated presence information may be stored in the database  and mapped to the user's identifier and account registration information for the web-based networks . The messaging server  may repeatedly access the user's respective accounts on the web-based networks  to obtain real-time presence information and real-time contact lists using, for example, web services methods that are known in the art. Such account access may occur repeatedly in a small period of time to reflect presence status of the contacts  in substantially real-time. For example, access may occur periodically every few seconds or even several times per second. The web services methods may, for example, be converted to IMS (IP Multimedia Subsystem) type subscribe\/notify methods for the wireless network. IMS is an open, standardized, user-friendly, next generation networking (NGN) multi-media architecture for mobile and fixed devices. The IMS is a VoIP implementation based on a 3GPP variant of session initiation protocol (SIP), and runs over standard internet protocol (IP).","The messaging server  creates internal strings or numbers, such as unique Direct Inward Dialing (DID) entries, to be associated with respective ones of the contacts . The internal number may, for example, be a numeric string address (\u201c123456\u201d), alphanumeric string address (\u201cL8T4AD8T\u201d), hexadecimal number, or other \u201cdummy\u201d address which, when entered into a device , initiates a communication session or link (e.g., voice\/video call, IM communication) with a contact  (or \u201ctarget\u201d contact). As illustrated in , the internal strings or numbers may also be stored in the database  with their respective contacts  and mapped to the user's identifier. The database  may include data associated with multiple devices (i.e., ID, ID, . . . IDN) . The database  may include email addresses, IM handles, and other electronic addresses (not shown) for the contacts .","Additionally, the messaging server  may import from a contact list , receive from the device  user, or may automatically create labels or names that correspond to the respective internal numbers of the contacts . The labels permit the user to readily identify the respective contacts  to which the internal numbers are associated. The labels may take the form of the screen names used to identify the contacts  on the respective web-based networks  (e.g., screen_name, screen_name). Alternatively, the labels may incorporate a portion of the screen names, various symbols, characters, numeric or alphanumeric strings, or any combination thereof. For example, if a device user (i.e., account subscriber) \u201cUser_A\u201d has contacts \u201cscreen_name\u201d and \u201cscreen_name,\u201d the labels corresponding to the specific internal numbers for contacts \u201cscreen_name\u201d and \u201cscreen_name\u201d may be \u201cUser_A to screen_name\u201d and \u201cUser_A to screen_name,\u201d respectively.","The labels (not shown) may be stored in the database . Alternatively and\/or additionally, the messaging server  may add the created internal numbers to the NAB server . The NAB server  may be operated or owned by the service provider which provides service for the service provider network . Alternatively, the NAB server  may be operated or owned by a third party service provider. The NAB server  and its associated features may be separate from the database , integrated into the database , or any other combination thereof. Although the NAB server  and the database  are described and illustrated herein as separate components, such description should not be construed as limiting the scope of the invention. The NAB server  may be configured to store the device  user's address book, and\/or to synchronize the device  user's contacts list  stored in database  with the device  address book.","The messaging server  may store in the NAB server  the internal numbers and corresponding labels of all the contacts  and provide an indication of the presence status of the contacts . The messaging server  may add to the NAB server  the presence information associated with the user's contacts . Presence identifiers may be used to indicate the presence information of the user's contacts . For example, the presence identifiers may be used to form displayable characters that change color and\/or shape in relation to the detected online status of the respective contacts . Respective presence identifiers may, for example, appear proximate to the contact labels upon being loaded onto the device  via the NAB server  (as described below), such that the user can readily determine whether respective contacts  are online. The presence detection may occur in real-time or substantially close to real time.","The network address book (NAB) server  is configured to synchronize data stored therein with the device . In other words, the NAB server  loads the labels and associated internal numbers onto the device , which does not have residing software specific to the web-based networks . For example, the NAB server  may forward data including the labels and associated internal numbers to the device  for storage and\/or updating previously forwarded and locally stored data. Alternatively, the NAB server  may forward the data including the labels and presence identifiers associated with the internal numbers to the device  for storage and\/or updating previously forwarded and locally stored data. The data forwarded from the NAB server  to the device  may, for example, be stored in a phonebook, contact list, or similar internal memory of the device  (e.g., mobile phone). The internal memory of the device  may take the form of a SIM, phone internal memory, or removable memory card (e.g., SD-card flash memory) or any logical combination thereof. For example, the data may form at least a portion of the device's contact list. The synchronization of the NAB server  data with the device  may occur each time the messaging server  accesses the user's respective accounts on the web-based networks  such that the presence status of the contacts  may be reflected in substantially real-time. For example, synchronization may occur periodically every few seconds or even several times per second or incrementally when there is a change in data. The synchronization session between the NAB server  and the user's device  may occur through a Synchronization Markup Language Data Synchronization (SyncML DS) session or other device synchronization signal or method.","In some embodiment, the NAB server  may be integrated into the database  or the database  may be integrated into the NAB server . For example, the messaging server  may access the database  via the NAB server .","Upon synchronization of the NAB server  with the device , the device user may readily identify the contacts  that are present on the web-based network  and initiate communication with selected contacts . The user may select the label, e.g., from the device  contact list or address book, that corresponds to the \u201ctarget\u201d contact. In some embodiments, the user may select the desired label using voice activation. The user may advantageously implement auto-dialing features such that the device  will automatically dial the internal number corresponding to the user-selected label, such as upon utterance by the user of the appropriate label or upon implementing automatic speed-dialing. Autodialing and voice activation features are known in the telecommunications industry. Alternatively, the user may select to view the internal number associated with the user-selected label and manually dial the internal number. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that several methods exist for dialing the internal number.","In some embodiments, the system  permits the user's device  and the called-party telecommunications device (e.g., a fixed or mobile device, such as a wired, wireless or cordless phone, Unlicensed Mobile Access or UMA enabled device, portable computer, handheld computer, smartphone, media player, and the like) to communicate while having installed thereon a client application to accept a call via an interface associated with the web-based network  (e.g., social network).","The service provider network  may include one or more cellular networks or IP-based networks. The cellular network may, for example, take a form of a GSM or UMTS broadcast architecture, or a combination thereof. Those skilled in the art will understand that GSM and\/or UMTS are typical of all cellular network architectures. As is known in the telecommunications industry, GSM network architecture includes one or more Base Station Controllers (BSCs) that control one or more base stations or Base Transceiver Stations (BTSs). The UMTS network architecture includes at least a Radio Network Controller (RNC) which provides control functionality of base stations (i.e., Node B's). Both the BTSs and the Node B's are communicatively coupled to the user's device .","In some embodiments, a picocell may be communicatively coupled to a base station in the cellular network. The picocell is a wireless access point typically covering a relatively small area, such as within a building (e.g., office, shopping mall, train station, or the like) or within an aircraft, ship, train or other vehicle. A picocell may, for example, be analogous to a WiFi access point, except that it typically broadcasts using the licensed spectrum of an associated wireless carrier. The picocell serves as an access point for routing communication between the device  and the network. One or more picocells may be coupled to the BSC by way of wired or wireless connection. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the relevant art that picocell implementations of the invention are within the scope of aspects of the invention disclosed herein.","Alternatively, the IP-based network, may take the form of a VoIP broadcast architecture, UMA or GAN (Generic Access Network) broadcast architecture, or a femtocell broadcast architecture. Voice Over Internet Protocol, or VoIP, is a telecommunication system for the transmission of voice over the Internet or other packet-switched networks. Unlicensed Mobile Access or UMA, is the commercial name of the 3GPP Generic Access Network or GAN standard. Somewhat like VoIP, UMA\/GAN is a telecommunication system which extends services, voice, data, and IP Multimedia Subsystem\/Session Initiation Protocol (IMS\/SIP) applications over IP-based networks. For example, a common application of UMA\/GAN is in a dual-mode handset service in which device users can seamlessly roam and handover between local area networks and wide area networks using a GSM\/Wi-Fi dual-mode device. UMA\/GAN enables the convergence of mobile, fixed and Internet telephony, sometimes called Fixed Mobile Convergence. Femtocells are much like picocells, broadcasting within the licensed spectrum of a wireless telecommunications carrier. Femtocells are typically designed for use in residential or small business environments. Femtocells connects to the service provider's network much like UMA\/GAN access points, namely over IP-based networks.","The IP network (IPN) subsystem  may further include a computer  (e.g., Personal Computer, laptop, smartphone), a web server , and an IP network . The user may gain access to respective accounts on the web-based networks  by entering the registration information on the computer  through the web server . The registration information is sent to the web-based network  via the IP network . The IP network may includes one or more networks that use the standardized internet protocol suite (e.g., TCP\/IP).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 1C","b":"150"},"The system  includes the devices , the messaging server , the NAB server  and the database . The system  is operable to inform a respective one of the devices  that at least one of the other devices  is available or present (e.g., registered with the system ). For example, the messaging server  may inform a first one of the devices  that a second one of the devices  is present and forward to the second one of the devices  presence information values. The second one of the devices  may, for example, use a sync session (e.g., syncML) to forward its presence information changes to the NAB server . According to some embodiments, the NAB server  publishes or transmits the presence information of the second one of the devices  to the messaging server  such that the messaging server  may notify the first one of the devices  of the presence information changes. The messaging server  may be allocated with a duty to notify the devices  of any presence information changes by way of a known protocol or standard.","As discussed above, the NAB server  may by operable to publish account attribute information (e.g., presence information) of respective ones of the devices . In some embodiments, a user of a respective one of the devices  may publish account attribute information via a transmitting device (e.g., mobile phone, PC client) or via the internet or other network. Account attribute information may be synched regardless of the device type used to publish and later display the attribute information. For example, account attribute information may be transmitted or published by a mobile phone and later viewed via the internet by way of a computer or similar computing device.","The NAB server  may be a system capable of accessing, modifying, and storing an Address Book which may reside remotely in a user device  (e.g., mobile phone). A Network Address Book may be a list of data (e.g., telephone numbers, names, labels, or other identifiers) associated with the identification of other entities or devices . The device  user is operable to communicate with the network address book, which may be stored in the database . The Network Address Book may be stored independently of any particular device such that the information in the Network Address Book can be accessed at any time through various means, such as the NAB server . For example, the Network Address Book could be a user's address book associated with his or her cellular phone, which typically includes a list of names and contact information, such as cellular phone numbers, for those with whom the user communicates. Although an electronic address book is one example of the Network Address Book, other lists, such as a list of incoming and outgoing telephone numbers on a cellular phone can also constitute a Network Address Book.","The NAB server  may be communicatively coupled to the messaging server  and the database , thereby taking the form of a computer system capable of accessing, modifying and storing what is commonly referred to as the user's electronic address book. Although the embodiment in  shows the NAB server  coupled to the messaging server  and the database , such specific interconnectivity is not required.","The synchronization session between the NAB server  and the user's device , which may occur through the Synchronization Markup Language Digital Signal (SyncML DS) session or other device synchronization signal or method, allows for the device  to access the most recent information included in the user's Network Address Book. Use of the SyncML DS session may be more efficient than, for example, XML Configuration Access Protocol (XCAP), and may also obviate the need for XCAP capabilities in devices  (e.g., phones) implementing presence identification. The synchronization advantageously minimizes the risk of confusing the device  user with inconsistent and possibly conflicting address book data when, for example, the user obtains a replacement device with an empty local address book.","In one embodiment, the user's device may then register to an Internet Protocol Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) and start the presence client through the messaging server  to begin sending and receiving presence Information. IMS uses IP Multimedia Services Identity Module (ISIM), which may run on a smart card and include parameters for identifying and authenticating a user to IMS. Similarly, the device  can be programmed to notify the messaging server  of certain conditions that may impair the sending or receiving of communication, such as when the user turns off or suspends the device , the device's battery is running low, and device  signal strength is minimal. The notification allows the messaging server  to update other device  users of the user's change in presence status, such as \u201coffline\u201d or \u201cunavailable.\u201d It is also possible for the device to register or de-register with IMS or other subsystems performing a similar function, irrespective of whether the synchronization with the NAB server  occurs.","In the embodiment shown in , communication between the user's device  and the messaging server  may occur through a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) following SIP SIMPLE 1.0. It will be appreciated that other protocols, capable of similar functionality, may also be used. When a user's device  first registers with the messaging server , after being turned on, the messaging server  automatically begins accessing the information included in the user device's Network Address Book and also begins publishing this particular device  user as being \u201conline\u201d or \u201cavailable,\u201d absent any specific instructions from the user to the contrary. According to one embodiment, the messaging server  accesses the network address book stored in the database  via the NAB server .","The messaging server  uses the information obtained from the user's Network Address Book to determine presence information about the devices or device users listed in the user's Network Address Book. For example, the messaging server  may check for presence information related to other devices listed in the Network Address Book based on the telephone numbers associated with each of those devices . The messaging server  sends notifications to the user's device  of the current status of each of the devices listed in the user's Network Address Book. For example, the device  user could be notified through the messaging server  whether each of the devices listed in the Network Address Book is \u201cavailable\u201d, \u201cunavailable\u201d, or the device status is \u201cunknown\u201d because no presence information is available for that specific device. As the messaging server  is updated with new presence information, the messaging server  sends updates to the user's device  so that the user has automatically updated presence information. In other embodiments, the system  is configured to disable automatic updates to the user and the presence information is updated at the specific request of the user, or updates at specified times and\/or intervals.","In some embodiments, the NAB server  may be configured to screen the user's Network Address Book, such that devices having ascertainable presence information are transmitted to the messaging server . Such may advantageously minimize unnecessary communication with the messaging server .","In another embodiment the device  user may access, change, and view presence information through a user interface which may be communicatively coupled to the NAB server , such as through the internet. When the device  user initially connects to the user account through the user interface, the connection may be registered to the Internet Protocol Multimedia Subsystem (IMS), and a Presence User Agent  may be initiated. The Presence User Agent  informs the messaging server  of the user's status as \u201conline\u201d or \u201cavailable\u201d absent any instructions from the user to the contrary, such as if the user wanted their status to be displayed as \u201coffline\u201d or \u201cunavailable\u201d because they did not want others to know that they were \u201cavailable.\u201d","Further details on determining presence information may be found in the assignee's copending U.S. application Ser. No. 12\/345,659, entitled, \u201cSYSTEM AND METHOD FOR THE DISTRIBUTION AND USE OF PRESENCE INFORMATION,\u201d filed Dec. 29, 2008, which lists Adrian Buzescu as inventor(s).","Registration and Synchronization Method",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 3","FIG. 2"],"b":["200","104","200"]},"The following discussions of registration, synchronization, and communication initialization methods and features, can be implemented separately or in combination. Although the registration and synchronization methods and features are described in a single flow diagram and flowchart, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that both methods may operate independently of the other. For example, the registration process may provide a universal social network registration process, while the synchronization and communication initialization processes provide a universal social network account synchronization and communication session establishment method.","The method  starts, for example, at , in response to the user creating one or more accounts on respective web-based networks . At least some of the user's accounts include a contact list, which comprises a list of user-generated screen names representing other registered users or \u201ccontacts\u201d on the particular web-based network . The contact list may be a user-specific network of contacts  which can be viewed by the user when logged onto the web-based network  supporting the contact list.","At , the user enters, via the web portal , the login credentials or registration information (e.g., user name and password) associated with the respective accounts on the web-based networks , and the identifier (e.g., MSISDN). The web-portal  forwards the registration information and the user's identifier to the messaging server  via the service provider network . In some embodiments, the service provider subsystem  may automatically add the identifier based on the user's prior login to the web portal . Alternatively, the user may input a MIN or other device  identification.","At , the messaging server  maps the identifier with the registration information associated with the respective accounts on the web-based networks , and stores the mapping in the database . The mapping may, for example, be stored in the database  in the form of the table. The table associates the identifier with the respective registration information and web-based networks . As mentioned above, the database  may be separate from the NAB server , embedded in the NAB server , or any other combination thereof. Thus, in some embodiments, the mapping may, for example, be stored in the NAB server .","At , in response to activation of the user's device , the messaging server  accesses the user's respective accounts on the web-based networks  and retrieves contacts  from the respective contact lists. The messaging server  accesses the database  and uses the registration information associated with the web-based networks  to gain access to these respective accounts on the web-based networks . Once the messaging server  accesses the user's accounts on the web-based networks , the messaging server  automatically retrieves the contacts  included in all the respective contact lists and their associated presence information (i.e., online status). The messaging server  may repeatedly access the user's respective accounts on the web-based networks  to determine real-time presence information and contact lists. Such account accessing may occur repeatedly in a small period of time to reflect presence status of the contacts  in substantially real-time. For example, access may occur every few seconds or even several times per second. In other embodiments, the web-based network  pushes the contacts  and\/or associated presence information to the messaging server . Such may occur repeatedly to reflect real-time presence status of the contacts . For example, the web-based network  may push the contact and\/or associated presence information to the messaging server  when there is a change of state in the subscription\/notify method.","In some embodiments, the messaging server  may be configured to retrieve the contacts  that are present (i.e., online or have a status of \u201cactive\u201d or \u201cbusy\u201d) and not to retrieve contacts  that are not present (i.e., offline or have an online status of \u201caway\u201d). It will be understood by those skilled in the art that the messaging server  may be configured to selectively retrieve the contacts  using other criteria such as user-selected criteria. For example, the user may select those contacts  that are to be retrieved by the messaging server  that will ultimately be loaded onto the user's device .","At , the retrieved contacts  and associated presence information are stored in the database  and mapped to the user's identifier.","At , the messaging server  creates the internal numbers (e.g., \u201cdummy\u201d numbers) which are to be associated with the contacts . The internal numbers may, for example, be numeric or alphanumeric addresses, such as DID entries, which can be manually or automatically entered into the device  to establish a communication link (e.g., voice\/video call, SMS, MMS, email, or IM) with respective ones of the contacts  (\u201ctarget\u201d contacts). The internal numbers are stored in the database  with their respective contacts  and are mapped to the user's identifier.","At , the messaging server  creates the labels that correspond to the respective internal numbers of the contacts  and adds these labels and corresponding internal numbers into the NAB server . The labels are such that the user may readily identify the respective contacts  to which the corresponding internal numbers are associated. The messaging server  may automatically create the labels, or the user may create and\/or adjust the labels independent of the messaging server .","Optionally, at , the messaging server  may add into the NAB server  the presence information associated with the user's contacts . Presence identifiers may be used to indicate the presence information of the user's contacts . For example, the messaging server  may add respective presence identifiers proximate the labels such that the presence status of the contacts  may be identifiable.","At , the NAB server  synchronizes the data, which includes the internal numbers and corresponding labels, with the device . The NAB server  forwards the data to the device  for storage and\/or updating of previously forwarded data. Alternatively, the NAB server  may forward data, which includes the labels and presence identifiers associated with the internal numbers, to the device  for storage and\/or updating of previously forwarded data. The data may, for example, form at least a portion of the phonebook of the device , which can be stored on the internal memory or SIM of the device .","The method  passes control to  and waits for the messaging server  to re-access the user's respective accounts on the web-based networks .","Communication Initialization Method",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0062"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 5","FIG. 4"],"b":["400","101","400"]},"The method  starts at , for example, in response to the user initiating a communication request such as, for example, a video\/voice call, IM session, or MMS session with a respective one of the contacts  (i.e., a \u201ctarget\u201d contact). The communication request may, for example, be in the form of a call from a device. As discussed above, the user may select the label, e.g., from the device  contact list or address book, that corresponds to the \u201ctarget\u201d contact . Then the user may advantageously implement auto-dialing features such that the device  will automatically dial the internal number corresponding to the user-selected label. The selection of the label corresponding to the \u201ctarget\u201d contact  and the autodialing of the internal number may occur in a single voice activation step, as is known in the telecommunications industry. In other embodiments, the user may manually select and\/or enter the internal number to initiate the communication request with the \u201ctarget\u201d contact . Alternatively, the user may initiate multiple communication requests with multiple \u201ctarget\u201d contacts . Such communication requests may, for example, include requests for conferencing with multiple contacts  simultaneously, or establishing separate communication links with respective contacts . One skilled in the art will recognize that multiple communication requests to multiple \u201ctarget\u201d contacts  falls within the scope of aspects of the invention described herein.","At , the communication request is forwarded through the SP network  to a SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) server . The SIP server  is configured to setup SIP calls in the IP network . For example, the SIP server  may have various functions such as helping route requests to the user's location, authenticate and authorize users for services, implement provider call-routing policies, and provide features to users. As is known in the telecommunications industry, SIP is a standard for setting up telephone calls, multimedia conferencing, instant messaging, and other types of real-time communications. The SIP server  converts the communication request to a SIP invite and sends to the messaging server .","At , upon receiving the SIP invite, the messaging server  accesses the database  and selects the \u201ctarget\u201d contact . The \u201ctarget\u201d contact  is selected based on the mapping of the user's identifier to the internal number. In other words, the messaging server  performs a search of contacts  in the database  to determine the respective one (i.e., \u201ctarget\u201d contact) that has the user's identifier and the internal number associated therewith. Once the \u201ctarget\u201d contact  is selected, the messaging server  then forwards the SIP invite (e.g., invite for voice\/video call, multimedia conference, instant messaging session, and\/or other types of real-time communications) to the \u201ctarget\u201d contact through the IP network . In other embodiments, communication (e.g., communication session invite) from the messaging server  to the \u201ctarget\u201d contact  may by implemented via an application programming interface (API) method defined by and unique to the web-based network , such as when the web-based network  does not employ SIP.","Mapping the user's identifier to the internal number advantageously blocks a third party device user from establishing a communications link (or communications session) with the \u201ctarget\u201d contact  associated with the device  , user. For example, if the third party device user enters the internal number associated with contact \u201cScreen_name,\u201d the messaging server  will determine that the third party device identifier does not match up with the internal number. In response, the messaging server  will reject the communications attempt initiated by the third party device. Thus, although the third party communications request may be forwarded to the messaging server , it will ultimately be rejected and a communications request will not be forwarded to the contact  on the web-based network .","At , if the \u201ctarget\u201d contact  accepts the SIP invite, the communication link is established between the device  user and the \u201ctarget\u201d contact  present on the web-based network . Otherwise, at , if the \u201ctarget\u201d contact  rejects the SIP invite, an alert (e.g., a rejection notification) may be sent to the device  user who initiated the communications request. Alternatively and\/or additionally, at , the \u201ctarget\u201d contact  may merely reject the type or format of the communications link or communications session that was requested, and instead respond to the device  user via another communications format. For example, if the device  user requested a voice call, the \u201ctarget\u201d contact  may reject the voice call request and instead respond with an IM session initiation.","The method  passes control to  and waits for the user of the device  to initiate another communication request with one or more of the contacts .","The methods  and\/or  may include additional acts, may omit some of the above-described acts and\/or may perform acts in a different order than set out in the flow diagram.","Conclusion","Unless the context clearly requires otherwise, throughout the description and the claims, the words \u201ccomprise,\u201d \u201ccomprising,\u201d and the like are to be construed in an inclusive sense, as opposed to an exclusive or exhaustive sense; that is to say, in the sense of \u201cincluding, but not limited to.\u201d As used herein, the terms \u201cconnected,\u201d \u201ccoupled,\u201d or any variant thereof means any connection or coupling, either direct or indirect, between two or more elements; the coupling or connection between the elements can be physical, logical, or a combination thereof.
