{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION","EXAMPLE"],"p":["This application claims priority from Provisional Application Ser. No. 61\/042,741 filed Apr. 6, 2008, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.","This invention was made under CRADA PNNL\/259 between UOP LLC and Alliance for Sustainable Energy, LLC, as operator of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory on behalf of the United States Department of Energy, and Battelle Memorial Institute, as operator of the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory on behalf of the United States Department of Energy. The Government has certain rights in this invention.","This invention relates to processes for obtaining hydrocarbons from biomass. More particularly, this invention relates to the treatment of pyrolysis oil produced from the pyrolysis of biomass to produce fuel or fuel blending or additive components. The fuel or fuel additives or blending components may include those in the gasoline boiling point range, the diesel boiling point range, and the aviation boiling point range.","Renewable energy sources are of increasing importance. They are a means of reducing dependence on petroleum oil and provide a substitute for fossil fuels. Also, renewable resources can provide for basic chemical constituents to be used in other industries, such as chemical monomers for the making of plastics. Biomass is a renewable resource that can provide some of the needs for sources of chemicals and fuels.","Biomass includes, but is not limited to, lignin, plant parts, fruits, vegetables, plant processing waste, wood chips, chaff, grain, grasses, corn, corn husks, weeds, aquatic plants, hay, paper, paper products, recycled paper and paper products, and any cellulose containing biological material or material of biological origin. Lignocellulosic biomass, or cellulosic biomass as used throughout the remainder of this document, consists of the three principle biopolymers cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. The ratio of these three components varies depending on the biomass source. Cellulosic biomass might also contain lipids, ash, and protein in varying amounts. The economics for converting biomass to fuels or chemicals depend on the ability to produce large amounts of biomass on marginal land, or in a water environment where there are few or no other significantly competing economic uses of that land or water environment. The economics can also depend on the disposal of biomass that would normally be placed in a landfill.","The growing, harvesting and processing of biomass in a water environment provides a space where there is plenty of sunlight and nutrients while not detracting from more productive alternate uses. Biomass is also generated in many everyday processes as a waste product, such as waste material from crops. In addition, biomass contributes to the removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere as the biomass grows. The use of biomass can be one process for recycling atmospheric carbon while producing fuels and chemical precursors. Biomass when heated in an environment at short contact times with low or no oxygen, termed pyrolysis, will generate a liquid product known as pyrolysis oil. Synonyms for pyrolysis oil include bio-oil, pyrolysis liquids, bio-crude oil, wood liquids, wood oil, liquid smoke, wood distillates, pyroligneous acid, and liquid wood.","The product of the biomass pyrolysis, the pyrolysis oil, contains what is known as pyrolytic lignin. Pyrolytic lignin is the water insoluble portion of the pyrolysis oil. An advantage of the process is that the pyrolysis oil may be optionally processed without prior separation of the pyrolytic lignin to produce fuel blending components or fuels that work with engines or devices that are currently distributed around the world without requiring upgrades to those engines.","The invention provides a process for producing high yields of naphtha, aviation, and or diesel fuel, blending components, or related products from biomass. The biomass undergoes pyrolysis to generate pyrolysis oil. The whole pyrolysis oil may be processed or optionally at least a portion of the aqueous phase may be removed to provide a pyrolytic lignin enriched pyrolysis oil generated from biomass. The pyrolysis oil, or a pyrolytic lignin enriched pyrolysis oil, is treated in a partial deoxygenation zone generating a partially deoxygenated stream. Water, gasses, and light ends are removed and the remainder of the partially deoxygenated stream is further treated in a full deoxygenation zone to produce a deoxygenated product stream. The deoxygenated product stream comprises hydrocarbon compounds that when fractionated are useful as gasoline and naphtha, aviation fuel, or as additives to, or blending components of, one or both products. The product stream can also be upgraded to produce a diesel fuel, blending component, or additive. Furthermore, the product stream can serve as a source of chemicals or chemical feedstocks.","After the full deoxygenation zone, water light ends, and gasses may be removed from the effluent of the full deoxygenation zone. Hydrogen may be separated and recycled. In one embodiment the first and full deoxygenation zones are combined and housed within in a single reactor.","In the U.S. and worldwide, there are huge amounts of lignocellulosic material, or biomass, which is not utilized, but is left to decay, often in a landfill, or just in an open field or forest. The material includes large amounts of wood waste products, and leaves and stalks of crops or other plant material that is regularly discarded and left to decay in fields. The emergence of inedible lipid-bearing crops for the production of renewable diesel will also produce increased amounts of biomass post extraction, often known as meal. Growth of cellulosic ethanol will also produce large amounts of a lignin side product. Biomass includes, but is not limited to, lignin, plant parts, fruits, vegetables, plant processing waste, wood chips, chaff, grain, grasses, corn, corn husks, weeds, aquatic plants, hay, meal, paper, paper products, recycled paper and paper products, and any cellulose containing biological material or material of biological origin. This biomass material can be pyrolyzed to make a pyrolysis oil, but due to poor thermal stability, the high water content of the pyrolysis oil, often greater than 25%, high total acid number often greater than 100, low heating value, and phase incompatibility with petroleum based materials, pyrolysis oil has not found wide use as a fuel.","This process substantially converts the pyrolysis oil from biomass into naphtha, aviation, and diesel boiling range components, having low acidity, low water, low oxygen, and low sulfur content. The pyrolysis of the biomass to form the pyrolysis oil is achieved by any technique known in the art, see for example, Mohan, D.; Pittman, C. U.; Steele, P. H. Energy and Fuels, 2006, 20, 848-889. Once the pyrolysis oil is generated from the biomass, although optional, it is not necessary to separate the pyrolytic lignin from the pyrolysis oil before further processing, thereby eliminating a step previously employed in industry. The whole pyrolysis oil may be processed, without a portion of the aqueous phase being removed to enrich the pyrolysis oil in the pyrolytic lignin. The pyrolytic ligin contains potentially high value products in the form of aromatic and naphthenic compounds having complex structures that comprises aromatic rings that are linked by oxygen atoms or carbon atoms. These structures can be broken into smaller segments when decarboxylated, decarbonylated, or hydrodeoxygenated, while maintaining the aromatic ring structures. One desired product is at least one cyclic hydrocarbon-rich stream. However, this processing of the pyrolytic ligin may be accomplished in the presence of the rest of the pyrolysis oil and no separation of the pyrolytic ligin before processing is required. Pyrolytic lignin is a pyrolysis product of the lignin portion of biomass. It can be separated from the rest of the whole pyrolysis oil during the pyrolysis process or through post-processing to produce an additional aqueous phase, which includes pyrolysis products primarily from the cellulose and hemicellulose portion of the biomass. The pyrolysis process can convert all components in the biomass feedstock into products useful as fuels or fuel components after full deoxygenation of the pyrolysis oil product. The water soluble components can also be transformed to naphthenes and aromatics under pyrolysis conditions. The production of heavier molecular weight products is known from steam cracking technology to produce light olefins, also run under pyrolysis conditions. Even feeds such as ethane, propane, and light naphtha produce heavier side products in these thermal cracking processes. The amount of these heavier products depends on the conditions of the thermal cracking reactor. Optionally, the pyrolysis oil may be separated and only a portion of the pyrolysis oil be introduced to the partial deoxygenation zone.","In one embodiment the pyrolysis oil is fully deoxygenated in two separate zones, a partial deoxygenation zone and a full deoxygenation zone. The partial deoxygenation zone may also be considered to be a hydrotreating zone and the full deoxygenation zone may be considered to be a hydrocracking zone. \u201cFull\u201d deoxygenation is meant to include deoxygenating at least 99% of available oxygenated hydrocarbons. The zones will primarily be referred to herein as a partial deoxygenation zone and a full deoxygenation zone. In the partial deoxygenation zone, partial deoxygenation occurs at milder conditions than the full deoxygenation zone and uses a catalyst such as a hydrotreating catalyst. In general, the partial oxidation zone removes the most reactive and thermally instable oxygenates. The oxygen level of the pyrolysis oil feedstock, which typically ranges from about 35 wt. % to about 60 wt %, is reduced to a significantly lower level, from about 5 wt. % to about 20 wt. % in the partial deoxygenation zone. Water is reduced from pyrolysis oil feedstock levels from about 10 wt. % to about 40 wt. % to levels from about 2 wt. % to about 11 wt. %. The acidity is greatly reduced as well in the partial deoxygenation zone, from a TAN level of about 125 to about 200 in the pyrolysis oil feedstock to a reduced level from about 40 to about 100 in the partial deoxygenation zone effluent.","The more thermally stable effluent from the partial deoxygenation zone can then be fully deoxygenated in the full deoxygenation zone. In the full deoxygenation zone, a hydrocracking catalyst, which has higher activity as compared to the hydrotreating catalyst, is employed with the option of more severe process conditions in order to catalyze the deoxygenation of less reactive oxygenates. Some hydrocracking of feedstock molecules will also occur to a higher extent than in the partial deoxygenation zone. In the full deoxygenation zone, oxygen content is reduced from about 5 wt. % to about 20 wt. % to much lower levels, from ppm concentrations to about 0.5 wt. %. Water is also greatly reduced in the full deoxygenation zone, from about 2 wt. % to about 11 wt. % down to levels from about 100 ppm to about 1000 ppm. The acidity is greatly reduced from initial TAN levels of about 40 to about 100 mg KOH\/g oil to lower levels from about 0.5 to about 4 mg KOH\/g oil. The effluent of the full deoxygenation zone is a hydrocarbon mixture rich in naphthenes and aromatics.","In one embodiment, as shown in , pyrolysis oil  is not separated and enters partial deoxygenation zone  along with recycle hydrogen stream  and optional hydrocarbon recycle  where contact with a deoxygenation and hydrogenation catalyst at deoxygenation conditions generates partially deoxygenated pyrolysis oil stream . The deoxygenation zone  performs catalytic decarboxylation, decarbonylation, and hydrodeoxygenation of oxygen polymers and single oxygenated molecules in the pyrolysis oil by breaking the oxygen linkages, and forming water and COfrom the oxygen and leaving smaller molecules. For example, the phenylpropyl ether linkages in the pyrolytic lignin will be partially deoxygenated producing some aromatic rings, such as alkylbenzenes and polyalkylbenzenes. Very reactive oxygenates will be deoxygenated as well, including small molecular weight carboxylic acids therefore greatly increasing the thermal stability of the product. Pyrolysis oil components not derived from lignin, including cellulose, hemicellulose, free sugars, may yield products such as acetic acid, furfural, furan, levoglucosan, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, hydroxyacetaldhyde, formaldehyde, and others such as those described in Mohan, D.; Pittman, C. U.; Steele, P. H. Energy and Fuels, 2006, 20, 848-889. Therefore, pyrolysis oil components not derived from lignin will also be partially or fully deoxygenated with the carbohydrates giving primarily light hydrocarbon fractions and water. The light hydrocarbon fractions may contain hydrocarbons with six or fewer carbon atoms. The reactions of decarbonylation, decarboxylation and hydrodeoxygenation are collectively referred to as deoxygenation reactions. Hydrogenation of olefins also occur in this zone. The catalysts and conditions of partial deoxygenation zone  are selected so that the more reactive compounds are deoxygenated. The effluent of partial deoxygenation zone is a partially deoxygenated pyrolysis oil stream  that has increased thermal stability as compared to the feed pyrolysis oil.","Partially deoxygenated pyrolysis oil stream  is passed to a separation zone . Carbon oxides, possibly hydrogen sulfide, and C3 and lighter components are separated and removed in overhead line  and a partially deoxygenated product stream  is removed from separation zone . Separation zone  may comprise a separator. Depending upon whether the separator is operated in a hot or cold mode, the water may be removed as a vapor in line  (hot separator mode) or as a liquid in line  (cold separator mode). Overhead line  comprises a large quantity of hydrogen and at least the carbon dioxide from the decarboxylation reaction. The carbon dioxide can be removed from the hydrogen by means well known in the art such as reaction with a hot carbonate solution, pressure swing absorption, etc. Also, absorption with an amine in processes such as described in co-pending applications U.S. Application No. 60\/973,792 and U.S. Application No. 60\/973,816, hereby incorporated by reference, may be employed. If desired, essentially pure carbon dioxide can be recovered by regenerating the spent absorption media. Therefore overhead line  is passed through one or more scrubbers  such as amine scrubbers to remove carbon dioxide in line  and hydrogen sulfide in line . Depending upon the scrubber technology selected some portion of water may also be retained by the scrubber. The lighter hydrocarbons and gasses, possibly including a portion of water, are conducted via line  to steam reforming zone . In one embodiment the light hydrocarbon fractions may contain hydrocarbons with six or fewer carbon atoms. After purification, hydrogen generated in steam reforming zone  is conducted via line  to combine with feedstock  and partially deoxygenated product stream . The hydrogen may be recycled to combine with the feedstock as shown or may be introduced directly to the reaction zone where hydrogenation primarily occurs and\/or to any subsequent reactor beds.","The partially deoxygenated product stream  along with recycle hydrogen stream  and optional hydrocarbon recycle , is passed to a second hydrodeoxygenation zone , where the remaining oxygen is removed. Full deoxygenation zone  performs catalytic decarboxylation, decarbonylation, and hydrodeoxygenation of the remaining oxygen compounds that are more stable than those reacted in the first stage. Therefore, a more active catalyst and more severe process conditions are employed in full deoxygenation zone  as compared to partial deoxygenation zone  in order to catalyze full deoxygenation.","Full deoxygenation zone effluent  is introduced to phase separator . Carbon oxides, possibly hydrogen sulfide and C3 and lighter components are separated and removed in line  and liquid hydrocarbons are removed in line . Depending upon whether the separator is operated in a hot or cold mode, the water may be removed as a vapor in line  (hot separator mode) or as a liquid in line  (cold separator mode). The overhead in line  comprises a large quantity of hydrogen and the carbon dioxide from the decarboxylation reaction. The carbon dioxide can be removed from the hydrogen by means well known in the art, reaction with a hot carbonate solution, pressure swing absorption, etc. Also, absorption with an amine in processes such as described in co-pending applications, U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,982,077 and 7,982,078 hereby incorporated by reference, may be employed. If desired, essentially pure carbon dioxide can be recovered by regenerating the spent absorption media. Therefore line  is passed through one or more scrubbers  such as amine scrubbers to remove carbon dioxide in line  and hydrogen sulfide in line . Depending upon the scrubber technology selected some portion of water may also be retained by the scrubber. The lighter hydrocarbons and gasses, possibly including a portion of water, are conducted via line  to steam reforming zone . A liquid stream containing hydrocarbons is removed from separator  in line  and conducted to product fractionation zone . Product fractionation zone  is operated so that product cut  contains the hydrocarbons in a boiling range most beneficial to meeting the gasoline specifications. Product cut  is collected for use as aviation fuel or as a blending component of aviation fuel. The lighter materials such as naphtha and LPG are removed in fractionation zone overhead stream . A portion of stream  may be optionally conducted in line  to the reforming zone . If desired, the naphtha and LPG may be further separated into an LPG stream and a naphtha stream (not shown).","Hydrocarbons that have a boiling point higher than acceptable for the specification of the aviation fuel are removed in bottoms stream . A portion of bottoms stream  may be recovered and used as fuel such as, for example, low sulfur heating oil fuel. It is likely that bottoms stream  may be acceptable for use as diesel or a diesel blending component. Alternatively, bottoms stream  could be upgraded to diesel in a separate process. A portion of bottoms stream  is optionally recycled to partial deoxygenation zone  and\/or full deoxygenation reaction zone . A portion of a hydrocarbon stream may also be cooled down if necessary and used as cool quench liquid between beds of one of the deoxygenation zones, or between the first and the full deoxygenation zone to further control the heat of reaction and provide quench liquid for emergencies. The recycle stream may be introduced to the inlet of one or both of the reaction zones and\/or to any subsequent beds or reactors. One benefit of the hydrocarbon recycle is to control the temperature rise across the individual beds. However, as discussed within, the amount of hydrocarbon recycle may be is determined based upon the desired hydrogen solubility in the reaction zone. Increasing the hydrogen solubility in the reaction mixture allows for successful operation at lower pressures, and thus reduced cost. Operating with high recycle and maintaining high levels of hydrogen in the liquid phase helps dissipate hot spots at the catalyst surface and reduces the formation of undesirable heavy components which lead to coking and catalyst deactivation. Fractionation zone  may contain more than one fractionation column and thus the locations of the different streams separated may vary from that shown in the figures.","In another embodiment as shown in , a pyrolysis oil feed stream  is passed through phase separator  where it is separated into an aqueous phase and a pyrolytic lignin phase. A portion or all of pyrolytic lignin is removed from separator  in stream  which is then combined with stream  to form combined stream . Optionally, some or all of the pyrolytic lignin is removed via stream . Part of all of the aqueous phase is removed from separator  in stream  which is then combined with stream  to form combined stream . Optionally, aqueous phase pyrolysis oil can be removed through line . Combined stream , which is a pyrolytic lignin enriched pyrolysis oil, passes into partial deoxygenation zone  where partial deoxygenation occurs along with hydrogenation of reactive functional groups as described above. The partially deoxygenated product stream  passes through separator  where CO, CO2, H2O, and H2S are removed. Product stream  passes through full deoxygenation zone  where complete deoxygenation is catalyzed. Full deoxygenation zone product stream  passes through separator  where water, CO, CO2, and H2S are removed resulting in a liquid hydrocarbon stream . Liquid hydrocarbon stream  is passed through the fractionation zone  where it is separated into the desired fuel cuts as discussed above.","In another embodiment as shown in  optionally a pyrolysis oil feed stream  is passed through phase separator  where it is separated into an aqueous phase and a pyrolytic lignin phase. A portion or all of pyrolytic lignin is removed from separator  in stream  which is then combined with stream  to form combined stream . Optionally, some or all of the pyrolytic lignin is removed via stream . Part of all of the aqueous phase is removed from separator  in stream  which is then combined with stream  to form combined stream . Optionally, aqueous phase pyrolysis oil can be removed through line . Either combined stream  (for the embodiment using pyrolytic lignin enriched pyrolysis oil), or pyrolysis oil feed stream  (for the embodiment using the whole pyrolysis oil) passes through deoxygenation zone  where contact with one or more catalysts fully deoxygenate the feed to produce a fully deoxygenated product stream . Deoxygenation zone  can employ a multifunctional catalyst capable of deoxygenation and hydrogenation or a set of catalysts. For example, partial deoxygenation and hydrogenation can occur over the first catalyst in a first portion of zone  while full deoxygenation occurs in a more active catalyst in a second portion of zone . A stacked bed configuration may be advantageous because a less active catalyst in an upper zone will deoxygenate the most reactive oxygen compounds without generating exotherms that can promote the formation of thermal coke. The fully deoxygenated product stream  is fed to phase separator  where water, CO, CO2, and H2S are removed resulting in a liquid hydrocarbon stream . Liquid hydrocarbon stream  is passed through the fractionation zone  where it is separated into the desired fuel cuts as discussed above.","Hydrogen is needed for the deoxygenation and hydrogenation reactions above, and to be effective, a sufficient quantity of hydrogen must be in solution in the deoxygenation zone to most effectively take part in the catalytic reaction. If hydrogen is not available at the reaction site of the catalyst, the coke forms on the catalyst and deactivates the catalyst. High operating pressures may be used in order to achieve a desired amount of hydrogen in solution and readily available for reaction and to avoid coking reactions on the catalyst. However, higher pressure operations are more costly to build and to operate as compared to their lower pressure counterparts.","The desired amount of hydrogen may be kept in solution at lower pressures by employing a large recycle of hydrocarbon. An added benefit is the control of the temperature in the deoxygenation zone(s) since the deoxygenation reactions are exothermic reactions. However, the range of recycle to feedstock ratios used herein is set based on the need to control the level of hydrogen in the liquid phase and therefore reduce the deactivation rate of the catalyst. The amount of recycle is determined not on temperature control requirements, but instead, based upon hydrogen solubility requirements. Hydrogen has a greater solubility in the hydrocarbon product than it does in the pyrolysis oil feedstock or the portion of the pyrolysis oil feedstock after separation. By utilizing a large hydrocarbon recycle the solubility of hydrogen in the liquid phase in the reaction zone is greatly increased and higher pressures are not needed to increase the amount of hydrogen in solution and avoid catalyst deactivation at low pressures. The hydrocarbon recycle may be a portion of the stream in any of lines , , , or , or any combination thereof, and the hydrocarbon recycle is directed to deoxygenation zone . The figure shows optional hydrocarbon recycle as a portion of diesel boiling point range component . However it is understood that in other embodiments portions different streams or combinations of stream such as the product stream  or any of fractionation zone streams , , or  may be used as the hydrocarbon recycle. Suitable volume ratios of hydrocarbon recycle to pyrolysis oil feedstock is from about 2:1 to about 8:1. In another embodiment the ratio is in the range of about 3:1 to about 6:1 and in yet another embodiment the ratio is in the range of about 4:1 to about 5:1.","Furthermore, the rate of reaction in the deoxygenation zone is increased with the hydrocarbon recycle resulting in a greater amount of throughput of material through the reactor in a given period of time. Lower operating pressures provide an additional advantage in increasing the decarboxylation reaction while reducing the hydrodeoxygenation reaction. The result is a reduction in the amount of hydrogen required to remove oxygen from the feedstock component and produce a finished product. Hydrogen can be a costly component of the feed and reduction of the hydrogen requirements is beneficial from an economic standpoint.","In another embodiment, mixtures or co-feeds of the pyrolysis oil and other renewable feedstocks or petroleum derived hydrocarbons may also be used as the feedstock to the deoxygenation zone. The mixture of the pyrolysis oil and another renewable feedstock or a petroleum derived hydrocarbon is selected to result in greater hydrogen solubility. Other feedstock components which may be used as a co-feed component in combination with the pyrolysis oil from the above listed biomass materials, include spent motor oil and industrial lubricants, used paraffin waxes, liquids derived from gasification of coal, biomass, or natural gas followed by a downstream liquefaction step such as Fischer-Tropsch technology; liquids derived from depolymerization, thermal or chemical, of waste plastics such as polypropylene, high density polyethylene, and low density polyethylene; and other synthetic oils generated as byproducts from petrochemical and chemical processes. One advantage of using a co-feed component is the transformation of what has been considered to be a waste product from a petroleum based or other process into a valuable co-feed component to the current process.","The partial deoxygenation zone is operated at a pressure from about 3.4 MPa (500 psia) to about 14 MPa (3000 psia), and preferably is operated at a pressure from about 3.4 MPa (500 psia) to about 12 MPa (1800 psia). The partial deoxygenation zone is operated at a temperature from about 200\u00b0 C. to 400\u00b0 C. with one embodiment being from about 300\u00b0 C. to about 375\u00b0 C. The partial deoxygenation zone is operated at a space velocity from about 0.1 LHSV hto 1.5 LHSV hbased on pyrolysis oil feedstock; this space velocity range does not include any contribution from a recycle stream. In one embodiment the space velocity is from about 0.25 to about 1.0 LHSV h. The hydrogen to liquid hydrocarbon feed ratio is at about 5000 to 20000 scf\/bbl with one embodiment being from about 10,000 to 15,000 scf\/bbl. The catalyst in the partial deoxygenation zone is any hydrogenation and hydrotreating catalysts well known in the art such as nickel or nickel\/molybdenum dispersed on a high surface area support. Other hydrogenation catalysts include one or more noble metal catalytic elements dispersed on a high surface area support. Non-limiting examples of noble metals include Pt and\/or Pd dispersed on gamma-alumina or activated carbon. Another example includes the catalysts disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,841,085, hereby incorporated by reference.","In the full deoxygenation zone, the conditions are more severe and the catalyst more active compared to that of the partial deoxygenation zone. The catalyst is any hydrocracking catalyst, having a hydrocracking function, that is well known in the art such as nickel or nickel\/molybdenum dispersed on a high surface area support. Another example is a combined zeolitic and amorphous silica-alumina catalyst with a metal deposited on the catalyst. The catalyst includes at least one metal selected from nickel (Ni), chromium (Cr), molybdenum (Mo), tungsten (W), cobalt (Co), rhodium (Rh), iridium (Ir), ruthenium (Ru), and rhenium (Re). In one embodiment, the catalyst includes a mixture of the metals Ni and Mo on the catalyst. The catalyst is preferably a large pore catalyst that provides sufficient pore size for allowing larger molecules into the pores for cracking to smaller molecular constituents. The metal content deposited on the catalysts used are deposited in amounts ranging from 0.1 wt. % to 20 wt. %, with specific embodiments having values for the metals including, but not limited to, nickel in a range from 0.5 wt. % to 10 wt. %, tungsten in a range from 5 wt. % to 20 wt. %, and molybdenum in a range from 5 wt. % to 20 wt. %. The metals can also be deposited in combinations on the catalysts with example combinations being Ni with W, and Ni with Mo. Zeolites used for the catalysts include, but are not limited to, beta zeolite, Y-zeolite, MFI type zeolites, mordenite, silicalite, SM3, and faujasite. The catalysts are capable of catalyzing decarboxylation, decarbonylation and\/or hydrodeoxygenation of the feedstock to remove oxygen as well as hydrogenation to saturate olefins. Cracking may also occur. Decarboxylation, decarbonylation, and hydrodeoxygenation are herein collectively referred to as deoxygenation reactions.","The full deoxygenation zone conditions include a relatively low pressure of about 6890 kPa (1000 psia) to about 13,790 kPa (2000 psia), a temperature of about 300\u00b0 C. to about 500\u00b0 C. and a liquid hourly space velocity of about 0.1 to about 3 hrbased on fresh feed not recycle. In another embodiment the deoxygenation conditions include the same pressure of about 6890 kPa (1000 psia) to about 6895 kPa (1700 psia), a temperature of about 350\u00b0 C. to about 450\u00b0 C. and a liquid hourly space velocity of about 0.15 to about 0.40 hr. It is envisioned and is within the scope of this invention that all the reactions are occurring simultaneously within a zone.","A whole mixed-wood pyrolysis oil feedstock was fed once-through a fixed bed reactor loaded with a hydrotreating catalyst at the conditions specified for partial deoxygenation zone (Zone 1) in Table 1 below. The effluent oil was isolated after separation of water generated in the reaction. The properties of the effluent oil from the partial deoxygenation zone are also shown in Table 1. The partially deoxygenated effluent oil from the partial deoxygenation zone was then fed to a full deoxygenation zone and contacted with a second catalyst at the elevated process conditions shown in Table 1. This second catalyst was a sulfided nickel and molybdenum on alumina catalyst. The overall volumetric yield of hydrocarbon that was isolated from the effluent of the full deoxygenation zone was about 51 vol % of the initial whole mixed-wood pyrolysis oil feedstock.","A whole pyrolysis oil feedstock produced from corn stover was fed once through a fixed bed reactor loaded with a hydrotreating catalyst at the conditions specified for the partial deoxygenation zone (Zone 1) in Table 2 below. The effluent oil was isolated after separation of water generated in the reaction. The properties of the effluent oil from the partial deoxygenation zone are also shown in Table 2. The partially deoxygenated effluent from the partial deoxygenation zone was then fed over a second catalyst in a full deoxygenation zone at the elevated process conditions shown. This second catalyst was a sulfided nickel molybdenum on alumina catalyst. The overall volumetric yield of hydrocarbon isolated from the effluent of the full deoxygenation zone was about 67 vol % of the initial whole pyrolysis oil feedstock produced from corn stover.","The third example again shows the complete deoxygenation of a whole pyrolysis oil produced from corn stover. The pyrolysis oil was fed once-through over a stacked fixed bed reactor. The upper zone of the reactor, the partial deoxygenation zone, was loaded with a milder hydrotreating catalyst run 250\u00b0 C. as shown in table 3. The bottom zone of the reactor, the full deoxygenation zone, was loaded a sulfided nickel and molybdenum on alumina catalyst produced by UOP and kept at 400\u00b0 C. The other process variables are shown in Table 3. This example shows that a single reactor with stacked catalyst beds is capable of full deoxygenation to produce a hydrocarbon product.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"203pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"91pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},"TABLE
