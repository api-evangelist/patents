No. 09\/457,068, which was filed on Dec. 7, 1999 now abandoned and of Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60\/328,878, filed on Oct. 12, 2001. Priority is hereby claimed to all common material disclosed in these pending patent cases.","Some of the technology described is this patent application was funded in part by National Instituted of Health grant number 1 R24 HL 64590.","1. Field of the Invention","This invention relates to the visualization, perception, representation and computation of data relating to the attributes or conditions constituting the health state of a dynamic system. More specifically, this invention relates to the display and computation of anesthesia drug data, in which variables constituting attributes and conditions of a dynamic anesthesia system can be interrelated and visually correlated in time as three-dimensional objects.","2. Description of the Related Art","A variety of methods and systems for the visualization of data have been proposed. Traditionally, these methods and systems fail to present in a real-time multi-dimensional format that is directed to facilitating a user\u201ds analysis of multiple variables and the relationships between such multiple variables. Moreover, such prior methods and systems tend not to be specifically directed to the monitoring of anesthesia or which is capable of estimating, predicting and displaying drug dosages, infusions, effect site concentration, and drug effects during anesthesia. Prior methods typically do not process and display data in real-time, rather they use databases or spatial organizations of historical data. Generally, they also simply plot existing information in two or three dimensions, but without using three-dimensional geometric objects to show the interrelations between data.","Often previous systems and methods are limited to pie charts, lines or bars to represent the data. Also, many previous systems are limited to particular applications or types of data. The flexibility and adaptability of the user interface and control is typically very limited, and may not provide flexible coordinate systems and historical-trend monitors. Other systems, which have a flexible user interface, generally require substantial user expertise in order to collect and evaluate the data, including the pre-identification of data ranges and resolution. Another common limitation of previous systems and methods is that they provide only a single or predetermined viewpoint from which to observe the data. Typically, prior systems and methods do not provide data normalcy frameworks to aid in the interpretation of the data. Furthermore, most prior methods use \u201cicons,\u201d shapes, lines, bars, or graphs.","Currently, many anesthesiologists must remember the drugs and doses that they have administered unless they have transcribed the information to a paper anesthetic record. Anesthesiologists may also need to rely on their memory and experience to provide adequate anesthesia. Anesthesiologists currently assess the effect of the anesthetics on a patient by indirect methods: pupil diameter, consciousness, breath and heart sounds, reflex response, blood pressure and heart rate. Unfortunately, many of these signs appear only when a patient has not received enough of an anesthetic drug or has received an overdose of a drug.","For general background material, the reader is directed to U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,671,953, 4,752,893, 4,772,882, 4,813,013, 4,814,755, 4,823,283, 4,885,173, 4,915,757, 4,926,868, 5,021,976, 5,121,469, 5,262,944, 5,317,321, 5,484,602, 5,485,850, 5,491,779, 5,588,104, 5,592,195, 5,596,694, 5,651,775, 5,680,590, 5,751,931, 5,768,552, 5,774,878, 5,796,398, 5,812,134, 5,830,150, 5,873,731, 5,875,108, 5,901,246, 5,923,330, 5,925,014, 5,957,860, and 6,042,548 each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety for the material disclosed therein.","As this disclosure employs a number of terms, which may be new to the reader, the reader is directed to the applicants\u201d definitions section, which is provided at the beginning of the detailed description section.","It is desirable to provide a method, system, and apparatus, which facilitates the rapid and accurate analysis of complex and quickly changing anesthesia drug data. Moreover, it is desirable that such a system and method be capable of estimating, predicting and displaying drug dosages, infusions, effect site concentrations and drug effects during anesthesia. It is desirable that such a system and method be capable of analyzing time based, real-time, and historical data and that it be able to graphically show the relationships between various data.","Research studies have indicated that the human mind is better able to analyze and use complex data when it is presented in a graphic, real world type representation, rather than when it is presented in textual or numeric formats. Research in thinking, imagination and learning has shown that visualization plays an intuitive and essential role in assisting a user associate, correlate, manipulate and use information. The more complex the relationship between information, the more critically important is the communication, including audio and visualization of the data. Modern human factors theory suggests that effective data representation requires the presentation of information in a manner that is consistent with the perceptual, cognitive, and response-based mental representations of the user. For example, the application of perceptual grouping (using color, similarity, connectedness, motion, sound etc.) can facilitate the presentation of information that should be grouped together. Conversely, a failure to use perceptual principles in the appropriate ways can lead to erroneous analysis of information.","The manner in which information is presented also affects the speed and accuracy of higher-level cognitive operations. For example, research on the \u201csymbolic distance effect\u201d suggests that there is a relationship between the nature of the cognitive decisions (for example, is the data increasing or decreasing in magnitude?) and the way the information is presented (for example, do the critical indices become larger or smaller, or does the sound volume or pitch rise or fall?). Additionally, \u201cpopulation stereotypes\u201d suggest that there are ways to present information that are compatible with well-learned interactions with other systems (for example, an upwards movement indicates an increasing value, while a downwards movement indicates a decreasing value).","Where there is compatibility between the information presented to the user and the cognitive representations presented to the user, performance is often more rapid, accurate, and consistent. Therefore, it is desirable that information be presented to the user in a manner that improves the user's ability to process the information and minimizes any mental transformations that must be applied to the data.","Therefore, it is the general object of this invention to provide a method and systems for presenting a three-dimensional visual and\/or possibly an audio display technique that assists in the monitoring and evaluation of drug data.","It is a further object of this invention to provide a method and system that assists in the evaluation of drug data with respect to the classification of an anesthetic.","It is another object of this invention to provide a method and system that assists in the evaluation of drug data with respect to anesthetics, including sedatives, analgesics, and neuromuscular blocking agents.","It is a still further object of this invention to provide a method and system that assists in the display of drug effects during anesthesia that takes into account the patient\u201ds age, gender, height and weight as related to historical or normative values.","Another object of this invention is to provide a method and system that assists in the evaluation of drug effects during anesthesia that provides for system execution faster than real time.","A still further object of this invention is to provide a method and system, which provides the gathering and use of sensor measured data, as well as the formatting and normalization of the data in a format suitable to the processing methodology.","A further object of this invention is to provide a method and system, which can normalize drug concentration and can display the concentration relative to the time that it was administered.","Another object of this invention is to provide a method and system, which provides a three-dimensional graphic display for the use of doctors in an operating room.","It is another object of this invention to provide a method and system, which provides three-dimensional graphic display that is used in conjunction with automatic drug delivery systems.","It is an object of this invention to provide a method and system that provides a visual display record of the drugs administered and a current, past and predicted estimate of how the drug should be expected to affect the patient.","It is a further object of this invention to provide a method and system that permits an integrated and overall holistic understanding of the effects of drugs during anesthesia.","A further object of this invention is to provide a method and system where three-dimensional objects are built from three-dimensional object primitives, including: cubes, spheres, pyramids, n-polygon prisms, cylinders, slabs.","A still further object of this invention is to provide a method and system, wherein three-dimensional objects are placed within health-space based on the coordinates of their geometric centers, edges, vertices, or other definite geometric variables.","It is a further object of this invention to provide a method and system, which has three-dimensional objects that have three spatial dimensions, as well as geometric, aesthetic and aural attributes, to permit the mapping of multiple data functions.","It is another object of this invention to provide a method and system, which shows increases and decreases in data values using changes in location, size, form, texture, opacity, color, sound and the relationships thereof in their context.","It is a still further object of this invention to provide a method and system, wherein the particular three-dimensional configuration of three-dimensional objects can be associated with a particular time and health state.","A still further object of this invention is to provide a method and system that permits the simultaneous display of the history of data objects.","Another object of this invention is to provide a method and system that provides for the selection of various user selectable viewports.","It is a further object of this invention to provide a method and system that provides both a global and a local three-dimensional coordinate space.","It is another object of this invention to provide a method and system that permits the use of time as one of the coordinates.","It is a still further object of this invention to provide a method and system that provides a reference framework of normative values for direct comparison with the measured data.","It is a further object of this invention to provide a method and system where normative values are based on the average historical behavior of a wide population of healthy systems similar to the system whose health is being monitored.","A further object of this invention is to provide a method and system that provides viewpoints that can be selected to be perspective views, immersive Virtual Reality views, or any orthographic views.","Another object of this invention is to provide a method and system that permits the display of a layout of multiple time-space viewpoints.","A still further object of this invention is to provide a method and system that provides for zooming in and out of a time and\/or

pre-recorded data or real-time data, that is as the data is obtained.","Another object of this invention is to provide a method and system that presents the data in familiar shapes, colors, and locations to enhance the usability of the data.","A still further object of the invention is to provide a method and system that uses animation, and sound to enhance the usefulness of the data to the user.","It is an object of this invention to provide a method and system for the measurement, computation, display and user interaction, of complex data sets that can be communicated and processed at various locations physically remote from each other, over a communication network, as necessary for the efficient utilization of the data and which can be dynamically changed or relocated as necessary.","It is still a further object of this invention to provide a method and system for the display of data that provides both a standard and a customized interface mode, thereby providing user and application flexibility.","It is an object of this invention to provide and method and system for the estimation, prediction, and display of drug dosages, infusions, effect site concentrations,

representation in real time.","Another object of this invention is to provide a method and system for displaying the interaction effects of multiple medications in an intuitive easy to understand format.","These and other objects of this invention are achieved by the method and system herein described and are readily apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art upon careful review of the following drawings, detailed description and claims.","Reference is now made in detail to the present preferred embodiments of the invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings.","This invention is a method, system and apparatus for the visual display of complex sets of dynamic data. In particular, this invention provides the means for efficiently analyzing, comparing and contrasting data, originating from either natural or artificial systems. This invention provides n-dimensional visual representations of data through innovative use of orthogonal views, form, space, frameworks, color, shading, texture, transparency, sound and visual positioning of the data. The preferred system of this invention includes one or a plurality of networked computer processing and display systems, which provide real-time as well as historical data, and which processes and formats the data into an audio-visual format with a visual combination of objects and models with which the user can interact to enhance the usefulness of the processed data. While this invention is applicable to a wide variety of data analysis applications, one important application is the analysis of health data. For this reason, the example of a medical application for this invention is used throughout this description. The use of this example is not intended to limit the scope of this invention to medical data analysis applications only, rather it is provided to give a context to the wide range of potential application for this invention.","This invention requires its own lexicon. For the purposes of this patent description and claims, the inventors intend that the following terms be understood to have the following definitions.","An \u201cartificial system\u201d is an entity, process, combination of human designed parts, and\/or environment that is created, designed or constructed by human intention. Examples of artificial systems include manmade real or virtual processes, computer systems, electrical power systems, utility and construction systems, chemical processes and designed combinations, economic processes (including, financial transactions), agricultural processes, machines, and human designed organic entities.","A \u201cnatural system\u201d is a functioning entity whose origin, processes and structures were not manmade or artificially created. Examples of natural systems are living organisms, ecological systems and various Earth environments.","The \u201chealth\u201d of a system is the state of being of the system as defined by its freedom from disease, ailment, failure or inefficiency. A diseased or ill state is a detrimental departure from normal functional conditions, as defined by the nature or specifications of the particular system (using historical and normative statistical values). The health of a functioning system refers to the soundness, wholeness, efficiency or well being of the entity. Moreover, the health of a system is determined by its functioning.","\u201cFunctions\u201d are behaviors or operations that an entity performs. Functional fitness is measures by the interaction among a set of \u201cvital-signs\u201d normally taken or measured using methods well known in the art, from a system to establish the system's health state, typically at regular or defined time intervals.","\u201cHealth-space\u201d or \u201cH-space\u201d is the data representation environment that is used to map the data in three or more dimensions.","\u201cH-state\u201d is a particular 3-D configuration or composition that the various 3-D objects take in H-space at a particular time. In other words, H-state is a 3-D snapshot of the system's health at one point of time.","\u201cLife-space\u201d or \u201cL-space\u201d provides the present and past health states of a system in a historical and comparative view of the evolution of the system in time. This 3-D representation environment constitutes the historical or Life-space of a dynamic system. L-space allows for both continuous and categorical displays of temporal dependent complex data. In other words, L-space represents the health history or trajectory of the system in time.","\u201cReal-Time Representation\u201d is the display of a representation of the data within a fraction of a second from the time when the event of the measured data occurred in the dynamic system.","\u201cReal-Time User Interface\u201d is the seemingly instantaneous response in the representation due to user interactivity (such as rotation and zooming).","A \u201cvariable\u201d is a time dependent information unit (one unit per time increment) related to sensing a given and constant feature of the dynamic system.","\u201cVital signs\u201d are key indicators that measure the system's critical functions or physiology.","In the preferred embodiments of this invention, data is gathered using methods or processes well known in the art or as appropriate and necessary. For example, in general, physiologic data, such as heart rate, respiration rate and volume, blood pressure, and the like, is collected using the various sensors that measure the functions of the natural system. Sensor-measured data is electronically transferred and translated into a digital data format to permit use by the invention. This invention uses the received measured data to deliver real-time and\/or historical representations of the data and\/or recorded data for later replay. Moreover, this invention permits the monitoring of the health of a dynamic system in a distributed environment. By distributed environment, it is meant that a user or users interacting with the monitoring system may be in separate locations from the location of the dynamic system being monitored. In its most basic elements, the monitoring system of this invention has three major logical components: (1) the sensors that measure the data of the system; (2) the networked computational information systems that computes the representation and that exchanges data with the sensors and the user interface; and (3) the interactive user interface that displays the desired representation and that interactively accepts the users\u201d inputs. The components and devices that perform the three major functions of this invention may be multiple, may be in the same or different physical locations, and\/or may be assigned to a specific process or shared by multiple processes.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0112","num":"0111"},"figref":"FIG. 1","i":["a ","a ","a ","b","b ","a","b ","a","a ","b ","a,b","a ","a ","b "],"b":["101","101","102","102","102","102","103","103","103","101","101","101","101","101","103","104","104","101","101","104","105","108","105","108","105","106","101","107","107","107","101","108","108","109","101","101"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0113","num":"0112"},"figref":"FIG. 1","i":["b ","a ","b","b ","a","b ","a","a ","b ","a,b","a,b ","a,b ","a ","b "],"b":["110","111","111","111","111","112","112","112","110","110","110","110","110","112","113","113","110","110","113","114","117","114","117","114","115","110","116","116","110","101","116","116","112","116","113","117","118","110","110"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0114","num":"0113"},"figref":"FIG. 1","i":"c ","b":["119","120","120","121","120","122","122","123","122","123","124","125","126","123","127","130","127","130","128","131","129","131","132","133","134","135"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0115","num":"0114"},"figref":"FIG. 1","i":["d ","a,b,c ","a,b,c ","a,b,c ","a,b,c","a,b,c","a,b,c ","a,b,c.

effects of intravenous drugs during anesthesia. The concentration and effect of drug  are presented with respect to the classification of the anesthetic: sedatives (unconsciousness) , analgesics (pain inhibitors) , and neuromuscular blockades (muscle relaxants) . Pharmacokinetic models  of the anesthetic drugs, derived from the results of clinical studies, have been implemented and are used to estimate the drug concentrations at the effect site with respect to the general population of a given height, weight, gender and age. The models are typically run in real time, but in alternative embodiments or uses may be run faster or slower than real time and a prediction of the effect site concentrations  shows up to 10 minutes into the future, although alternative future periods may be substituted without departing from the concept of this invention. A three-dimensional plot  provides a three-dimensional view of the effect interactions of two medications , . A trend of the predicted effect site concentrations is shown to 30 minutes in the past, although alternative trend periods may be substituted without departing from the concept of this invention. Each drug may be color coded. Past, current, and predicted concentrations are normalized with respect to the drug's EC50 for sedation or analgesia and plotted relative to the time that it was administered. Drug administrations are shown as boluses or infusions.","The current drug effects are represented as bar graphs , , . For sedation , the effect-site concentrations drive pharmacodynamic models , derived from the results of clinical studies, and present the drug effect of the \u201cpopulation normal\u201d patient (normalized to height, weight, and\/or gender). In the first graph , as the level of sedation surpasses the OAA\/S pharmacodynamic curve, the \u201cpopulation normal\u201d patient is expected to become unconscious. In the analgesia bar graph , the upper and lower bounds are given for the drug level required to prevent a somatic response. If the analgesia has surpassed the first pharmacodynamic curve (analgesia), then there will likely be no response to post-operative pain or surgical skin closure for the \u201cpopulation normal\u201d patient. Likewise, if the analgesia level has surpassed the somatic response to a laryngoscopy (placement of an endotracial tube) . In addition, mathematical models have been implemented to incorporate drug-drug synergism  between propofol (sedative-hypnotic) and opiods (analgesics). The drug synergism is shown as a gray bar  representing the additional effect due to the drug interactions. Finally, the neuromuscular blockade effect  is shown in relation to the train-of-four twitch monitor. The bar graph  relates the predicted number of twitches that would occur with a train-of-four monitor. As the drug level surpasses three twitches, then one would expect three twitches for the \u201cpopulation normal\u201d patient, and as it passes zero, then no train-of-four response would be expected.","One embodiment of the invention includes a graphical drug display, shown as  used to determine the effect of such a display on the performance of anesthesiologists and nurse anesthetists (CRNAs) in the delivery of intravenous (IV) anesthetic drugs using in a full-scale patient simulation environment.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0166","num":"0165"},"figref":"FIG. 42"},"An evaluation of a beta version of this display using a computer based simulation (Anesoft Inc. Issaquah, Wash.) found an enhancement of the anesthesiologist's performance in administering drug boluses for analgesia, anesthesia, and neuromuscular blockade with use of the display. The results showed an improvement in the accuracy of drug delivery with the drug display present.","A more advanced version of the drug display has been developed, capable of presenting multiple drugs per class, model predicted interactions between different drugs, and drug administration via infusion pumps in a graphical display as shown in .","A study using such a graphical displayed measured drug delivery performance in a simulated high fidelity test scenario. The drug display is designed to support anesthesiologists and CRNAs delivery of drugs by providing information about drug concentrations in the past, the present, and the future. Its use is expected to result in: (1) more judicious administration of drugs, (2) better intraoperative control of sedation, analgesia, and neuromuscular blockade, (3) more rapid emergence for the simulated patient after the surgery. (4) and better postoperative pain management.","Design: In the study, a between subjects design with display conditions (traditional display only, traditional display and drug display) will be used. Analyses of all dependent variables will be based on this design.","Methods Subjects: 24 anesthesiologists and anesthetists with a range of clinical experience (CRNA, CA-2 and CA-3, and faculty) participated in the study evaluating this invention.","Materials: The METI anesthesia simulator (MET], Sarasota, Fla.) at the University of Utah Center for Patient Simulation was used to conduct the display evaluation. To evaluate the traditional display, the display is connected to an AS\/3 anesthesia monitor  (Datex, Helsinki, Finland) that displays the traditional electrocardiogram (ECG), arterial blood pressure (BP), pulse oximeter (SpO2), and capnogram (CO2) waveforms. Digital values for heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), oxygen saturation (SpO2) end-tidal carbon dioxide (FetCO2), and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) is displayed via a patient simulator  that is supported by patient simulator hardware . The pulse oximeter tone will also be provided. All alarms will be in default mode and may be modified by the subjects according to their preferences.","The drug display of  provides information about drugs according to their classification, including intravenous sedatives , analgesics , and neuromuscular blocking agents . Color-coded histogram bars show the drug boluses delivered to the patient . Model predicted effect site concentrations are shown from thirty minutes in the past  and ten minutes in the future . The display  is animated with the concentrations and dosages  moving from right to left over time. Three concentration-effect graphs  show the current pharmacodynamic predicted levels of sedation , analgesia , and neuromuscular blockade  with respect to effect site concentration.","As IV drugs are administered, multi-compartment pharmacokinetic (PK) drug models  predict effect site concentrations, and pharmacodynamic (PD) models  use these predicted effect site concentration to predict the drug effects on the patient's levels of sedation , analgesia , and NMB . The PK models  of the drug display and the METI simulator are calibrated so that the simulated patient  responds as the PD models predict it should. In instances of synergistic drug interactions (e.g. propofol-opioid), the drug display uses a PD drug interaction model to predict the combined drug effects on sedation, analgesia, and NMB (Guoming, PhD Dissertation). The default physiologic responses of the METI simulator are overridden by physiologic responses appropriate to the drug levels as predicted by the drug interaction models shown in Tables 1 and 2, below. Table 1 shows a pain scale and Table 2 shows the sedative and opioid effects on the cardiovascular system. The scenario will be constructed so elements of the patient's history make the use of cardiovascular drugs undesirable.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0175","num":"0174"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"7"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE I"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"7","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Pain Scale","BP Max","BP Min","(P)SVR","HR Factor","HR","Stimulus"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"7","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"7"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"28pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"28pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"28pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"35pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"21pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["1","110","80","1.0","1.00","78","pre-surgery"]},{"entry":["2","117","84","1.1","1.08","85"]},{"entry":["3","123","89","1.3","1.17","91","maintenance"]},{"entry":["4","130","98","1.5","1.25","98","closure"]},{"entry":["5","137","98","1.7","1.33","104"]},{"entry":["6","143","102","2.0","1.42","111","Bankhart"]},{"entry":["7","150","107","2.3","1.50","117","Scope"]},{"entry":["8","157","111","2.7","1.58","124"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"7","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"Table 1 specifically shows the mapping of the pain scale to the METI Simulator's parameters.

An increase in drug levels increases the venous capacity factor (which lowers the arterial blood pressure). The heart rate factor is decreased. An adequate level of anesthesia and analgesia can prevent or lessen the intensity of a somatic response to laryngoscopy and surgical stimuli. An \u201coverdose\u201d of propofol and\/or opioids will result in hypotension and bradycardia. The drug display  receives data from computerized IV drug delivery systems . The Docuject\u00a9 4207 [DocuSys Inc. Mobile, Ala.] drug delivery system reads and records bolus doses of drugs administered via bar-coded syringes. The Medfusion\u2122 3010a (Medex Inc. Duluth, Ga.) infusion pumps  relay IV infusion rates (mg\/hr) through a serial port. For both devices, the drug concentration and amount delivered per unit time are sent to the delivery control PC  and the drug interface application relays the information to the drug display  and the operator of the human patient simulator via the drug display monitor .","The surgery involves shoulder arthroscopy (Bankart procedure) on a 62 y\/o, 80 kg male. The patients past medical history is significant for coronary artery disease which has been stable since stent placement one year ago, controlled hypertension, and a family history of malignant hyperthermia (MH). The patient is known to be MH susceptible by muscle biopsy.","The patient has had total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) for 2 prior surgical procedures and there were no anesthetic complications. The patient does mention that he had considerable postoperative pain after a previous shoulder procedure.","The surgeon has requested muscle relaxation for the procedure. The procedure will either be 20 minutes long if it only requires arthroscopy or 45 minutes if an open repair is needed.","For the scenario, TIVA will be required. To provide sedation, propofol will be available via bolus and continuous infusion. Remifentanyl (bolus and infusion) and fentanyl (bolus only) will be available for analgesia. Rocuronium (bolus only) is the available neuromuscular blocking agent.","Following intubation and transition of the patient to a semi-Fowler's position, the surgeon attempts to determine whether the Bankart procedure will be necessary via an exploratory evaluation. After 5 minutes, the surgeon announces that it will be necessary to convert to and open joint Bank art procedure. It is requested that the patient continues to have complete NMB for the duration of the surgery. Because the procedure is invasive and painful, the analgesic requirement increases (Table 2). Ten minutes into the surgery, the surgeon announces that the procedure is going very well and expects to close in approximately 10 minutes. Ideally, after skin closure, the patient should rapidly recover from the sedation and the NMB while having an appropriate amount of analgesia to relieve post-operative pain.","Measures. During the simulated surgery, predicted effect site concentrations of all administered drugs and model predicted levels of sedation, analgesia, and NMB will be recorded at two-second intervals. The values of the vital signs will be recorded at four-second intervals. Heart rate and blood pressure values will be extracted and sent to a spreadsheet.","Drug management performance will be calculated by comparing the predicted level of analgesia provided versus the simulated level of surgical stimulation. Because the simulator has been calibrated such that the physiologic responses match the pharmacodynamic predictions, a two-by-two repeated measurement analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be used to analyze tracking performance for the pharmacodynamic prediction of analgesia and the level of surgical stimulation (with or without the display). A criterion value of p<0.05 will be used for all analyses. Data will be presented as a mean standard deviation of the difference. The precision of drug administration will be measured as the standard deviation and the root-mean-square error (RMSE) between the predicted drug effect and the simulated level of surgical pain.","A train-of-four stimulus will be measured at 10-minute intervals and prior to removal of the endotracheal tube to assess the level of neuromuscular blockade. A t-test will be used to examine differences in the number of adjustments in propofol and remifentanil drug administration during maintenance.","Deviations from the preinduction heart rate (HR) and systolic blood pressure (SYS) will be used to determine the patient's responses to pain. The criteria for inadequate anesthesia will be a SYS more than 15 mmHg above the baseline and tachycardia higher than 90 beats\/min, in the absence of hypovolemia (Ausems, Anesth 68:851-61, 1988). Excessive level of anesthesia will be SYS more than 15 mmHG below the baseline and bradycardia lower than 40 beats\/min. For this analysis, the time interval during which heart rate or systolic blood pressure deviates from these thresholds will be computed. The baseline values for the vital signs will be determined by averaging vital sign data of the first 36 seconds of simulation, prior to intubation and drug administration. Vital sign differences between the two display conditions will be analyzed using an ANOVA test. Differences at the end of maintenance will be analyzed using a Fisher's exact test.","Patient vital signs will be recorded for 15 minutes following extubation. Minimum, maximum, mean, and percent deviations from baseline will be calculated. The time duration from completion of skin closure to awakening (spontaneous respiration and eye opening) and extubation will be recorded. Anesthetic records, vital sign measurements, and drug delivery information will be reviewed by three experienced anesthesiologists and scored on a scale of 0-100 according to their expert ratings of the quality of anesthesia provided by each subject.","Upon completion of the scenario, subjects will complete questionnaires related to measures of cognitive workload (NASA-TLX) satisfaction\u201d, and subjective utility of the drug display. A t-test <<-ill be used to determine differences between the experimental conditions.","Evaluation Procedure. When each subject arrives for the experiment, they will complete a questionnaire describing experience level, length of time working prior to the study. caffeine consumption, sleep history, and whether or not they require vision correction. Subjects will then be instructed about the general task in the experiment, i.e. that they have to administer anesthesia during a standard surgery. All participants will be instructed in the use of the METI simulator, interpretation of the drug display, Docuject, and the Medfusion 3010a pumps. Subjects will then induce anesthesia, intubate the trachea, care for the simulated patient throughout the procedure, and extubate the patient following skin closure and awakening.","Evaluation Training. A minimum amount of training is required with the high fidelity simulator because most subjects are familiar with the simulator as part of their training. Subjects will receive information about the simulator and be encouraged to ask questions about the simulator and its function. In both conditions, subjects will be asked if they are familiar with the set up of the standard monitoring equipment. All subjects will be instructed in the use of the Docuject and Medfusion 3010a drug delivery systems. Each subject will then use these devices to demonstrate the administration of a fixed infusion and three specified bolus doses of sterile eater representing the medications to be depicted in the simulation. Training for the simulator is completed when the subject reports feeling comfortable with administration of the anesthesic agents in the simulated patient.","A computerized tutorial will be presented in order to provide standardized training in use of the drug display for all subjects. Subjects will be shown static screen shots of the drug display monitor depicting the effect site concentrations and current effects of propofol, remifentanil, and rocuronium on sedation, analgesia and NMB. The display will be explained in detail including: axes, labels, drug classifications, effect site concentrations according to EC95. the effect bars. effect site concentration and its relation to drug effect, predicted, past, and present concentrations. The participants will be told that the display shows estimated effect site concentrations and drug effects generated from pharmacodynamic models.","In both conditions, after explaining the simulator, the subjects will be reminded that they have to administer anesthesia and provide care for the simulator patient. All questions concerning the use of the monitors, the procedure, etc will be answered immediately by the experimenter. On average, the training is expected to take 10 minutes. One-half of the subjects will be assigned randomly to the drug display condition and the remaining one-half will be assigned to the control condition, with equal numbers of attending anesthesiologists assigned to each group.","Evaluation Testing. The subject will be given a new anesthetic record and will be asked to fill it out during the course of the test scenario. Prior to starting the simulation, the subjects will be given the patient's preanesthetic evaluation form which includes: the patient's medical and surgical history, labs, baseline vital signs, planed surgical procedure, and the expected duration of the surgery. The patient will be presented as having arrived in the operating room without prior sedation or pre-oxygenation; however, ECG electrodes, an IV, an arterial line, and a non-invasive blood pressure cuff will already be in place. The subject will be reminded that they may administer boluses or continuous infusions of propofol and remifentanil, as well as bolus doses of fentanyl and rocuronium. Antagonist drugs will not be available for use. The subjects will be asked to administer anesthesia such that the patient is awake and spontaneously breathing as quickly as possible after the surgery with minimal post-operative pain. The simulation will end when the surgeon has finished closing and the patient is extubated. A video camera will record the training and the testing phases of the experiment.","After completing the experiment, the subjects will answer a NASA-TLX questionnaire and a short questionnaire about the drug display (see Appendix). Each study session is expected to last approximately one hour, and the subjects will be compensated $50 for their participation.","Procedure to compute the patient state: 1.Get the pain scale from the simulator scenario: painScale=computePainScale( ); 2.Get the analgesia drug scale from the models in the drug display: drugscale=getDrugScale( ); 3.Get the sedation drug level from the models in the drug display: sedationLevel=getSedationLevel( ); 4.Compute the resulting heart rate:hrPainFactor=getPainHRFactor(painScale) hrDrugFactor=getDrugHRFactor(drugScale)hr=80.0*hrPainFactor* hrDrug,Factor; 5.Compute the resulting SVR and PVR:svrPainFactor=getPainSVR(painScale):svrDrugFactor=getDrup-ISVR(drueScale);svrFactor=svrPainFactor*svrDrug-Factor;(same for PVR)6Systolic and Diastolic BP due to pain is encoded within the scenario (derived from painScale) 7.Compute the resulting venous capacity factor (offsets the somatic responses due to the drug) VcFactor=getVcFactor(drugScale); 8.Compute the Respiratory rate RR=getRespRate(sedationLevel); 9.Compute the \u201cEyes Open or Closed\u201d ResponseEyes=getEyes(sedationLevel); 10.Set using HiDEP. the following parameters for the simulator SvrFactor. pvrFactor, vcFactor, hr. eyes, and rr.","A study was performed to determine if in the presence of the drug display, the anesthesiologist's delivery of drugs will be more judicious and efficient, resulting in better control of the patient's vital signs and depth of anesthesia during the surgery.","Material and Methods. Subjects. After obtaining approval from the institutional review board at the University of Utah, we evaluated 14 resident\/attending anesthesiologist \u201cteams\u201d as they performed 3 TIVAs (total intravenous anesthetics) in the operating room. Residents were CA-2, CA-3 or chief residents. Study Design: The teams were evaluated during 42 laparoscopic surgeries (cholecystectomy, hernirraphy, tubal ligation) for ASA Class I, II and III patients with informed consent. Teams were limited in their choice of intravenous anesthetic agents: propofol for sedation, remifentanil, fentanyl, and sufentanil for analgesia, and rocuronium as a muscle relaxant. However, the anesthesiologists administered intravenous reversal agents and cardiovascular drugs as necessary.","All participating anesthesiologists used the Docuject (DocuSys Inc, Theodore Ala.) intravenous drug delivery system  for administering bolus doses of drugs. All bolus anesthetic and reversal agents as well as cardiovascular drugs were administered using the Docuject system . In addition, the teams administered drug infusions with two Medfusion (Medex Inc, Duluth Ga.) 2010i infusion pumps. Half of the participating teams (7 teams, 21 surgeries) had the University of Utah drug display presented alongside the standard OR monitors to help guide them during the anesthetic. A between subject design was used. That is, the teams that had use of the drug display presented did not participate as subjects for the condition without the drug display. The \u201cno drug display\u201d condition was executed first, and the teams were allowed to us the display in the second condition.","Training. All teams were trained to use the Docuject drug delivery system. The Medfusion intravenous pumps  are the standard pumps used in the operating room, and no training was necessary. In addition, the teams assigned to the drug display experimental condition were trained to use the drug display.","Because the Docuject drug delivery system is a new medical device, a brief training session on its use was necessary. Each team was trained to use the Docuject system in the operating room before their first case in the study. First, a short, scripted, demonstration was given by one of the experimenters. The experimenter explained the Docuject system: the syringe, the barcode, the technology to read the barcode and present the drug information, the technology to compute the amount of drug administered, and how to properly insert the syringe into the injection port of the IV-line. Teams learned to use the device with three sterilized mock syringes (propofol, fentanyl, rocuronium) that were affixed with barcodes representing the drugs used in the case. Anesthesiologists filled the syringes with sterile water and administered the drug to an IV port connected to an empty IV bag using the Docuject system. The experimenter answered all questions about the Docuject system. Both members of the team were tested to criterion by successfully administering specified amounts of the 3 mock drugs. On the day prior to using the drug display in the experimental condition, the team was trained to use the display. Each member of the team was trained separately. First, a digital video of the drug display was shown. The video described all of the graphical and numerical aspects of the display. In addition, the video displays an animation of a mock anesthetic was shown in accelerated time (20 times faster than real-time) with a numeric clearly showing the time. Finally the video described the limitations of the drug display: only modeled data for a population, does not incorporate reversal agents or cardiovascular drugs.","Next clinicians used a software program designed to simulate the bolus and infusion delivery of drugs (propofol, fentanyl, remifentanil, sufentanil, and rocuronium). Clinicians were asked to use the drug display in conjunction with the drug delivery simulator to titrate intravenous drugs for a young and healthy, 70-kg male undergoing an intra-abdominal surgery (with a large surgical incision). The anesthesiologist was asked to administer drugs to obtain adequate analgesia for the following stimuli: a laryngoscopy, surgical incision, surgical closure, patient wake-up, and post-operative analgesia. Questionnaires: After each case, the members of the team were required to use a NASA-TLX questionnaire to score their perceived physical, mental, and temporal demand for the surgery. After the team had fulfilled their quota of 3 TIVAs, they were given additional questionnaires on the utility and added value of the drug display and the Docuject systems.","Procedure Before starting surgery for the day, the Docuject and Drug Display system was set up in the designated operating room. The sterilized Docuject and the two Medfusion pumps attached to an IV pole. The infusion pumps could be moved according to the anesthesiologist's preference. A desktop PC on a cart ran software that coordinated the drug information with the drug delivery systems and the drug display, with digital output (Docuject\u2014USB, Medfusion\u2014RS-232) being sent to the PC. All intravenous drug delivery and predicted effect-site concentration data were saved to a file, with the time calibrated to the nearest minute of the time shown on the traditional monitors. When the drug display was shown, it was presented on a laptop PC next to the traditional monitors (or according to the anesthesiologist's preference). When the drug display was not shown, the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic models used by the drug display were executed in order to predict and store the effect-site concentrations for later analysis. Before the first case, a standardized checklist of system tests was used to ensure all software and hardware was working properly.","After each case, a table of vital sign trends recorded at one minute intervals was acquired from the traditional monitor (Datex and Eagle) were collected. All digital data stored on the experimenter's desktop PC were saved to a file for subsequent analysis. In addition, NASA-TLX questionnaire was given to both the resident and the attending anesthesiologist to complete. After the team had completed three TIVAs in the study, they completed the questionnaires on the utility and value of the drug display and the Docuject system.","Data Recording and Analysis After completion of the 42 cases, the data were analyzed: 1.Record the total dose\/kg and average dose\/kg\/unit time of all drugs administered. The costs of the drugs for the anesthetic were computed and differences in cost with regard to experimental condition were analyzed.","2. The variance in the following vital signs were analyzed during the case: \u2022heart rate,\u2022non-invasive BP (one to three minute intervals). 3.The differences between conditions were measured. Several variables were analyzed with respect to the patient's time to recovery. We measured the time from the point at which sutures were in place to the time of:\u2022wake up,\u2022spontaneous breathing, \u2022removal of endotrachial tube,\u2022ready for discharge in the PACU\u2022Aldrete scores in the PACU (30 min and 2 hours post surgery). 4.Reversal agents used, time administered, and amount given.","5.Experts rated the performance of each anesthetic: The impact of the drug display on performance to deliver anesthesia was evaluated. Three experts judged the anesthesiologists\u201d performance.","To evaluate the performance the experts used the anesthesia record, a record of monitored heart rate, blood pressure and SaO2, and the drugs administered. They judged whether anesthesiologists responded in a timely manner to changes in the vital signs, appropriate and efficient administration of drugs, and overall performance. The experts rated the performance with regard to these variables on a scale from 0-100, with 0 worst performance possible and 100 best performance possible. The ratings were used to assess performance independently from the measured variables (such as vital signs).
