{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.","The present invention relates to a quick release fitting. More specifically, but without limitation, the present invention relates to a common mobile aircrew restraint system interface emergency release assembly.","The United States Navy seeks to improve methods of restraining mobile crew members of air vehicles. Currently, rotary wing mobile aircrew members rely on the Gunner's Belt as the sole means of restraint and protection while flying unseated in aircraft. The Gunner's Belt system has several deficiencies and led to many mishaps including fatalities. These deficiencies include improper loading on the wearer during load events such as a fall or crash, inefficiencies induced to the wearer during mission duties, and limits on reliability of restraint. Those deficiencies have also attributed to several mishaps resulting in fatalities and injuries of aircrew.","The Gunner's Belt is intended to be worn around the chest, although aircrew often wear the belt around the torso and soft organs. Either location is injurious or sometimes fatal when the system is loaded via a fall or crash scenario, as the 3-inch wide webbing of the Gunner's Belt concentrates all the energy to the wearer in areas of low tolerance to force.","With the current Gunner's Belt system, users commonly encounter the problem of inadvertent release of the restraint due to the highly vulnerable latch release device that is exposed about the front torso of the wearer. Any contact with this release device, such as accidental sweeping contact with the aircraft structure, manipulating equipment within the aircraft, or lying on the floor to conduct certain mission duties, could result in inadvertent release of the system. Upon release, not only is the wearer unrestrained, resulting in a major safety hazard, the wearer must interrupt the mission to reconnect, resulting in mission inefficiency and possible mission failure.","The Gunner's Belt system is simply a belt intended to be worn around the chest with an adjustable length of tether that attaches to aircraft structure. This method of restraint has demonstrated limits on reliability. Should a wearer be suspended from the system with arms raised above their head, it is easy to realize the system shortfalls, as the restraint belt can lose all restraint-capability and freeing the wearer from restraint. Furthermore, if the tether is fully extended and the wearer is in a fall or crash scenario, the wearer can be thrown outside the aircraft via cabin doors or windows.","For the foregoing reasons, there is a need for an system described below.","The present invention is directed to a quick release fitting that meets the needs enumerated above and below.","The present invention is directed to a quick release fitting which includes a housing assembly, a locking arm, and a locking mechanism. The housing assembly has a main portion and a housing arm extending from the main portion. The locking arm is rotatably attached to the housing arm. The locking mechanism is disposed within the housing assembly. The locking mechanism communicates with the locking arm such the locking arm can be locked or unlocked to the housing assembly, when locked the locking arm is secured to the housing assembly, the locking arm, the housing arm and the housing main portion form a slot, when unlocked the locking arm is not secured to the housing assembly.","It is a feature of the present invention to provide a quick release fitting that does not inadvertently release, and has the ability to prevent inadvertent release by snagging or by contacting aircraft or other structures.","It is a feature of the present invention to provide a quick release fitting that can be connected to a nylon lifting harness connect that is attached to the AIRSAVE (CMU-33) survival vest that is worn by aircrew. Together with the quick release and nylon webbing is the common mobile aircrew restraint system AIRSAVE interface. The aircrew interface is a passive system that will become part of the already worn vest and harness assembly, therefore, cannot be worn in an incorrect, unsafe position, like that of a the gunners belt.","It is a feature of the present invention to provide a quick release fitting that is incorporated into a lifting harness that distributes applied loads appropriately through the quick release fitting and into a load-bearing harness, thus increasing the wearer's tolerance to load tremendously. It is a further feature to provide an assembly that has been tested and shown to decrease the chest load by up to 87%, compared to the gunner's belt.","It is a feature of the present invention to provide a quick release fitting with the ability to withstand a statically applied load of 3500-lbf for 60-seconds without permanent deformation, yet retain its other functional requirements.","It is a feature of the present invention to provide a quick release fitting with ability to positively engage itself such that the quick release fitting cannot appear to be engaged when in actuality it is partially engaged or not engaged. It is a feature, proven via testing, that the present invention will not inadvertently release upon crash or fall, like that of the gunner's belt.","It is a feature of the present invention to provide a quick release fitting with the ability to release at 0-lbf tension and 300-lbf tension with a manual pull of less than 27-lbf and more than 15-lbf, after exposure to the applied load requirements.","The preferred embodiments of the present invention are illustrated by way of example below and in . As shown in , the quick release fitting  includes a housing assembly , a locking arm , and a locking mechanism . The housing assembly  has a main portion  and a housing arm  extending from the main portion . The locking arm  has a first locking arm end  and a second locking arm end , the first locking arm end  is rotatably attached to the housing arm . The locking mechanism  is disposed within the housing assembly . The locking mechanism  communicates with the second locking arm end  such the locking arm  can be locked (as shown in ) or unlocked (as shown in ). When locked, the locking arm  is secured to the housing assembly  via the locking mechanism . In the locked position, the locking arm , the housing arm  and the housing main portion  form a slot  enabling attachment of a cord, rope, wire or the like. When unlocked the locking arm  is not secured to the housing assembly , and the slot  is no longer present.","In the description of the present invention, the invention will be discussed in a military environment; however, this invention can be utilized for any type of application that requires use of a quick release fitting.","The housing arm  extends from the housing main portion  and curves inwardly toward the centerline  of the housing main portion . The housing assembly  may also include a housing slot  disposed on the opposite end of the housing arm . The housing slot  may accept webbing from a restraint system. The housing assembly  may include a housing cover which covers the housing assembly  and anything disposed within the housing assembly .","The locking arm  may be rotatably or pivotably attached to the housing arm  via a rivet , or any type of mechanism that allows rotational communication. The locking arm  has a notch  at the second locking arm end . The locking arm  may have a first edge  and a second edge . When the quick release fitting  is closed and the slot  is formed, the first edge  is outside the slot , while the second edge  forms part of the inner edge of the slot  (along with the inner edge  of the housing arm ). The notch  is disposed at the first edge  of the locking arm . On the second edge  there is a sloping portion , which slopes toward the second locking arm end  and away from the axis of the locking arm  (or toward the centerline  of the housing main portion  when the quick release fitting  is in the closed position).","The locking mechanism  includes an actuation lever , a plunger assembly , a compression spring  and a spring pin . The plunger assembly  includes a plunger  and a plunger assembly compression spring . The actuation lever  is rotatably attached to the housing assembly  (at a fulcrum point), preferably at the center of the actuation lever  (the center of the actuation lever  may be defined, but without limitation, as the proximate point in the middle or center of the opposite axial ends of the lever). The actuation lever  contains an actuation lever slot  enabling attachment or routing of webbing, a cord or a lanyard that when pulled the actuation lever  rotates about its fulcrum point. The plunger assembly compression spring  is located between the actuation lever  and the plunger  and serves to control, in conjunction with compression spring , the force required to pull the actuator lever  resulting with release. The spring pin  serves to react the pull force, thus transitioning the pull force to the actuation lever . With webbing, cord or lanyard routed through the actuation lever slot  in the actuation lever  and anchored to the spring pin , the force applied to the webbing, cord or lanyard is applied to the actuation lever  resulting with rotation of the actuation lever .","The actuation lever  includes a notch projection , a plunger assembly projection  and a lever portion . The notch projection  and the plunger assembly projection  are disposed on opposite ends of the lever portion . The actuation lever  pivots about the axial center of the of the lever portion . The plunger assembly projection  may include a gain A.","The plunger assembly compression spring  envelopes part or most of the plunger  and serves to control the force required to pull the actuator lever  resulting with release. The plunger assembly compression spring  is attached to the plunger assembly projection , and rests partially in the gain A of the plunger assembly projection .","In operation, when the locking arm  is engaged to be closed, the sloping portion  of the locking arm  engages the plunger . The plunger  along with the plunger assembly compression spying  pushes on the plunger assembly projection , which causes the actuation lever  to pivot such that the end with the plunger assembly projection  is pushed downward and the end with notch projection  goes upward (with force from the compression spring ) such that the notch projection  communicates with the notch  of the locking arm  such that the locking arm  is in the locked position. When a lanyard or cord communicating with the actuation lever slot  is pulled, the actuation lever  pivots and the end with the notch projection  is pushed downward, ending communication with the notch  and the quick release fitting  is in the unlocked position.","When introducing elements of the present invention or the preferred embodiment(s) thereof, the articles \u201ca,\u201d \u201can,\u201d \u201cthe,\u201d and \u201csaid\u201d are intended to mean there are one or more of the elements.
