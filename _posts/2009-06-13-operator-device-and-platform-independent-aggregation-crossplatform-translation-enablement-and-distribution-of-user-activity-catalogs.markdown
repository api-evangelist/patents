title: Operator, device and platform independent aggregation, cross-platform translation, enablement and distribution of user activity catalogs
abstract: Implementations relate to generating an operator, device, and platform-independent aggregation, cross-platform translation, enablement, and distribution of user activity catalogs. Users of a cellular telephone, a personal computer, or other devices or services can register to a database that collects transaction and other activity for the user. The user can designate one or more groups of users with whom to share collective activity data. The activity feeds can include recommendations, transactions, and other information generated when group members conduct retail or other activity. In one example, the activity feeds transmitted can be automatically translated and configured based on service operator and/or recipient device type. In another example, a user visiting a Website can be presented with a context-sensitive drop-down list of transactions conducted at that site by members of user's designated group(s) in the past. The platform permits users to mutually and transparently suggest products, services, or content to each other.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present application relates to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/080,435 filed Jul. 14, 2008, entitled \u201cMethod and Apparatus for Aggregation and Distribution of User Activity Catalogs,\u201d by Kabir Kasargod, Tianyu D'Amore, Gabriel M. Da Silva, and Brian Minear, assigned or under obligation of assignment to the same entity as this application, from which provisional application priority is claimed, and which provisional application is incorporated by reference herein.","The present teachings relate generally to method and apparatus for the operator, device, and platform-independent collection, and cross-platform translation, and distribution of user activity catalogs.","The advent of the Internet, network-enabled cellular telephones, and other networked devices has spawned a new era of advertising and content delivery. One factor spurring the increase in online advertising and other content delivery is the potential for targeted marketing to cell phone, Internet, and other users. Search-based advertising, for instance, has proliferated, in which content related to a user's search topic is automatically inserted in selectable banner ads or other advertising media.","Despite the widespread adoption of cellular and Internet advertising and other media, certain barriers to the effectiveness of networked content delivery remain. One factor is that consumers do not tend to give as much consideration to network-generated advertising content as they do to the recommendations or experiences of their immediate friends and other acquaintances. Traditional advertising platforms and channels generally fail, however, to exploit the marketing power of peer-reported recommendations and experiences.","Cellular and Internet providers and operators around the world, for example, offer services and devices that support the browsing, purchase, and download of games, ringtones, wallpapers, screensavers, music, and other types of DRM-protected services or content. DRM-protected content is generally purchased through a shopping catalog that is managed by the operator and made available to the user via either the mobile or the operator's website. The catalog tries to differentiate and promote some pieces of content over others, generally without regard to the user's preference, but rather based on the operator's partnerships with content developers. Commercial catalogs themselves do not, however, provide the credibility and personal connection that the user is most easily able to relate to, and in general those catalogs are not tailored by user preferences and\/or preferences and experiences of the user's social group. Those accumulated experiences can therefore remain hidden from mutual members of the group. Although inference based-catalogs and user recommendations have begun to be supported, the catalogs are still operator-controlled, the one-off recommendations tend to not be sufficient to cause a significant revenue impact, and the catalogs themselves do not provide the credibility or personality to which the user is able to relate easily.","It may be desirable to provide platforms and techniques that harness the leveraging effect of allowing users to accumulate and freely share their experiences and recommendations to other network users and that allow operators, merchants, and others to monetize those compounded content feeds. It may be further desirable to provide an ability to generate and distribute those feeds to various group members on a context-sensitive and\/or device-independent basis, since in certain regards, the membership group can have a set of diverse handsets and other devices.","According to the present teachings in one or more aspects, systems and methods for operator, device, and platform independent, cross-platform translation, enablement, and distribution of user activity catalogs are provided, in which users such as cellular telephone, Internet, or other users can agree to have their transaction and other activity captured to a combined database. In one or more implementations of the present teachings, systems and methods are provided which capture a catalog of user activity or experiences for each user registered, to participate in a shared database of activity histories. In one or more implementations, each user in a set of registered users can be any one or more of a cellular telephone user, a personal computer user, a user of a network-enabled media playback device, or other user or subscriber.","In one or more implementations, the user activity captured and recorded to the database can include, for example, purchase, license, or other transaction activity for the user. For instance, the catalog of user activity can include a record of purchases made by a user via the Internet and\/or cellular telephone, or by in-store or point-of-sale purchases at stores or other retail sites. The transaction activity can involve, for example, the purchase, rental, or licensing of book, music, movie, clothing, food, software, or other media or content being recommended in the feed, and that has been translated to be relevant to the receiving user, and\/or other products or services. In one or more implementations, the users receiving a feed of recommendations or other information from within their registered group or other participating community can be presented with an option to purchase the same product, service, or content being recommended in the feed. In one or more implementations, the option to purchase the recommended product can be a one-click interface, to permit convenient transactions by the user's linked \u201cbuddies,\u201d or other designated group(s).","In one or more implementations, the delivery of the shared-experience feeds can be generated and\/or translated on a device-independent or cross-platform basis, permitting diverse devices to capture and upload new transactions, recommendations and experiences, and receive the same feeds, without a need for a given device to translate the format of the content for local presentation on that device. In one or more implementations in further regards, the presentation of various click-through options can be generated on a context-sensitive basis, for example, to display peer-recommended movies for purchase when the user navigates to a video rental page or theater schedule page.","In one or more implementations, the content feed received by the friends or other users can relate to a non-purchase activity, but the platform can nevertheless generate or translate that information into a purchasable activity. For example, a user might recommend a certain golf course and incorporate that recommendation into their catalog of user activity. When that recommendation is placed into a feed or distribution to the user's \u201cbuddies\u201d or other designated group(s), selectable purchase options for golf clubs or other sporting equipment can be inserted into the feed. In one or more implementations, selectable purchase options can also be inserted for feeds which already include user transactions and\/or recommendations, and can for instance include sponsored feeds from participating merchants or vendors. In one or more implementations, the selectable purchase options that are not derived from user recommendations or experiences can be marked or designated as merchant-sponsored options or recommendations.","According to one or more aspects, platforms and techniques according to the present teachings can thereby permit a user to share or link their catalog of accumulated user activity to one or more designated group or groups of other registered users, on a selective basis. In one or more implementations, the designated group(s) of other registered users can include a social network or other defined user community. In one or more implementations, the user can be identified by credentials, such as the user's cellular telephone or Internet credentials including identifiers such as a user name, password, cellular telephone or other account number. In one or more implementations, the user can configure an access profile which permits all users within a designated group or groups to receive the same content from the user's catalog of user activity, or different levels, types, or amounts of content from the user's catalog by configuring access policies for the catalog. In one or more implementations, the designated group or groups can view or discover, for example, the transaction history of the user to identify recent purchases by that user, such as recent music or video purchases or rentals. In one or more implementations, members of the designated group(s) can be presented with a selectable option, such as a button or box selectable by cursor or mouse click, or other dialog or interface to select that music, video, or other content for purchase themselves. In one or more implementations, the database hosting the set of catalogs of user activity can record the click-through or selection of material for purchase based on the user activity feed, for instance to record loyalty points or other promotional data.","To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends, the one or more aspects comprise the features hereinafter fully described and particularly pointed out in the claims. The following description and the annexed drawings set forth in detail certain illustrative features of the one or more aspects. These features are indicative, however, of but a few of the various ways in which the principles of various aspects may be employed, and this description is intended to include all such aspects and their equivalents.","Various aspects are now described with reference to the drawings. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of one or more aspects. It may be evident; however, that such aspect(s) may be practiced without these specific details.","Aspects of the present teachings relate to methods and apparatus for the operator, device, and platform-independent distribution of user activity catalogs. More particularly, in one or more aspects, platforms and techniques are provided in which users can agree to have their transaction records or other activity or experiences captured and stored to a shared database, for collection and selective distribution or sharing to designated group(s) of users within the overall set of registered users of the platform. The transaction, ratings\/recommendation, and other histories and experiences of all users can therefore become available and transparent to each other depending on user-defined permissions, allowing the compounding effect of peer recommendations and experiences to be exploited in user-generated activity feeds. Consistent with one or more implementations, the feeds can be accessed, translated, and delivered on a cross-platform and\/or operator, device and platform-independent basis, permitting a wide range of users to employ a wide range of devices to participate in the user-generated content streams. In one or more implementations, translations between various formats for a given recipient device and\/or its supporting operator can be generated at the catalog server.","According to one or more implementations in one regard, a user can, in general, contribute to, view, or explore the set of catalogs of user activity in his or her designated group(s). The designated group(s) of a user can include, for example, friends, contacts, or other users within a \u201cbuddy\u201d list, social network, and\/or other user community. In one or more implementations, a user can choose to import or merge an existing list of users from a social network into the user's designated group(s). In one or more implementations, other users who are not registered to a specific social network can be included in a user's designated group(s). For example, a user can choose to include users or groups of users from their workplace, school, or other institution, community, or source, or can choose to invite participation from any public Internet or other network users. In one or more implementations of the present teachings, the designated group(s) for a user can be freely modified by the user at any time. In one or more implementations, a user can maintain one group or multiple groups. If multiple groups are generated, the user can designate groups having an overlap of users between separate groups, if desired. In one or more implementations, different designated groups or users within designated groups can be assigned the same or different content feeds, access privileges, or other distribution settings. In one or more implementations, groups can be established across platforms, carriers, or access providers. In one or more aspects, the user can configure a set of access or privilege controls to selectively opt in, opt out, filter, suspend, or activate the sharing of their transaction activity and other data to the shared catalog environment, at the user's discretion.","In the subject description, the word \u201cexemplary\u201d is used to mean serving as an example, instance, or illustration. Any aspect or design described herein as \u201cexemplary\u201d is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other aspects or designs. Rather, use of the word exemplary is intended to present concepts in a concrete fashion.","Moreover, the term \u201cor\u201d is intended to mean an inclusive \u201cor\u201d rather than an exclusive \u201cor.\u201d That is, unless specified otherwise, or clear from the context, the phrase \u201cX employs A or B\u201d is intended to mean any of the natural inclusive permutations. That is, the phrase \u201cX employs A or B\u201d is satisfied by any of the following instances: X employs A; X employs B; or X employs both A and B. In addition, the articles \u201ca\u201d and \u201can\u201d as used in this application and the appended claims should generally be construed to mean \u201cone or more\u201d unless specified otherwise or clear from the context to be directed to a singular form.","As shown in , according to one or more implementations in general regards, the user can operate a device  to access a database  and catalog server  via one or more network , and thereby participate in an overall shared-catalog environment . In one or more implementations, device  can be or include a cellular telephone, a personal computer, a network-enabled media player, a network-enabled personal digital assistant, a desktop or laptop computer, or other wired, optically-connected, wireless, or other networked device. Device  can host a client , such as a software application designed for a cellular telephone or other type of device , and configured to permit interaction with database , catalog server , and other resources. Client  can be or include, for instance, a client designed for BREW\u00ae platform available from QUALCOMM Incorporated of San Diego, Calif. Client  can likewise be or include a client designed for environments such as the Java\u2122 2 Mobile Environment (J2ME), the Wireless Application Protocol (WAP), or the Mobile Widget environment, etc. Client  can also be or include software for a personal computer, such as a Web browser, or other application or plug-in software module for the Windows\u2122, Linux\u2122, or any other network-aware environment. In one aspect, for instance, client  can likewise be or include a device such as a cable-enabled set-top box. One or more network  through which device  and client  or other associated hardware, software, or logic communicate with database  and other resources can be or include the Internet, or other public or private networks. In one or more aspects, network  can include or interface with one or more base station , such as a cellular base station, to communicate with wireless devices. In one or more implementations, a user can use more than one type of device  and\/or client  at the same time or different times.","A catalog server  can maintain or interface with database . Database  can be a relational database or other data store that registers or stores catalogs of user activity, such as mobile or transaction activities that users choose to publicize to their designated group(s) of other users. In one or more aspects, catalog server can likewise maintain or interface with device database  storing configuration data for different types of device , client , and\/or other resources.","In one or more implementations, the users can build their desired designated group(s) by manually enumerating users they wish to join their group(s).  depicts, purely illustratively, a designated group , a designated group , and a designated group , but any number, type, and arrangement of groups can be used. In one or more implementations, the designated group(s) for a user can also or instead be imported or merged from a social network, such as the publicly available Facebook\u2122 or other service, to leverage any existing \u201cbuddy\u201d network that the user maintains via external social networks. In one or more implementations, a user can designate all registered users in shared-catalog environment  as their designated group, or can designate subsets of that entire community as desired. In one or more implementations, the identity of designated group(s) for each user can be stored in database , or other data stores. In general, the designated group(s) for one user need not be identical to the designated group(s) for another user, although in one or more implementations, users can choose to establish or share common groups. In one or more implementations, the service of publishing a user's activity and feeds can be provided free of cost to the user. In implementation, database  can be integral with catalog server , or in another implementation, the database  can be independent and\/or physically separated from catalog server . In one or more implementations, catalog server , base station , device database , database , and\/or other resources can be located or hosted at a site operated by a carrier, operator, service, or other provider, or can be located or hosted within one or more network  or other locations.","The systems and methods for operator, device and platform-independent distribution of user activity catalogs of the present teachings can allow carriers, merchants, content providers, and other vendors or participants to introduce premium content which users can publicize to their designated group(s). Premium content can be downloadable content such as ringtones, wallpapers, applications, video clips, music, etc, as well as everyday content sold by brick-and-mortar and\/or online retailers, vendors, or merchants (e.g., such as Wal-Mart, Amazon, eBay etc.), etc. One potential source of revenue for implementations of the present teachings can derive from vendors who promote premium content within the catalog distribution environment. A vendor can, for example, be or include a wireless carrier, or a retail merchant. According to one or more implementations in one regard, catalog server  can register and track the number of clicks that a user generates on each item or service that is vended by a participating vendor, and can charge the vendor a pre-specified rate for the downstream user clicks on the vendor's items initiated from user feeds.","In one or more implementations, the type of content delivered via a feed to or from a user can be filtered or configured according to user-configured settings, and\/or the network or networks in which they are supported, subscribe, or operate. For example, a user can configure the user's received feeds to be filtered by the user's present location, such as a Global-Positioning System (GPS) fix reported by device , etc. A user can in these regards limit the set of selectable purchase options the user wishes to receive to those located within a certain number of miles of the user's present location. It may also be noted that in one or more implementations, and as described herein including in connection with , the feeds or other content delivered to device  can be modified or adjusted to conform to the specifications or limitations of an operator and\/or the particular device  or to ensure compatibility with the user's service and\/or device , such as for example to reduce the video resolution of content transmitted to device , or perform other adjustments.","In one implementation, for instance, a wireless carrier's digital content can only be made selectively visible or available to a user if the user and the members of the user's designated group(s) belong to the same carrier. If the user and the designated group(s) belong to different carriers, feeds that promote a different carrier's digital content can be filtered out of, or otherwise adjusted, in the user's feed list. In one or more implementations in these regards, only non-carrier-specific premium content feeds can be made visible or available to the user from the user's designated group(s). Other types and combinations of content filtering may further be possible. However, according to one or more aspects, the delivery of content feeds can be made and filtered on an operator (or service) independent basis, so that users across different supporting operators can receive content feeds across different catalog databases and user groups, as described herein.","According to one or more implementations in another regard, and as described herein (including below in connection with ), a set of Web sites  can be configured to generate and present context-sensitive lists or menus of available catalogs of user activity and\/or related user feeds. The context-sensitive content feeds can be generated based on registration of the set of Web sites  to database  via catalog server , along with associated user activity and mappings from Web addresses or other navigation information. In one or more implementations, and as likewise shown in , catalog server  can communicate with a set of loyalty programs  to register and track earned challenge points, rewards, loyalty points, or other value. Set of loyalty programs  can be hosted or maintained, for instance, by third party providers such as merchants, vendors, retailers, or financial institutions.","According to one or more implementations in these regards, the catalog server , database , and other infrastructure and logic of the catalog-sharing environment  can be adapted to allow users demonstrating common interests to add each other to each other's designated group(s), e.g., as \u201cbuddies,\u201d to view each other's catalogs, and strengthen and broaden their relationships and shared experiences over time. In terms of storage of a user's catalog of user activity stored in database , each user can have a tracked number of pieces of content that the user has made publicly available in database . For each user, database , catalog server , and\/or other software or logic can sort the stored data hosted in database  for instance to identify users with the highest number of content that is common with the user, and provide the user with a list of the most like-minded users.","For example, database  can be sorted or a report can be generated to indicate those users who have frequented a given user's favorite or most-visited restaurant the greatest number of times. In one or more implementations, the like-minded user list can be displayed within the shared-catalog environment to the user, for instance via client  on device . The user can then be presented with options such as an option to add the like-minded user as a member of the user's designated group(s) for sharing catalog content, view the buddy's catalog, and\/or make purchases through or with the like-minded user. The shared-catalog environment  of the present teachings can likewise be used to facilitate joint purchase activity amongst multiple users, for instance via a shared \u201cwish list,\u201d gift registry, or other information.","According to implementations in a further regard, the shared-catalog environment  of the present teachings can be extended to include retail merchants or other vendors in the users' designated group(s). This extension permits the expansion of recommended or available products, services, and content to the retail catalogs of merchants. In one or more implementations, merchants can join a user's designated group(s) as a node or virtual user. In this manner, a user can add merchants to the user's designated group(s), and purchase products, services, or content through the merchant's catalogs. In one or more implementations in these regards, the user can, for example, complete the purchase of retail or other items through payment mechanisms such as payment via mobile banking accounts, operator billing, and\/or through the use of his\/her credit card or other payment account in partnership with the participating merchant. In one or more implementations, the user can be incentivized through loyalty points from the owner or operator of database  or other entity to make public or broadcast his\/her wish list items, as well as purchased items if desired.","In one or more implementations, it may be noted that the merchant catalogs as well as records of historical purchases need not necessarily be captured or transmitted via device  in the form of a cellular telephone or personal computer, for example. A retail store, for instance, acting as a virtual user, can store daily transactions on a local data processing platform in that store or other site, and upload transactions via the one or more network  (e.g., the Internet, etc.) to database , or other data store. The point-of-sale transaction captured in this manner can be conducted, for example, using cash or electronic payment. In one or more implementations, each participating merchant can designate all of its existing account holders, customers, or other subscribers or affiliates as \u201cbuddies\u201d or members of the merchant's designated group(s), within the shared-catalog environment .","In one or more implementations in further regards, a user can configure or register to receive feeds or distributions of the set of catalogs of user activity, but decline to capture their own transaction activity to the database  and\/or publish that activity to other users. In one or more implementations, a user can opt to capture and\/or publish a transaction on a one-time basis, and\/or to be queried to capture and\/or publish their transactions one at a time on an ongoing transaction-by-transaction basis. In one or more implementations, a user can opt to capture, retrieve, and publish one or more transactions at any time, including for instance contemporaneously with the transaction, or some predetermined time after the transaction has taken place. In one or more implementations, a user can selectively opt at any time to capture and publish only those transactions conducted at or with one or more specific merchant, vendor, or content provider. In one or more implementations, a user can opt to have their transaction or other activity captured and published automatically for all available merchants, vendors, or content providers that are registered to or participating in the shared-catalog environment . In further implementations, the user can opt to selectively capture and publish offline activities such as transactions made at a physical store or other point of sale. The user in these regards can choose to add information links (e.g., a Web Uniform Resource Locator (URL), etc.) to the purchase or other transaction, or to the store, merchant, or provider. If a user adds a merchant to the user's designated group(s), the user is conversely able to view that merchant's catalog within the shared-catalog environment, for example via a display on device .","After insertion into the user's catalog of user activity, the user's designated group(s) can then now view the item (purchased item, wish list item, or other) in the user's catalog. Members of the designated group(s) can then add these items in their own wish list if desired, or purchase the item directly through or for the initial user. Again, transactions through the shared-catalog environment  can be tied back to the operator's or carrier's monthly or other bill, through mobile banking services, through the user's inputted credit card, through any online payment agency such as Paypal\u2122 (e.g., where Paypal\u2122 could for instance be a node or user within the shared-catalog environment, etc.), a credit card chip embedded within the cellular telephone if used, or other payment or settlement techniques. In one or more implementations, the owner or operator of database  can receive a revenue share for every purchase or other transaction conducted in the shared-catalog environment.","According to one or more implementations in a further regard, in addition to allowing members of a user's designated groups(s) to individually explore the catalog of user activity for that user, the shared-catalog environment of the present teachings can in addition or instead be configured to allow a user to broadcast or \u201cblast\u201d their catalog to the user's designated group(s). For example, according to one or more implementations in these regards, the user can automatically transmit a product, service, content or other catalog recommendation to one or all of the user's \u201cbuddies.\u201d In one or more implementations, the user can be provided with the flexibility of selecting or scheduling which users in the user's designated group(s) will receive the catalog broadcast or blast\u2014whether one, some, or all users within the designated group(s), or others. In one or more implementations, a notification of the broadcast and\/or the broadcast itself can be displayed within a specific area of the home page of the recipient users. In one or more implementations, that display can include the product, service, or content name or other identifier, the broadcasting user's rating of the product, service, or content, and a selectable link for the recipient user to purchase or explore that item.","In one or more implementations, the broadcast can relate to a specific product, service, or content, a selected group of such items, or a promotion of the broadcasting user's entire catalog of user activity. If the broadcast is referring to a complete catalog of user activity, clicking the associated link can take the recipient to the broadcasting user's catalog. The recipient user can for instance choose to ignore the broadcast, store it, delete it, or use it to purchase the product or go to the sending user's catalog. If ignored, in one or more implementations the broadcast can be kept in a \u201cblast\u201d list appearing in the recipient user's homepage without deleting it. If deleted, the broadcast can be removed from the recipient user's homepage completely. According to one or more implementations in further regards, the capability to generate, store and sort ratings of the catalogs of user activity can be incorporated in database , catalog server , and\/or other associated hardware, software, and logic. The rating system can for instance be stored and managed in catalog server  or other resources of the network. In one or more implementations, the rating system and current details of a user's catalog of user activity and associated ratings can be displayed to the user within his or her home page on the Web, on their mobile network, or other sites, services, or locations.","According to one or more implementations in a further regard, the catalog server  and associated logic can factor in location-based information in determining catalog information to transmit to a user. In one or more implementations in these regards, the recommendation data transmitted to the user can relate to location-based user data, in addition to or instead of products, content, or services. In one or more implementations in these regards, a user can include an individual as well as a merchant or other commercial entity, such as a retail store or corporation. The location of the subject user can be reported to catalog server  via device , for instance via the Global Positioning System (GPS) location capability embedded in a cellular telephone. In one or more implementations, when a user approaches or reaches the vicinity or a retail store, for example, the user can be prompted by a notification on device  that the retail store can be immediately added as a member of the user's designated group(s), if that merchant user is not already part of the user's designated group(s). If the user has already previously added the retail store or other site or entity to their designated group(s), the user can be prompted to view that merchant user's catalog to access coupons, discounts, or other promotions within the catalog. This notification and option for location-sensitive action allows the user to conveniently expand his or her designated group(s) to include, and be notified about, location-based merchant users or services. A location-based discovery feature can furthermore add geographically-based context and real-time relevance to a recommendation to add a merchant user to a user's designated group(s). In one or more implementations, a location-based discovery capability can also be used to notify individual users of their proximity to other individual users.","In terms of the delivery of content streams generated via catalog server , and as for instance illustrated in , according to one or more aspects, a request to access database  by device  and initiate the delivery of content can be made via a content service application programming interface (API) . In one or more aspects, content service application programming interface (API)  can be hosted in client  of device , and serve to invoke various resources available in or accessed via catalog server , using a predetermined set of function calls and\/or other parameters. According to one or more aspects in one regard, because a request to upload transaction data to or receive content streams from catalog server  can be abstracted through the interface of content service application programming interface (API) , device  and its client  need not be aware of all details regarding the configuration of user transaction and other data stored in database . Device  and client  can instead merely request delivery of content via catalog server  which can access a device database  to identify a device type, operator or service identification, and\/or operating parameters necessary to communicate with that device.","In one or more aspects as shown, and purely illustratively, inputs, parameters, and data passed to content service application programming interface (API)  can include, for instance, advertising revenue data , billing data , user information activity , sign on data , consumer billing data , sign on data  (shown being exchanged by or via a Web portal as catalog server  having an associated user group , labeled user group ), etc. In one or more aspects as shown, and also purely illustratively, inputs, parameters, and data passed to content service application programming interface (API)  can likewise include sign on data , billing data , operator billing data , and operator authentication data  (shown being exchanged by or via a base station or other mobile platform, as catalog server , having an associated user group , labeled as user group Z), etc. In one or more aspects, catalog server  and catalog server  can each communicate with resources including, for instance, and associated database  and device database , and\/or other resources. In one or more aspects, two or more catalog servers  and  can also exchange message data  related to catalog activity, between themselves In one or more aspects, content service application programming interface (API)  can include, define, or operate on other inputs, parameters, and data.","According to one or more aspects, and as shown for instance in , the abstraction of content feeds via a content service application programming interface (API)  can permit the cross-platform translation and operator, device and platform-independent delivery of content streams to a set of diverse devices, for instance, devices made by different manufacturers, supported by different carries, services or operators, devices having different display resolutions, different connection bandwidths, and\/or other operating parameters. As shown in , in one or more aspects and purely illustratively, a given service operator  (labeled Operator A), can maintain a group of users and associated device types stored in device database . When a first user (illustratively, user A) uploads transaction data or requests content from a first device  (illustratively, device A) related to a first item (illustratively, item A), the message can be communicated via catalog server  using an associated uniform resource locator (URL, illustratively, URL A) to a first catalog  (illustratively, catalog A) associated with that user, device, and catalog. When a second user (shown as user A) for instance wishes to view or receive data captured by or associated with the first user (user A), or otherwise communicate with the first user or other user, the second user can receive data related to a second item (shown as item A) associated with a second catalog  (shown as catalog A) and delivered to a second device  (shown as device A) via a second URL (shown as URL A). In one or more aspects, the first item (item A) can be recognized as the same as the second item (item A), when an exact match between records in the different catalogs of a given service or operator can be made. In a further aspect as shown, other exchanges of data or feeds can be made between users (e.g., user B having device  and user C having device ) and separate catalogs (e.g., catalog  (shown as catalog B) and catalog  (shown as catalog C) supported by different operators, as long as comparative matches or translations between diverse items, catalogs, search engines, database repositories, or other resources related to capturing and organizing user-generated catalog data can be performed or identified.","More particularly, and as for instance illustratively shown in , in one aspect, a catalog server  within a given operator having multiple user catalogs can perform an item title keyword match between entries in device-specific catalogs, illustratively shown as catalog  (labeled catalog A) and catalog  (labeled catalog A), stored in database  or other data store. Thus, for instance, a user seeking recent transactions containing a keyword term \u201cRacing Game\u201d can receive multiple results from multiple catalogs including various other users and transactions, within or outside their group, which relate to the purchase or rating of that class of product. Similarly, and as for instance shown in , across multiple operators an item title keyword match can be performed across different operator search engines, illustratively shown as search engine  (labeled search engine A) and search engine  (labeled search engine B), and hosted, for instance, in the catalog server for two or more operators or service providers. Thus the catalog server can execute a search against respective catalogs for the keyword term \u201cgolf clubs,\u201d and obtain matching results inside or outside the registered membership group of two or more users.","In one or more further aspects, and as for instance shown in , an item title keyword match can be performed across operator database repositories for two or more operators or service providers, shown as database  (labeled database A) and database  (shown as database C), to locate matches in repository records for matching keyword terms in catalogs, transaction stores, and\/or other data files. Due in certain aspects to the ability to access the user transaction and related data histories across carriers, services, providers and\/or operators as well as the ability to adjust content to device-specific requirements, according to platforms and techniques of the present teachings, the user activity records of diverse users operating diverse devices can be universally and mutually accessed, without a need for users to manually reconfigure for different operators or device types. The accessing of user activity feeds via content service application programming interface (API)  can therefore be transparently performed as a ubiquitous service, rather than a proprietary resource available only within defined operator networks and\/or specific device types.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIGS. 5A and 5B","b":["110","502","504","104","100","506","508","104"]},"In , user activity for the user can be captured via device , from data stores associated with online transaction sites, via manual entry by the user or others, or through other channels, networks, or modes. For instance, if device  is a cellular telephone, transactions conducted via mobile Web or other applications can be captured and transmitted to catalog server , database , or other destination. For further instance, in one or more implementations, a retail store or other point of sale site can sort transactions on a daily or other basis, and transmit records of transactions for users registered to the catalog sharing service of the present teachings to catalog server , database , or other destination. Activity data can be captured using other modes, channels, or techniques. In , a catalog of user activity for the subject user can be generated, for instance as an entry in database . In one or more implementations, user configuration settings for the user's catalog can likewise be received, for instance to set levels of access to be permitted to different aspects of that user's catalog or other data.","In , the user's catalog can be aggregated with the catalogs of the user's designated group(s), and\/or with the entire population of the set of registered users, as desired. In , a distribution of the aggregate catalog or desired portions or components of the aggregate catalog can be initiated, for instance based on user-defined authorization, where appropriate, and the filtering, sorting discovery, or other processing of the aggregate catalog. A user can for example configure his or her personal catalog to be distributed as a whole to their designated group(s), which distribution catalog server  can automatically generate. In one or more aspects, distributions or feeds of user activity can for instance be generated at predetermined times such as fixed intervals, at event-triggered times such as when a participating user conducts or records a transaction, or at other times or based on other conditions. In , an item keyword search can be generated to locate an item within a given catalog of a given operator, and\/or across multiple catalogs, search engines, or repositories of different operators to locate items or activity of interest to a user or their group, as appropriate. In , content parameters for delivery to a recipient device or devices can be configured by accessing device database , for instance to identify a video resolution for the recipient display screen. In , the generated distribution or feed of user activity can be transmitted to the subject user's designated group(s) or other targets, with configuration settings adapted to the receiving device, as appropriate.","In , rewards, earned challenge points, loyalty points, or other value can be generated to assign or transmit to an originating user of feeds or content that produce downstream transaction or other activity, as appropriate. For example, catalog server  can communicate with set of loyalty programs  to determine rewards points or other value associated with downstream purchases initiated by or associated with a user's feeds or other distributed content. In , the cost-per-click or other count or record for feeds, associated links, or other content can be generated for a content\/advertising stream log. In one or more implementations, the content\/advertising stream log of clicks or other activity can be generated via catalog server  and be used to remunerate a carrier, content provider, or other operator or entity participating in shared-catalog environment .","In , the aggregate set of catalogs of user activity can be updated to reflect further user activity by one or more users, newly processed data or content received in database , or other updates or revisions, as appropriate. In , processing can repeat, return to a prior processing point, jump to a further processing point, or end.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["102","602","604","102","606","102","608","102","138","610","136","612","102","102","614","616"]},"According to one or more implementations in further regards, in terms of activity feeds, and as for example illustrated in aspects in , a set of Web sites  or other sources can be configured to generate and present context-sensitive menu  or other lists or menus of available catalogs of user activity and\/or related user feeds, based on registration of the set of Web sites  to database  via catalog server . The user's presence or navigation at a content-enabled or context-sensitive Web site via device  can be detected, for example, by detecting a uniform resource locator (URL) registered to or associated with shared catalog environment . The user navigating to a site within the set of Web sites  can be required to enable catalog sharing once the user has navigated to or accessed that site. The activation of catalog sharing on a participating site can require the user to identify who they are, for example, using their catalog-sharing credentials. Upon activation and identification of the user, the user can receive the set of catalogs of user activity for their designated group(s) related to that Web site in context-sensitive fashion. For instance, a user can be presented with context-sensitive menu  of the purchases of golf clubs or other sporting equipment from a sports merchant site made by members of their designated group(s).","The context-sensitive menu  or other presentation object or widget can give the user the option of exploring details of that activity of those members of their designated group(s), and\/or the option of directly purchasing the same item. In one or more implementations employing Web site-sensing in this manner, device  can be configured with client-side application programming interfaces (APIs) interacting with client  or other resources to detect and activate user feeds and other options on the Web site. Corresponding server-side APIs to permit access to database  and distribution of feeds from catalog server  to device  can also be used. In one or more implementations, upon receiving a context-sensitive feed or other content at a site within set of Web sites , if the user clicks or selects a recommendation by a member of his or her designated group(s), the user can be re-directed to the link associated with the recommendation, such as a checkout page. In one or more implementations, the creators or operators of sites within the set of Web sites  can be allocated a revenue share based on their hosting of the feeds on their site, for example based on a cost per click (CPC), cost per mille (or thousand) impressions (CPM), or other basis. In one or more implementations, the user feed or feeds showing recommendations, ratings, or other activity from other users can be presented in a banner ad on the participating Web site, or in other locations, formats, or media. In one or more implementations, a user-generated feed can be treated as an advertisement, and be tracked on a cost-per-click basis for purposes of compensation or rewards to the originating user or others.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["102","102","702","704","702","718","702","138","702","704","706","708","102","710","708"]},"Processor  can analyze user activity information  received by antenna  and\/or a user interface  of the mobile device  and\/or generate user activity information  or other data for transmission by a transmitter  via a modulator .

For instance, the various illustrative logics, logical blocks, modules, devices, and circuits, including personal computers, cellular telephones, media playback devices, and servers, described in connection with the implementations disclosed herein may be implemented or performed with or using a general purpose processor, a digital signal processor (DSP), an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), a field programmable gate array (FPGA) or other programmable logic device, discrete gate or transistor logic, discrete hardware components, or any combination thereof designed to perform the functions described herein. A general-purpose processor may be a microprocessor, but, in the alternative, the processor may be any conventional processor, controller, microcontroller, or state machine. A processor may also be implemented as a combination of computing devices, e.g., a combination of a DSP and a microprocessor, a plurality of microprocessors, one or more microprocessors in conjunction with a DSP core, or any other such configuration. In one or more exemplary implementations, the functions described may be implemented in hardware, software, firmware, or any combination thereof. If implemented in software, the functions may be stored on or transmitted over as one or more instructions or code on a computer-readable medium. Computer-readable media includes both computer storage media and communication media including any medium that facilitates transfer of a computer program from one place to another. A storage media may be any available media that can be accessed by a computer. By way of example, and not limitation, such computer-readable media can comprise RAM, ROM, EEPROM, CD-ROM or other optical disk storage, magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices, or any other medium that can be used to carry or store desired program code in the form of instructions or data structures and that can be accessed by a computer. Also, any connection is properly termed a computer-readable medium. For example, if the software is transmitted from a website, server, or other remote source using a coaxial cable, fiber optic cable, twisted pair, digital subscriber line (DSL), or wireless technologies such as infrared, radio, and microwave, then the coaxial cable, fiber optic cable, twisted pair, DSL, or wireless technologies such as infrared, radio, and microwave are included in the definition of medium. Disk and disc, as used herein, includes compact disc (CD), laser disc, optical disc, digital versatile disc (DVD), floppy disk, and blu-ray disc where disks usually reproduce data magnetically, while discs reproduce data optically with lasers. Combinations of the above should also be included within the scope of computer-readable media. The steps of a method or algorithm described in connection with the implementations disclosed herein may be embodied directly in hardware, in a software module executed by a processor, or in a combination of the two. A software module may reside in RAM memory, flash memory, ROM memory, EPROM memory, EEPROM memory, registers, a hard disk, a removable disk, a CD-ROM, or any other form of storage medium known in the art. An exemplary storage medium is coupled to the processor, such that the processor can read information from, and write information to, the storage medium. In the alternative, the storage medium may be integral to the processor. The processor and the storage medium may reside in an ASIC. The ASIC may reside in a user terminal. In the alternative, the processor and the storage medium may reside as discrete components in a user terminal.","The techniques described herein may be used for various wireless communication systems such as CDMA, TDMA, FDMA, OFDMA, SC-FDMA and other systems. The terms \u201csystem\u201d and \u201cnetwork\u201d are often used interchangeably. A CDMA system may implement a radio technology such as Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (UTRA), cdma2000, etc. UTRA includes Wideband-CDMA (W-CDMA) and other variants of CDMA. Further, cdma2000 covers IS-2000, IS-95, and IS-856 standards. A TDMA system may implement a radio technology such as Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM). An OFDMA system may implement a radio technology such as Evolved UTRA (E-UTRA), Ultra Mobile Broadband (UMB), IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi), IEEE 802.16 (WiMAX), IEEE 802.20, Flash-OFDM, etc. UTRA and E-UTRA are part of Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS). 3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE) is a release of UMTS that uses E-UTRA, which employs OFDMA on the downlink and SC-FDMA on the uplink. UTRA, E-UTRA, UMTS, LTE, and GSM are described in documents from an organization named \u201c3rd Generation Partnership Project\u201d (3GPP). Additionally, cdma2000 and UMB are described in documents from an organization named \u201c3rd Generation Partnership Project 2\u201d (3GPP2).
