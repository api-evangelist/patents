Field of the Invention","The invention relates to wireless communication technology, and particularly, to a device and a method for performing management and control for a wireless device by using speech.","2. Brief Description of the Prior Art","With the rapid development of pervasive computing, in people's daily life and work there appear various pervasive computing devices, which reduce people's labor and provide new functions. However, this development tends also to bring many problems. For example, different devices may adopt different access and control methods. When new devices appear continually, people have to learn how to operate these devices and how to use the remote controllers of these devices. When the number of devices increases, people will face various control panels or remote controllers and do not know what to do. In addition, sometimes people are required to operate many devices simultaneously, and at this time it is very possible to cause confusion or erroneous operation.","Therefore, most people, particularly disabled persons, wish to control all devices in certain environments in a unified manner by a single control device (such as a kind of remote controller). In addition, people also wish to be capable of controlling various devices anytime and anywhere.","However, in accordance with the methods of the prior art, the requirements described above will increase the complexities of the controlling devices and the controlled devices and reduce their price performance ratio.","In the prior art, there is BLUETOOTH\u2122 wireless technology. BLUETOOTH\u2122 is a wireless technology standard proposed by Erisson, IBM, Intel, Nokia and Toshiba as an original organization in May 1998. In as short as two years since then, over 1800 companies have participated the Special Interested Group (SIG) of the BLUETOOTH\u2122 technology. Those of skill in the wireless communications art are familiar with BLUETOOTH\u2122 wireless technology. Complete information is available on the www sites, under the BLUETOOTH\u2122 name, in both the .com and .org domains. BLUETOOTH\u2122 is a trademark and service mark of Telfonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson Corporation of Stockholm, Sweden.","In particular, BLUETOOTH\u2122 technology is a short distance wireless communication technology which runs using the 2.4 GHz ISM (industrial scientific medical) band. The short distance means that the effective communication distance is about 10-100 meters between BLUETOOTH\u2122 devices, i.e. the effective communication distance is about 10 meters when the maximum transmitting power is 1 mW (0 dBm) and the effective communication distance is about 100 meters when the maximum transmitting power is 100 mW (20 dBm). The basic network structure is a piconet constituted by one master device and at most seven slave devices, and several piconets can constitute a bigger scatternet. BLUETOOTH\u2122 technology uses a time division multiple access (TDMA) scheme, and supports at least one asynchronous data path and at most three synchronous data paths. In summary, by using BLUETOOTH\u2122 technology, various devices can be connected in a wireless manner at low cost, and wireless channels are established between them so as to perform speech communication and data communication.","Furthermore, the natural speech processing technology in the prior art has been capable of recognizing speech as text or transforming text into speech, and thus provides people a simple man-machine interface which controls devices by means of speech.","A main object of the invention is to provide a speech enabled BLUETOOTH\u2122 device management and access platform, hereinafter referred to as simple SBP, by combining BLUETOOTH\u2122 technology with the natural speech processing technology.","Another object of the invention is to provide a method for performing management and control for all BLUETOOTH\u2122 devices in certain environments by a unified speech operation manner.","For realizing the purposes described above, the invention provides a speech enabled BLUETOOTH\u2122 device management and access platform, including:","a BLUETOOTH\u2122 communication module, for establishing radio frequency connections with a remote control device and with a controlled device, and providing data and speech paths, for example, receiving speech commands from the remote control device;","a connection management module, for maintaining network topology based on BLUETOOTH\u2122 communication modules, and providing network security administration and device access control;","a device management module, for discovering a controlled device located in the radio frequency proximity of said platform, and gathering related controlled device data from the discovered controlled device, as well as providing an interface for performing personalizing configuration, for example, naming the device;","a speech processing module, for converting a speech command received by said BLUETOOTH\u2122 communication module into a data command corresponding to the controlled device data gathered by said device management module, or converting a data response from the controlled device into a speech response and providing the speech response to the BLUETOOTH\u2122 communication module; and","a command\/event management module, for generating corresponding instructions based on the data command from said speech processing module, and sending the generated instructions to corresponding modules or the controlled device.","The invention also provides a method of managing and controlling a BLUETOOTH\u2122 device with speech, including the steps of:","establishing radio frequency connections with a remote control device and receiving a speech command from the remote control device;","converting the received speech command into a data command for a respective controlled device;","generating corresponding instructions based on said data command, and sending the generated instructions to the related controlled device.","With the speech enabled BLUETOOTH\u2122 device management and access platform of the invention, the user, at anytime and at anywhere, can perform control and access to all devices in a certain range in a unified speech operation manner, without increasing the complexity of the control device and the controlled device. This will greatly facilitate people's daily life and work.","In particular, the invention has the following advantages:","(1) Since a wireless network is set between a control device and a controlled device, the device connection is simplified.","(2) People need not perform control for the various BLUETOOTH\u2122 devices in certain range with their hands but rather with natural language to improve work efficiency greatly.","(3) People can operate all devices with unified natural language without being required to know the particular operation sequence of the particular device.","(4) People, at anytime and at anywhere, can perform control and access to all BLUETOOTH\u2122 devices located in the radio frequency range of the control device, which facilitates disabled persons particularly.","(5) The costs of the control device and controlled device are not increased significantly. Almost all functions are completed by the platform provided by the invention.","The description of the preferred manners of the embodiments of the invention is made in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","10","11"]},"The remote device  is used as a user interface device and it at least has a speech input capacity. The remote device  receives a user's speech command and transmits it to SBP . Furthermore, the remote device  can also have a speech output capacity, can receive a speech response from SBP , and can broadcast the response to the user.","The controlled device  can be any object which has a BLUETOOTH\u2122 communication capacity, as long as this object is capable of providing some information, executing some actions or managing some resources according to external data commands. The controlled device  receives data commands from SBP , executes predetermined actions, and returns the corresponding responses to SBP . Furthermore, if necessary, the controlled device  can also report some events to SBP  actively.","SBP  functions as a bridge between the remote device  and the controlled device . In particular, SBP  receives the speech command transmitted by the remote device , converts the received speech command into a format which can be recognized by the controlled device  with a speech recognition engine (contained in a speech processing module  in FIG. ), and then sends the command to the controlled device . Furthermore, SBP  can also receive the returned device response from the controlled device , and by means of a text-speech converting engine (contained in the speech processing module  in FIG. ), can convert the received response into a speech format to be transmitted to the remote device .","As shown in , for reducing the complexity of the device so as to lower its cost, both the communication between the remote device  and SBP , and the communication between SBP  and the controlled device , are realized with a piconet in BLUETOOTH\u2122. For this reason, the remote device , the controlled device , and SBP  are provided with respective BLUETOOTH\u2122 communication modules.","The remote device  and SBP  constitute a piconet A, in which the remote device  is used as a master device (for example, referred to as a master device A) in the piconet A and SBP  as a slave device (for example, refered to as a slave device A) in the piconet A. All the connections and data transmissions in the piconet A are started and stopped by the remote device  (i.e. the master device A).","SBP  and the controlled device  constitute a piconet B, in which SBP  is used as a master device (for example, refered to as a master device B) in the piconet B and the controlled device  as a slave device (for example, refereed to as a slave device B) in the piconet B. All the connections and data transmissions in the piconet B are started and stopped by SBP  (i.e. the master device B).","The piconet A and the piconet B constitute a scatternet through SBP . For the detailed illustration related to the piconet and the scatternet, refer to the BLUETOOTH\u2122 specifications, the detailed description of which is omitted here. As noted above, the relevant BLUETOOTH\u2122 wireless standards and specifications are publicly available and such materials are well-known to these skilled in the wireless communications art.","The portion above the dot-dash line in  shows a basic logic structure of the SBP  of FIG. . Reference number  indicates a message dispatching module. Reference number  indicates a device management module. Reference number  indicates a command\/event management module. Reference number  indicates a speech processing module. Reference number  indicates a BLUETOOTH\u2122 communication module. Reference number  indicates a connection management module. Reference number  indicates a GUI\/system configuration management module. Reference number  indicates a database management system. Reference number  indicates an open development environment module. Reference number  indicates a remote device. Reference number  indicates a controlled device.","The BLUETOOTH\u2122 communication module  is used for providing radio frequency connections between SBP  and the remote control device  and radio frequency connections between SBP  and the controlled device .","The communication between the BLUETOOTH\u2122 communication module  and the remote control device  and the communication between the BLUETOOTH\u2122 communication module  and the controlled device  are schematically shown in  by a dash line arrow. These communications are realized with the piconet of BLUETOOTH\u2122 technology, and have been described above in conjunction with FIG. .","The connection management module  is used for providing a reliable and secure point to point connection and maintaining the whole network topology based on BLUETOOTH\u2122 communication modules. Furthermore, the connection management module  also generates and manages a key for the whole system. The key can be used for encrypting the data transmission.","The message dispatching module , in accordance with the message resource, transmits messages or events between related modules within the SBP . In other words, the message dispatching module  is used for establishing a network connection of the messages or events within a platform.","For example, after the BLUETOOTH\u2122 communication module  receives a speech command from the remote device , the message dispatching module  transmits such speech command from the BLUETOOTH\u2122 communication module  to the speech processing module  as a message.","It should be realized that the message dispatching module  is optional, because the respective other modules can be designed to transmit messages to related modules without providing a separate message dispatching module .","The speech processing module , after receiving a speech command, first converts it into text. Then, the text format command is analyzed and interpreted into a series of predetermined format data commands. These data commands are transmitted by the message dispatching module  to the command\/event management module  to be processed further. As described hereafter, the command\/event management module  controls itself according to these data commands, or controls the corresponding controlled device  to execute certain actions. By means of the cooperation of the speech processing module  and other respective modules, the user can control the device which is remote and can not be directly controlled by speech, with oral commands and by using a controller without speech processing function.","In contrast, if a data response from the controlled device  is received by the speech processing module , it will interpret the data response, and transmit the interpreted result to the control device  through the BLUETOOTH\u2122 communication module .","The device management module  is used for automatically discovering various devices and services, in accord with the BLUETOOTH\u2122 specification, within radio frequency range. All the collected information will be transmitted to the database management system  so as to be maintained and stored. Another task of the device management module  is to provide a tool which sets personally the BLUETOOTH\u2122 devices. That is, with the device management module , the user, according to his\/her own preference, can set a unique identifier for every device. Therefore, the user can organize all the devices according to the convenience of his\/her actual life or work style.","The personalizing setting described above is important to the speech processing. For example, the user can control the lamp located in the bedroom with oral commands \u201cturning on\u201d or \u201cturning on the lamp located in the bedroom\u201d. However, the lamp can not provide on its own the additional information such as \u201clocated in the bedroom\u201d. Therefore, these kinds of problems can be solved by the device management module .","The command\/event management module , as a core of SBP , receives messages or events from other modules in the platform, and manages all the actions of SBP  based on the received message or events. The inputs of the command\/event management module  may be the data commands from the speech processing module , the events from any other modules, the responses from the controlled device , etc.","The database management system  provides support for storing, maintaining and accessing batch data. During operation, SBP  will produce a quantity of different databases, such as the device information database, the system recording database, the user configuration database, etc. All the databases can be accessed by many modules in the platform simultaneously.","The GUI\/system configuration management module  provides the user with a graphic interface for operation of SBP . With the GUI\/system configuration management module , the user can set the platform properly.","The GUI\/system configuration management module  acquires the stored data from the database management system , and displays it on a monitor properly (such as in a graphic manner). For example, the physical structure or logic structure of the network constituted by each device, the real time state, etc., may be displayed. The user can set or modify the system configurations according to the display on the monitor.","The open development environment module  provides third party programming persons with a chance for extending the function of SBP , so as to allow the platform of the invention to be adapted to various environments. The open development environment module  not only provides an API (Application Programming Interface) for accessing the necessary parts in the platform or runtime events, but also provides a management system for the third party extension. Therefore, SBP  of the invention is not only an application platform, but also an open development platform.","The modules shown in the dash line box in  are the necessary modules of the invention, which include the device management module , command\/event management module , the speech processing module , the BLUETOOTH\u2122 communication module  and connection management module . The other modules are optional, or may be integrated into other modules.","As described above, the invention combines BLUETOOTH\u2122 technology with the speech processing technology. BLUETOOTH\u2122 technology not only provides data paths between devices, but also provides synchronous audio paths. The audio paths can carry speech at a rate of 64 Kbps, and the transmission of the speech is not interrupted. This means that the speech commands given orally by the user are transmitted from the remote device  to SBP  for further processing. At the same time, the speech response of the controlled device  can be transmitted from platform  to the remote device , and the remote device broadcasts the speech response to the user.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0062"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["10","100","10","100","10","100","2","100"]},"As shown by the short dash line arrow in , after a microphone receives a speech command given orally by a user, the speech command is encoded by the speech CODEC, and then, the speech command (after being encoded) is transmitted by the BLUETOOTH\u2122 communication module to the BLUETOOTH\u2122 communication module (i.e. as shown by the reference number  in ) in SPB . After the BLUETOOTH\u2122 communication module in SPB  receives the speech command transmitted by the remote device, the speech command is decoded by the speech CODEC, and then the speech command (after being decoded) is transmitted to the message dispatching module (i.e. as shown by the reference number  in FIG. ). The message dispatching module dispatches the speech command to the speech processing module (i.e. as shown by the reference number  in ) for further processing.","In contrast, as shown by the long dash line arrow in , after the BLUETOOTH\u2122 communication module in SPB  receives a data response from the controlled device (i.e. as shown by the reference number  in FIG. ), the data response is transferred to the message dispatching module. The message dispatching module then dispatches the data response to the speech processing module. The speech processing module makes a text-speech conversion on the data response to obtain the speech response. Then, the speech processing module transfers the speech response to the message dispatching module, which dispatches the speech response to the BLUETOOTH\u2122 communication module. Before the speech response reaches the BLUETOOTH\u2122 communication module, the speech response is encoded by the speech CODEC. Finally, the BLUETOOTH\u2122 communication module dispatches the speech response (after being encoded) to the remote device . After a BLUETOOTH\u2122 communication module in the remote device  receives the speech response from SBP , the speech response is decoded by the speech CODEC, and then the speaker broadcasts the speech response (after being decoded) to the user.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0065"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["4","8","8"]},"The data commands generated by the speech processing module  are transferred to the command\/event management module , which generates related instructions according to the received data commands.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0067"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},"After the command\/event management module  receives the data commands from the speech processing module , a series of data commands will be generated to dispatch respective parts in SBP  so as to realize the user's oral command.","For example, if the user's oral command is \u201copen the door\u201d, the command\/event management module generates the following commands:","(1) an instruction to the BLUETOOTH\u2122 communication module : sending the corresponding instruction to the corresponding door, in such case, the sent instruction being \u201copen the door\u201d;","(2) an instruction to the connection management module : establishing a BLUETOOTH\u2122 connection between the door and SBP ;","(3) an instruction to the database management system : establishing a record term; and","(4) an instruction to the controlled device , in such case, being the instruction to \u201copen the door\u201d.","The former three instructions correspond to the related modules in SBP , and are represented by a short dash line arrow in FIG. .
