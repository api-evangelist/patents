Field of Invention","This invention relates to systems and methods for authoring a media presentation.","2. Description of Related Art","Tools used to author media presentations are available in the commercial marketplace. One popular tool available for authoring a media presentation is PowerPoint by Microsoft. PowerPoint organizes presentations by a sequence of slides, and supports text editing, figure drawing, audio and video embedding, and slide animation. Furthermore, Microsoft Producer enables a synchronization of sequence of PowerPoint slides with audiovisual streams and images to produce an on-demand media presentation. Competitors of Microsoft, including Apple, Macromedia, and Impact Engine, also market similar products. Some other commercially available media presentation products embed related media presentation links in a video stream. Examples of companies marketing such products include Digital Design Works and VideoClix.","A variety of theater automation software interfaces are also available in the commercial marketplace. An example of a theater automation software interface currently available in the commercial marketplace is Batalpha's Figaro software.","Many media presentation authoring products in the commercial marketplace are developed based on a model that supports only one two-dimensional display and only one audio loud speaker. This assumption is a significant limitation when an environment has more than one two-dimensional display, more than one loudspeaker, or controllable devices other than displays and speakers. Thus, these media presentation authoring products in the commercial marketplace are inadequate for authoring media presentations in a media-device distributed environment.","Many existing presentation authoring tools are unable to recognize various device locations and make use of that information. Thus, they cannot efficiently use multiple presentation channels, such as multiple displays and loudspeakers. The main drawback of many media presentation authoring products in the commercial marketplace is that they are either unable to support media presentation authoring based on locations of multimedia devices or unable to coordinate the use of multiple presentation devices, such as lights, multiple displays, multiple loudspeakers, a printer, a sprinkler, a fan, or other sort of articulators.","Even though Batalpha's Figaro Software has the ability to assist theater customization, they do not provide users GUIs depicting a presentation environment with hot-spots for referring to presentation devices in that environment. These kinds of software are good for professionals, who are very familiar with their working environments, to create complex motion sequences. However, they are not suitable for an ordinary user who is not familiar with a presentation environment.","As multimedia devices become more affordable, more devices will be installed in media presentation environment. Thus, it is beneficial when presentation authoring tools support presentation customization for various media-device distributed environments.","Most commercially available media presentation authoring products require a user to prepare each media presentation based on a conservative one-display-and-one-loudspeaker model. Therefore, outputs for various media devices have to be separately prepared.","Some media presentation products require users using specific equipment, such as a specific pointer or touch screen, to move slides from display to display. Most media presentation authoring products do not have a model of a media presentation environment. Furthermore, most commercially available media presentation authoring products do not support moving slides from one device to another. Most commercially available media presentation authoring products are unable to customize presentations for various components within a specific media presentation environment.","Most commercially available media presentation authoring products cannot support the volume control of a loud speaker, or a loud speaker's on\/off function, or the magnitude of a light, or a light's on\/off function. Likewise, some media presentation authoring products, such as ModSlideShow, require a media presentation presenter to remember every aspect of the entire presentation well in order to effectively relocate any component of the presentation while the presentation is in progress.","For at least the foregoing reasons, most commercially available media presentation authoring products are ill suited for a typical user to customize a presentation that uses many media devices in an unfamiliar environment.","This invention provides systems and methods for authoring a media presentation that efficiently use multiple devices.","This invention separably provides systems and methods for authoring a media presentation that is well suited for a user that is less than thoroughly familiar with a given media presentation.","This invention separably provides systems and methods for authoring a media presentation that includes a plurality of image screens.","This invention separably provides systems and methods for authoring a media presentation that considers the location of a loud speaker.","This invention separably provides systems and methods for authoring a media presentation that controls a plurality of loud speakers.","This invention separably provides systems and methods for authoring a media presentation that controls whether a loud speaker is on or off.","This invention separably provides systems and methods for authoring a media presentation that controls a light.","This invention separably provides systems and methods for authoring a media presentation that controls the magnitude of a light.","This invention separably provides systems and methods for authoring a media presentation that controls whether a light is on or off.","This invention separably provides systems and methods for authoring a media presentation that includes a model of the presentation environment.","This invention separably provides systems and methods for authoring media presentations wherein two or more representations of a media presentation environment are different.","This invention separably provides systems and methods for authoring a media presentation including a representation of each element of the media presentation.","This invention separably provides systems and methods for authoring a media presentation wherein any element of the presentation can be relocated within the presentation through the use of a graphical user interface.","This invention separably provides systems and methods for authoring a media presentation wherein a representation of the presentation environment is alterable.","This invention separably provides systems and methods for authoring a media presentation that provides a user with a reference to a plurality of available media presentation devices.","This invention separably provides systems and methods for authoring a media presentation wherein a representation of an available media device is an image within a model of the presentation environment.","This invention separably provides systems and methods for authoring a media presentation wherein a user selects a media device by actuating an image or model of the device.","This invention separably provides systems and methods for authoring a media presentation wherein a user is able to customize the output of a selected media device.","This invention separably provides systems and methods for authoring a media presentation wherein every media device available in the presentation environment is controlled.","This invention separably provides systems and methods for authoring a media presentation wherein alterations are available to accommodate newly developed media devices and advances in existing media devices.","This invention separably provides systems and methods for authoring a media presentation wherein a user is provided with a graphical user interface depicting a presentation environment with hot-spots that refer to presentation devices in the presentation environment.","This invention separably provides systems and methods for authoring a media presentation that manage output sequences corresponding to a plurality of output devices, thus creating a media presentation sequence for each of a plurality of media presentation devices and synchronizing all of the media presentation sequences during a playback or preview of the media presentation.","This invention separably provides systems and methods for authoring a media presentation that manage a multiple channel media presentation.","Various exemplary embodiments of the systems and methods for authoring a media presentation according to this invention include a media presentation environment representation having a hot spot associated with a particular media presentation device.","Various exemplary embodiments of the systems and methods for authoring a media presentation according to this invention include a media presentation
