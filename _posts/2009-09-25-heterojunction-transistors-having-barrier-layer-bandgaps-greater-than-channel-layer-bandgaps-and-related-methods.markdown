No. 11\/357,752 filed Feb. 17, 2006 now U.S. Pat. No. 7,612,390, which claims the benefit of priority as a continuation-in-part application of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/772,882 filed Feb. 5, 2004 now U.S. Pat. No. 7,170,111. The disclosures of both of the above referenced applications are hereby incorporated herein in their entirety by reference.","This invention was made with Government support under Contract Nos. N00014-02-C-0306 and FA8650-04-C-7146 awarded by the Office Of Naval Research (ONR) and the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL). The Government has certain rights in this invention.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to high frequency transistors and in particular relates to microwave field effect transistors (FETs) that incorporate nitride-based active layers.","2. Description of the Related Art","The present invention relates to transistors formed of nitride semiconductor materials that can make them suitable for high power, high temperature, and\/or high frequency applications. Materials such as silicon (Si) and gallium arsenide (GaAs) have found wide application in semiconductor devices for lower power and (in the case of Si) lower frequency applications. These more common semiconductor materials may not be well suited for higher power and\/or high frequency applications, however, because of their relatively small bandgaps (e.g., 1.12 eV for Si and 1.42 for GaAs at room temperature) and\/or relatively small breakdown voltages.","GaAs based HEMTs have become the standard for signal amplification in civil and military radar, handset cellular, and satellite communications. GaAs has a higher electron mobility (approximately 6000 cm\/V-s) and a lower source resistance than Si, which may allow GaAs based devices to function at higher frequencies. However, GaAs has a relatively small bandgap (1.42 eV at room temperature) and relatively small breakdown voltage, which may prevent GaAs based HEMTs from providing high power at high frequencies.","In light of the difficulties presented by Si and GaAs, interest in high power, high temperature and\/or high frequency applications and devices has turned to wide bandgap semiconductor materials such as silicon carbide (2.996 eV for alpha SiC at room temperature) and the Group III nitrides (e.g., 3.36 eV for GaN at room temperature). These materials typically have higher electric field breakdown strengths and higher electron saturation velocities as compared to gallium arsenide and silicon.","A device of particular interest for high power and\/or high frequency applications is the high electron mobility transistor (HEMT), which is also known as a modulation doped field effect transistor (MODFET) or a Heterostructure Field Effect Transistor (HFET). These devices may offer operational advantages under a number of circumstances. They are typically characterized by the presence of a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) formed at the heterojunction of two semiconductor materials with different bandgap energies, where the smaller bandgap material has a higher electron affinity compared to the larger bandgap material. The 2DEG, which forms due to the presence of an accumulation layer in the smaller bandgap material, can contain a very high sheet electron concentration in excess of, for example, 10carriers\/cmeven though the material is nominally undoped. Additionally, electrons that originate in the wider-bandgap semiconductor transfer to the 2DEG, allowing a high electron mobility due to reduced ionized impurity scattering.","This combination of high carrier concentration and high carrier mobility can give the HEMT a very large transconductance and may provide a performance advantage over metal-semiconductor field effect transistors (MESFETs) for high-frequency applications, although MESFETs continue to be suitable for certain applications based on factors such as cost and reliability.","High electron mobility transistors fabricated in the gallium nitride (GaN) material system have the potential to generate large amounts of RF power because of the combination of material characteristics that includes the aforementioned high breakdown fields, their wide bandgaps, large conduction band offset, and\/or high saturated electron drift velocity. In addition, polarization of GaN-based materials contributes to the accumulation of carriers in the 2DEG region.","GaN-based HEMTs have already been demonstrated. U.S. Pat. No. 6,316,793, to Sheppard et al., which is commonly assigned and is incorporated herein by reference, describes a HEMT device having a semi-insulating silicon carbide substrate, an aluminum nitride buffer layer on the substrate, an insulating gallium nitride layer on the buffer layer, an aluminum gallium nitride barrier layer on the gallium nitride layer, and a passivation layer on the aluminum gallium nitride active structure.","Improvements in the manufacturing of GaN semiconductor materials have focused interest on the development of GaN HEMTs for high frequency, high temperature and high power applications. GaN-based materials have large bandgaps, and high peak and saturation electron velocity values [B. Belmont, K. Kim and M. Shur, J. Appl. Phys. 74, 1818 (1993)]. GaN HEMTs can also have 2DEG sheet densities in excess of 10\/cmand relatively high electron mobility (up to 2000 cm\/V-s) [R. Gaska, J. W. Yang, A. Osinsky, Q. Chen, M. A. Khan, A. O. Orlov, G. L. Snider and M. S. Shur, Appl. Phys. Lett., 72, 707 (1998)]. These characteristics may allow GaN HEMTs to provide high power at higher frequencies.","A conventional GaN HEMT structure  is illustrated in . A channel layer  is formed on buffer layer  on a substrate . A barrier layer  is formed on the channel layer . A source electrode  and a drain electrode  form ohmic contacts through the surface of the barrier layer  to the electron layer that is present at the top of the channel layer . A gate electrode  forms a non-ohmic contact to the surface of the barrier layer .","Typically, the channel layer  includes GaN while barrier layer  includes AlGaN. Because of the presence of aluminum in the crystal lattice, AlGaN has a wider bandgap than GaN. Thus, the interface between a GaN channel layer  and an AlGaN barrier layer  forms a heterostructure or heterojunction where energy bands are deformed due to, for example, Fermi level alignment and polarization in the material.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":["FIG. 15","FIG. 14","FIG. 14","FIG. 15"],"b":["116","114","114","114","116","115","114","116","116","122"],"sub":"c "},"In addition, in a nitride-based device, the conduction and valence bands in the barrier layer  are further distorted due to polarization effects. This very important property of the heterostructures in the III-Nitride system may be essential for the high performance of the GaN HEMT. In addition to the accumulation of electrons due to the bandgap differential and band offset between the barrier and channel layers, the total number of free electrons is enhanced greatly by pseudomorphic strain in the barrier layer relative to the channel. Due to localized piezoelectric effects, the strain causes an enhanced electric field and a higher electron concentration than would, typically, be possible were the strain not present.","Electrons in the 2DEG sheet charge region  demonstrate high carrier mobility. Moreover, because the sheet charge region is extremely thin, the carriers are subject to reduced impurity scattering that may improve the device's noise characteristics.","The source to drain conductivity of this device structure is modulated by applying a voltage to the gate electrode . When a reverse voltage is applied, the conduction band beneath the gate is elevated, with the result that the conduction band Ein the vicinity of the sheet charge region  becomes elevated above the Fermi level, and a portion of the sheet charge region  is depleted of carriers, thereby preventing or reducing the flow of current from source  to drain .","By forming the barrier layer  from AlN, certain advantages can be achieved. The 2.4% lattice mismatch between AlN (AlGaN for y=1) and GaN results in an increased and even maximum possible piezoelectric charge at the interface between the two layers. Using an AlN barrier layer also reduces the piezoelectric scattering between the layers that can limit the 2DEG mobility.","However, the high lattice mismatch between AlN and GaN dictates that the thickness of the AlN layer should be less than 50 \u212b. If the layer is thicker, the device can experience problems with its ohmic contacts, the material quality in the layer begins to degrade, the device's reliability decreases, and the material is more difficult to grow. However, a HEMT with a 50 \u212b or less AlN layer may be susceptible to high gate leakage.","Although GaN-based HEMTs have demonstrated exceptional power densities, a number of technical challenges still remain to be overcome before the devices can achieve commercial success. For example, one problem that may limit the performance and lifetime of certain GaN-based HEMTs is free carrier trapping, which may occur when carriers migrate away from the 2DEG region and become trapped in a surface dielectric region or in a buffer region beneath the channel. Such trapping may result in degradation in performance and\/or reliability of a device.","Some attempts have been made to improve confinement of carriers within a HEMT channel by providing a second heterojunction below the channel\u2014a so-called Double Heterostructure HEMT or DH-HEMT. However, in general, the amount of confinement due to the heterobarrier (which is a function of the difference in electron affinity between a wide-bandgap layer and the narrower-bandgap channel) may not be sufficiently large to result in effective confinement. Moreover, in a highly polarized material such as c-plane GaN, the polarization charges present in the material may reduce the confinement effect of the heterobarrier. Thus, in nitride-based transistor devices, the mere presence of a heterojunction alone below the channel may not be sufficient to effectively prevent carriers from migrating away from the 2DEG region into the buffer region where they can become trapped. Moreover, the structure of a DH-HEMT provides no additional barrier against surface trapping effects.","Another problem associated with the transit of carriers away from the channel region is linearity. When carriers are not confined to the channel, the ability to control their action via the applied gate voltage may be reduced, resulting in undesirable nonlinear transconductance characteristics.","The problems associated with free carrier trapping may also affect the performance of other types of nitride field effect transistors, such as GaN-based MESFETs.","According to some embodiments of the present invention, a heterojunction transistor may include a channel layer comprising a Group III nitride, a barrier layer comprising a Group III nitride on the channel layer, and an energy barrier comprising a layer of a Group III nitride including indium on the channel layer. The barrier layer may have a bandgap greater than a bandgap of the channel layer, and the channel layer may be between the barrier layer and the energy barrier. In addition, a concentration of indium (In) in the energy barrier may be greater than a concentration of indium (In) in the channel layer.","More particularly, the channel layer and the barrier layer may cooperatively induce a two-dimensional electron gas at an interface between the channel layer and the barrier layer. For example, the energy barrier may include a layer of InGaN (0<x#1), and more particularly, a layer of InGaN (0<x<1). A mole fraction of InN (indium nitride) in an InN\/GaN alloy of the energy barrier may be at least about 1%. For example, a mole fraction of InN (indium nitride) in an InN\/GaN alloy of the energy barrier may be in the range of about 1% to about 50%, and more particularly in the range of about 4% to about 16%.","The energy barrier may oppose movement of carriers away from the channel layer, and\/or the energy barrier may include a quantum well. Moreover, the energy barrier may have a thickness in the range of about 1 Angstrom to about 200 Angstroms, and more particularly, in the range of about 1 Angstrom to about 100 Angstroms.","The heterojunction transistor may also include source, drain, and gate contacts on the barrier layer such that the barrier layer is between the channel layer and the source, drain, and gate contacts, and a substrate on the energy barrier such that the energy barrier is between the substrate and the channel layer. The barrier layer may have a thickness in the range of about 0.1 nm to about 10 nm. The barrier layer and the energy barrier may be separated by a distance in the range of about 5 nm to about 30 nm, and more particularly in the range of about 5 nm to about 20 nm. In addition, the channel layer may include a layer of AlGaN (0#y<1), the barrier layer may include a layer of AlGaN (0<z#1), and y and z may be different.","Moreover, the heterojunction transistor may include a cap layer including a Group III nitride on the barrier layer such that the barrier layer is between the cap layer and the channel layer. A concentration of Ga in the cap layer may be greater than a concentration of Ga in the barrier layer. A concentration of Al in the barrier layer may be greater than a concentration of Al in the channel layer.","According to some additional embodiments of the present invention, a method of forming a heterojunction transistor may include forming an energy barrier comprising a layer of a Group III nitride including indium, forming a channel layer comprising a Group III nitride on the energy barrier, and forming a barrier layer comprising a Group III nitride on the channel layer so that the channel layer is between barrier layer and the energy barrier. A concentration of indium (In) in the energy barrier may be greater than a concentration of indium (In) in the channel layer, and the barrier layer may have a bandgap greater than a bandgap of the channel layer.","The channel layer and the barrier layer may cooperatively induce a two-dimensional electron gas at an interface between the channel layer and the barrier layer. For example, the energy barrier may include a layer of InGaN (0<x#1), and more particularly, a layer of InGaN (0<x<1). A mole fraction of InN (indium nitride) in an InN\/GaN alloy of the energy barrier may be at least about 1%. More particularly, a mole fraction of InN (indium nitride) in an InN\/GaN alloy of the energy barrier may be in the range of about 1% to about 50%, and more particularly, in the range of about 4% to about 16%. The energy barrier may oppose movement of carriers away from the channel layer, and\/or the energy barrier may include a quantum well. Moreover, the energy barrier may have a thickness in the range of about 1 Angstrom to about 200 Angstrom, and more particularly, in the range of about 1 Angstrom to about 100 Angstroms.","Forming the energy barrier may include forming the energy barrier on a substrate. In addition, source, drain, and gate contacts may be fanned on the barrier layer after &liming the barrier layer. For example, the channel layer may include a layer of AlGaN (0\u2266y<1), the barrier layer include a layer of AlGaN (0<z\u22661), and y and z may be different. After forming the barrier layer, a cap layer comprising a Group III nitride may be formed on the barrier layer, and a concentration of Ga in the cap layer may be greater than a concentration of Ga in the barrier layer. Moreover, a concentration of Al in the barrier layer may be greater than a concentration of Al in the channel layer.","Forming the channel layer may include forming a first portion of the channel layer on the energy barrier at a first temperature. After forming the first portion of the channel layer, a second portion of the channel layer may be formed at a second temperature on the first portion of the channel layer wherein the first temperature is less than the second temperature. The first temperature, for example, may be at least about 100 degrees C. less than the second temperature. In addition, the first and second portions of the channel layer may each comprise GaN.","According to some more embodiments of the present invention, a heterojunction transistor may include a channel layer, a barrier layer on the channel layer, and an energy barrier on the channel layer such that the channel layer is between the barrier layer and the energy barrier. The barrier layer and the channel layer may cooperatively induce a two-dimensional electron gas at an interface between the channel layer and the barrier layer, and the energy barrier may oppose movement of carriers away from the channel layer.","The energy barrier may include a quantum well. The channel layer may include a first layer of a Group III nitride, the barrier layer may include a second layer of a Group III nitride, and the energy barrier may include a third layer of a Group III nitride. The energy barrier, for example, may include a layer of InGaN (0<x\u22661), and more particularly, the energy barrier may include a layer of InGaN (0<x<1). A mole fraction of InN (indium nitride) in an InN\/GaN alloy of the energy barrier may be at least about 1%, and more particularly, in the range of about 1% to about 50%, and more particularly, in the range of about 4% to about 16%. Moreover, the energy barrier may have a thickness in the range of about 1 Angstrom to about 200 Angstroms, and more particularly, in the range of about 1 Angstrom to about 100 Angstroms.","The heterojunction transistor may also include source, drain, and gate contacts on the barrier layer such that the barrier layer is between the channel layer and the source, drain, and gate contacts, and the heterojunction transistor may also include a substrate on the energy barrier such that the energy barrier is between the substrate and the channel layer. The channel layer may include a Group III nitride, the barrier layer may include a Group III nitride, and the barrier layer may have a bandgap greater than a bandgap of the channel layer. The channel layer may include a layer of AlGaN (0\u2266y<1), the barrier layer may include a layer of AlGaN (0<z\u22661), and y and z may be different.","In addition, a cap layer including a Group III nitride may be provided on the barrier layer such that the barrier layer is between the cap layer and the channel layer, and a concentration of Ga in the cap layer may be greater than a concentration of Ga in the barrier layer. Moreover, the barrier layer may include a Group III nitride and the channel layer may include a Group III nitride, and a concentration of Al in the barrier layer may be greater than a concentration of Al in the channel layer.","The present invention will now be described more fully with reference to the accompanying drawings in which some embodiments of the invention are shown. This invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein. Rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout.","Furthermore, the various layers and regions illustrated in the figures are illustrated schematically. Accordingly, the present invention is not limited to the relative size and spacing illustrated in the accompanying figures. As will also be appreciated by those of skill in the art, references herein to a layer formed \u201con\u201d a substrate or other layer may refer to the layer formed directly on the substrate or other layer or on an intervening layer or layers formed on the substrate or other layer. As used herein the term \u201cand\/or\u201d includes any and all combinations of one or more of the associated listed items.","It will be understood that although the terms first, second, etc. may be used herein to describe various regions, layers, and\/or sections, these regions, layers, and\/or sections should not be limited by these terms. These terms are only used to distinguish one region, layer, or section from another region, layer, or section. Thus, a first region, layer, or section discussed below could be termed a second region, layer, or section, and similarly, a second without departing from the teachings of the present invention.","As discussed above, confinement of carriers in the channel is an important concern in the design of a nitride-based field effect transistor. Embodiments of the present invention may provide enhanced confinement of carriers through the inclusion of a high-field region on one or both sides of a channel. The electric field in the high field region may be generated by the transfer of charge between an electron source region and a hole source region. The electric field in the high field region is directed away from the channel. Thus, the electric field opposes the movement of negatively charged electrons away from the channel. (In general, the direction of an electric field is defined by the direction of electric force acting on a positively charged particle.)","As used herein, the term \u201cGroup III nitride\u201d refers to those semiconducting compounds formed between nitrogen and the elements in Group III of the periodic table, usually aluminum (Al), gallium (Ga), and\/or indium (In). The term also refers to ternary and quaternary compounds such as AlGaN and AlInGaN. As is well understood by those in this art, the Group III elements can combine with nitrogen to form binary (e.g., GaN), ternary (e.g., AlGaN, AlInN), and quaternary (e.g., AlInGaN) compounds. These compounds all have empirical formulas in which one mole of nitrogen is combined with a total of one mole of the Group III elements. Accordingly, formulas such as AlGaN where 0\u2266x\u22661 are often used to describe them. For brevity, when the term AlInGaN is used herein without specification of relative percentages for the Group III elements (Al, In and Ga), it will be understood to refer to a compound of the general formula InAlGaN where x+y+z=1, 0\u2266x\u22661, 0\u2266y\u22661, and 0\u2266z\u22661. Thus, as used herein, the term InAlGaN may refer to GaN, InN, AlN, AlGaN, AlInN, InGaN and\/or AlInGaN unless otherwise specified or limited. Accordingly, the terms \u201cInAlGaN\u201d, \u201cGroup III-nitride material\u201d and \u201cnitride-based material\u201d are used interchangeably throughout this specification.","Embodiments of the present invention are schematically illustrated as a high electron mobility transistor (HEMT)  in the cross-sectional view of . The transistor  includes a substrate  that may be, for example, semi-insulating silicon carbide (SiC) of the 4H polytype. Other silicon carbide candidate polytypes including the 2H, 3C, 6H, and 15R polytypes may be utilized. The term \u201csemi-insulating\u201d is used descriptively in a relative sense rather than in an absolute sense. In particular embodiments of the present invention, the silicon carbide bulk crystal may have a resistivity equal to or higher than about 1\u00d710\u03a9-cm at room temperature.","A buffer layer  on the substrate  provides an appropriate crystalline transition between the substrate  and the remainder of the device. Buffer layer  may include one or more layers of InAlGaN. In particular embodiments, buffer layer  may include AlN or AlGaN. Silicon carbide has a much closer crystal lattice match to Group III nitrides than does sapphire (AlO), which is a very common substrate material for Group III nitride devices. The closer lattice match may result in Group III nitride films of higher quality than those generally available on sapphire. Silicon carbide also has a very high thermal conductivity so that the total output power of Group III nitride devices on silicon carbide is, typically, not as limited by thermal dissipation of the substrate as in the case of the same devices formed on sapphire. Also, the availability of semi-insulating silicon carbide substrates may provide for device isolation and reduced parasitic capacitance.","Although silicon carbide is the preferred substrate material, embodiments of the present invention may utilize any suitable substrate, such as sapphire, aluminum nitride, aluminum gallium nitride, gallium nitride, silicon, GaAs, LGO, ZnO, LAO, InP and the like. In some embodiments, an appropriate buffer layer also may be formed.","Suitable SiC substrates are manufactured by, for example, Cree, Inc., of Durham, N.C., the assignee of the present invention, and the methods for producing are described, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. Re. 34,861; 4,946,547; 5,200,022; and 6,218,680, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. Similarly, techniques for epitaxial growth of Group III nitrides have been described in, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,210,051; 5,393,993; 5,523,589; and 5,592,501, the contents of which are also incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.","Particular structures for GaN-based HEMTs are described, for example, in commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 6,316,793 and U.S. application Ser.

Embodiments of the present invention may be incorporated into such structures and, therefore, should not be construed as limited to the particular structures described in detail herein.","Returning again to , a transistor  includes a channel layer . In some embodiments of the present invention, the channel layer  includes InAlGaN. In particular embodiments, the channel layer  includes AlGaN (0\u2266x\u22661). In some embodiments of the present invention, the channel layer  includes GaN. The channel layer  may be undoped and may be grown to a thickness of between about 50 and about 500 \u212b. Thus, the channel layer  may be thinner than channel layers in conventional GaN HEMT devices, which are typically greater than 500 \u212b in thickness. In some of the embodiments described above, it may be desirable for the semiconductor crystal structure to be oriented in a Ga-polar (or Group III polar) orientation to enhance the effect of the piezoelectric quality of the material. However, many of the embodiments, including the embodiment of , may be formed using N-polar or non-polar material without departing from the scope of the invention.","A barrier layer  is provided on the channel layer . The barrier layer  may be a Group III-nitride having a bandgap larger than that of the channel layer . Accordingly, the barrier layer  may be AlGaN, AlInGaN, AlInN and\/or AlN. The barrier layer  may be at least about 10 nm thick, but is not so thick as to cause cracking or defect formation therein. Moreover, the barrier layer  should be thin enough that it is completely depleted under equilibrium conditions.","Preferably, the barrier layer  is undoped or doped with activated donor atoms at a concentration of less than about 10cm. In some embodiments, the barrier layer  may be delta-doped at a concentration of up to about 10cmat a distance of about 100 \u212b (Angstroms) from the interface between barrier layer  and channel layer . In some embodiments of the invention, the barrier layer  includes AlGaN where 0<x\u22661. In certain embodiments of the present invention, the barrier layer  includes AlGaN with an aluminum concentration of between about 5% and about 100%. In specific embodiments of the present invention, the aluminum concentration is greater than about 10%. The barrier layer  has a bandgap greater than that of the channel layer .","The barrier layer may also be provided with multiple layers as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/102,272, to Smorchkova et al., entitled \u201cGROUP-III NITRIDE BASED HIGH ELECTRON MOBILITY TRANSISTOR (HEMT) WITH BARRIER\/SPACER LAYER\u201d and U.S. Pat. No. 6,316,793 entitled \u201cNitride Based Transistors on Semi-Insulating Silicon Carbide Substrates with Passivation Layer\u201d issued Nov. 13, 2001, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference as if set forth fully herein. Thus, embodiments of the present invention should not be construed as limiting the barrier layer to a single layer but may include, for example, barrier layers having combinations of InAlGaN layers having various material compositions. For example, a GaN\/AlN structure may be utilized to reduce or prevent alloy scattering.","An optional InAlGaN contact layer or cap layer (not shown) may be provided on the barrier layer  to facilitate the formation of contacts of the transistor . An example of such a cap layer is disclosed in U.S. application Ser. No. 09\/904,333 filed Jul. 12, 2001 for \u201cALUMINUM GALLIUM NITRIDE\/GALLIUM NITRIDE HIGH ELECTRON MOBILITY TRANSISTORS HAVING A GATE CONTACT ON A GALLIUM NITRIDE BASED CAP SEGMENT AND METHODS OF FABRICATING SAME,\u201d which is referenced above. In addition, there may be a compositionally graded transition layer (not shown) between the barrier layer  and the contact or cap layer. The source contact , the drain contact  and the gate contact  may be fabricated as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,316,793.","As discussed above, a 2DEG sheet charge region  is induced at the interface between channel layer  and barrier layer . In order to reduce the movement of carriers away from the channel layer , a region  having a high electric field is provided between the channel layer  and the buffer layer . In some embodiments, the high field is generated by charge transfer between an electron source layer  and a hole source layer  which are spaced apart by a distance \u201cd\u201d which defines the thickness of the high field region .","In some embodiments, including the embodiment illustrated in , the electron source layer  may include a thin layer of a Group III-nitride material such as AlGaN (0\u2266x\u22661) that is highly doped with donor (n-type) dopants, while the hole source layer  may include a thin layer of a Group III-nitride material such as AlGaN (0\u2266x\u22661) that is highly doped with acceptor (p-type) dopants. The electron source layer  and the hole source layer  are spaced apart by a distance \u201cd\u201d that defines a high field region  therebetween. When the electron source layer  and the hole source layer  are formed, charge transfer between the layers occurs to cause the Fermi levels of the layers to align (i.e. to ensure that under equilibrium conditions, the average electron energy is the same throughout the structure). This charge transfer causes a depletion region to form between the electron source region and the hole source region. The charge transfer may fully deplete the electron source region and\/or the hole source region. The depletion region is characterized by a high electric field directed away from the channel layer . The magnitude of the induced electric field is proportional to the doping levels in the electron source layer and the hole source layer. A built-in potential is developed between the electron source layer and the hole source layer that is proportional to the thickness of the high field region (i.e. the distance between the electron source region and the hole source region. Accordingly, by selecting appropriate values for the thickness, doping level and spacing of the electron source layer  and the hole source layer , a potential barrier up to the bandgap (less the donor and acceptor ionization energies) may be formed. However, it may be preferable to provide a potential barrier somewhat less than the theoretical maximum, for example less than about 3 eV for GaN (which has a nominal bandgap of about 3.5 eV).","Moreover, the buffer  may be doped with deep acceptors as described in S.

As is known in the art, delta doping refers to doping a semiconductor layer with a very high density of dopants in a very thin region. For example, to form hole source layer , the semiconductor crystal of AlGaN may be doped with an acceptor such as Mg or Zn at an activated concentration of about 10cmfor a depth of about 10 nm. Hole source layer  may be doped with deep level acceptor elements such as Fe or V. Alternatively, hole source layer  may be co-doped with deep level transition elements, such as Fe or V, along with shallow acceptor dopants, such as Zn and\/or Mg. Using shallow acceptors with smaller activation energies Emay yield a larger maximum built-in voltage VHowever, if the material is overdoped, free acceptors could be generated which would adversely impact device performance. Also, it is undesirable to form a \u201ccamel hump\u201d in the conduction band Ethat could trap electrons. Thus, it may be preferable to keep Vfairly low and choose a dopant with a low memory effect in the growth system.","Similarly, the electron source layer may be doped with Si, Ge or O atoms. However, other forms of doping may be used in conjunction with thicker layers. For example, doping in the layers could be progressively graded or abrupt. Moreover, the electron source layer and the hole source layer may be thicker or thinner than 10 nm. In general, the electron source layer and hole source layer may each range in thickness from about 0.2 nm to about 100 nm. The electron source layer and the hole source layer do not have to have the same thickness or doping density.","Thus, for a 2V barrier, \u201cd\u201d may be less than about 0.1 \u03bcm. In general, depending on the desired barrier height and the doping levels used, the thickness \u201cd\u201d of the high field region  may range from about 10 nm to about 200 nm.","Depending on the desired barrier, different doping levels and spacings may be chosen. In some embodiments, the barrier may have a potential height of less than about 0.5V. In other embodiments, the barrier height may be about 1V or less. In still other embodiments, the barrier height may be about 2V or less. As discussed above, the limit on the barrier height is that it be less than (E\u2212E\u2212E).","In some embodiments, the electron source layer may include the 2DEG region induced at the interface of the barrier layer and the channel layer.

When a reverse voltage is applied, the conduction band in the vicinity of conduction layer  is elevated above the Fermi level, and a portion of the conduction layer  is depleted of carriers, thereby preventing the flow of current from the source  to the drain .","To oppose the movement of electrons away from the channel layer, an energy barrier is formed by inserting the electron source layer  and the hole source layer  between the channel layer  and the buffer layer . The electron source layer  and the hole source layer  are spaced apart by a distance \u201cd\u201d which defines a region  having a high electric field. The slope of the energy bands within the region  is directly related to the strength of the electric field in this region. As illustrated in , the large slope of the conduction band Ec within the high field region  presents a large potential barrier that opposes the movement of electrons from the channel layer  toward the buffer layer . More specifically, the potential barrier created by the high field region  tends to cause electrons in the 2DEG region not to migrate into the buffer region where they could become trapped or become less susceptible to influence by a gate voltage.","Other embodiments of the present invention are illustrated in .

It will be understood that the heterointerface between the first layer  and the second layer  may include an abrupt or graded junction. The second layer , which may include AlGaN (0\u2266x\u22661), has a higher bandgap than the first layer . The second layer  may be undoped, lightly doped with shallow p-type dopants and\/or doped with deep-level p-type dopants. Accordingly, when the first and second layers  and  are formed, the region near the heterointerface between the first and second layers  and  is induced to become highly p-type due to piezoelectric band bending. Thus, even though the structure does not include a highly p-doped layer, a quasi-p-type region is induced at the interface between the first and second layers  and  that serves as a hole source region.","As with the embodiments described above, the transfer of carriers between the quasi-p-type region created at the interface between the first and second layers  and  and the electron source layer  creates a high field region  that serves as a barrier against electrons transiting away from the 2DEG region .","In some embodiments, the second layer  comprises InAlGaN.

The second layer  may be from 10 nm to 10 \u03bcm thick. Moreover, the second layer  may be omitted altogether if buffer layer  has a suitable aluminum composition such that an interface between buffer layer  and the first layer  forms a heterojunction capable of acting as a hole source layer.","An illustrative band diagram for the structure of  is shown in . As illustrated in , a high field region , characterized by a steep positive slope of the conduction band, is formed between an electron source layer  and a hole source layer A formed at an interface between high field region  and the second layer . The electric field within the high field region  opposes the movement of carriers away from channel layer .","As discussed above, it may also be desirable to prevent as many carriers from the channel layer  from reaching the surface of a transistor device. Although the exposed surface of a transistor device is usually passivated, carrier trapping in interface states of a passivation layer may have a negative impact on the performance and\/or lifetime of a microwave transistor.","Accordingly, in some embodiments of the invention, a potential barrier is formed in the structure to resist or oppose the movement of carriers away from the channel layer  towards the surface of the device.  illustrates embodiments of the invention in which a potential barrier is formed between the barrier layer  and the upper surface  of a device B by means of a hole source layer  and an electron source layer  positioned sufficiently close to each other form a high field region  there between.

The hole source layer  is formed in close proximity to the electron source layer  but spaced apart by a distance \u201cd\u201d that defines high field layer . An optional cap layer  may be formed on the hole source layer . A passivation layer  covers the exposed upper surfaces of the device B. The passivation layer  may include SiN and\/or SiO. The formation of passivation layers on GaN-based layers is well known in the art.","In order to form effective source and drain ohmic contacts ,  it may be desirable to recess the contacts, for example by etching through the hole source layer , the high field layer  and the electron source layer  to expose a surface of barrier layer  prior to metallization as illustrated in . Alternatively, in certain embodiments of the present invention, the etch extends only into high field layer  or electron source layer  prior to metallization as shown in  respectively. The exposed surface may also be implanted with ions to provide a better surface for forming an ohmic contact.","An illustrative band diagram for the structure of  is shown in . As illustrated in , a high field region , characterized by a steep negative slope of the conduction band, is formed between an electron source layer  and a hole source layer  in a device B. The electric field within the high field region opposes the movement of carriers away from the channel layer  towards the surface  of the device B.","As with the embodiments illustrated in , the hole source layer  may be provided by a heterojunction interface between the high-field layer and a higher-bandgap layer. Such an embodiment is illustrated in  in which an electron source layer  is formed on the barrier layer . A high field layer  is formed on the electron source layer  and a layer  having a narrower bandgap than the high field layer  forms an abrupt or graded heterojunction with the high field layer . The lower band-gap layer , which may include AlGaN (0\u2266x\u22661), may be undoped or lightly doped with p-type dopants. Accordingly, when the layers are formed, the region near the heterointerface between layers  and  is induced to act as a hole source due to spontaneous and piezoelectric polarization charge. Thus, even though the structure does not include a highly p-doped layer, a quasi-p-type region  is induced at the interface between layers  and  which serves as a hole source region.","An illustrative band diagram of the device C is shown in .

An illustrative band diagram for the structure of device D is shown in . As is evident from , large potential barriers are formed on both sides of the channel layer to oppose the movement of carriers away from the channel region in either direction. As with the embodiments described above, the hole source layers ,  could be formed as thin layers doped with high concentrations of acceptors or they could be induced at heterojunction interfaces as described in connection with the embodiments of .","Other embodiments of the present invention are illustrated in . As described in connection with structure  of , structure E of  includes a substrate , a buffer layer , a channel layer  and a barrier layer  which are formed as described above in connection with . Structure E further includes interface regions A and A between which a quantum well is formed. In structure E, the first layer  has a narrower band gap and larger lattice constant than the channel layer  and the second layer  so as to provide a quantum well that provides the barrier. In particular embodiments of the present invention, the first layer  is InN and the channel layer  and second layer  are GaN. For an InN first layer , the layer may be approximately 1 monolayer thick (\u02dc3 \u212b). The charge anticipated with an InN\/GaN interface is expected to be very high (>2E14 cm), so no more than \u02dc2 monolayers would be desired for a large barrier. The interfaces A and A are the hole and electron source regions, respectively, each possessing this very large charge density. Therefore, a very thin layer  is capable of producing a large barrier as previously described. Also, the InN layer should be kept thin enough so that there are no allowed energy levels formed within the quantum well that may act as electron or hole traps. Accordingly, for a GaN\/InN\/GaN structure, the InN should be kept below \u02dc2 monolayers for this reason. For a GaN\/InGaN\/GaN (or AlGaN\/GaN\/AlGaN or other InAlGaN\/InAlGaN\/InAlGaN) structure for a given barrier, the thickness would need to be increased approximately linearly as the band offset is decreased, but the maximum allowable thickness for forbidding quantum levels within the well scales only approximately as the square root\u2014therefore a large discontinuity in band gap may be desirable. Interface regions A and A may each be either abrupt or graded.","In certain of the embodiments illustrated in , the channel layer  may be a thin layer (\u02dc30-300 \u212b)\u2014just thick enough to contain the 2DEG and allow enough thickness to switch to high quality GaN during the growth. In embodiments where the layer  is InN, to keep the InN from decomposing during heating up to the subsequent GaN growth temperatures, MBE or high pressure MOCVD may be utilized rather than conventional reduced pressure MOCVD.","An illustrative band diagram for the structure of  is shown in . As illustrated in , a high field region , characterized by a steep positive slope of the conduction band, is formed by the quantum well provided by channel layer , the first layer  and the second layer . The electric field within the high field region  opposes the movement of carriers away from channel layer .","Embodiments of the present invention illustrated in  provide a GaN\/InGaN\/GaN (including GaN\/InN\/GaN) structure and, therefore, may provide a channel that is a binary for reduced alloy scattering. Furthermore, the GaN layer  may be easier to grow than ternary or quaternary materials, so a thicker, lower dislocation density layer could be made, particularly if GaN substrates become available for use. Furthermore, the electron source and hole source layer densities at interfaces should be approximately equal and cancel, thus, potentially making design easier.","Method embodiments of the present invention are illustrated in . As illustrated in , a method according to embodiments of the present invention includes forming a channel region (block ) and forming an energy barrier that opposes the movement of carriers away from the channel region (block ). Some embodiments of the invention include forming a channel region and forming an energy barrier that opposes the movement of carriers away from the channel region on each side of the channel region.","In some embodiments illustrated in , forming an energy barrier includes forming an electron source layer (block ), forming a high field region (block ) and forming a hole source layer (block ). In some embodiments, the channel layer may be formed on the electron source layer. In other embodiments, the electron source layer may be formed after formation of the channel layer.","In particular embodiments illustrated in , a hole source layer is formed (block ), a high field region is formed on the hole source layer (block ), and an electron source layer is formed on the high field region (block ). A channel layer is formed on the electron source layer (block ). For HEMT structures, a barrier layer may be formed on the channel layer in order to facilitate generation of a 2DEG region between the channel layer and the barrier layer.","In other embodiments, a channel layer is formed, an electron source layer is formed on the channel layer, a high field region is formed on the electron source layer and a hole source layer is formed on the high field region.","The steps of forming a channel layer, forming an electron source layer, forming a high field region and forming a hole source layer are described in detail above. In particular, the step of forming an electron source layer may include delta-doping a thin layer of a nitride-based crystal with donor (n-type) impurities. For example, as discussed above, an electron source layer may be formed by doping a semiconductor crystal with a concentration of dopant atoms of about 10cmfor a thickness of about 10 nm. Similarly, the step of forming a hole source layer may include delta-doping a thin layer of a nitride-based crystal with acceptor (p-type) impurities. As discussed above, the electron and hole source layers may be formed thicker or thinner than 10 nm. Moreover, the electron and hole source layers do not have to have the same thickness and\/or doping levels.","Instead of forming an intentionally doped layer, the step of forming an electron source layer may be accomplished simultaneously with the formation of a 2DEG at a GaN\/AlGaN interface. That is, the 2DEG region may act as the electron source layer for purposes of certain embodiments. Similarly, the step of forming a hole source layer may be accomplished by the formation of a heterointerface that acts as an acceptor-doped region due to piezoelectric effects as discussed above.","Additional embodiments of the present invention are illustrated in . As described in connection with structure E of , structure F of  includes a substrate , a buffer layer  (also referred to as a nucleation layer), a channel layer  and a barrier layer  which are formed as described above in connection with  and\/or . Structure F also includes interface regions A and A between which a quantum well may be formed. In addition, a low temperature protective layer  may be provided between the channel layer  and the layer  (energy barrier or back barrier), and\/or an upper cap layer  may be provided on the barrier layer . In structure F, the layer  (also referred to as an energy barrier or back barrier) has a narrower band gap and larger lattice constant than the channel layer  and the layer  so as to provide a quantum well that provides the barrier. In some embodiments of the present invention, the first layer  (energy barrier or back barrier) may be a layer of InGaN (0<x\u22661) and the channel layer  and second layer  may both be layers of GaN. For an InGaN (0<x\u22661) layer  (energy barrier or back barrier), the layer  may have a thickness in the range of about 10 \u212b (Angstroms) to about 50 \u212b (Angstroms). Moreover, for an InGaN (0<x\u22661) layer , a characteristic of the layer (such as a concentration of indium) may be graded and\/or non-uniform laterally and\/or vertically, and grading and\/or non-uniformity may be intentionally induced and\/or may result as a by-product of a process used.","The charge induced by an InN\/GaN interface may be expected to be very high (>2\u00d710cm), so no more than \u02dc2 monolayers may be desired for a large barrier. The interfaces A and A are the hole and electron source regions, respectively, and each may possess this very large charge density. Therefore, a very thin layer  (energy barrier or back barrier) may be capable of producing a large barrier as previously described. Also, the InGaN (0<x\u22661) layer  may be kept thin enough so that there may be no allowed energy levels fowled within the quantum well that may act as electron or hole traps. Accordingly, for a GaN\/InN\/GaN structure, the InN may be kept below \u02dc2 monolayers for this reason. For a GaN\/InGaN\/GaN (or AlGaN\/GaN\/AlGaN or other InAlGaN\/InAlGaN\/InAlGaN) structure with a given barrier layer, a thickness of the layer  may be increased approximately linearly as the band offset is decreased to reduce and\/or prevent accumulation of electrons in the well. A maximum allowable thickness for forbidding quantum levels within the well may scale only approximately as the square root of the thickness of the layer . Therefore, a large discontinuity in band gap may be desirable. Interface regions A and A may each be either abrupt or graded.","In certain of the embodiments illustrated in , the channel layer  may be a thin layer in the range of about 30 \u212b (Angstroms) to about 300 \u212b (Angstroms)\u2014just thick enough to contain the 2DEG and allow enough thickness to switch to high quality GaN during the growth. In embodiments where the layer  is InN and\/or InGaN (0<x\u22661), the low-temperature protective layer  may be optionally formed on the layer  (energy barrier or back barrier) before forming the channel layer . More particularly, the low temperature protective layer  and the channel layer  may both be layers of GaN, with the low temperature protective layer  being formed at a temperature that is at least about 100 degrees C. lower than a temperature at which the channel layer  is formed. More particularly, the low temperature GaN protective layer  may be formed at a temperature less than about 900 degrees C., and the GaN channel layer  may be formed at a temperature greater than about 1000 degrees C. By forming the low temperature protective layer  before forming the channel layer  at a higher temperature, the layer  (including indium) is not exposed when forming the channel layer  at a higher temperature, and damage to the layer  can be reduced. Moreover, the low temperature protective layer  may be considered as a portion of the channel layer .","By providing the layer  (energy barrier or back barrier) as a layer of InGaN (0<x<1), as opposed to a layer of InN, manufacturability of the device may be increased. According to some embodiments of the present invention, a mole fraction of InN in an alloy of InN\/GaN making up the layer  (energy barrier or back barrier) may be at least about 1% (percent), and more particularly, in the range of about 2% (percent) to about 20% (percent). Moreover, a concentration of indium in the layer  may vary in directions parallel and\/or perpendicular with respect to a surface of the substrate, and\/or the layer  may include InN and\/or GaN dots (inclusions) therein.","Embodiments of the present invention illustrated in  may provide a GaN\/InGaN\/GaN and\/or GaN\/InN\/GaN structure (of layers \/\/) and, therefore, may provide a channel layer formed of a binary compound semiconductor material which may result in reduced alloy scattering. Furthermore, the GaN layer  may be easier to grow than ternary or quaternary materials, so a thicker, lower dislocation density layer could be made, particularly if a GaN substrate is employed.

Layer  in each of Sample- and Control- has a thickness of about 2000 nm (nanometers).","By providing a InGaN (0<x\u22661) layer  on the channel layer  opposite the barrier layer  (as in each of Sample-), a resulting polarization may improve charge confinement of the 2DEG at the interface of the channel and barrier layers  and . More particularly, the InGaN (0<x\u22661) layer  may form a charge dipole raising a conduction-band potential in the GaN layer . The InGaN (0<x\u22661) layer  is not required to be an active current carrying layer so that a quality InGaN (0<x\u22661) layer  may be relatively low. A concentration of indium in the InGaN (0<x<1) layer  may thus vary in directions perpendicular and\/or parallel with respect to a surface of the substrate , and\/or the layer  may include InN and\/or GaN dots (inclusions) therein. Moreover, the InGaN (0<x\u22661) layer  of each of Sample- may provide a barrier in the range of about 0.2 eV to about 0.4 eV. In addition, a structure of each of Sample- may be provided as a 0.5 \u03bcm (micrometer) stepper based HEMT.","According to some embodiments of the present invention, the barrier layer  may have a thickness in the range of about 0.1 nm to about 10 nm, and more particularly, in the range of about 0.7 nm to about 0.8 nm, and\/or the barrier layer  may be separated from the energy barrier  by a distance in the range of about 5 nm to about 30 nm, and more particularly, in the range of about 5 nm to about 20 nm, and still more particularly in the range of about 10 nm to about 15 nm. According to some embodiments of the present invention, the channel layer  may have a thickness in the range of about 1 nm to about 20 nm, and more particularly in the range of about 8 nm to about 10 nm, and\/or the GaN protective layer  may have a thickness of about 15 nm or less, and more particularly, of about 7 nm or less. According to some embodiments of the present invention, the energy barrier  may have a thickness in the range of about 0.1 nm (1 Angstrom) to about 10 nm (100 Angstrom), and more particularly, in the range of about 1 nm (10 Angstrom) to about 5 nm (50 Angstrom). According to some embodiments of the present invention, a mole fraction of InN (indium nitride) in an InN\/GaN alloy of the energy barrier may be in the range of about 1% to about 50%, and more particularly, in the range of about 4% to about 16%.","The band diagrams of  illustrate a potential impact of including the InGaN (0<x\u22661) layer  that may provide charge confinement.  is a band diagram for a structure including a 24 nm (nanometer) thick AlGaN cap layer (having a mole fraction of AlN in an AlN\/GaN alloy of about 25%), a 1 nm (nanometer) AlN barrier layer, and an AlGaN channel layer (having a mole fraction of AlN in an AlN\/GaN alloy of about 5%) without an InGaN (0<x\u22661) layer .  is a band diagram for a structure including a 24 nm (nanometer) thick AlGaN cap layer  (having a mole fraction of AlN in an AlN\/GaN alloy of about 25%), a 1 nm (nanometer) AlN barrier layer , a 3 nm (nanometer) thick GaN channel layer , a 5 nm thick InGaN (0<x\u22661) layer  (having a mole fraction of InN in an InN\/GaN alloy of about 5%), and a GaN layer  as shown in .","Without the InGaN (0<x\u22661) layer , the electron distribution (dashed line) may extend well into a buffer region as shown in . With the InGaN (0<x\u22661) layer , the electron distribution (dashed line) may be reduced by more than half as shown in . The solid lines of  illustrate conduction bands for the respective structures. The reference numbers of  indicate portions of the conduction band graph of  corresponding to the layers of the structure shown in .","Drain-source output resistances Rds (measured in ohms) are provided in  as a function of estimated InGaN compositions for the InGaN (0<x\u22661) layer  of Sample- and Control- from the table of . As shown, the structures of Control- without layer  may provide the lowest output resistances. When the InGaN (0<x\u22661) layer  is included (as in Sample-), the output resistance may increase with increasing concentrations of indium in the InGaN (0<x\u22661) layer . The high output resistance Rds may be an indication of reduced short-channel effects, and devices with higher output resistances may be expected to provide higher gain and\/or Power Added Efficiency (PAE), especially when implemented in sub 0.2 \u03bcm (micrometer) gate length HEMTs for mm-wave applications.","As shown in , drain-source output resistances Rds may be increased in structures including energy barriers according to embodiments of the present invention as compared to structures of similar dimensions and materials without energy barriers. For example, drain-source output resistances Rds may be increased by 10%, 50%, or even 100% as compared to structures of similar dimensions and materials but without an energy barrier.","Confinement may be improved with improved quality of the InGaN (0<x\u22661) layer , and a relatively thin InGaN (0<x\u22661) layer  with a relatively high In (indium) mole fraction may provide a relatively high dipole and improved confinement. A high indium (In) content InGaN (0<x\u22661) layer , however, may be difficult to grow with high crystal quality. An effective InGaN (0<x\u22661) layer  (energy barrier or back barrier) may be provided with a relatively low In content (for example, having a mole fraction of InN in an InN\/GaN alloy of about 5%) and a thickness in the range of about 10 \u212b (Angstroms) to about 50 \u212b (Angstroms).","Heterojunction transistors (such as HEMTs) according to embodiments of the present invention may be formed by forming an epitaxial nucleation layer  (such as an MN nucleation layer) on a single crystal substrate (such as a 4H\u2014SiC substrate). An epitaxial Group III nitride layer  (such as a layer of GaN may be formed on the nucleation layer , and an epitaxial Group III nitride energy barrier layer  (such as a layer of InGaN where 0<x\u22661 or where 0<x<1) may be formed on the layer .","An epitaxial Group III nitride low temperature protective layer  (such as a layer of InAlGaN) may be formed on the energy barrier layer , and an epitaxial Group III nitride channel layer  (such as a layer of InAlGaN) may be formed on the low temperature protective layer . More particularly, the low temperature protective layer  may be formed at a temperature at least 100 degrees C. less than a temperature at which the channel layer  is formed. For example, the low temperature protective layer  may be formed at a temperature in the range of about 600 degrees C. to about 800 degrees C., and the channel layer  may be formed at a temperature of at least about 1000 degrees C. The low temperature protective layer  may thus protect the energy barrier layer  during the subsequent step of forming the channel layer , and the low temperature protective layer  may be considered a part of the channel layer . After forming the channel layer , an epitaxial Group III nitride barrier layer  (such as a layer of InAlGaN) may be formed on the channel layer , and an epitaxial Group III nitride cap layer  (such as a layer of InAlGaN) may be formed on the barrier layer . After forming the cap layer , source, gate, and drain contacts , , and  and passivation layer  may be fowled.","More particularly, Group III nitride compositions of the energy barrier layer , the channel layer , the barrier layer , and the cap layer  may vary. For example, a concentration of gallium in the cap layer  may be greater than a concentration of gallium in the barrier layer . A concentration of aluminum in the barrier layer  may exceed a concentration of aluminum in the channel layer  and\/or the low temperature protective layer . Moreover, a concentration of indium in the energy barrier layer  may exceed a concentration of indium in the channel layer  and\/or the low temperature protective layer . For example, the energy barrier layer  may comprise a layer of InGaN (0<x\u22661), the channel layer  may comprise a layer of AlGaN (0\u2266y<1), and the barrier layer  may comprise a layer of AlGaN (0<z\u22661), and x, y, and\/or z may be different. More particularly, the energy barrier layer  may comprise a layer of InGaN (0<x<1), the channel layer  may comprise a layer of GaN, the barrier layer  may comprise a layer of AlN, and the cap layer  may comprise a layer of AlGaN (0<n<1).","HEMT structures according to embodiments of the present invention may provide improved power performance, for example, for mm-wave amplifiers for satellite communication, mm-wave WLAN (Wireless Local-Area Network), Digital Radio, solid-state amplifiers for vacuum tube replacement, and\/or high frequency amplifiers for test and measurement applications. Power levels of 5 to 10 times that currently available using gallium-arsenide (GaAs) and\/or indium-phosphorus (InP) transistors may be provided by HEMT structures according to embodiments of the present invention with relatively high efficiency and\/or high power mm-wave amplifier operation.","By including the InGaN (0<x\u22661) layer  in HEMT structures according to embodiments of the present invention, output characteristics may be improved by providing confinement from the backside of the GaN HEMT channel layer . Performance may be improved for HEMT structures operating at radio frequency (RF) and\/or microwave frequencies, and even more significant improvements may be provided for HEMT structures operating at higher frequencies. As gate lengths are scaled down for higher frequency operations, device output conductance may be reduced linearly. Although on-resistance may also decrease due to dimensional shrinkage, the reduction may be at a much lower rate so that power gain may be compromised, and improvement of extrinsic cut-off frequency fwith respect to fmay be less than desired. Moreover, a sub-threshold leakage may increase when the gate length is below 0.25 \u03bcm (micrometers) so that Power Added Efficiency (PAE) is reduced.","In alternatives, an energy barrier (or back barrier) may be provided using AlGaN based buffer layers. AlGaN layers, however, may tend to be unintentionally doped, and dopant compensation may cause deep traps. Moreover, a crystal quality of bulk AlGaN may generally be less than a crystal quality of currently available GaN, because the crystal formation process for AlGaN may be more complicated and may be subjected to alloy disorder. A layer of AlGaN may be provided between the 2-DEG and a relatively high quality GaN buffer, but a buried sub-channel may form at the first AlGaN\/GaN interface. Grading the AlGaN from the GaN buffer may reduce the sub-channel while generating bulk polarization charges, possibly reducing confinement.","Exemplary embodiments described herein having heterostructures as a hole or electron source are illustrated with respect to Ga-polar epitaxial layers. For exemplary embodiments relying on doping to provide a hole and\/or source layer, such structures would be the same for non-polar or partially Ga polar. However, typically, non-polar structures would not be able to take advantage of heterointerface polarization doping. Embodiments of the present invention employing N-polar structures would look different in terms of the heterostructure layers, although the same principles apply, just reversed.","The table of provides drain-source resistances Rds in ohm mm, unity gain frequencies Ft, intr (i.e., frequencies at which current gain is 1, also referred to as Ft) in GHz, back-confinement values Vbc in ohm mmGHz, device resistances Dr in ohm mm, and percentages of Indium in the InGaN layers  for the devices Sample- and Control- from the table of .
