While some terms may include a wide variety of embodiments, the appended claims may expressly limit these terms to specific embodiments.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIGS. 1 through 5"},"Disclosed embodiments include a platform that renders the decision-making process more effective in today's increasingly complex production environments. Various disclosed systems and methods are referred to herein as the High-Definition Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) (HDPLM) system. Features of HDPLM, in various embodiments, include (i) placing users in the right context based on the user's role in a PLM process and history of interactions with the PLM process (which may be separately and jointly referred to as an \u201cActive Workspace\u201d); (ii) presenting information to the user from multiple sources in a PLM system, where the information is selected and arranged according to the user's current activities (which may be referred to as High-Definition Visualization); (iii) pro-actively assisting the user in accomplishment of tasks (which may be referred to as Digital Assistance); (iv) providing access to information on one or more of a plurality of wired and wireless devices (which may be referred to as Enterprise Mobility); and (v) verifying decision-making processes employed by the user or a group of users against one or more recorded decision-making rationales previously used or authorized (which may be referred to as Company Wisdom).","Broadly viewed, various disclosed embodiments of the HDPLM system address challenges in production environments by providing a collaborative and pro-active portal for all users, placing these users in the right context, empowering them to deal with complex problems and, at the same time, being sensitive to their individual needs. These users may be employees of an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), suppliers and\/or production partners of an OEM, and\/or consumers of the OEM's products. Architecturally, the HDPLM system is composed of a collection of role-based portals that allow effective communication between OEMs, their partners and suppliers, and their consumers.","By being placed in the right context, having access to agents that are always evaluating new information against rationale, and presented with an intuitive representation of all information on one of a plurality of wired and wireless devices, users may be empowered to make timely decisions that are recorded for future reference. This capability, in turn, may result in increasing a quality of user knowledge through verified best practices. Thus, an active workspace accompanied by high-def visualization, mobility, and digital assistance, may facilitate the decision-making process by users while, at the same time, enhancing company wisdom.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["102","104","106","106","108","110","110","111"]},"Other peripherals, such as local area network (LAN)\/Wide Area Network\/Wireless (e.g. WiFi) adapter , may also be connected to local system bus . Expansion bus interface  connects local system bus  to input\/output (I\/O) bus . I\/O bus  is connected to keyboard\/mouse adapter , disk controller , and I\/O adapter . Disk controller  can be connected to a storage , which can be any suitable machine usable or machine readable storage medium, including but not limited to nonvolatile, hard-coded type mediums such as read only memories (ROMs) or erasable, electrically programmable read only memories (EEPROMs), magnetic tape storage, and user-recordable type mediums such as floppy disks, hard disk drives and compact disk read only memories (CD-ROMs) or digital versatile disks (DVDs), and other known optical, electrical, or magnetic storage devices.","Also connected to I\/O bus  in the example shown is audio adapter , to which speakers (not shown) may be connected for playing sounds. Keyboard\/mouse adapter  provides a connection for a pointing device (not shown), such as a mouse, trackball, trackpointer, etc.","Those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the hardware depicted in  may vary for particular implementations. For example, other peripheral devices, such as an optical disk drive and the like, also may be used in addition or in place of the hardware depicted. The depicted example is provided for the purpose of explanation only and is not meant to imply architectural limitations with respect to the present disclosure.","A data processing system in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure includes an operating system employing a graphical user interface. The operating system permits multiple display windows to be presented in the graphical user interface simultaneously, with each display window providing an interface to a different application or to a different instance of the same application. A cursor in the graphical user interface may be manipulated by a user through the pointing device. The position of the cursor may be changed and\/or an event, such as clicking a mouse button, generated to actuate a desired response.","One of various commercial operating systems, such as a version of Microsoft Windows\u2122, a product of Microsoft Corporation located in Redmond, Wash. may be employed if suitably modified. The operating system is modified or created in accordance with the present disclosure as described.","LAN\/WAN\/Wireless adapter  can be connected to a network  (not a part of data processing system ), which can be any public or private data processing system network or combination of networks, as known to those of skill in the art, including the Internet. Data processing system  can communicate over network  with server system , which is also not part of data processing system , but can be implemented, for example, as a separate data processing system .","The data processing system  may be modified to operate as part of system providing digital assistance agents in product lifecycle management and configured to perform processes as described herein. The data processing system  may provide all or a portion of an agent server or application server, as depicted in . In providing such service, the data processing system  may operate in the role of one or more elements of the systems shown in .","Digital Assistance according to the disclosure is provided by agents, which are pieces of software that run inside of HDPLM system components. Agents are adapted to interact with other HDPLM system components and\/or one or more users, in order to help users perform tasks or to provide information to the user. Such information may be from a plurality of sources. Agents reduce or eliminate the need for a user to individually launch a plurality of applications, and may minimize situations in which the user must point and click on multiple elements of components user interfaces in order to accomplish a task.","Agents may be accessed by applications outside the HDPLM system. For example, an external collaboration tool may access agents while supporting collaboration sessions. Participants in such a session might use agents to help manage issues or find documents while collaborating with suppliers. While the agents may interact with applications outside the HDPLM system, the functionality of the agents remains within the HDPLM system, to ensure that the agents have access to necessary information.","An agent according to the disclosure is aware of a context in which it is operating. The context of an agent may be a collection of HDPLM system objects that should be considered when the agent is performing actions. For example, during design of a vehicle, in a collaborative meeting between designers and suppliers, the context might be all of the parts in the exhaust system of the vehicle. An Issue Management agent activated during such a meeting might use such a context to generate a list of issues relating only to parts in the exhaust system. Similarly a Requirements agent activated during such a meeting might use such a context to generate a list of requirements for only the parts in the exhaust system. A user may add additional information for the agent to use in its search, such as issues to do with vibration.","The agent may obtain context information from the collaboration system or the HDPLM system, such as information relating to an agenda for the collaborative meeting. In some embodiments, a user may provide additional context information via a user interface. For example, a set context button activated by the user may set an agent's context to currently visible parts. If the user has a model of a car loaded, but only wants the agent to find items related to the wheels, the user may turn off all of the parts except for the wheels, and then click the set context button. This sets the agent context to the visible parts\u2014the wheels.","An agent according to the disclosure is adapted to use one or more of several categories of information in performing its functions. An agent is adapted to recognize a context in which it is operating. Context may include roles of collaboration participants, meeting agendas or topics, user inputs, and other information indicating a framework in which the agent is being utilized. An agent is adapted to obtain a history for its present context\u2014that is, information about previous decisions, discussions, collaboration contacts, changes, updates, and other background information. An agent is adapted to get or put information to other HDPLM applications. An agent is adapted to provide notification to a user by signaling that the agent may have information relevant to a user or collaborative group, or by interjecting an offer of functionality or a result of an action into a collaboration session or other interaction of a user with the HDPLM system.","An agent is adapted to record decision-making and other processes performed by users and store records of such processes or validate such processes against previously stored information. An agent is adapted to compare a process that is currently or was recently performed by a user against stored \u201cbest practices\u201d templates. Such best practices templates may be chosen by the agent based upon its awareness of the context of the user's process. Because it has access to all the best practices templates of the organization, the agent may recognize applicable templates that the user is not aware of or has forgotten. The agent is adapted to present to the user comparisons of the process to one or more such templates, enabling the user to verify or validate the process, or revise the process commensurate with the template(s).","A Collaboration agent may provide relevant, contextual information to users during a meeting. For example, the Collaboration agent might notice that the participants are talking about what material to use for a part, and bring up environmental information about the materials being discussed. Or, the Collaboration agent might realize that when talking about materials in the past, participants typically looked at a government list of banned materials, and automatically load that document in case it is needed.","When an HDPLM system user makes a decision, several issues (or options) are typically assessed and weighed for their advantages and disadvantages. The user is typically going through a rational process to sift through the options and arguments in favor of or against a particular action. An agent according to the disclosure may be adapted to notice one or more patterns in user behavior and context (such as noticing what kind of documents are looked at during collaboration sessions), record those patterns, and apply one or more patterns against future events to determine relevant information.","The validation aspect of agents captures this decision-making process and makes it available to users and organizations to validate their decisions. Agents are adapted to record a decision-making process rationale in the form of a mind-map template. Such templates are then re-used by agents at a later date to remind the user of past logic for the same or similar decisions. Such templates may also be elevated to \u201corganizational best practices\u201d for reuse by other users or integrated for automatic validation during the development process.","Two modes that agents according to the disclosure may use in interaction with users are \u201cactive\u201d and \u201cproactive.\u201d In active mode, an agent gathers information, but does not present the gathered information to the user unless asked. However, the agent in active mode does provide some notification to the user that the agent has information to present. For example, the active mode might be used by a CAD designer working on a part; as the design is created, the agent might gather information on the materials that could be used, relevant requirements, etc. In some embodiments, the icon for the agent changes color or flashes or otherwise indicates that the agent has information to present. However, the information is not presented until the user clicks on the icon and the agent displays the information to the user. Such a presentation may include input components (e.g., one or more buttons) for the user to indicate further action by the agent).","In proactive mode, an agent gathers information and provides it to the user as the information is found. Proactive mode might be used during a collaboration session, where the agent immediately offers to provide information that it has found that might be relevant to the discussion. In some embodiments, the agent may present its offered information in a chat transcript along with comments by human participants in a collaboration session. In other embodiments, the agent may present its information in an interaction window (or dialog box) to one or more participants in the collaboration session.","A user may switch the interaction mode of an agent. In the case of a meeting, the user who invited the agent to the meeting may modify that agent's mode. The agent performs the same work in each mode; the difference is how the agent interacts with users. In some circumstances, only one of active and proactive modes may be available. For example, for a single designer using an HDPLM system, an agent might be available exclusively in active mode, where the proactive mode doesn't make sense for that use case.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":"200"},"In step , the agent obtains from the HDPLM system context information relating to a first user of an HDPLM system from an interaction of the first user with one or more other users of the HDPLM system. The context information may be obtained from or relate to the identities of one or more users who are interacting with the agent, for example, the users' roles in an organization, activity or collaboration session that the agent is supporting. The context information may be obtained from or relate to a subject matter, agenda, or displayed information of an application, activity or collaboration session that the agent is supporting. The context information may be obtained by direct or indirect input from a current user of the agent.","In step , the agent obtains from the HDPLM system history information relating to the context information. The history information may relate to previous decisions or discussions made in an activity supported by the agent. The history information may relate to previous uses by one or more current users, or users in similar roles, of the agent. The history information may relate to actions taken in previous collaboration sessions supported by the agent. The history information may relate to partial or complete decision-making processes engaged in by user(s) of the agent. The history information may relate to changes, updates, or other information that has occurred since a previous activation of the agent in one or more elements of the context information obtained in step .","In step , the agent may launch one or more HDPLM system processes or applications for users of the agent to employ in conducting an activity or collaboration session that the agent is supporting. The agent may select the applications based upon the context information obtained in step  or the history information obtained in step . The agent may provide context or history information to the applications in order to place the applications in a condition that the user expects or a condition in which the user left the application. As the agent performs actions to support the user, the agent may launch applications to support the agent in its performance of those actions.","In step , the agent receives (or \u201cgets\u201d) input information from one or more of the users that the agent is supporting. The input information may be received by monitoring a collaboration session that the users are engaged in and detecting a topic or comment by a collaboration participant. The agent may show an interaction window (or dialog box) to request the input information from a user. A user may activate a dialog to push the input information to the agent.","In step , the agent may get or put action information from or to one or more files, databases, or applications of the HDPLM system, where the action information is based upon the input information received in step  and the context information received in step . The action information may further be based upon the history information obtained in step . The agent may get or put information from or to a data source external to the HDPLM system, such as a database, blog, or website maintained by a supplier, a customer, or a government entity. The agent may get or put a plurality of pieces of information in step , the actions of the agent determined in some cases by the input information received in step , and in other cases by information obtained during performance of step .","In step , the agent displays (or sends or \u201cputs\u201d) output information back to one or more of the users. The output information may be a response to the input information received in step . The output information may be a request for further input information from the user, an offer to provide further information to the user, or an offer to perform further activities for the user.","In step , the agent records a decision-making or other process performed by user(s) in an activity or collaboration session. In step , the agent compares the recorded process to one or more templates of similar processes or processes of the same type in order to validate the recorded process. Such templates may be selected by the agent according to the context information obtained in step  and may represent organizational best practices that the user is encouraged or required to follow. The validation may compare the recorded process to best practices and provide feedback to the user(s) relating to a quality of the process or the decision made. The validation may compare the recorded process to one or more standards to certify that the process meets organizational or statutory requirements.","In step , the recorded process may be used to create a template for processes of the same type. Such a template may be stored for use in step  with subsequent recorded processes.","One or more agents in an HDPLM system may be provided by an agent server. Client platforms (e.g., JAVA\u00ae language, IPHONE\u00ae operating system, SHAREPOINT\u00ae platform, .NET connection software, etc.) that are to access agents are provided with an individualized client library to handle access to the server. The libraries hide the details of the server calls behind function calls. Inside the library, function calls may be converted to HTTP GET or POST requests (depending on the platform) to the server. On the server, an application programming interface routes the request to the appropriate agent. Agents may be implemented in the agent server as plug-ins. HDPLM system application objects may be converted to a standard format (such as XML) before being returned to a client.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","302","304","302"]},"To respond to the query, the requirements agent makes a call on an HDPLM system that is running on an application server . An agent search module  in the HDPLM system formats a full text search request, which includes query text (\u201cnon-hazardous materials\u201d), a current user's group, and role information for the user of the client . The agent search module  sends the search request to a search server , which may access an index created for the agent of application data  in performing the search. The search server  returns search result information matching the search terms. The search result information may be formatted as an XML list of objects. The agent search module  may convert the search result information into an internal format used by the requirements application. For example, the agent search module  may parse the XML list of objects and build a list of objects in a proprietary agent format. The agent search module  returns the search result information to the client .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","402","404","406","406","408","410","412","400","420","430","402","404","406","412","420","408","410","412","430"]},"The agent servers  and  may communicate with each other using plugins or other extension software. The agent server  may communicate with applications of the backend system  using plugins. The plugins used by the agent server  may be selected based upon a type of the backend system . The agent server , in the public internet, does not communicate directly with the backend system . The agent server  communicates with the backend system  through the agent server . The agent server  is adapted to provide full access to client applications that are in the corporate intranet, inside the firewall . However, the agent server  is adapted to expose only selected functions of the backend system  to clients  and  and other client applications outside the firewall , in the public internet .","Because the agent server  encapsulates all of the functionality of agents operating on the agent server , the clients  and  are only required to handle communication to and from the agent server , as well as the display of retrieved information. For example, a workflow agent running on the agent server  exposes a function to return a list of tasks assigned to a user. Where the client  is operating on an IPAD\u00ae mobile digital device and the client  is operating on a DROID\u00ae handheld device, Client libraries for IPAD mobile digital devices and DROID handheld devices are provided in the clients  and , respectively, and are adapted to retrieve the list of tasks from the workflow agent. Local platform functionality is then used in each of the clients  and  to display the list of tasks.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","502","504","506","506","506","502","504","506"]},"Even where applications operating on the backend server  provide client side libraries that handle all of the communication with the applications, there may be individual client platforms that cannot use the libraries. For example, where the libraries are written in JAVA language, a client platform that does not support JAVA language, or a platform that does not support a full JAVA language environment, may not be able to use the application libraries. For such client platforms the agent server  is adapted to act as a middleman, using the application-supplied client side libraries to communicate with the application running on the backend server , and transforming the responses in to XML, which each of the clients  and  are adapted to handle. In a similar way, agent functionality may be entirely contained within the agent server , with the result that agent functionality can be supported on a single server environment, rather than on multiple server environments.","An issues agent provides an example of an agent embodying elements of the disclosure. During a collaboration session between designers and suppliers, an issues agent obtains context information indicating that a context for the session is parts in an exhaust system of a car. The issues agent may use the context to generate a list of open issues relating to the parts of the exhaust system of the car. The issues agent monitors the collaboration session and actively searches for issues related to any part or assembly mentioned in the session. If issues or models are found, the issues agent interrupts the user and asks if the user wants to open the issues or models.","An underlying issues management (IM) process operates in an HDPLM system used for the collaboration session. When there is an issue with a part, the IM process is used to identify the problem, route problem descriptions and other data to the appropriate users, and provide a signoff history to prove that the process was followed. Such an IM process may use a plurality of HDPLM applications operating on one or more HDPLM platforms.","The issues agent is adapted to operate as an intermediary between a user and the IM process. In the absence of the issues agent, the user must perform the steps required to create and manage an IM process instance, which typically requires training. The issues agent is adapted to support user actions by mapping the user actions to IM process steps and base functionality. The issues agent is also adapted to manage data associated with an IM process item, making it easy for the user to search for an IM item, and view and create data necessary to manage the IM item.","Table 1 presents an example of user actions performed during a life cycle of an issue. Two users are represented, an Issue Manager and a CAD developer.

The IM process also generates one or more snapshots, which are visualizations of the part structure and may include markup information.","One or more HDPLM applications operating on one or more HDPLM platforms provide the following base functionality that are used in the performance of the IM process:\n\n","Table 2 presents user actions supported by the issues agent, as well as the IM process steps and base functionality used by the issues agent to support the user actions:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0071"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"91pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":[{},"TABLE 2"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},{},"IM Process","Base"]},{"entry":[{},"User Action","Steps","Functionality"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Create a new issue.","1, 2","3, 5"]},{"entry":[{},"Markup a visualization","3, 4, 9","1, 2, 4,"]},{"entry":[{},"and attach it to the issue."]},{"entry":[{},"Notification of assigned","6, 11"]},{"entry":[{},"tasks."]},{"entry":[{},"Fix the issue.","8","7"]},{"entry":[{},"See the current state of an","7, 12","8"]},{"entry":[{},"issue."]},{"entry":[{},"Approve\/reject changes.","5, 10, 13, 14","6, 9"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}}},"Thus, the issues agent obtains content information regarding the collaboration session (parts in an exhaust system of a car) from a title of the session, a role of the session organizer as lead designer for the exhaust system, or from a discussion among session participants of the exhaust system parts. The issues agent accesses an IM process to obtain history information relating to existing issue items. The issues agent gets information from the session participants by monitoring comments and questions in the session or by being directly accessed by a session participant.","During the collaboration session, a problem may be discussed and the participants ask the issues agent to determine whether an issue (e.g., an IM item) exists relating to the problem. The issues agent searches the IM process to find such issues and, if any issues are found, puts any issues found to the participants in the session. If it is determined that an IM item does not exist, a participant may use the issues agent to create an IM item relating to the problem. The participants in the session may then have the issues agent utilize the IM process to generate a visualization of one or more parts relating to the issue. As the participants discuss the problem, one or more participants may add markup comments to the part structure. When the discussion of the issue is completed, a participant may use the issues agent to initiate IM process steps to assign tasks to resolve the issue.","While the collaboration session is in progress, or after it is completed, the issues agent compares the process followed in the session and any issue resolution steps performed after the session to one or more stored templates. The templates are selected by the issues agent based upon the information about the context of the issue that was obtained from the collaboration session. The templates may represent best practices of the users' organization. Conformation of the users' process to the templates may be required by the organization and, if the process fails validation against one or more of the templates, the issues agent may notify one or more of the users to reconvene the collaboration session or may identify for the user steps required to bring the process into compliance with the template(s).","A requirements agent provides another example of an agent embodying elements of the disclosure. During a collaboration session between designers and suppliers, a requirements agent obtains context information indicating that a context for the session is parts in an exhaust system of a car. The requirements agent is adapted to use the context and processes and applications of the HDPLM system to find requirements related to the context. The requirements agent is also adapted to assist session participants to view, verify and modify such requirements. The requirements agent is adapted to associate such requirements with parts in the exhaust system and link the requirements to their source and rationale. That is, the requirements agent is adapted to enable users to create, find, and view requirements, as well as find and view relationships between requirements and other items (e.g., parts) and the sources of those requirements, by utilizing HDPLM processes and applications that provide such functionality.","There are many sources for requirements. Formal requirements may be entered by HDPLM users. Customers may provide suggestions that are treated as informal requirements through TWITTER\u00ae messaging service TWEET\u00ae messages, emails, blog entries, web sites, and other communications via the Internet. It would be difficult for an HDPLM system user to keep track of all such different types of media, so the requirements agent to monitor, and suggest requirements to a human user.","When an HDPLM system user finds a source that should be followed for potential requirements, the user gives the type and location of the source to the requirements agent. The requirements agent is adapted to check the source at regular intervals\u2014or to receive notifications when the source is updated. If an update seems like it may be a useful requirement, the requirements agent is adapted to notify a user. The user can then make a determination as to whether the potential requirement is valid or not. If the user determines that the source update should become a requirement, the agent is adapted to utilize HDPLM processes and applications to create the requirement and source objects, and relate them together.","In one example, a manufacturer has a blog where it posts updates to acceptable materials. An HDPLM system user adds the uniform resource locator (URL) of the blog to the requirements agent's list of sources to monitor. When the manufacturer posts a new blog entry, the requirements agent notices the update and, if the update seems like a potential requirement, the requirements agent notifies an HDPLM system user. The user may instruct the requirements agent to create a new requirement within the HDPLM system or to modify an existing requirement. In another example, another manufacturer may have a TWITTER account where its marketing group posts informal look and feel requirements. An HDPLM system user may add the TWITTER account to the requirements agent's list of sources to monitor. When the manufacturer sends a TWEET message that includes a new look and feel requirement, the requirements agent notices the update and, if the tweet seems like it could be a requirement for an HDPLM design, the requirements agent notifies an HDPLM system user.","Thus, in support of a collaboration session, the requirements agent is adapted to find requirements related to context information obtained regarding an HDPLM system user's current work or collaboration session. The requirements agent is also adapted to assist users in creating, finding, and viewing requirements. In an ongoing process, which may be separate from collaboration sessions, the requirements agent is adapted to monitor external sources for possible new requirements or changes to existing requirements. The requirements agent is adapted to consolidate calls to one or more HDPLM system processes or applications to facilitate user performance of actions related to user roles or activities.","According to various embodiments, one or more of the processes or steps described in relation to the figures described above may be performed alternately, concurrently, repeatedly, or in a different order, unless otherwise specifically described or claimed. \u201cReceiving,\u201d as used herein, can include loading from storage, receiving from another data processing system such as over a network, receiving via an interaction with a user, a combination of these, or otherwise, as recognized by those of skill in the art.","Those skilled in the art will recognize that, for simplicity and clarity, the full structure and operation of all data processing systems suitable for use with the present disclosure is not being depicted or described herein.
