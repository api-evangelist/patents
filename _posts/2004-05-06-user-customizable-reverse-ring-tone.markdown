title: User customizable reverse ring tone
abstract: An improved system and method to provide important information either, as voice, text, picture, holographic image or video from the called party to a calling party before the called party answers a telephone. The information may be a recorded voice, text, image or video message. The called party may send a voice message, for example, and send it along with a call alerting message. The voice message may be recorded beforehand. Instead of the calling party's telephone playing a ringback signal, the recorded voice message is played or a data/bearer stream is heard. The calling party hears the voice message instead of the ringback tone normally heard when there is an incoming telephone call. If the calling and called party have telephones, such as mobile phones, IP phones, IP softphones, PDA with telephony capabilities, etc., which allow for multimedia messages such as text, images and video messages, the called party's recorded voice message may include text, images or video.

No. 60\/558,433, filed Mar. 31, 2004, of the same title and to the same inventors, and contains subject matter related to the subject matter of copending U.S. application Ser. No. 10\/801,960, filed Mar. 15, 2004, entitled \u201cRing-Tone Messaging Service\u201d to Delaney, et al., each of which is incorporated herein by this reference.","The present invention is directed generally to telephony services and specifically to providing a message before a called party answers a call.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0004","num":"0003"},"figref":["FIGS. 1A","FIG. 1A"],"b":["1","1","30","20","10","50","60","50","30","20","10","40","40","10","30"]},"In , the calling party initiates a call over the PSTN  using either a wireline telephone  or wireless telephone . In this example, the call is routed solely through the PSTN  to the remote end where the called party may be using either a wireline  or wireless telephone . If the called party does not answer the call but pays for voice mail  service as part of their communications bill, the call is diverted to voice mail .","In , the calling party may initiate a call over the PSTN  using either a wireline telephone  or wireless telephone . Similarly, the calling party may initiate a call over the Internet  using a H.323 terminal or the session initiation protocol (SIP) telephone . H.323\/SIP terminals include IP telephones  or IP softphones . An IP telephone provides communications capability as analog or digital telephones provide except that communications are routed via the Internet or data network rather than via PSTN. An IP softphone  is a client-based telephony application for the desktop PC  or laptop  that has similar functionality as a desktop IP telephone .","At the remote end, the private branch exchange (PBX)  is a telephone system that supports enterprise users (college, government office, business, etc.) by answering and transferring inbound and outbound telephone calls to and from the PSTN  or Internet . All enterprise users share external telephone lines, i.e., trunk lines , which saves the cost of requiring a line for each user to the telephone company's central office (CO) (not shown but part of the PSTN ). PBXs  have evolved from being proprietary hardware\/software systems completely separate from the packet switched network or LAN  to systems running on off-the-shelf servers, interoperable with other servers through open standards and communicating via the LAN . Furthermore, the PBX  has evolved from strictly routing local and long distance telephone calls over the PSTN  to additionally providing the capability to route local and long distance telephone calls over the Internet  or over the LAN . The PBX  operating on packet switched networks allow the enterprise to reduce costs by maintaining one network instead of two (the data and telephone) and reducing charges from toll calls by routing some calls over the packet switched network  or Internet .","As shown generally in , B, C and  when a call is initiated using a wireless telephone  or a wireline telephone , ,  from outside or within an enterprise and sent via the PSTN , the calling party  dials the telephone number which is transmitted to the nearest central office (CO) (part of PSTN , ) along with a call set-up message (, ). The local exchange CO comprises one or more carrier class switches (not shown), which take calls and routes the calls to the proper destination based on the dialed number. If the call is a long distance call, the call goes from the local CO to a long distance carrier's class switch on route to the local CO nearest the called party. The call set-up message (, ; , ) for a call sent over the various switches is governed by standards, which are particular to the network in use.","As shown in , the local CO (which is part of the PSTN ) locates the remote end-point  using the dialed telephone number. Once the CO locates the remote end-point , the CO sends a call set-up message to the remote end-point  as shown in . If the remote endpoint  is on and not busy (, ), an alerting (ringing) signal is sent back to the CO and the CO forwards the alerting (ringing) signal to the calling party . The alerting signal tells the calling party the remote endpoint  has not answered the call. As shown in , once the called party goes off-hook, i.e., answers the telephone, the telephone at the remote endpoint (, ) sends a call-connect message (, ) to the CO. The CO forwards the call-connect message to the calling party (, ). Now the two endpoints will begin transmitting voice or data between them over the PSTN (, , ). A call termination message is sent by either the calling party or called party to disconnect, i.e., terminate the call (, , , , ; , ).","As shown in , the remote endpoint may be unavailable to answer the call; that is, the telephone is turned off, not connected, or busy, or the called party simply does not answer the call (, ; , ). In this case, if the called party does not have a \u201cfollow-me\u201d service (, ), the call is diverted to a multi-media message storage system (e.g., voice mail system) and the call is answered by the multi-media message storage system (, , , ). Once the calling party records the voicemail message (, ), the calling party terminates the call (, , , , ). As will be appreciated, when the called party  is busy and has no corresponding multi-media storage system, such as voice mail, a busy signal (not shown) may be returned by the remote endpoint to the calling party. When the calling party's endpoint receives the busy signal, a busy tone, which is different from the ring back tone played in response to the alerting signal , is played to the caller . If the called party has a \u201cfollow-me\u201d service (, ), the CO diverts the call to a pre-defined next location (, ) and tries to contact the called party at each \u201cfollow-me\u201d number administered for called party. If the called party is not available at any of the \u201cfollow-me\u201d numbers, the CO diverts the call to a multi-media storage system .","For IP desktop telephones (, ) or softphones (, ) sending calls via the Internet, using session initiation protocol (SIP) or H.323 protocol, the messages sent between the end-points to establish a call and set-up a communication channel are governed by the particular protocol in use. Regardless, the called party at the remote end-point is alerted to an incoming call by a standard ringing signal if the IP end-point is available (, ). Once the call is answered by the called party, the appropriate establishment and connection messages (, ) are sent via the Internet or over the data network. Otherwise the call is similarly diverted to a pre-defined next location (, ), such as a \u201cfollow-me\u201d number as administered in the service preferences, or a voice mail system (, ).","Unfortunately, neither wireline or wireless telephone systems or even paging services currently allow the called party to send a data\/bearer stream including voice, text, images or video to the calling party during initiation of a telephone call and before the called party answers the telephone. Mobile phones can be enabled to send and receive SMS or MMS signals. The short message service (SMS) protocol allows mobile users to send short text messages, and the multimedia message service (MMS) protocol allows mobile users to send multimedia messages. SMS also allows a mobile user to send short text messages to and receive text messages from email, paging services or informational services (such as receiving stock quotes). MMS adds images, text, audio clips and video to SMS messages. However, both SMS and MMS messages are not delivered during initiation of a telephone call.","The mobile switch center (not shown) sends SMS messages to a mobile message service center (not shown). If the mobile phone user is available, the SMS message is immediately deliverable to the recipient and the mobile message center sends the message to the recipient. Otherwise, the message is stored in the mobile message service center until the mobile user is available.","The mobile switch center (not shown) sends MMS messages to a mobile message service center (not shown). The message service center sends the sender a message confirmation that the message was sent. The message service center then sends the recipient a message notification that a new message has arrived. The recipient can download the message immediately or later. Once the recipient has successfully downloaded the message, the sender gets a message delivered confirmation message.","For mobile phones that use polyphonic ring tone technology, the mobile telephone user can download various high quality tones and administer his user preferences to play a particular tone on his phone when a particular incoming call arrives. Alternatively, the mobile telephone user can record his voice and administer his user preferences to play the recording of his voice on his phone when a particular person is calling or for any incoming call. These polyphonic ring tones are administered and recorded by the called party mobile telephone owner to play when a call is received from a calling party.","Current voice paging systems associated with telephones are typically used in a facility to broadcast messages to locate individuals or announce messages, such as emergencies or sales. When the paging system is used to locate individuals, the individual still needs to call back the person who initiated the page. The person initiating the page cannot use the paging system to initiate a telephone call to locate an individual. The person receiving the page cannot send a data\/bearer stream attached to the paging party before the called party answers the page.","These and other needs are addressed by the various embodiments of present invention. The present invention generally forwards a multi-media message from the first user of a called communication device to a second user of a calling communication device. The calling communication device plays the message to the second user before a bi-directional communication path is established between the first and second users.","In a first embodiment of the present invention, a method is provided that includes the steps:","(a) the calling communication device sends a call set-up message to the called communication device; and","(b) in response thereto, the called communication device sends a call establishment message (or reverse ring tone message) to the calling communication device. As used herein, a \u201ccall establishment message\u201d refers to any message exchanged between at least two communication devices or between a communication device and another computational component acting on the other communication device's behalf before a bi-directional communication path is established therebetween. The call establishment message can include a call alerting or ringing message, an acknowledge message, a call proceeding message, and the like.","The call establishment message includes a prerecorded message from the first party to the second party and\/or a request to open a bearer channel from the calling communication device to the called communication device. The prerecorded message can include voice, text, a picture, a holographic image and\/or a video multi-media message from the called party. The prerecorded message is played by the calling communication device, typically instead of a reverse ring tone or ringback tone, before the called party answers the Call.","The prerecorded message may be in band or out of band with the call. The message may be attached as a Multimedia Message Service or MMS message to a call establishment message or sent it as a text-message, such as a Short Message Service or SMS message, and converted into an audible message at the calling communication device using text-to-speech conversion techniques. The message may, for instance, be used to alert the calling party to the called party's identity and provide additional, information to the calling party that is important to the called party before the called party answers the call. The call may be sent via the PSTN, an IP network such as the Internet or over a data network. Of course, if the calling and called party endpoints (i.e., telephones or other communication device) allow for text, images and video, the recorded data\/bearer stream sent with the call set-up message to initiate the call may include text, images or video in addition to voice.","In a second embodiment of the present invention, the calling party may administer a special introductory ring tone on his telephone or communications device to play when the calling party receives a recorded message or data\/bearer stream from the called party. After the special introductory ring tone plays, the called party's message or the data\/bearer stream plays before the called party answers the call. This special introductory ring tone may be administered to play for any called party or for a particular called party.","In a further embodiment, the calling party and called party endpoints may publish and exchange information regarding multimedia capabilities. Once the endpoint multimedia capabilities are known, the calling party endpoint allows the calling party to send a voice, text, image, or video message attached to a call establishment message to the calling party.","In another embodiment, a user may configure various messages for differing sets of callers. When a person calls, the appropriate message is forwarded to the caller's communication device.","The embodiments of the present invention can offer advantages over the prior art. By way of example, the present invention can convey valuable information to a caller or discourage the caller from continuing with the call. An example of the former case is where a retailer sends to calling parties information, such as advertisements, that may lead to increased sales revenue. Another example is where the called party desires specific callers to try a different number where the callee may be currently located. An example of the latter case is where a private party sends to telemarketers a message to terminate immediately the call before the called party answers the call. This permits the called party to avoid the inconvenience of conveying the message verbally to the telemarketer. Although reverse ring tones or ringback-tones are currently in use, the ringback-tones are unable to convey a voice message from the callee to the caller. The use of customizable reverse ring tones provides communication device users with another modality through which to express their creativity\/individuality. Such expression is increasingly attractive to the consuming public.","As discussed previously, , B and C are examples of three different prior art network communication configurations. These network communication configurations are adaptable to enable the reverse ring tone message service (RRTMS) agent, which includes a client and server software. The RRTMS agent is an application programming interface (API) that communicates with the underlying network through function calls to perform its function. The RRTMS agent enables the communication network to provide important information either, as voice, text, image or video from a called party to a calling party before the called party answers a telephone. The RRTMS agent (client or server) interfaces with the various components of the communications network, such as the communication device, to recognize the reverse ring tone message (RRTM). The RRTMS agent allows the called party to record a RRTM attached to a call establishing message, such as a call alerting message. To adapt these network communication configurations to enable the reverse ring tone message service (RRTMS) several changes are required to various components of the network communications configurations. The communication networks include the PSTN , IP network , mobile switch center (not shown), etc.","To RRTMS-enable the calling or called party endpoint communication devices, the RRTMS agent client (, ) is stored in the calling and\/or calling party communication device (, ). The communication device can be wireless, satellite phones (not shown) or personal digital assistant (PDA) with telephony capability (not shown), wireline, such as analog, digital, ISDN, IP telephones, IP softphones, etc. The communication devices may embed the RRTMS agent client  as software stored in a storage device such as memory, flash card or hard-disk drive. Alternatively, the RRTMS agent client  may be incorporated in firmware or hardware. To facilitate the recording and storage of the RRTM message, the communication device may use memory, flash card, or a hard-disk storage device. In the calling party communication device , the RRTMS agent client  receives the RRTMS packet and interfaces with the other components in the calling party communication device to play the RRTMS message.","The RRTMS agent client  interfaces with the RRTMS agent server logic  embedded in software residing in the communication network, such as the CO  () to allow a called party to send and a calling party to receive RRTMS messages. Alternatively, the RRTMS agent server  may be incorporated in firmware or hardware. As shown in , communication device  communicates and interfaces with the RRTMS agent server  residing in CO  carrier class switch ,  memory  and in long distance carrier switch  memory . Alternatively, the RRTMS agent server  may reside, for example in other storage devices such as a flash card (not shown) or hard-disk storage device (not shown) on the CO  carrier switch ,  or long distance carrier switch .","The RRTMS agent client , for example, instructs the communication device to store a RRTM (voice message) in memory, i.e., a recording of a voice message beforehand. At the calling party endpoint, the RRTMS agent client  plays the RRTM over the speaker before the called party answers the call instead of the calling party endpoint playing the standard reverse ring tone or ringback tone. If the calling party endpoint includes multimedia capability, the RRTMS agent client  interfaces with the communication device memory  to buffer and plays any multimedia components of the RRTM message.","The RRTMS agent client  may create the RRTMS message, i.e., RRTM that is attached or associated with a call establishment message. RRTMS messages are subject to the same rules governing quality of service for the voice channel, such as conversion of an analog signal to a digital signal at the CO , PBX , or Gateway ; encryption; echo cancellation, etc. Otherwise, if the communication device  does not include the RRTMS agent client , the communication device  interfaces with the RRTMS agent server  logic to create the RRTMS message. Likewise, RRTMS messages created by the RRTMS agent server  are subject to the same rules governing quality of service for the voice channel.","Some mobile phones are multimedia messaging service (MMS) capable which allows the mobile telephone user to send and receive images, text, audio and video in a message. In an alternate embodiment, the calling party and called party RRTMS agent client  may negotiate endpoint multimedia capabilities. If both endpoints are MMS capable but the network ,  is not capable of handling RRTMS messages with multimedia components, the RRTMS agent client  on both endpoints may agree to record a multimedia message as an MMS message rather than as a RRTMS message with multimedia components. In this case, the called party endpoint will send the calling party, a call establishment message, such as a RRTMS alerting message (, ). The MMS data is recorded (, ) and sent (, ) after the endpoints exchange and negotiate multimedia capabilities (, ). Although the network  is identified as the Internet in , C, and B, it is to be understood that the network can be any data network and may employ protocols other than the Transfer Control or Internet Protocols.","Similarly, some mobile phones are short message service (SMS) capable which allows the mobile telephone user to additionally send and receive alphanumeric messages from mobile subscribers, email, paging and voice mail systems. If the calling party and called party RRTMS agent client  negotiate endpoint capabilities, both endpoints are SMS capable but the network ,  or device is not capable of handling a RRTMS text message, the RRTMS agent client  on both endpoints may agree to send the SMS message rather than convert the message to an RRTMS message with a text component. In this case, the called party endpoint will send the calling party, a call establishment message, such as a RRTMS alerting message (not shown). The SMS message is sent after the endpoints exchange and negotiate multimedia capabilities. At the calling party end, the SMS text message can be displayed on the mobile communication device or a text-to-speech converter may be used to convert the text to speech for the mobile user.","In some cases, a communication device may not be economically retrofitted to store the RRTMS agent client  or have sufficient memory to record or store an RRTM message. Additionally a calling or called party communication device may have the capability to receive and send voice but not the capability to receive one or more other multimedia components. In this case, a computer (not shown) that is integrated with the communication device may be used to store the RRTMS agent client  in the computer's storage device, such as memory, flash card, or hard-disk storage.","Alternatively, when the communication device does not include the RRTMS agent client  or have sufficient memory to record an RRTMS message, the calling party may purchase an RRTMS service plan from their local telephone company. This provides the calling party the same benefits a called party has if they had a RRTMS enabled communication device or at a minimum the capability to send a RRTM voice message. The called party may still administer the RRTMS service, at a minimum record and store a RRTM voice message or buffer a live RRTMS voice message using the local network facilities .","To use this service plan, the calling party may have an account requiring them to authenticate themselves with an account name and password. Once successfully authenticated, the called party is presented menu options to allow the called party to configure the RRTMS that he or she wants to send. For example, if the called party chooses to send a RRTM message, menu options will allow the calling party to record or delete a recorded message or store an RRTM message. The calling party may respond to the menu options using dual tone multi-frequency (DTMF) keys from the telephone keypad or voice recognition services.","In an alternative embodiment, the communication device may be capable of receiving and sending voice, text, images, and video. However, the calling party or called party may not have the capability to retrofit the communication device  to record or store a multimedia RRTM message. In this case, the calling or called party may purchase an RRTMS service plan from their local telephone company to administer the RRTMS service or record or store a RRTM multimedia message using the local network facilities . The account may require the calling or called party to authenticate themselves with an account name and password. Once successfully authenticated, the called party is presented with menu options to allow the called party to choose the RRTMS message he or she wants to send. For example, if the called party chooses to send a multimedia RRTM message, menu options will allow the called party to record or delete a recorded message or store an RRTM message As previously mentioned, the called party may respond to the menu options using dual tone multi-frequency (DTMF) keys from the telephone keypad or voice recognition services.","The RRTMS agent client  has administrable features. For example, the calling party may administer the RRTMS agent client  in the calling party communication device. One administrable feature may be whether to play the RRTM once or even repeatedly before the called party answers the call. This administered parameter may be for an RRTM received from any called party or from a specific called party. Hence, an RRTM from a family member may be administered to play repeatedly whereas an RRTM from the boss is played only once. Alternatively, the calling party may administer this feature from his account on a RRTMS service plan provided by the local telephone company. Another administrable feature is to disable playing the RRTM completely (e.g., repeatedly from family members, once from the boss, and never from the bank manager).","The calling party may administer the RRTMS agent client  to record and store a special introductory ring tone on the communications device to play when the calling party receives a RRTM. The RRTMS agent client  may play this special introductory ring tone before playing the RRTMS message from any called party or from a specific called party. Rather than the calling party communication device playing the standard ring tone for an incoming call. After the special introductory ring tone plays, the RRTM plays before the calling party answers the call. Alternatively, the calling party may administer this feature from his account on a RRTMS service plan provided by the local telephone company.","Some mobile telephones play polyphonic ring tones. In this case, the RRTMS agent client  interfaces with the software, firmware or hardware that selects, records and plays the polyphonic ring tone. The calling party may be allowed to administer the polyphonic ring tone to play as the special introductory ring tone on the communications device prior to playing the RRTM rather than the calling party communication device playing the standard ringback tone for an incoming call.","In an alternative embodiment, the called party may administer the RRTMS agent client  to use a previously recorded RRTM stored in the communication device memory  when a particular person calls. This allows the called party to select a previously recorded RRTM when the called party receives a call from a particular person.","Alternatively if the called party has an RRTMS service plan, the previously recorded RRTM may be stored on network facilities, such as in CO  carrier class switch ,  memory  or in long distance carrier switch  memory . This allows the called party to select a previously recorded RRTM when receiving a call from a particular person. As the called party may administer the communication device, the called party may administer the RRTMS agent server  to associate the previously recorded RRTM to a calling party when a call is received from the calling party.","In another alternative embodiment, the calling party and called party endpoints may administer a feature that allows the RRTMS agent client  to exchange information regarding multimedia capabilities. The RRTMS agent server residing in the CO  memory  or long distance carrier switch  memory  is administered to assist in the exchange of information between endpoints. Once the called party RRTMS agent client  knows the calling party communication device multimedia capabilities, the RRTMS agent client  may prevent the called party from sending inappropriate multimedia components to the calling party.","However, the calling party communication device may have an associated resource, such as text-to-speech (TTS) or automatic speech recognition (ASR), residing, for example, on an associated computer. The associated computer may have an associated monitor. If the calling party device is not capable to receive text or speech, the TTS or ASR resource may convert a multimedia component as administered by the calling party. For example if the communication device is not text capable, the calling party RRTMS agent client  will respond to the request for exchange of information and notify the called party RRTMS agent client  that a text component in the RRTM is receivable. The calling party communication device will not display the text. Instead, the calling party RRTMS agent client  will interface with the TTS resource and convert the text-to-speech and play the speech to the called party before the called party answers the call. Alternatively, the calling party communication device may not display the text but the associated computer monitor will display the text.","Similarly if the communication device is not capable of playing speech, the calling party RRTMS agent client  may respond to the request for exchange of information and notify the called party RRTMS agent client  that a speech component in the RRTM is receivable. The calling party communication device will not play the received speech. Instead, the calling party RRTMS agent client  will interface with the ASR resource and convert the speech to a transcript of the speech and display the transcript to the calling party before the calling party answers the call.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["750","754","758","762","750","764","768","768","772"]},"To RRTMS enable communication networks, such as the PSTN , Internet , or mobile switch center (not shown), the RRTMS agent server  interfaces with the network specific protocols used in the PSTN , Internet  or mobile switch center (not shown) to establish a RRTMS call and ensure the components of the RRTMS message are recognized and associated with the RRTMS call. As shown in , the RRTMS agent server  is located in the CO  carrier class switch ,  memory  or in the long distance carrier switch  memory .  shows a communication network that routes a call from the PSTN  to the Internet  to save on long distance toll charges. At the remote end, the call is routed to the PSTN  to the called party. In this case, a RRTMS agent server  additionally resides on the near and remote end Gateway  memory . The RRTMS agent server  ensures the RRTMS message is routed with the call through the Internet to the appropriate Gateway  and PSTN  at the remote end. For a wireless communication network, the RRTMS agent server may reside in memory within the mobile switch center (not shown). To RRTMS enable the enterprise communication network as shown in , the RRTMS agent server (not shown) resides in PBX  storage device, such as memory, flash card, or hard disk-drive (not shown).","There is no requirement the RRTMS agent server ,  is stored in memory, hence the RRTMS agent server ,  may be stored in a storage device, such as flash card or a hard-disk drive. Alternatively, the RRTMS agent server ,  may be incorporated in firmware or hardware.","To facilitate the recording of the RRTM message until the calling party answers the call, the PSTN , Internet , or data network  may include storage devices such as additional memory, flash card, or hard-disks.","The RRTMS agent server ,  interfaces with the network specific protocols to allow the RRTM or the live-RRTMS to be sent and received in-band, i.e., within the same channel (e.g., time slot or connection), as the signaling information. When required the RRTMS agent server ,  interfaces with the network specific protocols to allow the RRTMS message be sent out-of-band, i.e., a different channel (e.g., time slot or connection) is used for signaling and voice transmission. For those communication network protocols in the PSTN  that require out-of-band signaling, the RRTMS agent server ,  interfaces with the network specific protocol to open a short lived bearer (i.e., voice) channel between the called party endpoint and PSTN . Additionally, the RRTMS agent server ,  interfaces with the network specific protocol to open a short lived bearer (i.e., voice) channel between the PSTN  and the calling party endpoint to send the RRTM to the called party. Otherwise, if the voice and signaling information are sent within the same channel, i.e., in-band, the RRTMS agent server ,  interfaces with the network specific protocol software to include the RRTM or live-RRTMS message as part of the call establishment message.","For an Internet  or data network, such as a LAN (, ), call establishment messages are control messages and are not sent together with the voice transmission, i.e., this is out-of-band signaling. In this case, the RRTMS agent in the PBX (not shown) interfaces with the Internet Protocol (IP) call establishment messages to ensure the IP network recognizes the additional separate packets containing the RRTM voice message.","For mobile telephone users that have SMS or MMS enabled on their phones, the RRTMS agent server  on the mobile message service center (not shown) may convert the RRTM or live-RRTMS message to an MMS message. The RRTMS agent server  may then store the converted message in the mobile message service center.","An operational embodiment of the present invention will now be discussed with reference to FIGS.  and -.","The process starts when the caller initiates a call from his communication device. The caller's communication device generates and sends a call setup message to the local CO  within PSTN . The local CO  returns a call proceeding message  to the calling party  and sends the call set-up message to the called party endpoint . The called party endpoint receives the call setup message in step  and determines, in decision diamond , whether the called party has configured the device to respond with an RRTM. As noted, this determination may require the calling party's address to be mapped against a collection of electronic addresses to determine the appropriate RRTM, if any, to send to the particular caller. If the called party has configured the device to respond to the call setup message  with a RRTM, the agent  in the called communication device generates and sends, in step , an alerting message including the RRTM data (as shown). If the called party has not configured the device to respond to the call setup message  with a RRTM, the agent in the called communication device generates and sends, in step , the default (standard) alerting message (which does not contain a RRTM).","The alerting message is received by the local CO  within PSTN  and forwarded as alerting message to the calling party's communication device. In step , the calling party's communication device receives the alerting message  including the RRTM data. In decision diamond , the agent  in the calling party's communication device determines whether or not the alerting message includes RRTM data. If not (which is not the case in the depicted call flow of ), the device in step  plays a standard reverse ring tone or ringback tone to the calling party. If so (which is the case in the depicted call flow of ), the device in step  plays the RRTM to the calling party. After performing either step  or , the agent  in decision diamond  or , respectively, determines whether a call connect message  has been received from the called communication device. If not, the agent  waits a predetermined time in step  or , as appropriate, and repeats the applicable of steps  and  to repeat playback of the standard reverse ring tone or RRTM. As noted, the calling party's communication device may be configured to restrict the number of times the RRTM is played. If the call connect message is received, the agent  terminates operation.","When the called party answers the call, the called communication generates a call connect message , which is forwarded by the local CO  to the calling party's communication device. The calling and called party communication devices thereafter exchange data\/voice information.","When either the calling party or called party hangs up, i.e., terminates the call, a call terminate message is sent from the endpoint that terminated the call to the local CO . The local CO  sends an acknowledge message to the party that terminated the call and sends the call terminate message to the remote endpoint to notify the remote endpoint the other party terminated the call. The remote endpoint sends an acknowledge message to the local CO .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0067"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},"To initiate the call, the calling party, dials the called party's telephone number. A call set-up message  including the dialed telephone number is sent to the local CO  within PSTN . The local CO  returns a call proceeding message  to the calling party  and sends the call set-up message to the called party endpoint . The called party endpoint receives the call setup message and, in response, sends an RRMS alerting message, including a request for information regarding multimedia capabilities at the remote endpoint. The local CO  forwards the message to the calling endpoint. The calling party endpoint responds with a RRTMS-MMS Call Capabilities message  that includes the multimedia capabilities of the called party telephone.","At the called party endpoint, the RRTMS enabled telephone allows the called party to record and send a RRTM message which includes the multimedia components that match the calling party's telephone multimedia capabilities . This recorded RRTM message is sent in a RRTMS-MMS data message to the calling party endpoint.","At the calling party endpoint, the recorded RRTMS MMS message, i.e., RRTM message with multimedia components, the RRTM with MMS components, or RRTM with SMS component plays  instead of the standard reverse ring tone or ringback tone to confirm to the calling party that the call is ringing on the called party's endpoint. The recorded RRTM with multimedia components, MMS or SMS message will play once or repeatedly on the calling party's telephone depending how the calling party administered the RRTMS agent client  on his telephone.","If the called party answers the call , the called party endpoint sends the call connect message to the local CO  which sends the message to the calling party local CO . The calling party local CO  sends the call connect message  to the calling party  to establish the call between the calling party and the called party. When either the calling party or called party hangs up, i.e., terminates the call, a call terminate message  is sent from the endpoint that terminated the call to the local CO . The local CO  sends an acknowledge message  to the party that terminated the call and sends the call terminate message to the remote endpoint to notify the remote endpoint the other party terminated the call. The remote endpoint sends an Acknowledge message to the local CO .","Finally, nothing limits the RRTMS enabled network to a PSTN  network. The RRTMS enabled network may include Internet , a mobile switch center (not shown) or a combination including an enterprise network, such as shown in .","As will be appreciated, numerous other embodiments may be envisioned using the teachings of the present invention.","For example, other circuit-switched or packet-switched protocols may be used to define the various call flows. Examples of such protocols include SIP, H.323, Integrated Services Digital Network or ISDN, and the like.","The present invention, in various embodiments, includes components, methods, processes, systems and\/or apparatus substantially as depicted and described herein, including various embodiments, subcombinations, and subsets thereof.
