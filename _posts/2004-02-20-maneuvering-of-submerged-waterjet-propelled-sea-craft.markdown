title: Maneuvering of submerged waterjet propelled sea craft
abstract: The stern hull portion of a sea craft through which main exit flow channels extend to projecting jet propulsion nozzles, is provided with facilities for controlled maneuvering of the sea craft, including steering, stopping, negative thrust backing and docking without substantial hydrodynamic loading and with facilitated installation. Such maneuvering control facilities include a secondary flow channel extending from each of the main exit flow channels having two angularly related subchannel branches for pressurized water outflow through gated openings in the hull from which propulsion jets emerge under maneuvering control. Either control of a subchannel diverting flapper, or by use of selective closure gates and a flow diverting flap within the main exit flow channel, maneuvering may be effected in response to inflow through inlet openings in the hull of water that is pressurized before supply to the main exit flow channels.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefore.","The present invention relates to the maneuvering of sea craft having water jet propulsors.","Water jet propulsion of marine vessel hulls as compared to screw propeller systems are more flexible in usage, involve less mechanical equipment for hull installation and provide for improved maneuverability of the ship being propelled. Conventional maneuvering systems for water jet propulsors include water intake motors and pumps for water inflow through hull inlets and accelerated nozzle outflow of the propulsion jets above the hull waterline. Heretofore commercial ships with such water jet propulsors utilized jet deflecting buckets, sleeves and vanes for effective steering and backing purposes, involving above water jet discharge.","According to U.S. Pat. No. 6,171,159 issued January 2001 to Shen et al., surface ships propelled by underwater jet discharge are provided with steering and backing types of maneuvering systems, not suitable however for a submerged sea craft. It is therefore an important object of the present invention to provide for simplified and efficient controlled maneuvering of a submerged sea craft with water jet propulsors, involving steering, backing and stopping operations.","In accordance with the present invention, all maneuvering operations of an underwater jet propulsion system are performed by selectively controlled diversion of pressurized water through main water flow channels into secondary flow channels past flow smoothing vanes for controlled outflow discharge as the propulsion jets emerging from openings in the hull in one direction perpendicular to the hull centerline for steering purposes and in another direction at an acute negative thrust angle for backing and stopping purposes. Such directional outflow discharge jets are conducted to the hull openings from the secondary channels through subchannel branches under selective control of either closure gates at the hull openings or hinged juncture flow diverting flappers between the subchannels branches.","Referring now to the drawing in detail,  illustrate the stern portion of an underwater submerged ship or sea craft  having a generally conical-shaped hull  enclosing a ballast tank therein. The craft  is propelled in a forward direction by water jet propulsion on the stern portion of the hull  as generally known in the art, involving four (4) main tubular water outflow channels  extending from propulsors as disclosed for example in U.S. Pat. No. 6,171,159 to Shen et al. The channels  extend through the stern portion of the hull  in parallel spaced relation to the hull centerline . Stern outflow nozzles  at the ends of the channels  project from the hull  for emergence of propelling water jets  as shown in . Conventional rudders  are mounted on and project from the hull  between the main channels , spaced forwardly of the nozzles  along the hull centerline .","The foregoing referred to jet propulsion system for the sea craft , with which the four main water outflow channels  are associated, includes water inlets  on the hull  located adjacent to motor driven pump units  as shown in  for pressurizing water received within the channels  so as to emerge from the stern nozzles  as the propulsion jets . A pair of outflow gates  and  are formed in the hull  in alignment with each of the main channels , pursuant to the present invention as hereinafter explained.","Referring now to , positioned within the stern portion of the hull  between each of the four main flow channels  and an associated pair of the gates  and  aligned therewith is a secondary flow channel  which is connected to the main channel  at an opening  formed therein. Positioned within a streamlined convergent inlet section of the secondary flow channel  adjacent the opening  are guide vanes  for smoothing water inflow. An angularly related subchannel branch  extends from the secondary flow channel  into a sidewall outlet  projecting inwardly from the hull  at an acute angle to the centerline  as shown in . The gate  is hinged to the hull  within the outlet , while the other gate  is hinged to the hull  at a sidewall outlet  into which a subchannel branch  extends from the secondary channel . Also hinged to the main channel  at the opening  therein is a flap  pivotally connected to an actuator .","As also shown in , pressurized water flow is confined to each of the main channels  when the openings  associated therewith are closed by the flaps  for emergence of the water propelling jets  from the nozzles . With both of the gates  and  closed, straight course normal propulsion of the hull  is effected by the jets  in the direction of the centerline  without any hydrodynamic impact.","Under zero or low speed conditions the gate  is rotated about its hinge  into the hull  to open the outlet  as shown in , while the flap  is displaced about its hinge  to a position fully blocking exit outflow from the end nozzle . Flow is then diverted by the flap  from the main channel  into the secondary flow channel  through the opening . Exit jet flow from the hull  then occurs through the secondary channel  and the branch  past the opened gate  for emergence from the outlet  as a jet  in a direction perpendicular to the centerline  to produce side force and turning moment on the hull  for ship steering purposes. The guide vanes  smooth such flow from the main channel  into the secondary channel . The differential pressure on the gate  is small, so that the force required to open and close the gate  is small. Since the exit jet vector  associated with outflow past the opened gate  is perpendicular to the ship centerline  as indicated in , a large steering moment arm is obtained for efficient ship steering and docking.","As shown in , the flap  is rotated into the main channel  to a position at an angle \u03b2 between the channel side wall and the flap  so as to divert only a portion of the main channel flow into the secondary channel  during travel at forward speeds. A diverted flow portion Qin the secondary channel  then exits therefrom past the opened gate  for steering purposes. The flow portion Qcontinuing through the main channel  past the flap  will then exit the nozzle end  for forward motion propulsion of the hull . The leading edge  of the flap  is rounded so as to improve hydrodynamic performance. There is a relationship between channel branch flows Qand total main channel flow Qdenoted as Q=Q\u2212Q, where the flap angle \u03b2 and the flow portion Qmay be varied to provide the desired design speed and steering capability.","Referring now to , it denotes an acute angle \u03b3 between flow through the subchannel branch  and the hull centerline , corresponding to that of a negative backing thrust (F) induced by an outflow jet  from the outlet  at a jet velocity (V) past the gate  opened by inward displacement into the hull  for backing and stopping purposes under low speed conditions. Negative thrust (F) for backing purposes, is reflected by the equations F=\u03c1QVCos\u03b3=\u03c1QACos\u03b3. Maneuvering control is exercised in accordance with the foregoing relationships between flow, speed and thrust, as well as water density (\u03c1), flow rate (Q), jet velocity (V) and flow area (A) of the outlet  at the exit gate .","As diagrammed in , the pump units  are driven by reversible motors  while the gates  and  as well as sidewall flaps as hereinafter described are displaced under control of a maneuvering control network . Operation of the pump motors  and the control network  for maneuvering of the craft  as hereinbefore explained is effected by an electric power supply  through a switching control system  of the propulsion system.","Referring now to , a modification of the embodiment illustrated in  is shown, wherein the gate  is replaced by a gate \u2032 hinged to the hull  radially outward of an inclined sidewall outlet \u2032 opened by rotation of the gate \u2032 outwardly from the hull . The advantage of such location gate \u2032 is that it may be angularly adjusted to directionally regulate the outflow of a jet \u2032 for backing and stopping purposes.","According to the embodiments of the present invention as hereinbefore described, the pair of gates  and  or \u2032 and  are provided on the surface of the hull  for use in association with each of the four main flow channels . According to yet another embodiment as illustrated in  only one gate , larger than the gates , \u2032 and , is provided on the stern portion surface of the hull  for use with each main flow channel . The gate  is directly hinged to the hull  on top of an outlet  through which an exit jet  emerges in a direction perpendicular to the hull centerline  for steering maneuver purposes. The secondary channel  with the guide vanes  therein is provided at the opening  in the main flow channel ; with the side wall flap  hinged for angular displacement between positions as hereinbefore described. However pursuant to the embodiment shown in , two outflow subchannels branches  and  are connected to the secondary channel , with a flapper  hinged at a juncture between the subchannel branches  and  to directionally control flow into one of the subchannel branches  and  to the hull opening outlet . The flap  is rotated to the fully closed position while the gate  is rotated to a fully closed position by an actuator  for normal operation.","When steering is needed under a zero or low speed condition, such as a docketing maneuver, the gate  is in the fully opened position for outflow of the exit jet  from both of the subchannel branches  and , with the flapper  positioned between the subchannel branches  and . With the flapper  closing the subchannel branch  as shown in , flow is then diverted only through the subchannel branch  in a direction perpendicular to the hull centerline  to thereby effect outflow of the steering control jet  from the hull opening outlet  during forward speed of travel, with the control flap  rotated to the acute angle (\u03b2) position shown to only direct a portion of flow through the main channel  into the secondary channel .","For backing and stopping purposes the flapper  is rotated to the position shown in  totally diverting flow from the secondary channel  into the curved subchannel branch . Outflow of the jet  is then directed from the branch  through the hull opening outlet  at an angle \u03b3, while flow to the nozzle  is blocked by the flap .","Obviously, other modifications and variations of the present invention may be possible in light of the foregoing teachings. It is therefore to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING","p":["A more complete appreciation of the invention and many of its attendant advantages will be readily appreciated as the same becomes better understood by reference to the following detailed description when considered in connection with the accompanying drawing wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["2","2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"],"b":["3","3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":["FIGS. 3A","FIG. 3"],"b":["3","3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3"],"b":["4","4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIGS. 1\u20134"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":["FIGS. 7A and 7B","FIG. 7"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 7"],"b":["8","8"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
