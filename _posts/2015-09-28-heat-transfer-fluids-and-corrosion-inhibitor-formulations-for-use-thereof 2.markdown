{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATIONS","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","Examples"],"p":["This is a continuation-in-part of prior application Ser. No. 14\/087,796, filed Nov. 22, 2013 (U.S. Pat. No. 9,145,613), which in turn is a continuation of prior application Ser. No. 13\/606,452, filed Sep. 7, 2012 (U.S. Pat. No. 8,617,416). The entire contents of both of these documents are incorporated herein by reference.","The present teachings relate generally to heat transfer fluids and, in some embodiments, to heat transfer fluids for inhibiting corrosion in heat transfer systems.","Modern vehicle engines may use a heat transfer fluid (e.g., liquid coolant) to provide long-lasting, year-round protection of their cooling systems. A key function of heat transfer fluids is to transfer excess heat from an engine to a radiator for dissipation. Efficient heat transfer and control of engine temperature leads to efficient fuel economy and lubrication, and may prevent engine failures due to freeze-up, boiling-over, or over-heating. Ideally, engine coolant may also serve to provide corrosion protection of cooling system metals (e.g., over a range of different temperature and operating conditions).","Common corrosion-related problems that may arise in automotive cooling systems include: (1) cavitation corrosion and rusting of cylinder heads and cylinder blocks; (2) seal leakage, bellows seal failure, and cavitation corrosion in water pumps; (3) solder bloom, scale and deposit formation, and pitting in radiators and heater cores; (4) thermostat sticking; and\/or (5) crevice corrosion at hose necks. In addition, erosion-corrosion, galvanic corrosion, under-deposit corrosion, and\/or stray-current corrosion may occur at susceptible locations in a cooling system depending on conditions.","Different kinds of metals may be used to fabricate the various parts of a cooling system. By way of example, cast iron and cast aluminum alloys may be used for cylinder blocks, cylinder heads, intake manifolds, coolant pumps, and power electronic device enclosures; wrought aluminum and copper alloys may be used for radiators and heater cores; solders may be used to join the components of brass or copper radiators or heater cores; steel may be used for cylinder head gaskets and for small components such as freeze plugs, coolant pump housing enclosures, and coolant pump impellers; and copper alloys may be used in thermostats.","Corrosion protection of components manufactured from aluminum or aluminum alloys (e.g., engine block, cylinder head, water pump, heat exchangers, and the like), corrosion protection of heat transfer system components produced by a controlled atmosphere brazing (CAB) process (e.g., heat exchangers), and corrosion protection at high temperature (e.g., in cooling systems for vehicles equipped with exhaust gas recirculation or EGR) are of particular interest.","The scope of the present invention is defined solely by the appended claims, and is not affected to any degree by the statements within this summary.","By way of introduction, a first heat transfer fluid concentrate in accordance with the present teachings includes (a) a freezing point depressant, water, or a combination thereof; (b) a carboxylate; (c) an inorganic phosphate; (d) an azole compound; (e) calcium ions in a concentration ranging from about 1 mg\/L to about 60 mg\/L based on a total weight of the heat transfer fluid concentrate; and (f) a water-soluble polymer.","A second heat transfer fluid concentrate in accordance with the present teachings includes (a) a freezing point depressant, water, or a combination thereof, wherein the freezing point depressant is present in an amount ranging from about 15 wt. % to about 99% wt. % based on a total weight of the heat transfer fluid concentrate; (b) a C-Ccarboxylate in an amount ranging from about 1 wt. % to about 10 wt. % based on the total weight of the heat transfer fluid concentrate, wherein the C-Ccarboxylate is selected from the group consisting of an aliphatic mono-carboxylate, an aliphatic di-carboxylate, an aromatic mono-carboxylate, an aromatic di-carboxylate, and a combination thereof; (c) an inorganic phosphate selected from the group consisting of an orthophosphate, phosphoric acid, and a combination thereof, wherein a phosphate ion concentration in the heat transfer fluid concentrate ranges from about 0.002 wt. % to about 5 wt. % based on the total weight of the heat transfer fluid; (d) an azole compound in an amount from about 0.01 wt. % to about 3 wt. % based on the total weight of the heat transfer fluid concentrate; (e) calcium ions in a concentration ranging from about 1 mg\/L to about 60 mg\/L based on a total weight of the heat transfer fluid concentrate; and (f) an acrylate-based polymer. A ratio of a concentration of the acrylate-based polymer to the concentration of the calcium ions is greater than about 4 and less than about 110.","A ready-to-use heat transfer fluid in accordance with the present teachings includes water and a heat transfer fluid concentrate of a type described above. The heat transfer fluid concentrate is present in an amount ranging from about 40 vol. % to about 60 vol. % based on a total volume of the heat transfer fluid.","A method in accordance with the present teachings for preventing corrosion in a heat transfer system includes contacting at least a portion of the heat transfer system with a heat transfer fluid of a type described above.","In accordance with the present teachings, heat transfer fluid concentrates and ready-to-use heat transfer fluids derived from heat transfer fluid concentrates (e.g., by dilution with water) exhibit a synergistic effect between the components of the formulation with respect to corrosion inhibition. As further described below, the synergistic heat transfer fluid concentrates and ready-to-use heat transfer fluids derived therefrom contain calcium ions (e.g., such as may be derived from one or more water-soluble calcium salts).","It is to be understood that elements and features of the various representative embodiments described below may be combined in different ways to produce new embodiments that likewise fall within the scope of the present teachings.","By way of general introduction, in a heat transfer fluid concentrate comprising a freezing point depressant (e.g., ethylene glycol), water, a carboxylate, an inorganic phosphate, and an azole compound, a synergistic effect is observed between calcium ions and a water-soluble polymer (e.g., an acrylate-based polymer), as shown by corrosion test data and storage test data. In some embodiments, the optimal performance is observed when a concentration of the calcium ions ranges from about 1 mg\/L to about 60 mg\/L based on a total weight of the heat transfer fluid concentrate, and\/or when a ratio of active acrylate-based polymer concentration to the calcium ion concentration in the heat transfer fluid concentrate is greater than about 4 and less than about 110.","In some embodiments, a heat transfer fluid concentrate in accordance with the present teachings includes: a freezing point depressant, water, or a combination thereof; a carboxylate; an inorganic phosphate; an azole compound; calcium ions; and a water-soluble polymer.","Heat transfer fluid concentrates in accordance with the present teachings may include a freezing point depressant.

In some embodiments, the pH of a heat transfer fluid concentrate in accordance with the present teachings at 50% concentration is between about 7.2 and about 9.0. In some embodiments, a heat transfer fluid concentrate in accordance with the present teachings is free from silicate, borate, and amines and has a nitrate concentration of less than about 50 ppm as NO.","In some embodiments, a heat transfer fluid concentrate in accordance with the present teachings is a single-phase, homogeneous solution at room temperature. In some embodiments, a heat transfer fluid concentrate in accordance with the present teachings is storage stable at a temperature between about \u221210\u00b0 C. and +100\u00b0 C. In some embodiments, a heat transfer fluid concentrate and\/or a ready-to-use heat transfer fluid derived therefrom (e.g., by dilution) will meet the properties and performance requirements of ASTM D3306.","In some embodiments, a heat transfer fluid concentrate in accordance with the present teachings may be diluted (e.g., with water) to form a heat transfer fluid. For example, in some embodiments, the heat transfer fluid concentrate may be diluted by about 10 vol. % to about 75 vol. % to form a heat transfer fluid. In some embodiments, the water used for dilution is deionized water as described in Section 4.5 of ASTM D3306-10.","In some embodiments, heat transfer fluid concentrate in accordance with the present teachings may be provided as a commercially available product. In other embodiments, a ready-to-use heat transfer fluid in which the heat transfer fluid concentrate has been pre-diluted to around 50 vol. % with water may be provided as a commercially available product. In preparing a ready-to-use heat transfer fluid by dilution, the optimal level of water added to the heat transfer concentrate at use conditions may be determined by the desired freeze-up, boil-over, and corrosion protection requirements.","Heat transfer fluid concentrate that has not been diluted by adding water is typically not used in an engine cooling system as a heat transfer fluid due to its relatively low heat transfer coefficient (or specific heat), high viscosity, and high freeze point. Thus, heat transfer fluid concentrates may be diluted (e.g., to 40 vol. % to 60 vol. % solutions) by adding water before being used in engine cooling systems as heat transfer fluids. Vehicle manufacturers typically use 50 vol. % heat transfer concentrate diluted by water as factory fill fluid in vehicle cooling systems. Heat transfer fluid products that are pre-diluted by water to contain about 40 vol. % to about 60 vol. % heat transfer fluid concentrate are ready-to-use coolants because no additional water is needed when they are added into a vehicle cooling system.","In a ready-to-use heat transfer fluid, the freezing point depressant may be present in an amount of about 1 wt. % to less than about 90 wt. %, based on the total weight of the ready-to-use heat transfer fluid.

Also, within this range, the amount of the freezing point depressant may be less than or equal to about 30 wt. %, less than or equal to about 40 wt. %, less than or equal to about 50 wt. %, less than or equal to about 55 wt. %, less than or equal to about 60 wt. %, less than or equal to about 70 wt. %, less than or equal to about 75 wt. %, less than or equal to about 80 wt. %, less than or equal to about 85 wt. %, less than or equal to about 86 wt. %, less than or equal to about 87 wt. %, less than or equal to about 88 wt. %, or less than or equal to about 89 wt. %, but more than about 1 wt. % based on the total weight of the ready-to-use heat transfer fluid.","In the ready-to-use heat transfer fluid, the carboxylate may be present in an amount of about 0.5 wt. % to about 8 wt. %, based on the total weight of the ready-to-use heat transfer fluid. Within this range, the amount may be greater than or equal to about 0.6 wt. %, or, in some embodiments, greater than or equal to about 0.7 wt. %. Also within this range, the amount may be less than or equal to about 7 wt. %, or, in some embodiments, less than or equal to about 6 wt. %.","In the ready-to-use heat transfer fluid, the inorganic phosphate may be present in an amount of about 0.05 wt. % to about 0.4 wt. % based on the total weight of the ready-to-use heat transfer fluid.

Also within this range, the amount may be less than or equal to about 0.35 wt. %, or, in some embodiments, less than or equal to about 0.30 wt. %.","In the ready-to-use heat transfer fluid, the azole compound may be present in an amount of about 0.005 wt. % to about 2 wt. %, based on the total weight of the ready-to-use heat transfer fluid. Within this range, the azole compound may be present in an amount greater than or equal to about 0.007 wt. %, or, in some embodiments, greater than or equal to about 0.01 wt. %. Also within this range, the azole compound may be present in an amount less than or equal to about 1.5 wt. %, or, in some embodiments, less than or equal to about 1 wt. %.","In the ready-to-use heat transfer fluid, the calcium compound may be present in an amount such that the ready-to-use heat transfer fluid has a calcium ion concentration of greater than about 0.5 ppm based on the total weight of the ready-to-use heat transfer fluid. Within this range, the amount of calcium ions may be less than about 60 ppm. Also within this range, the amount of calcium ions may be less than or equal to about 40 ppm.","The pH of the ready-to-use heat transfer fluid may be between about 7.0 and about 9.5 at room temperature. Within this range, the pH may be greater than or equal to about 7.5 or, in some embodiments, greater than or equal to about 7.8. Also within this range, the pH may be less than or equal to about 9.0 or, in some embodiments, less than or equal to about 8.8.","A method of preventing corrosion in accordance with the present teachings includes contacting a ready-to-use heat transfer fluid of a type described herein with a heat transfer system. The heat transfer system may include one or a plurality of components made by controlled atmosphere brazing (i.e., CAB). In some embodiments, the heat transfer system may include aluminum.","It is also contemplated that in some applications, such as heavy duty engines, it may be desirable to incorporate one or more additional corrosion inhibitors (e.g., including but not limited to nitrites, molybdates, and\/or the like, salts thereof, and combinations thereof).","The ready-to-use heat transfer fluid is further demonstrated by the following non-limiting examples.
