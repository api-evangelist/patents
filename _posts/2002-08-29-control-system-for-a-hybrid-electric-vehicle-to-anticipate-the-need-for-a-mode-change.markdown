title: Control system for a hybrid electric vehicle to anticipate the need for a mode change
abstract: A parallel hybrid electric vehicle method and system including an internal combustion engine (ICE), an electric traction motor/generator, and a controller. A control strategy is provided to prevent unpredicted or undesired engine starts by anticipating the need for the vehicle engine, while avoiding “false starting” the engine or allowing an annoying lag in performance that will occur if the engine is not started in advance of an actual requirement. The invention anticipates the need for engine starts by monitoring vehicle speed and driver demand and their rates of change. The invention allows consistent performance and operates in a manner pleasing to the customer because a substantially constant drive force is maintained.

No. 09\/686,472, filed Oct. 11, 2000, now abandoned.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates generally to hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), and specifically to a method and system to improve the efficiency and drivability of a HEV by monitoring vehicle control variables and their rate of change, whereby driver demand is anticipated so that unpredicted or undesired engine false starts and performance lags are prevented.","2. Background Art","The need to reduce fossil fuel consumption and undesirable engine exhaust gas emissions from vehicles powered by an internal combustion engine (ICE) is well known. Vehicles powered by battery-powered electric traction motors have attempted to address this need. However, electric vehicles have limited operating range and limited power capabilities. They also require substantial time to recharge their batteries. An alternative solution is to combine an ICE and an electric traction motor in one vehicle. Such vehicles are typically called hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). See generally, U.S. Pat. No. 5,343,970 (Severinsky). HEVs reduce both undesirable exhaust gas emissions and fuel consumption because a smaller engine can be used. Under certain conditions, the engine can be turned off.","The HEV has been described in a variety of configurations. Many known HEV designs use systems in which an operator is required to select between electric and internal combustion engine operation. In other configurations, the electric motor drives one set of wheels, and the ICE drives a different set of wheels.","Other, more useful, configurations include, for example, a series hybrid electric vehicle (SHEV), which is a vehicle with an engine (most typically an ICE) that powers a generator. The generator, in turn, provides electric power for a battery and an electric traction motor coupled to the drive wheels of the vehicle. No mechanical connection exists between the engine and the drive wheels. Another useful configuration is a parallel hybrid electrical vehicle (PHEV), which is a vehicle with an engine (most typically an ICE), battery, and electric traction motor that combine to provide torque to the drive wheels of the vehicle.","A parallel\/series hybrid electric vehicle (PSHEV) has characteristics of both the PHEV and the SHEV. The PSHEV is also known as a torque (or power) split powertrain configuration. In the PSHEV, the engine torque can be used to power a motor\/generator and\/or contribute to the necessary traction wheel or output shaft torque. The motor\/generator generates electrical power for the battery, or it can act as a traction motor to contribute to the necessary wheel or output shaft torque. The traction motor\/generator can be used also to recover braking energy to the battery if a regenerative braking system is used.","The desirability of combining the ICE with an electric motor\/generator is clear. Fuel consumption and undesirable engine exhaust gas emissions are reduced with no appreciable loss of performance or range of the vehicle. Nevertheless, there remains substantial room for development of ways to optimize HEV operation. This includes the need to ensure that vehicle drivability is consistent, predictable and pleasing to the customer while also maintaining efficiency.","Factors involved in achieving an acceptable level of HEV drivability are the frequency and character of engine-start-and engine-stop events. Frequent engine starts and stops can be annoying, especially if they do not occur in response to any conscious input from the vehicle driver.","Some engine starts and stops are dictated by an energy management strategy (EMS) that seeks to combine the engine and motor drives to achieve maximum fuel economy. For example, the EMS might start the engine whenever demand exceeds a predetermined motive power threshold. Also, the engine must start when driver demand for power is in excess of that available from the electric system.","Frequent, annoying, high-emission, and engine-wearing \u201cfalse starts\u201d can occur when the engine is started in response to what later proves to be a very brief demand for power in excess of the motive power threshold but still within the drive capabilities. This can occur when quickly pulling out into otherwise slow traffic or surging forward in heavy traffic. Alternatively, starting an engine poses a challenge because its torque is not available instantaneously. An annoying lag in performance will occur if the engine is not started somewhat in advance of the actual engine torque requirement.","An HEV system controller (VSC) must, therefore, control two mode transitions. The first is the transition from a vehicle at rest with the engine off to a vehicle using electric power. The second is the transition from electric driving to engine power in response to an increase in driver demand. (This driver demand transition should not be confused with a less time critical version of the same transition when the engine is started because of a need to charge a battery.) The timely preparation for these transitions is achieved by \u201canticipators\u201d.","A converterless multiple ratio automatic transmission of the kind that may be used in a parallel hybrid electric vehicle powertrain is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 6,217,479, where an engine crankshaft is connected through a damper assembly and a disconnect clutch to the torque input element of multiple-ratio gearing without an intervening torque converter. A continuously slipping forward-drive clutch during an engine-engage operating mode is used, thereby avoiding a need for a separate startup clutch. The lack of a startup clutch, as well as the lack of a hydrokinetic torque converter, reduces the inertia mass which permits a faster response to a command force startup torque at the vehicle wheels.","A control strategy for a hybrid powertrain of the kind disclosed in the '479 patent is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,364,807. The control strategy of the '807 patent includes a closed-loop clutch pressure modulation technique to effect a smooth transition from an electric motor drive mode to an internal combustion engine drive mode. This is done in cooperation with a control of the fuel supply during the transition. The electric motor in this HEV powertrain may act as an inertial starter, wherein the electric motor freely accelerates up to idle speed where the engine-driven pump has full hydraulic pressure for the clutch following continuously slipping clutch operation during startup.","Another hybrid vehicle powertrain using a multiple-ratio transmission without a torque converter and having a startup clutch located between the induction motor and the engine crankshaft is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,176,808. An auxiliary launch torque is supplied by the motor during startup in the design of the '808 patent, and regenerative braking with the internal combustion engine inactive is available for charging the battery when the vehicle is in a coast mode.","In HEV operating strategies of the kind described in these prior art patents, the decision to start the engine in response to driver demand is based on vehicle speed and driving torque. The drive power is calculated using torque and motor speed. The total power required for the HEV is not only the drive power, but also power for all other loads, such as accessory load and climate control load. If this total required power exceeds a predetermined threshold for the motor, engine power and, therefore, engine start is required. If the total required power is below a predetermined value, the motor solely provides torque to the powertrain. A hysteresis loop is included in these predetermined values to prevent mode \u201cchattering\u201d when the vehicle nears these power thresholds.","A problem with this prior art system is apparent in an intermediate power range above the power below which it is more efficient to drive with the motor on (perhaps five to ten kW for a typical compact to mid-size vehicle), and below the peak electric-only power capability required for acceptable engine-off launch (twenty to forty kW for the same vehicle). While driving in electric-only mode, a momentary demand for power in this intermediate power range should be met without repetitive starting the engine, and then immediately stopping it. Therefore, a new anticipator strategy is required to improve efficiency and drivability of the HEV by anticipating the need for a driving state or mode change as close as possible to a predetermined optimal moment to create a seamless transition while reducing or eliminating engine \u201cfalse starts\u201d.","It is possible to effect an instantaneous response of the powertrain to a driver command using a so-called feed roller torque calculation. This strategy would anticipate the torque requirements following a command for an increased torque or a decreased torque by calculating a leading indicator of engine torque. That indicator is used to develop a transmission line pressure that is appropriate for a subsequent ratio change and a subsequent driving torque requirement by anticipating the engine torque required following a response to an engine torque request by the driver. This torque feed-forward technique is further refined in a control system described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,253,140 where the engagement of the clutch, as the gear ratio change nears completion, is controlled with a pressure-shaping function used to reduce the desired slip rate to effect a smooth termination of the slip of one friction element as a companion friction element during a ratio change gains torque-transmitting capacity. This is achieved using an adaptive engagement technique so that the engagement characteristics of the controller can be learned during a ratio change and used in a subsequent ratio change. In this way, ratio change smoothness can be achieved by compensating for driveline variables such as changes in coefficients of friction due to clutch wear, for example, and due to changes in spring loads at the friction element actuators.","Another example of a converterless multiple-ratio transmission is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,299,565 wherein the clutches, during a ratio change, are controlled by a strategy that makes it possible to achieve maximum vehicle acceleration using a controllable wet clutch between the engine and the input of a synchronous transmission.","Another example of a hybrid electric vehicle powertrain is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,316,904 wherein the induction motor is controlled using a speed sensorless controller.","The control systems of these prior art patents do not describe nor suggest an anticipator function for anticipating the need for a driving state change so that an optimal seamless transition between driving state modes can be achieved.","A successful \u201canticipator\u201d function must predict either: 1) that the demand power is likely to remain higher than a motive power threshold, but well within the motor and battery capacities so that the engine will be started in as seamless a manner as possible; or 2) that the demand power is likely to exceed the motor and battery capacities within a very short time, and the engine should be started quickly in a \u201ckick-down\u201d fashion. In the latter case, sufficient motor torque must be held in reserve to compensate for the sudden load of the slewing engine.","Accordingly, an objective of the present invention is to improve the drivability and efficiency of a parallel hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) powertrain system so that the vehicle has predictable drivability as perceived by the vehicle operator.","Specifically, it is an object of the present invention to provide a strategy to prevent unpredicted or undesired engine starts by anticipating the need for the vehicle engine, while not \u201cfalse starting\u201d the engine or allowing an annoying lag in the engine's performance. This is achieved by the control of the present invention by monitoring both vehicle speed and driver demand, as well as their rates of change.","It is a further objective of the invention to provide an anticipator strategy that is a mathematical function of a predetermined set of system variables such as master cylinder brake pressure (MCP), throttle position, vehicle speed, vehicle mass, and road grade, including any rates of change of these system variables. Estimates of time remaining from the instant of estimation to the moment at which the vehicle system cannot meet the driver demand in the present mode are calculated. When the anticipated time remaining before the incipient transition approaches the time required to smoothly execute that transition, a transition command is executed.","Although the embodiment of the invention described is a parallel HEV, the invention could be applied to other HEV configurations.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["20","22","24","26","22","34","22","28","30","32","20","22","28","30"]},"All powertrain components are under the supervisory control of a vehicle system controller (VSC) . Each powertrain component has a separate controller under that supervisory control of the VSC . An engine controller  controls the engine . For this application an electronic throttle control (ETC) would be used. The disconnect clutch  is under the control of a clutch controller . The motor\/generator  is under the control of a motor\/generator controller . The transmission  is under the control of a transmission control unit .","In the disclosed embodiment, the transmission  is an electronic converterless transmission (ECLT). The ECLT is a fully synchronous, high-efficiency, power-shifting transmission derived from a current mass-production product known in the prior art. Torque amplification function of the torque converter is provided by the motor\/generator drive unit . The motor\/generator  is also used for shift synchronization and dynamic control.","A vehicle brake system is under the control of a regenerative braking control , and the battery  is under the control of a battery controller .","Since the engine  can be disconnected from the motor\/generator  and power transfer device , there are three potential powertrain states. These states, which are based on various vehicle demands and commands for the VCS , include: the engine  only, the motor\/generator drive unit  only, or the engine  and the motor\/generator drive unit  combined. The disclosed embodiment of this invention is a strategy to determine when the engine should be turned on and off based on driver demand.","A simple state algorithm within the vehicle system control  of an HEV is illustrated in FIG. . In this Figure, the circles indicate intrinsically transient (\u201cself-exiting\u201d) states of starting and stopping vehicle systems, including starting and stopping the engine.","This state algorithm has several \u201cflags\u201d and parameters controlling transitions among the different vehicle states in  \u201cKEY ON\u201d flag  and a \u201cKEY OFF\u201d flag  are self-explanatory. The KEY ON flag  results in a pre-start state  proceeding to a rest IC-OFF , whereby the engine  is off. The KEY OFF flag  results in a vehicle shutdown state  command followed by a system-off state .","SYS ON and SYS OFF flags  and  reflect a \u201cbasket\u201d of conditions that require starting the engine for reasons other than to satisfy a driver's demand for powertrain torque under the current vehicle conditions (speed, grade, etc.). These include, but are not limited to: the engine  temperature below a predetermined value; an after treatment system temperature below a predetermined value; an air conditioner set to its maximum value; low battery  state of charge; and gear selector \u201cPRND\u201d in a reverse position . The engine  must be started when any one of these conditions exist, and can be shut down only when none of these conditions are in force.","The Rest IC-OFF State  moves to a \u201ccold\u201d start clutch open state  or to a Rest IC on state  with the SYS on flag  or reverse flag . The DRV ON and DRV OFF flags  and  indicate the need to start or stop the engine  based on driver demand \u201c%\u201d (such as accelerator position) and present vehicle speed \u201cv\u201d. The DRV ON and DRV OFF flags  and  will be set and cleared based on a map of % and v. Other considerations, such as d%\/dt (rate of change of accelerator position) and grade (if \u201cidentifiable\u201d), could also be included.","A DR BOOST flag  indicates that driver demand can only be met with a combination of motor\/generator  and engine  power. This is the Boost (I+E)-drive condition . The NOT DR BOOST condition  means driver demand does not require the combination.","The RGN OFF flag  indicates that regenerative braking is occurring. This condition is used to postpone the engine  shutdown while significant negative torque is transmitted through the vehicle powertrain, thus preventing what might otherwise be unpleasant braking behavior. Note that regenerative braking can actually take place without master cylinder pressure (MCP) or brake touch, and even with slight throttle.","The \u201c%\u201d is simply an accelerator position in percent representing its full range of 0 to 100 percent. The \u201cV\u201d notation is a speed below which the motor\/generator drive unit  is turning too slowly to at that instant \u201cbump start\u201d  the engine  simply by closing the disconnect clutch  leading to an I-drive IC on , whereby the engine  is on. The engine  would spin to below idle speed or be turning too slowly to deliver the requisite torque. The motor\/generator drive unit  must be spun up by a combination of downshifting the transmission and allowing the drive-away clutch to slip\u2014thus the term \u201cslip start\u201d .","The Rest IC ON state  transitions to an IC stop  state with the SYS OFF flag , DRV OFF flag , and the KEY OFF flag , and back to the REST IC-OFF  state. The Rest IC on state  also can transition to the I-Drive IC ON state  when (using terms defined above) %>0 or V>0. The I-Drive IC on state  can also transition to the Rest IC on state  when %=0 and V=0.","The Rest IC off state  transitions to an electric E-drive low speed state  when (using terms defined above) %>0 or V>0. The E-drive low speed state  can also transition to the rest IC on state  when %=0 and V=0.","The electric E-drive low speed state  transitions to the \u201cslip\u201d start state  when there is a SYS ON flag  or a DRV ON flag  that results in the I-Drive IC on state . The I-Drive IC on state  can transition to the IC stop  state with the SYS OFF flag , DRV OFF flag , and RGN OFF flag .","The IC stop  state and an E-drive high speed state  transition to the electric E-drive low speed state  when V<V. The IC stop  state and the E-drive low speed state  transition to the E-drive high-speed state  when V>V. Finally, the E-drive high-speed state  transitions to the \u201cbump\u201d start state  with the SYS ON flag  or the DRV ON flag .","In determining state transitions from a purely fuel economy perspective, all powertrain torque below a fairly low motive power threshold, typically in the range of 5 kW to 12 kW for a compact or mid-size vehicle, should be electric. When the engine  is on, it should be delivering at least the threshold power for the combined load of the vehicle requirements and battery charging load. The threshold represents an efficiency crossover point  in FIG. . Thus, small errors in the exact value do not have a major effect on fuel economy.","Adding driver demand to the transitions takes into account at least two considerations: 1) whether the instantaneous power demand at the present vehicle speed exceeds the motive power threshold  in , and 2) whether the anticipated time at which the demand power at the present accelerator position and rate of vehicle acceleration will become less than the time it will take to start the engine  (conservatively 0.7 seconds). A representative demand function is shown in  at .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["96","98","116","100","102","20","3"]},"When using the disclosed embodiment and the above described engine startup procedure, the anticipator function uses the value and rate of change of the input parameters. In this case, the driver accelerator position \u201c%\u201d and vehicle speed \u201cv\u201d, which together can be used to compute power demand \u201cP\u201d and estimate the time remaining until the power demand exceeds some threshold near the maximum capability of the electric drive system.","In the described embodiment of the invention, the anticipator for the first of these transitions\u2014\u201cget ready to drive\u201d\u2014is used to pre-spin the drive motor to its \u201cidle speed.\u201d This generates hydraulic pressure in preparation for delivering torque to the wheels. The motor\/generator  is turned off and the inverter  is put in a \u201csleep mode\u201d as much as possible to minimize the parasitic electric load. The \u201cget ready to drive\u201d anticipator will consider: vehicle speed (motion in either direction signals the need or motive power); throttle touch (any finite signals the intent to launch); brake switch (e.g., removing the foot from the brake signals the intent to launch); brake master cylinder pressure (MCP); and the rate of decrease in brake pressure given by the formula d(MCP)\/dt (i.e., a rapid decrease in brake pressure signals the intent to launch).","Of these four, the rapid decrease in brake pressure is the most critical. A decreasing brake pressure, even with finite pressure remaining, can signal the intent to launch well in advance of the actual driver expectation of torque in response to the throttle touch that will occur a large fraction of a second later. Thus the anticipator can bring the motor\/generator drive unit  to its \u201cidle\u201d speed before the demand actually appears. Therefore, it is \u201canticipated\u201d.","The second critical transition, \u201cswitch to engine power\u201d, is somewhat more complex. Here, it is important to avoid \u201cfalse starts\u201d in which the engine  is started just above the motive power threshold only to be shut off a moment later, while also avoiding \u201cstumbles\u201d in which the demand power exceeds the capabilities of the drive motor before the engine can be brought in. The HEV system design must leave ample margin between the motive power threshold the motor\/generator  capabilities. The \u201cswitch to engine\u201d anticipator will consider:","Vehicle speed: \u201cv\u201d","Rate of acceleration: dv\/dt","Throttle position: \u201c%\u201d","Rate of change of throttle: d(%)\/dt","Mass\/grade: It may be possible to identify the actual vehicle mass and possibly road grade and adjust the operating strategy accordingly.","The anticipator strategy of the invention requires the motor\/generator drive unit  to operate as a pseudo-engine such that overall vehicle control remains largely unchanged irrespective of whether the engine  is running. The torque capabilities of each in isolation and in combination are illustrated in FIG. .  is inpended as a starting point for defining the relationship between driver demand as determined by accelerator position and vehicle speed and motor\/engine torque.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0063"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["102","106","108","110","112","102","106"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0064"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["114","20"]},"If the tip of the anticipator falls below the motive power threshold due to decreasing speed and\/or demand, the engine should not be started. When the anticipator vector lies within the motor capability, the decision to start the engine is made on the basis of efficiency. This decision is based on some combination of a running average of demand power and imposed hysteresis in the motive power threshold (e.g., using an upper threshold for starting, and a lower one for engine shutoff). Accidentally running on the engine  power just below the threshold, or running the motor\/generator  just above, does not impose a significant fuel economy penalty. The wide gap between the motive power threshold and motor\/generator  capability is deliberately designed into the HEV system to allow occasional but brief periods of high motive power without forcing the engine  to start for what may prove to be only a very short time.","Because the system spends very little time in this rather inefficient mode (because the running power average mounts very rapidly), this strategy does not undermine fuel economy. With calibration of the anticipator functions, possibly including higher order polynomials or other nonlinear functions, and careful construction of the power averaging function, the optimal energy management strategy can be realized with no operational annoyance false starts and stumbles.","In the disclosed embodiment of the present invention, motive power threshold, where the engine  needs to be started, can be shown algebraically as:\n\n\n\n\u00d7Speed\u00d7\n\nwhere \u201ca\u201d is a constant. The time \u201cT\u201d remaining before crossing the threshold is given by:\n\n()\/()\n\nIf there is also a maximum torque limit, as in , the time to reach that limit must also be computed as:\n\n()\/(\n\nIf, for example, it takes one second to start the engine  and bring it up to some target power output, the engine  start process will be initiated when the \u201canticipator time\u201d falls below one second. Use of the anticipator function to determine whether to start the engine  in response to increasing power demand will minimize the frequency of \u201cfalse starts\u201d, after which the demand power is high only for a brief period and never exceeds that of the motor\/generator , while ensuring that the engine  will start in time to provide power if needed.\n","Anticipators can also determine whether to shut the engine  off in response to a sudden decrease in demand power simply by choosing a lower power threshold. An HEV braking system's master cylinder pressure (MCP) and its time rate of change can also be included in this anticipator function.","In the operation of the HEV system in the disclosed embodiment, the motor\/generator drive unit  must be spinning in order for the transmission to carry torque. However, to reduce energy consumption it is desirable to stop the motor\/generator  when possible and turn it off always when the vehicle is at rest. In a simple implementation, a touch of the accelerator, any vehicle motion, or removal of brake force can be used to trigger the restart of the motor\/generator drive unit . However, such a simple control might result in an annoying delay in vehicle launch. An anticipator that observes the force on a brake and its rate of change to compute the time remaining before vehicle motion can begin or would begin in a conventional vehicle in which \u201ccreep\u201d (forward motion with no touch to either brake or accelerator) can be used to signal the need to spin the motor. The system would be ready to deliver power even before the driver actually demands it. In the case of the HEV in the disclosed embodiment, a \u201cfalse start\u201d of the motor\/generator  consumes little energy and my not be detectable.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0071","num":"0070"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["96","98","3"]},"In the positive torque part of the plot of , the limit of the driving torque capability of the motor is shown at .
