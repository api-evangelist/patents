title: Programming learning center
abstract: A programming learning center includes a learning center workshop and a learning module generator. The learning center workshop allows a user to create a computing program by connecting programming blocks portrayed visually within the learning center workshop as building blocks. The learning module generator generates a learning module from the computing program. The learning module iterates through the computing program to generate a sequential list of steps. The learning module generator allows the user to add notations to the sequential list of steps and to reorder steps in the sequential list of steps.

interface. For example, the interface is a web browser or a dedicated app located on a computing device such as a personal computer or a tablet. When learning is launched, a user can build a project, which is essentially a computer program. Learning center workshop  allows a user to construct a project (computer program) and save it. The computer program can be run using learning center runtime .","Upon entering learning center workshop , a user can elect to build a new computer program from scratch or open an existing computer program.","To build a computer program from scratch, the user utilizes blocks of programming instructions represented visually as building blocks within learning center workshop . The tools provided within learning center workshop  allow a user to create a scene that includes a background, main objects and actors. Learning center workshop  allows a user to add computer program logic to the actors and the background. The user acts by dragging and dropping visual blocks into code areas. The visual blocks snap into place to form logic sequences.","Learning center workshop  saves the computer program and all its assets as the computer program is being built. For example, learning center workshop  saves the computer program in a persistent format so that the computer program can be loaded later. This can be done, for example in a Javascript Object Notation (JSON) format, Extensible Markup Language (XML) or some other structured syntax.

As illustrated by arrow , an external trigger event  results in a script  that has been registered in event registrations list  being added to a scheduler , which is a list of running scripts. Run loop  picks up a script to execute from scheduler . The scripts are executed in parallel by scheduler . Scheduler  determines how to select the next script (e.g. round robin, priority queue, time queue). The execution context is restored from a runtime stack  specific to that script. The instruction is executed as a non-blocking process.","For example, within a project runner , in a block  a next script is fetched from the scheduler. In a block , execution context is restored for the fetched script. In a block  an instruction is run. In a block , context is moved to a next instruction. As illustrated by arrow , block  and block  are continued until there is a context switch. A context switches occurs, for example, when the script has executed a yield instruction, a time slice expires, user interrupts execution, etc. When there is a context switch, in a block , execution context is saved and context is returned to block . If the end of the script has not been reached, the script is retained in the scheduler . If the end of the script has been reached, the script is removed from runtime stack  and the list of running scripts within scheduler .","For example, for learning center runtime , scripts  are written using Javascript. Javascript is a single-threaded environment in a web browser. A sequence of instructions is executed sequentially until the sequence relinquishes control back to the web browser before other instruction sequences will execute. As a result, multiple Javascript sequences cannot run at the same time.","For example, the learning center represents instructions as blocks so that each block represents one instruction that executes atomically, that is without being interrupted by another block. Each block must relinquish control back to the web browser in a timely fashion. Scheduler , therefore, maintains a context for each script sequence. Scheduler  selects a script sequence, switches to that script's context and executes a predetermined number of blocks for each turn. Scheduler  then selects the next script sequence and repeats until all scheduled scripts have run theft turn. At this point scheduler  relinquishes control back to the web browser. The web browser starts up another time slice where another script sequence is executed.

For example, a task is presented to the student to accomplish a goal such as to write code to move a golf ball into a hole. The student creates the code. In order to check whether the code accomplishes the task, code blocks that the student has added can be checked to see that the code blocks are in the correct order. Alternatively, a trigger methodology can be used to determine whether the task was accomplished.","For example, a trigger is assigned to the objects that a user manipulates. The trigger is based on whether a criteria placed within the computing program has been satisfied. For example the objects are a ball and a hole. The triggers are hidden from the user. The triggers are code instructions that check for the criteria, as delineated by parameters. If the parameters are satisfied, the trigger is fired, and the process that checks that the code can determine whether the user accomplished the task. For example, a geometric criteria specifies that a ball must travel a certain distance. For example, a hole trigger checks that the ball is within the bounds of the hole.","In addition, other types of criteria can be used. For example, a time-based criteria indicates whether a task is completed within a specified amount of time. For example, did a mouse finish a maze in under 8 seconds? A code based criteria determines whether code used to accomplish a task is within predetermined parameters. For example, was a lesson completed using under 8 code blocks and without using recursion? Value-based criteria determine whether a particular value was reached. For example, was a score greater than 25? Event criteria determine whether a certain event criteria was received. For example, was a message sent by one of the actors? A physics based criteria indicates a physical property or phenomena occurred. For example, did a cannon ball reach a velocity of at least 25 meters per second? An external physical criteria indicates some real activity outside the program occur. For example, did a sensor on a physical stage robot move 10 feet?",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0077","num":"0076"},"figref":"FIG. 16","b":["151","21","160","160","161","162","161","162","163","164","165","165"]},"An activity monitor  within lesson runner  includes a timer module , a resource monitor  and an event monitor .

For example, an author gets paid $2 for every 1000 lesson views inside a paid course authored by the author.
