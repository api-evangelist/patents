{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present invention relates generally to management and\/or navigation of items arranged in a hierarchical structure and more particularly to methods for presenting items such as folders or directories that are arranged in a hierarchical structure in a computer system.","Computer systems generally store software program files and data files in folders or directories. The folders are typically arranged and maintained in a hierarchical structure or file system by an operating system or file manager to facilitate easy access and navigation by users of the computer system.","In certain operating systems such as Microsoft\u00ae Windows\u00ae, folders are displayed in a window using a tree-type structure. The tree-type structure is hierarchical in nature and includes both parent folders and sub-folders or child folders, as described hereinafter with reference to .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0005","num":"0004"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","100"]},"Referring to , folder is shown in the expanded state. Folder is a parent folder relative to sub-folder and sub-folder. Folder may be shown in the contracted state by activation of the [\u2212] icon adjacent to folder.","Folder is also a parent folder, however, the sub-folder(s) of parent folder is\/are not visible on account of folder being shown in the contracted state. The sub-folder(s) of folder may be shown in the expanded state by activation of the [+] icon adjacent to folder. Folder is not a parent folder.","Folder, folder and folder are parent folders shown in the contracted state.","Computer file systems generally provide a level of security by restricting permissions of individual users or groups of users in relation to folders. For example, certain users may be allowed to access certain folders (and files or items stored therein) but may be restricted from editing the folders' properties or the files or items stored therein, or creating new items in the folders. This is commonly known as \u201cread-only\u201d protection and denies a user \u201cwrite\u201d access.","In certain cases, a user may have \u201cwrite\u201d permission for a parent folder but may have restricted \u201cread-only\u201d permission for one or more sub-folder(s) of that parent folder. When a user wishes to store an item or file in a sub-folder some number of levels lower than the parent folder in the hierarchy, this may necessitate navigation through multiple levels of sub-folders only to discover (after performing the navigation) that the desired sub-folder is \u201cread-only\u201d. Moreover, all of the sub-folders in the navigation path may be \u201cread-only\u201d. In other words, if the user is intending to find a sub-folder to write to, the navigated path can be a \u201cdead-end\u201d on account of it being impossible to store the item in the desired sub-folder.","Referring again to , in order for a user to identify whether there are any sub-folders of any of folder, folder and folder for which the user has \u201cwrite\u201d access, the user is required to actually navigate down the path by expanding the parent folders in the path. Navigating and expanding folders in this manner only to discover that the desired sub-folder is read-only, particularly on a repeated or continual basis, is a waste of time that would desirably be avoided.","An aspect of the present invention provides a computer-implemented method for presenting items in a hierarchy comprising parent and sub-items. The method comprises the steps of identifying one or more parent items in the hierarchy, wherein all sub-items of the identified parent items possess a particular property; and presenting the hierarchy in a manner to indicate that all sub-items of the identified parent items possess the particular property.","Another aspect of the present invention provides a computer-implemented method for presenting folders in a hierarchy. The method comprises the steps of identifying one or more parent folders in the hierarchy, wherein the one or more parent folders and all sub-folders of the one or more parent folder are read-only; and presenting the hierarchy of folders in a manner to enable a user to differentiate between the identified one or more parent folders and other parent folders in the hierarchy.","Another aspect of the present invention provides a computer system comprising memory for storing data and instructions; an audio-video interface for presenting data; and at least one processor unit coupled to the memory and the audio-video interface. The at least one processor unit is programmed to identify one or more parent items in the hierarchy, wherein all sub-items of the identified parent items possess a particular property; and present the hierarchy in a manner to indicate that all sub-items of the identified parent items possess the particular property.","Another aspect of the present invention provides a computer program product comprising computer software stored thereon for presenting items in a hierarchy comprising parent and sub-items. The computer software comprises computer program code for identifying one or more parent items in the hierarchy, wherein all sub-items of the identified parent items possess a particular property; and computer program code for presenting the hierarchy in a manner to indicate that all sub-items of the identified parent items possess the particular property.","The identified parent items may also possess the particular property, and the hierarchy may be presented in a manner to indicate that the identified parent items and all sub-items of the identified parent items possess the particular property.","The identified parent items may be displayed using a display characteristic that is different to that used to display other parent items in the hierarchy.","The items may comprise folders and the particular property may be that the identified parent folders and all sub-folders of the identified parent folders are read-only. Alternatively, the particular property may be that the identified parent folders and all sub-folders of the identified parent folders are writable. Other properties may alternatively be used without departing from the scope of the invention.","The identified parent folders may be displayed using a first display characteristic that is different to one or more display characteristics used to display other folders in the hierarchy that are writable. The first display characteristic may, for example, comprise one or more items selected from a group composed of the following: a selected color; a selected font; a selected font size; a strikethrough; and underlining. In another embodiment, the first display characteristic is that display of the identified parent items may be suppressed.","The following detailed description is of the best currently contemplated modes of carrying out the invention. The description is not to be taken in a limiting sense, but is made merely for the purpose of illustrating the general principles of the invention, since the scope of the invention is best defined by the appended claims.","The terms \u201csub-item\u201d and \u201csub-folders\u201d, as used in the present specification, are intended to refer to \u201cchild items\u201d and \u201cchild folders\u201d, respectively, in a hierarchical (tree) structure. An item or folder can be both a parent item or parent folder and a child item or child folder. The concept of a sub-item or sub-folder is intended to encompass a child item or child folder, a grandchild item or grandchild folder, etc.","Furthermore, the terms \u201cfolder\u201d and \u201cdirectory\u201d, as used in this specification are intended to be interchangeable.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 2","i":"a ","b":["200","200","200"]},"The display  is similar to the display  of  and, in particular, comprises the same hierarchy of folders as . However, compared to the display  of , certain of the folders shown in  are shown using visual properties that provide specific information to a user.","Referring to , folder, folder and folder are shown in italicized text to indicate that these folders are read-only. Additionally, folder is shown in underlined text to indicate that folder is a read-only parent folder and has only read-only sub-folders associated with it (i.e., folder has no sub-folders that are writable).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"i":["b ","a","a","b "],"b":["210","200","12","2","3","4","210","3","4","3","4"]},"In , folder, folder and folder are each shown in italicized text to respectively indicate that each of these folders is read-only. Parent folder  is also shown in underlined text in both and to indicate that all of the sub-folders of parent folder are read-only. Furthermore, folder (which is both a sub-folder and a parent folder) is also shown in underlined text in to indicate that all sub-folders of folder are read-only. Accordingly, a user can observe the underlined text of folder in and the underlined text of folder in (with both folders shown in the compressed state) and make the correct assumption that all sub-folders of folder and folder are read-only. This may advantageously save the user from needlessly navigating through or expanding the sub-folders of folder and folder.","In , each of folder, sub-folder , sub-folder , sub-folder and sub-folder are shown in italicized text to respectively indicate that each of these folders is read-only. However, sub-folder is not shown in italicized text to indicate that this folder is writable. Accordingly, parent folder is not shown in underlined text to indicate that parent folder has at least one sub-folder that is writeable, even though parent folder is itself read-only (i.e., shown in italicized text). By observing parent folder in the compressed state in the display  of , a user can thus conclude that at least one sub-folder of parent folder is writable.","In , folder and folder are shown in italicized and underlined text to indicate that both of these folders and all respective sub-folders are read-only.","Those skilled in the art will appreciate that alternative properties or characteristics to the properties or characteristics used in the embodiments described hereinbefore with reference to and may be used to indicate read-only status of folders or items. In particular, the properties or characteristics used (i.e., italicized and underlined text) were selected for ease of description of examples in a black-and-white document. In other embodiments, read-only folders and folders having only read-only sub-folders may be displayed or indicated by means of alternative colors, fonts, font sizes, strikethrough, boldface, or combinations of the foregoing. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that numerous other properties of characteristics may alternatively be used to indicate read-only or other status of folders or items.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","300","300"]},"Referring to , the \u2018ls\u2019 command causes a list of the contents of the root@cloudy directory to be displayed. Immediately thereafter in , the \u2018ls \u22121\u2019 command causes a list of the contents of the root@cloudy directory to be displayed with additional information (e.g., access rights, size, creation date, etc.).","Also shown in  is the command \u2018cp.\/myfile.txt.\/opt\/WebSphere\/\u2019, which causes the file myfile.txt to be copied to the directory .\/opt\/WebSphere. Before performing this command, it would be useful to a user to know whether there are any sub-directories in the opt directory that are writeable. Alternatively, it may be useful to know whether there are any sub-directories in the opt directory that are read-only. This information can be displayed using methods described hereinbefore with reference to the embodiment of and . For example, the relevant directory names may be displayed in a particular color. Alternative methods of indicating whether directories are writable or read-only may also be practiced. For example, the information may be provided in a separate column of the display.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},"Referring to , one or more parent items in the hierarchy are identified at step . All sub-items of the identified parent items possess a particular property or attribute. The identified parent items may also possess the particular property.","At step , the hierarchy is presented in a manner to indicate that all sub-items of the identified parent items possess the particular property. The hierarchy may be presented in a manner to indicate that the identified parent items and all sub-items of the identified parent items possess the particular property. The identified parent items may, for example, be displayed using a display characteristic that is different to that used to display other parent items in the hierarchy. In one embodiment, display of the identified parent items is suppressed. In other embodiments, the identified parent items are presented to a user in an audible manner. In a web browser, for example, the HTML statement:","Folder <span style=\u201cdisplay: none;\u201d>This folder has no writable sub-folders<\/span>","can be used to indicate that the string indicating the folder has no writable sub-folders is not be displayed by the browser, but will be read by a browser screen reader (i.e., a text-to-speech converter). This embodiment is particularly useful for assisting blind or partially blind users. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that visual and audible indications may be provided either alone or in combination.","The parent items and sub-items may comprise parent folders and sub-folders, respectively, and the particular property may be that the identified parent folders and all sub-folders of the identified parent folders are read-only. Alternatively, the particular property may be that the identified parent folders and all sub-folders of the identified parent folders are writable or, conversely, that the identified parent folders have no read-only sub-folders. Other properties or attributes may alternatively be used.","The identified parent folders may be displayed using a first display characteristic that is different to one or more display characteristics used to display other folders in the hierarchy that are writable. The first display characteristic may, for example, comprise: a selected color; a selected font; a selected font size; a strikethrough; underlining; boldface or a combination thereof. Alternatively, as described hereinbefore, the identified parent folders may be presented or conveyed to a user in an audible manner.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 4"],"b":["500","500","500","500","500","500"]},"As shown in , the computer system  is formed by a computer module , input devices such as a keyboard  and a mouse pointer device and\/or other human machine interface , and output devices including a printer , a video display  and loudspeakers . The video display  may be a cathode ray tube type device, an LCD monitor or other suitable device for graphically or textually displaying items such as folders in a hierarchy. An external Modulator-Demodulator (Modem) transceiver device  may be used by the computer module  for communicating to and from a communications network  via a connection . The network  may be a wide-area network (WAN), such as the Internet or a private WAN. Where the connection  is a telephone line, the modem  may be a traditional \u201cdial-up\u201d modem. Alternatively, where the connection  is a high-capacity (e.g., cable) connection, the modem  may be a broadband modem. A wireless modem may also be used for wireless connection to the network .","The computer module  typically includes at least one processor unit , and a memory unit  for example formed from semiconductor random access memory (RAM) and read only memory (ROM). The module  also includes a number of input\/output (I\/O) interfaces including an audio-video interface  that couples to the visual display  and loudspeakers , an I\/O interface  for the keyboard  and mouse  and optionally a joystick (not illustrated), and an interface  for the external modem  and printer . In some implementations, the modem  may be incorporated within the computer module , for example within the interface . The computer module  also has a local network interface  which, via a connection , permits coupling of the computer system  to a local computer network , known as a Local Area Network (LAN). As also illustrated, the local network  may also couple to the wide network  via a connection , which would typically include a so-called \u201cfirewall\u201d device or similar functionality. The interface  may be formed by an Ethernet\u2122 circuit card, a wireless Bluetooth\u2122 or an IEEE 802.11 wireless arrangement.","The interfaces  and  may afford both serial and parallel connectivity, the former typically being implemented according to the Universal Serial Bus (USB) standards and having corresponding USB connectors (not illustrated). A scanner or photocopier  may be coupled to the interfaces  or . USB and Firewire are common interfaces used for connection to such a scanner as are other serial and parallel interfaces. Storage devices  are provided and typically include a hard disk drive (HDD) . Other devices such as a floppy disk drive and a magnetic tape drive (not illustrated) may also be used. An optical disk drive  is typically provided to act as a non-volatile source of data. Portable memory devices, such optical disks (e.g., CD-ROM, DVD), USB-RAM, and floppy disks for example may then be used as appropriate sources of data to the system .","The components  to  of the computer module  may typically communicate via an interconnected bus  and in a manner which results in a conventional mode of operation of the computer system  known to those skilled in the art. Examples of computers on which the described arrangements can be practiced include IBM-PCs and compatibles, Sun\u2122 Sparcstations\u2122, Apple Mac\u2122 and similar computer systems evolved therefrom.","Typically, the application programs discussed hereinbefore may be resident on the hard disk drive , which are read and controlled in execution by the processor . Intermediate storage of such programs and any data fetched from the networks  and  may be accomplished using the semiconductor memory , possibly in concert with the hard disk drive . In some instances, the application programs may be supplied to the user encoded on one or more CD-ROM and read via the corresponding drive , or alternatively may be read by the user from the networks  or . Still further, the software can also be loaded into the computer system  from other computer readable media. Computer readable media refers to any storage medium that participates in providing instructions and\/or data to the computer system  for execution and\/or processing. Examples of such media include floppy disks, magnetic tape, CD-ROM, a hard disk drive, a ROM or integrated circuit, a magneto-optical disk, or a computer readable card such as a PCMCIA card and the like, whether or not such devices are internal or external of the computer module . Examples of computer readable transmission media that may also participate in the provision of instructions and\/or data include radio or infra-red transmission channels as well as a network connection to another computer or networked device, and the Internet or Intranets including e-mail transmissions and information recorded on Websites and the like.","The application programs and\/or code modules mentioned above may be executed to implement one or more graphical user interfaces (GUIs) to be rendered or otherwise represented upon the display . Through manipulation of the keyboard  and the mouse , a user of the computer system  and the application may manipulate the interface to provide controlling commands and\/or input to the applications associated with the GUI(s).","Appendix A, hereinafter, contains a computer software program or sub-program in the Java\u00ae language for checking whether a directory has any writable sub-directories and determining a relevant color that the folder or directory should be displayed in. The computer software program code in Appendix A represents an embodiment of the present invention that may be practiced using the computer system  as described hereinbefore with reference to .","Java\u00ae is a platform independent language that enables the Java\u00ae code to be converted into different operating system (OS)-dependent code at application run time, depending on the OS that the code is running on. Hence, the software program code in Appendix A could be run by a Windows\u00ae, UNIX\u00ae or Mac operating system to query the colors that a folder should be shown in. Java\u00ae code that generates the User Interface (UI) would call the function FolderColorUtility.getFolderColor(File folder) for each folder or directory that will be shown in the UI to determine the color that the folder or directory should be shown in. The Java\u00ae Application Programming Interface (API) used here is the java.io.File class, which gives access to the properties of files and folders in any operating system. There are equivalent APIs (that are written in the C or C++ language) available for the UNIX\u00ae and Windows\u00ae operating systems that perform the same function directly in the operating system. The relevant UNIX\u00ae API would be used to show the relevant information in the text-based UI of .","Returning to the computer software program in Appendix A, the folders in the hierarchy are recursively checked to determine whether they are writable or read-only. Determining whether a particular folder or sub-folder is read-only or writable is performed on an operating system specific methodology and may be available as a standard operating system function. Determining the sub-folders of a particular parent folder may also be available as a standard operating system function. Writable folders are displayed in black, read-only folders with writable sub-folders are displayed in blue, and read-only folders with only read-only sub-folders are displayed in red.","Embodiments described hereinbefore enable computer system users to readily identify parent items or parent folders, the sub-items or sub-folders of which all possess a particular property such as \u2018read-only\u2019 or \u2018writable\u2019. The embodiments described hereinbefore enable users to readily identify such parent folders without the need for expanding the parent items or parent folders or navigating through the hierarchy.","The foregoing description provides exemplary embodiments only, and is not intended to limit the scope, applicability or configurations of the present invention. Rather, the description of the exemplary embodiments herein provides those skilled in the art with enabling descriptions for implementing an embodiment of the invention. Various changes may be made in the function and arrangement of steps or features without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as set forth in the claims hereinafter.","Where specific features, elements and steps referred to herein have known equivalents in the art to which the invention relates, such known equivalents are deemed to be incorporated herein as if individually set forth.
