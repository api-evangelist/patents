title: Self-reconfigurable memristor-based analog resonant computer
abstract: An apparatus which provides a self-reconfigurable analog resonant computer employing a fixed electronic circuit schematic which performs computing logic operations (for example OR, AND, NOR, and XOR Boolean logic) without physical re-wiring and whose components only include passive circuit elements such as resistors, capacitors, inductors, and memristor devices. The computational logic self-reconfiguration process in the circuit takes place as training input signals, which are input causing the impedance state of the memristor device to change. Once the training process is completed, the circuit is probed to determine whether the desired logic operation has been programmed.

Given that the memristor device is essentially an electronic variable solid state resistor; the specific oscillating frequency of the resonant LCRM circuit can be made dependent on the impedance state variable M of the memristor device. [2][3]","What is lacking in the prior art, however, is an LCRM circuit into which an electronic signal can be input so as to change the oscillating frequency and magnitude of oscillation of the circuit based on the time-domain dynamic of the memristor device.","It is an object of the present invention to provide an apparatus that performs computing functions that are reprogrammable.","It is another object of the present invention, then, to provide an apparatus that performs computing functions that does not require power consumption to retain a programmed logic state or computing configuration.","It is yet another object of the present invention to provide an apparatus that serves as a fundamental building block for computing machine design that can be logically reconfigured repeatedly through the application of input signals while not requiring power consumption to retain any configured logical state.","Briefly stated, the present invention provides an apparatus which provides a self-reconfigurable analog resonant computer employing a fixed electronic circuit schematic which performs computing logic operations (for example OR, AND, NOR, and XOR Boolean logic) without physical re-wiring and whose components only include passive circuit elements such as resistors, capacitors, inductors, and memristor devices.

The memristor device model operation and formalism is described elsewhere in the published literature [2].","Still referring to and , the circuit shown can be reconfigured to function as either an XOR gate, OR gate, AND gate, NOR gate, or the output can be turned off so it always outputs a zero. The circuit contains two memristor devices that can be switched to either a high or low resistance state to make the circuit perform the desired logic operation as shown. During normal operation, the input voltage to the gate representing the logic 1 bit is a 2 Volt amplitude positive half wave sinusoidal pulse at 1 KHz frequency. The output of the resonant logic gate is deemed high if it goes above the specified threshold voltage of 0.55 volts. During programming, pulses of a higher amplitude voltage of either positive or negative polarity are applied to the input nodes of the circuit, Vin and\/or Vin, to switch the memristors to the desired state.","Referring to  shows the time domain output response when the logic gate in and is programmed to function as a Boolean AND logic gate.  shows the input pulses Vin and Vin and the output response Vout. Still, from , it is apparent that the output, Vout, of the logic gate is higher than the specified threshold value of 0.55 Volts only when both inputs at input at the same time between the 12 and 14 ms of operation. The memristor state values that allow the circuit to exhibit the Boolean AND logic functionality are M=1,539\u03a9 and M=25,001\u03a9 respectively.","Referring to  depicts the performance of the present invention when the logic circuit gate of and is programmed to behave as a Boolean OR logic gate, and, accordingly, the memristor values are programmed to M=1,539\u03a9 and M=50,000\u03a9 respectively. It is apparent in  that for any input to the resonant logic gate, the output is always above the specified 0.55 Volt threshold voltage.","Referring to , when the memristor values are set to M=1,500\u03a9 and M=50,000\u03a9 respectively, the Boolean XOR logic operation can be performed. The Boolean XOR logic function states that the output is 1 whenever the inputs are different which is the case in  in which the output is below the threshold voltage only when both inputs, Vin and Vin, are high, 2 Volts, between the 12 and 14 ms operation time.","Referring to  shows the operations of the Boolean NOR logic function of the present invention when the memristor values are set to M=1,500\u03a9 and M=25,001\u03a9 respectively.","In the foregoing figures it was demonstrated how the present invention can reconfigure the logic gate to operate as various Boolean logic gates by setting the memristor devices M and M to specific impedance values. Additionally, however, the present invention can provide logic gate self-reconfiguration capability from a particular Boolean functionality to another and vice versa. To reprogram or reconfigure the logic gate, positive or negative programming pulses are applied to the inputs of the logic gate in a certain sequence to switch the state of one and\/or both memristor devices, M and M. The voltage of the programming pulses can range from \u22127.5 to 7.5 Volts approximately. These pulses are applied so that the voltage across the memristor to be switched exceeds the threshold voltage of the memristor and is of the correct polarity to make the memristor switch to the desired resistance state [2].","Referring to , , , and  illustrates the logic gate self-reconfiguration process from Boolean logic AND to NOR (see ), from NOR to XOR (see ), from XOR to OR (see ), and from OR to AND (see ), respectively. The specific memristor device impedance state changes that allowed the logic gate to achieve self-reconfiguration are given in .","Referring to  illustrates that a single 7.5 Volt electrical pulse applied to node Vin is required to change the Boolean logic function from a AND to a NOR logic gate, and  illustrates that the memristor impedance values change, M change from 1,539 to 14,411\u03a9 while M remained fixed at 25,001\u03a9. Similarly, the transitions to and from any other Boolean logic gate functionality can be described from the results in , , and  and the memristor initial\/final impedance state values again given in . It is important to state that the experimental results described here represent only a small subset of the possible memristor impedance state combinations that would result in a particular Boolean logic gate functionality.","Thus to summarize, the present invention provides an apparatus and method for the design and operation characteristics of an analog self-reconfigurable Boolean logic computing architecture. The present invention's computing architecture leverages in a unique and novel way the non-linear dynamic properties of memristor devices with passive electronic components (inductor, capacitor, and resistor) to deliver threshold-based Boolean logic computational capabilities.","Having described preferred embodiments of the invention with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to those precise embodiments, and that various changes and modifications may be effected therein by one skilled in the art without departing from the scope or spirit of the invention as defined in the appended claims."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 1","i":"a "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 1","i":"b "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 11"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
