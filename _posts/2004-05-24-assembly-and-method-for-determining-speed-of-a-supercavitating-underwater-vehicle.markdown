For a nominal prior art streamlined, fully wetted underwater vehicle, 70% of the overall drag is skin friction drag, the remainder is pressure or blockage drag. Supercavitation allows for much higher speeds to be sustainable by eliminating, or at least substantially reducing, skin friction drag. The conditions for supercavitation require that enough energy be put into the water to vaporize a given volume of water through which the vehicle travels. This is done by accelerating fluid over a sharp edge, usually the nose of a vehicle, such as a torpedo, so that the pressure drops below the vapor pressure of water. If the speed of the object is not fast enough to travel through the vapor cavity before the cavity collapses, artificial ventilation into the cavity can keep the cavity \u201copen\u201d until the object moves past. When a cavity completely encapsulates an object, by vaporous and\/or vented cavitation, it is referred to as \u201csupercavitation\u201d. The vehicle nose, or \u201ccavitator\u201d, and aft control surfaces, are the only parts of the vehicle in constant contact with the water through which the vehicle travels. The cavity closure typically is positioned just forward of the aft control surfaces.","A supercavitating vehicle achieves high speed by minimizing the wetted contact area. The entire vehicle, with the exception of the cavitator and the aft control surfaces, is not in contact with the water through which the vehicle moves. The optimal use of this small wetted contact area presents problems with respect to cavity formation means and vehicle control systems, all of which must be disposed in this limited space. Traditional homing systems require surface space in order to function. However, in supercavitating vehicles, the use of the cavitator surface as a velocity sensor is impractical. Further, the lack of wetted contact areas means traditional methods of using dynamic fluid pressure for determining speed are not practical. In as much as supercavitating vehicle technology is in its early stages of development, a complete understanding of vehicle propulsion and hydrodynamics is insufficient to determine vehicle velocity from on-board sensing of fuel consumption, ventilation gas flow rates, and the like.","Accordingly, there is a need for a sensor assembly and method for determining the speed of a supercavitating underwater vehicle, as the vehicle travels through water. There is further a need for such an assembly as can be carried on-board the vehicle.","There is similarly a need for a method for determining the speed of the vehicle through water, using on-board sensors.","An object of the invention is, therefore, to provide a velocity sensor assembly for supercavitating underwater vehicles, which assembly can be carried on-board the vehicle.","A further object of the invention is to provide a method for determining speed of a supercavitating underwater vehicle traveling through an underwater environment.","With the above and other objects in view, a feature of the present invention is the provision of an assembly for determining speed of a supercavitating underwater vehicle during underwater travel. The assembly comprises a fin mounted on the vehicle aft of a cavitator portion of the vehicle and adapted to be extended outwardly beyond a hull of the vehicle and through a boundary of a gas-filled cavity around the vehicle to form a disturbance in the cavity boundary, which disturbance propagates along the boundary. An acoustic transmitter is mounted on the vehicle for directing acoustic energy toward the boundary and the disturbance. An acoustic receiver is mounted on the vehicle for receiving acoustic energy reflected off the disturbance, and an autopilot is mounted on the vehicle for clocking times of projection of the fin and times of receptions of reflected acoustic energy from the disturbance to determine the speed of the vehicle through the water.","In accordance with a further feature of the invention, there is provided a high-speed supercavitating underwater vehicle including an elongated hull of circular cross section, the hull having a cavitator at a forward end thereof, and means for ventilating gas to form a cavity around the hull in underwater travel. The vehicle further includes an assembly disposed in the hull for determining speed of the vehicle during the underwater travel. The assembly comprises a fin mounted on the hull aft of the cavitator and adapted to extend outwardly through a cavity boundary to form a disturbance in the cavity boundary, and sensors disposed in the hull for determining velocity of the disturbance relative to the hull as the disturbance propagates along the cavity boundary, whereby to determine the velocity of the vehicle.","In accordance with a still further feature of the invention, there is provided a method for determining speed of a supercavitating underwater vehicle through an underwater environment. The method comprises the steps of extending a fin mounted behind a cavitator at a forward end of the vehicle, such that the fin extends through a cavity boundary to form a disturbance in the cavity boundary, which disturbance propagates along the cavity boundary, and measuring the speed of the disturbance as the disturbance propagates along the cavity boundary, thereby to determine the speed of the vehicle through the water.","The above and other features of the invention, including various novel details of construction and combinations of parts and method steps, will now be more particularly described with reference to the accompanying drawings and pointed out in the claims. It will be understood that the particular assembly and method embodying the invention are shown by way of illustration only and not as limitations of the invention. The principles and features of this invention may be employed in various and numerous embodiments without departing from the scope of the invention.","Referring to , it will be seen that an illustrative underwater vehicle  includes an elongated hull  of circular cross section. The hull is provided with peripheral grooves or apertures  for venting gas, typically air, stored in the vehicle under pressure. The hull  is provided with a cavitator, shown herein as a pointed nose cone , at the forward end of the hull. The hull  contains a reservoir of gas (not shown) under pressure for venting through the grooves , and a jet engine (not shown) for propelling the hull  forward at a rapid rate. The aft end  of the hull  is open to accommodate a jet plume when the jet engine is in operation.","Referring to , it will be seen that the forward movement of the vehicle  causes the nose cone , which acts as a cavitator, to create a cavity , or vapor region, behind the cone . The outflow of pressurized gas from the grooves  enlarges the cavity  and maintains the cavity such that the water-gas interface, or cavity boundary , is spaced from the vehicle , except at the nose cone  and aft end  of the hull . The vehicle  may be provided with fins  mounted on the hull  and adapted to extend beyond the cavity boundary  for purposes of stabilization and\/or guidance. Thus, the vehicle  is not subjected to the friction of water, except at the nose cone  and the aft end  and\/or control surfaces, or fins, .","In  there is shown a preferred embodiment of the supercavitating velocity measurement assembly. The vehicle cavitator  is located on a forward end of the vehicle . An actuator  is mechanically linked to a small fin . The fin  () is mounted immediately downstream of the cavitator . The actuator  operates to momentarily extend the fin . When fully deployed, the fin  extends beyond the edge of the cavity  and impacts the cavity boundary . This interaction causes a disturbance D () to form and propagate along the cavity boundary . The disruption of the cavity is local and does not contribute significantly to overall vehicle drag. A selected number of acoustic transmitters  () send signals toward the cavity  and the disturbance D. The time of flight between the acoustic transmission, reflection off the disturbance D, and collection by acoustic receivers  is determined by a vehicle autopilot  that computes the pertinent times and thereby determines the speed of the vehicle, which is used to plot a homing course. The acoustic transmitters  and acoustic receivers  are linked to the vehicle autopilot  and to the fin actuator . The autopilot  sends commands to the fin actuator  and has a synchronous clock to record the arrival of the disturbance D over the acoustic receivers . After accounting for system lags, the vehicle velocity is determined by time from fin deployment to times of acoustic measure of the disruption, divided by the appropriate length from fin  to the appropriate acoustic receivers . Vehicle accelerations are similarly determined from time lagged velocities. This requires one receiver and multiple actuations of the fin, or a single disruption and multiple measurements of that disruption at different vehicle sensor locations, or a combination thereof. The fin  may be deployed at any rate desired. The mechanical lag time for the fin deployment and electronic processing of the acoustic signal are small compared to the time of travel along the cavity path and an accurate velocity measurement is obtained. The measurement accuracy is roughly independent of vehicle velocity.","In  there are shown details of ultrasonic transmitters  and receivers . A central transmitter  is located beneath a transparent acoustic cover or acoustic lens . The acoustic energy is projected toward the cavity boundary . The transmission may be continuous or intermittent. In the \u201cbackground\u201d functioning of the transmission, the acoustic energy is reflected back toward the projector and dissipates. However, as a cavity disturbance D passes over the projected beam, the reflected energy is directed away from the transmitter . An annular receiver  surrounds the transmitter. The receiver  experiences a significant response when a cavity disruption is present. The interval between successive disruptions is timed to avoid any signal ambiguity.","There is thus provided a velocity sensor assembly for supercavitating underwater vehicles, which assembly enables on-board determination of speed by an autopilot of the vehicle.","There is further provided a method for determining the speed of a supercavitating vehicle traveling underwater. The method can be carried out by operation of the above-described assembly performing the steps of extending the fin  to create the disturbance D in the cavity boundary , and measuring the speed of the disturbance as the disturbance propagates along the cavity, thereby to determine the speed of the vehicle through the water. The speed is computed by an autopilot on-board the vehicle.","It will be understood that many additional changes in the details, steps and arrangement of components, which have been herein described and illustrated in order to explain the nature of the invention, may be made by those skilled in the art within the principles and scope of the invention as expressed in the appended claims.","The foregoing describes the invention in terms of embodiments foreseen by the inventor and for which an enabling description is available. Insubstantial modifications of the invention not presently foreseen may nonetheless represent equivalents."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["Reference is made to the accompanying drawings in which is shown an illustrative embodiment of the invention, from which its novel features and advantages will be apparent, wherein corresponding reference characters indicate corresponding parts throughout the several views of the drawings and wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 4"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
