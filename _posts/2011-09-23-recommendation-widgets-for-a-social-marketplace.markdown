Field of the Invention","Embodiments of the invention relate generally to information handling systems. More specifically, embodiments of the invention provide a method and system for providing syndicated commerce recommendations.","2. Description of the Related Art","As the value and use of information continues to increase, individuals and businesses seek additional ways to process and store information. One option available to users is information handling systems. An information handling system generally processes, compiles, stores, and\/or communicates information or data for business, personal, or other purposes thereby allowing users to take advantage of the value of the information. Because technology and information handling needs and requirements vary between different users or applications, information handling systems may also vary regarding what information is handled, how the information is handled, how much information is processed, stored, or communicated, and how quickly and efficiently the information may be processed, stored, or communicated. The variations in information handling systems allow for information handling systems to be general or configured for a specific user or specific use such as financial transaction processing, airline reservations, enterprise data storage, or global communications. In addition, information handling systems may include a variety of hardware and software components that may be configured to process, store, and communicate information and may include one or more computer systems, data storage systems, and networking systems.","These same information handling systems have played a key role in the rapid growth of electronic commerce on the Internet. One known aspect of electronic commerce is affiliate networks, which allow online merchants to reach a larger audience through participation in various affiliate programs. Typically, potential customers are referred to the merchant's website from an affiliate's web site, which receives a share of any resulting sale as compensation for the referral. Various affiliate network services and benefits generally include referral tracking, reporting tools, payment processing, and access to a large base of participants. Over time, affiliate networks have made progress in simplifying the process of registering affiliate participants fore or more merchant affiliate programs. However, affiliates still face integration challenges when attempting to provide their users a customized subset of the merchant's website.","In recent years, information handling systems have also been instrumental in the widespread adoption of social media into the mainstream of everyday life. Social media commonly refers to the use of web-based technologies for the creation and exchange of user-generated content for social interaction. As such, it currently accounts for approximately 22% of all time spent on the Internet. More recently, various aspects of social media have become an increasingly popular for enabling customer feedback, and by extension, have likewise evolved into a viable marketing channel for vendors. This new marketing channel, sometimes referred to as \u201csocial marketing,\u201d has proven to not only have a higher customer retention rate than traditional marketing channels, but to also provide higher demand generation \u201clift.\u201d","Another aspect of social marketing that is gaining popularity is syndicated commerce, where a scaled-down version of a merchant's online storefront is embedded in an affiliate's web page or social media site. Such syndicated commerce sites provide the opportunity to increase sales, a portion of which is typically provided to the affiliate. However, these embedded storefronts generally require custom development, which inhibit their implementation. Furthermore, the content (e.g., products, promotions, etc.) they contain are often static and are not presented in either the context of its adjacent content and related topics. Moreover, they generally fail to provide contextual recommendations to guide the viewer in selecting the ideal product for their needs. As a result, the likelihood of a sales conversion occurring is diminished.","A method and system are disclosed for providing syndicated commerce recommendations. In various embodiments, a widget is generated from a template comprising user-selectable options and then embedded within a web page. In these and other embodiments, social data associated with a user is received and then processed to generate a set of recommendation objects (e.g., a product, an offer, a deal, an advertisement, text, a video, an image, a Uniform Resource Indicator, etc.). The set of recommendation objects are then displayed within the widget.","In various embodiments, the social data is received dynamically from a social data source, such as a social network site. In one embodiment, the user provides identity data to access such a social network site. In this embodiment, the widget uses the identity data to request the social data from the social network site. In various embodiments, the social data may comprise identity data, a social score, or social graph data associated with the user. In certain embodiments, the social data may comprise a page keyword or a referral keyword. In one embodiment, the processing of the social data comprises semantic analysis to generate the set of recommendation objects.","A method and system are disclosed for providing syndicated commerce recommendations. For purposes of this disclosure, an information handling system may include any instrumentality or aggregate of instrumentalities operable to compute, classify, process, transmit, receive, retrieve, originate, switch, store, display, manifest, detect, record, reproduce, handle, or utilize any form of information, intelligence, or data for business, scientific, control, or other purposes. For example, an information handling system may be a personal computer, a network storage device, or any other suitable device and may vary in size, shape, performance, functionality, and price. The information handling system may include random access memory (RAM), one or more processing resources such as a central processing unit (CPU) or hardware or software control logic, ROM, and\/or other types of nonvolatile memory. Additional components of the information handling system may include one or more disk drives, one or more network ports for communicating with external devices as well as various input and output (I\/O) devices, such as a keyboard, a mouse, and a video display. The information handling system may also include one or more buses operable to transmit communications between the various hardware components.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","104","106","108","100","110","140","142","100","112","114","112","116","118","120","122","124","100","118","120","122","124","142","118","120","122","124","142"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["118","120","122","124","120","214","120","218","222","222","120","224","226","228"]},"In one embodiment, the blog\/site management module  is used by the plurality of affiliates  to manage the posting and linking of social commerce content from the affiliate's online blog or website to the social commerce marketplace system .
