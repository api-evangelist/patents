In particular, the present invention relates to modified IgNAR variable domains and to domains from members of the immunoglobulin superfamily that have been modified to include structural features derived from IgNAR variable domains.","The immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) includes immunoglobulins and numerous other cell surface and soluble molecules that mediate recognition, adhesion or binding functions in the immune system. They share partial amino acid sequence homology and tertiary structural features that were originally identified in immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy and light chains.","Molecules of the IgSF are identified by a characteristic IgSF fold structure, a sandwich structure formed by two \u03b2-sheets, packed face-to-face and linked by a disulphide bond between the B and F strands (Bork 1994; Chothia 1998). IgSF frameworks are further classified into 3-4 major categories, the Variable (V)-, Constant (C)-, I- and I2-sets, based on \u03b2-strand number, configuration and hydrogen bond patterns (Bork 1994; Cassasnovas 1998).","Conventional immunoglobulins have two heavy polypeptide chains linked by disulphide bonds at a hinge portion, and two light polypeptide chains, each of which is linked to a respective heavy chain by disulphide bonding. Each heavy chain comprises a variable (VH) domain at the N-terminal end and a number of constant (CH) domains. Each light chain has a variable (VL) domain at the N-terminal end and a constant (CL) domain at the C-terminal end, the VL and CL domains aligning with the VH domain and the first CH domain, respectively. Unlike immunoglobulins, T-cell receptors (TCRs) are heterodimers having \u03b1 and \u03b2 chains of equal size, each chain consisting of an N-terminal variable domain (V\u03b1 or V\u03b2) and a constant domain.","Typically, the variable domains on different polypeptide chains interact across hydrophobic interfaces to form binding sites designed to receive a particular target molecule. In the case of immunoglobulins, each pair of VH\/VL domains form an antigen binding site, the CH and CL domains not being directly involved in binding the antibody to the antigen. Similarly, in the case of TCRs, the V\u03b1 and V\u03b2 domains form the binding site for target molecules, namely peptides presented by a histocompatibility antigen.","The amino acid sequences of variable domains vary particularly from one molecule to another. This variation in sequence enables the molecules to recognise an extremely wide variety of target molecules. Variable domains are often viewed as comprising four framework regions, whose sequences are relatively conserved, connected by three hypervariable or complementarity determining loop regions (CDRs) (Kabat 1983 & 1987; Bork 1994). The CDRs are held in close proximity by the framework regions and, with the CDRs from the other variable domain, contribute to the formation of the binding site.","With the development of new molecular biology and recombinant DNA techniques, research interest in the IgSF field has increased. Among the main reasons for this increased interest is the desire to develop novel therapeutics and diagnostics based on immunoglobulins or other IgSF molecules.","Using the hybridoma technique developed by Kohler and Milstein, the production of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) of almost any specificity is now well known. However, the production of human antibodies remains difficult, with the vast majority of MAbs produced being of rodent, in particular mouse, origin. Such antibodies are often antigenic in humans.","Researchers have therefore investigated producing modified immunoglobulins which are as \u201chuman\u201d as possible, but which still retain the appropriate specificity. For example, \u201cchimeric\u201d antibodies have been constructed in which an animal antigen-binding variable domain is coupled to a human constant domain. The isotype of the human constant domain may be selected to tailor the chimeric antibody for participation in antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement dependent cytotoxicity. However, chimeric antibodies typically may contain about one third rodent (or other non-human species) sequence and consequently are often still capable of eliciting a significant antigenic response in humans.","In a further effort to resolve the antigen binding functions of antibodies and to minimize the use of heterologous sequences in human antibodies, others have modified the specific domains by, for example, substituting rodent CDRs for CDR sequences from the corresponding segments of a human antibody. In some cases, substituting CDRs from rodent antibodies for the human CDRs in human frameworks is sufficient to transfer high antigen binding affinity as described in EP 239400.","An alternative approach has been to use fragments of immunoglobulins or other molecules of the IgSF. For example, specific binding reagents can be formed by association of only the VH and VL domains into a Fv module. Bacterial expression is then enhanced by joining the variable domains with a linker polypeptide into a single-chain scFv molecule.","Methods to improve the expression and folding characteristics of single-chain Fv molecules have been described by Nieba (1997). The properties of single V-domains, derived from natural mammalian antibodies, have been described in WO 90\/05144, EP 368684 and WO 91\/08482. Single camelid V-domains have been described by WO\/96\/34103 and in WO\/94\/25591. A method for reducing the hydrophobicity of the surface of a human VH domain by replacing human amino acid sequences with camelid amino acid sequences was described by Davies and Riechmann (1994). Methods to exchange other regions of human VH sequences with camel sequences to further enhance protein stability, including the insertion of cysteine residues in CDR loops, were described by Davies and Riechmann (1996).","Several attempts to engineer high-affinity single domain binding reagents using either the VH or VL domains alone have been unsuccessful, due to lack of binding specificity and the inherent insolubility of single domains exposing unpaired hydrophobic VH\/VL binding faces (Kortt 1995).","The TCR has two variable domains that combine into a structure similar to the Fv module of an antibody that results from combination of the VH and VL domains. Novotny (1991) described how the V\u03b1 and V\u03b2 domains of the TCR can be fused and expressed as a single chain polypeptide and, further, how to alter surface residues to reduce the hydrophobicity directly analogous to an antibody scFv. Other publications describe the expression characteristics of single-chain TCRs comprising two V\u03b1 and V\u03b2 domains (Wulfing 1994; Ward 1991).","The three-dimensional crystal structures have been published for intact immunoglobulins, a variety of immunoglobulin fragments, antibody-antigen complexes and for other IgSF molecules such as the TCR. It is known that the function of IgSF molecules is dependent on their three dimensional structure, and that amino acid substitutions can change the three-dimensional structure of, for example, an antibody (Snow and Amzel 1986). Based upon molecular modelling, it has been shown that the antigen binding affinity of a humanized antibody can be increased by mutagenesis (Riechmann 1988; Queen 1989).","The Immunoglobulin New Antigen Receptors (IgNARs) are an unconventional subset of antibodies recently identified in fish. In domain structure, IgNAR proteins are reportedly similar to other immune effector molecules, being disulphide-bonded homodimers of two polypeptide chains having five constant domains (Cs) and one variable domain (V) (Greenberg 1995). However, unlike conventional antibodies, there are no associated light chains and the individual variable domains are independent in solution and do not appear to associate across a hydrophobic interface (as seen for conventional VH\/VL type antibodies) (Roux 1998).","IgNARs have been identified in all shark species studied to date. In particular, IgNARs have been identified in the serum of nurse sharks (Greenberg 1995) and wobbegong sharks (Nuttall 2001). The cell-surface expression of IgNARs has also been reported (Rumfelt 2002). Research has implicated IgNARs as true molecules of the immune armoury, and as the most probable agents of the shark antigen-driven affinity-maturation antibody response (Diaz 1999; Nuttall 2002; Dooley 2003).","IgNARs identified to date have been placed into three categories based on their time of appearance during the shark development and on their postulated disulphide bonding pattern within the variable domains (Diaz 2002; Nuttall 2003). Type 1 Vtopology is characterised by an extra framework disulphide linkage and, usually, cysteines in the extended loop region analogous to a conventional CDR3 loop, which it has been suggested may form intra-loop disulphide bonds. Type 2 Vtopology is characterised by cysteines in the loop regions analogous to conventional CDR1 and CDR3 loops in approximately two thirds of cases, which it has been postulated may form inter-loop disulphide bonds. Type 3 Vtopology is characterised by a relatively constant sized loop region analogous to a conventional CDR3 loop of limited diversity and a characteristic conserved tryptophan residue within the loop region analogous to a CDR1 loop.","Regardless of type, all IgNARs identified to date are reported as having minimally variable loop regions analogous to conventional CDR1 and CDR2 loops, with diversity being concentrated in an elongated loop region analogous to a conventional CDR3 loop (Greenberg 1995; Nuttall 2001; Diaz 2002). The elongated loop region can reportedly vary in length from 5 to 23 residues in length, though the modal classes are more in the order of 15 to 17 residues (Nuttall 2003). This is significantly larger than for conventional murine and human antibodies, but approximate to the extended CDR3 loops found in camelid single VH antibodies (Wu 1993; Muyldermans 1994).","Large bacteriophage libraries have been generated based upon the Type 2 Vrepertoire from wobbegong sharks and used to isolate a number of Type 2 Vs proteins encapsulating significant variability within the framework and the loop region analogous to a conventional CDR1 loop. However, the most significant diversity was within the extended loop region analogous to a conventional CDR3 loop, the extended loop region varying in both length and amino acid composition (Nuttall 2001; Nuttall 2003).","Various computer-modelled structures for Type 2 Vs have been reported in the literature (Roux 1998; Nuttall 2001; Diaz 2002; Nuttall 2004). Although such computer modelling can offer key insights into structure, the definitive structure remains to be determined from crystallographic analysis. In the case of Vs, the elucidation of the crystal structure is particularly important.","In a first aspect, the present invention provides a crystal of a variable domain of a Type 2 IgNAR that effectively diffracts X-rays for the determination of the atomic coordinates of the variable domain of the IgNAR to a resolution of better than 4.0 \u212b, wherein the variable domain of the Type 2 IgNAR consists of 105 to 125 amino acid residues and comprises an amino acid sequence according to Table 1 and\/or .","In another aspect, the present invention provides a crystal of a variable domain of a Type 2 IgNAR comprising a structure defined by all or a portion of the coordinates of Appendix I(a), (b), (c) or (d)\u00b1a root mean square deviation from the C\u03b1 atoms of less than 0.5 \u212b.","In another aspect, the present invention provides a method of homology modelling comprising the steps of: (a) aligning a representation of an amino acid sequence of an IgSF domain with the amino acid sequence of 12Y-1, 12Y-2, 12A-9 or 1A-7 as shown in  to match homologous regions of the amino acid sequences;

These proteins, designated 12Y-1 (SEQ ID NOs: 1 & 2) and 12Y-2 (SEQ ID NOs: 3 & 4), were isolated from a library containing a broad mixture of Type 2 Vframework scaffolds derived from the native wobbegong shark repertoire, combined with both naturally occurring and synthetic loop regions analogous to CDR3 sequences (Nuttall 2003).","We have now isolated two further IgNAR variable domains designated 12A-9 and 1A-7.","V12A-9 (SEQ ID NOs: 9 & 10) was isolated from a library containing a broad mixture of naturally occurring Type 2 Vframework scaffolds derived from the wobbegong shark by biopanning against the Gingipain K protease from (Nuttall et al. 2002). This IgNAR is completely natural, including the CDR3 analogous loop region (loop region 8). In common with many IgNAR variable domains, a disulphide bridge links and stabilises the CDR1 and CDR3 analogous loop regions, in this case connecting residues Cys29 and Cys89.","V1A-7 (SEQ ID NOs: 5 & 6) is specific for the anti-AMA-1 mouse IgG 5G8 and was isolated using the same procedure as described for the isolation of 12Y-1 and 12Y-2, i.e. biopanning of the phage displayed IgNAR library. Binding is through an \u201cSYP\u201d motif found in the 1A-7 \u201csynthetic\u201d CDR3 analogous loop region (i.e. loop region 8).","While the 12Y-1, 12Y-2 and 1A-7 loop regions analogous to conventional CDR3 loops fit into the synthetic category, their lengths (16, 18 and 16 residues, respectively) and amino acid composition are typical of naturally occurring IgNAR antibodies. 12A-9 is a naturally occurring shark IgNAR and has a loop region of length 13 residues analogous to a conventional CDR3 loop.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0098","num":"0100"},"figref":"FIG. 1","sub":"NAR"},"Table 1 shows the amino acid variation across the sixteen Type 2 Vs sequences in  and the Type 2 Vs sequences reported by Nuttall (2002 & 2003). It is evident from  and Table 1 that there is a large degree of conservation of sequence outside of the loop regions analogous to conventional CDR1 and CDR3 loops.","We have now successfully generated crystals of 12Y-1, 12Y-2, 12A-9 and 1A-7 and have determined the structures of these proteins. Furthermore, we have compared these structures with a range of known immune molecules, i.e. members of the immunoglobulin superfamily.","12Y-1 and 12Y-2 Vs were expressed in and placed into crystallization trials in the presence or absence of AMA1 antigen. No crystal leads were observed in the presence of antigen, possibly due to the intrinsically flexible domain structure of the AMA1 protein (Hodder 1996). In contrast, good quality crystals were obtained for both 12Y-1 (space group I422) and 12Y-2 (space group I222) in the absence of antigen.","12A-9 and 1A-7 Vs were expressed in and placed into crystallization trials. Successful conditions were scaled up and diffraction quality crystals obtained for both 12A-9 (space group P222) and 1A-7 (space group I222).","Data sets generated for 12Y-1 and 12Y-2 crystal forms resisted solution by standard molecular replacement techniques, using a broad range of immunoglobulin superfamily proteins as template. We believed this was indicative of the unique nature of these proteins, thus the 12Y-1 structure was solved ab initio by phasing with two isomorphous heavy atom derivatives (Lutetium (III) Acetate Hydrate: LAH, and Potassium Hexachloro Rhenium: PHR). However, this structure was incomplete, lacking residues Phe88 to Pro98, most likely due to inherent flexibility of the loop region analogous to a conventional CDR3 loop within this crystal form. The complete 12Y-2 structure was then solved by molecular replacement using the 2.8 \u212b 12Y-1 structure as a model.","Whereas the 12Y-1 asymmetric unit contains one molecule, the 12Y-2 crystal asymmetric units contain two molecules (Chains A; B); the relative disposition of these two 12Y-2 monomers requires rotation by 176.20 and screw translation by \u22121.1 \u212b to overlay the Ca atoms. The final 12Y-2 structure was refined to 2.18 \u212b resolution, with 93.4% of residues in the most favoured regions of the Ramachandran plot with no residues in the generously allowed or disallowed regions. Details of the diffraction data and refinement statistics are presented in Table 2.

The search model for 12A-9 was the 12Y-1 structure (above) without the CDR3 loop. The search model for 1A-7 was the 12Y-1 two-fold dimer structure without the CDR3 loops. In the final 12A-9 structure, 88.4% of the residues are in the most favoured regions of the Ramachandran plot, with one residue in the generously allowed or disallowed regions. In the final 1A-7 structure, 90.9% of the residues are in the most favoured regions of the Ramachandran plot, with two residues for chain C in the generously allowed or disallowed regions.

Preferably, amino acid sequences will have at least 90%, more preferably at least 95% sequence identity with those residues in the consensus sequence in Table 1 that are totally conserved.","It will be understood that reference herein to comprising an amino acid sequence according to  includes amino acid sequences having at least at least 80%, more preferably at least 85% and yet more preferably at least 90% sequence identity with a sequence shown in .","For the avoidance of doubt, the sequence identity figures given above in respect of Table 1 and  exclude the variable regions in Table 1 and corresponding variable regions in .","In one embodiment, the crystal has a space group I422 with unit cell dimensions of a=97.26 \u212b, b=97.26 \u212b and c=65.23 \u212b, and a unit cell variability of 5% in all dimensions.","In another embodiment, the crystal has a space group I222with unit cell dimensions of a=65.28 \u212b, b=92.05 \u212b and c=98.22 \u212b, and a unit cell variability of 5% in all dimensions.","In another embodiment, the crystal has a space group P222 with unit cell dimensions of a=38.27 \u212b, b=68.32 \u212b and c=39.51 \u212b, and a unit cell variability of 5% in all dimensions.","In another embodiment, the crystal has a space group I222with unit cell dimensions of a=80.50 \u212b, b=88.66 \u212b and c=101.75 \u212b, and a unit cell variability of 5% in all dimensions.","Preferably, the crystals effectively diffract X-rays to a resolution of better than 3.0 \u212b, more preferably better than 2.5 \u212b.","In a further aspect, the present invention provides a crystal of a variable domain of a Type 2 IgNAR comprising a structure defined by all or a portion of the coordinates of Appendix I(a), (b), (c) or (d)\u00b1 a root mean square deviation from the C\u03b1 atoms of less than 0.5 \u212b.","The IgNAR domain structures set out in Appendices I(a), (b), (c) and (d) are monomer structures. This is the first time that a monomer has been observed crystallographically for an IgNAR variable domain.","In Appendices I(a), (b), (c) and (d), the third column denotes the atom type, the fourth column the residue type, the fifth column the chain identification, the sixth column the residue number (the atom numbering as described in Hong (2000)), the seventh, eighth and ninth columns the X, Y, Z coordinates, respectively, of the atom in question, the tenth column the occupancy of the atom, the eleventh column the temperature factor of the atom, and the last the atom type.","Each of the Appendices is presented in an internally consistent format. For example, the coordinates of the atoms of each amino acid residue are listed such that the backbone nitrogen atom is first, followed by the C-\u03b1 backbone carbon atom, designated CA, followed by the carbon and oxygen of the protein backbone and finally side chain residues (designated according to one standard convention). Alternative file formats (e.g. such as a format consistent with that of the EBI Macromolecular Structure Database (Hinxton, UK)) which may include a different ordering of these atoms, or a different designation of the side-chain residues, may be used or preferred by others of skill in the art. However it will be apparent that the use of a different file format to present or manipulate the coordinates of the Appendices is within the scope of the present invention.","As discussed herein, we have identified structural features in 12Y-1, 12Y-2, 12A-9 and 1A-7 IgNAR variable domains that are important for antigen binding or solubility\/stability of these domains. These features can be introduced into domains of other members of the IgSF (for example, I-set or V-set domains) in order to alter binding properties or to improve solubility and\/or stability. The information presented in Appendix I can be used, for example, to compare structures of IgSF domains that have been modified so as to more closely resemble the structure of IgNAR variable domains.","Protein structure similarity is routinely expressed and measured by the root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.), which measures the difference in positioning in space between two sets of atoms. By \u201croot mean square deviation\u201d we mean the square root of the arithmetic mean of the squares of the deviations from the mean. The r.m.s.d. measures distance between equivalent atoms after their optimal superposition. The r.m.s.d. can be calculated over all atoms, over residue backbone atoms (i.e. the nitrogen-carbon-carbon backbone atoms of the protein amino acid residues), main chain atoms only (i.e. the nitrogen-carbon-oxygen-carbon backbone atoms of the protein amino acid residues), side chain atoms only or more usually over C-\u03b1 atoms only. For the purposes of this invention, the r.m.s.d. can be calculated over any of these, using any of the methods outlined below.","Methods of comparing protein structures are discussed in Methods of Enzymology, vol 115, pg 397-420. The necessary least-squares algebra to calculate r.m.s.d. has been given by Rossman (1975) although faster methods have been described by Kabsch (1976 & 1978), Hendrickson (1979) and McLachan (1979). Some algorithms use an iterative procedure in which the one molecule is moved relative to the other, such as that described by Ferro (1977). Other methods e.g. Kabsch's algorithm locate the best fit directly.","It is usual to consider C-\u03b1 atoms and the r.m.s.d. can then be calculated using programs such as LSQKAB (Collaborative Computational Project 4. (CCP4 1994)), MNYFIT (part of a collection of programs called COMPOSER) (Sutcliffe (1987)), MAPS (Lu 1998), QUANTA (Jones 1991 and commercially available from Accelerys, San Diego, Calif.), Insight (commercially available from Accelerys, San Diego, Calif.), Sybyl\u00ae (commercially available from Tripos, Inc., St Louis), O (Jones 1991) and other coordinate fitting programs.","In, for example, the programs LSQKAB and O, the user can define the residues in the two proteins that are to be paired for the purpose of the calculation. Alternatively, the pairing of residues can be determined by generating a sequence alignment of the two proteins. The atomic coordinates can then be superimposed according to this alignment and an r.m.s.d. value calculated. The program (Bruns 1999) performs the alignment of homologous protein sequences, and the superposition of homologous protein atomic coordinates. Once aligned, the r.m.s.d. can be calculated using programs detailed above. For sequence identical, or highly identical, the structural alignment of proteins can be done manually or automatically as outlined above. Another approach would be to generate a superposition of protein atomic coordinates without considering the sequence.","It is more normal when comparing significantly different sets of coordinates to calculate the r.m.s.d. value over C-\u03b1 atoms only. It is particularly useful when analysing side chain movement to calculate the r.m.s.d. over all atoms and this can be done using LSQKAB and other programs.","Varying the atomic positions of the atoms of the structure by up to about 0.5 \u212b in a concerted way, preferably up to about 0.3 \u212b in any direction will result in a structure which is substantially the same as the structure of Appendix I(a) or (b) in terms of both its structural characteristics and utility e.g. for molecular structure-based analysis.","Those of skill in the art will appreciate that in many applications of the invention, it is not necessary to utilise all the coordinates of Appendix I(a), (b), (c) or (d), but merely a portion of them. The term portion is intended to define a sub-set of the coordinates, which may or may not represent contiguous amino acid residues in the 12Y-1, 12Y-2, 12A-9 or 1A-7 structure.","The invention also provides a means for homology modelling of other IgSF domains. By \u201chomology modelling\u201d, it is meant the prediction of related IgSF domain structures based either on X-ray crystallographic data or computer-assisted de novo prediction of structure, based upon manipulation of the coordinate data of Appendix I.","The term \u201chomologous regions\u201d describes amino acid residues in two sequences that are identical or have similar (e.g. aliphatic, aromatic, polar, negatively charged, or positively charged) side-chain chemical groups. Identical and similar residues in homologous regions are sometimes described as being respectively \u201cinvariant\u201d and \u201cconserved\u201d by those skilled in the art.","In general, the method involves comparing the amino acid sequences of the IgNAR domain of Appendix I(a), (b), (c) or (d) with a modified IgSF domain by aligning the amino acid sequences (Dunbrack (1997)). Amino acids in the sequences are then compared and groups of amino acids that are homologous (conveniently referred to as \u201ccorresponding regions\u201d) are grouped together. This method detects conserved regions of the polypeptides and accounts for amino acid insertions or deletions.","Homology between amino acid sequences can be determined using commercially available algorithms. The programs BLAST, gapped BLAST, BLASTN, PSI-BLAST and BLAST 2 sequences (provided by the National Center for Biotechnology Information) are widely used in the art for this purpose, and can align homologous regions of two amino acid sequences. These may be used with default parameters to determine the degree of homology between the amino acid sequence of the 12Y-1, 12Y-2, 12A-9 or 1A-7 protein and other IgSF domains, which are to be modelled.","Homology modelling as such is a technique that is well known to those skilled in the art (see e.g. Greer 1985 and Blundell 1988). The techniques described in these references, as well as other homology modelling techniques, generally available in the art, may be used in performing the present invention","Thus the invention provides a method of homology modelling comprising the steps of: (a) aligning a representation of an amino acid sequence of an IgSF domain with the amino acid sequence of 12Y-1, 12Y-2, 12A-9 or 1A-9 as shown in  to match homologous regions of the amino acid sequences; (b) modelling the structure of the matched homologous regions of said IgSF domain on the corresponding regions of the 12Y-1, 12Y-2, 12A-9 or 1A-7 structure as defined by Appendix I(a), (b), (c) or (d); and (c) determining a conformation (e.g. so that favourable interactions are formed within the IgSF domain and\/or so that a low energy conformation is formed) for said IgSF domain which substantially preserves the structure of said matched homologous regions.","Preferably one or all of steps (a) to (c) are performed by computer modelling.","The aspects of the invention described herein which utilise the 12Y-1, 12Y-2, 12A-9 or 1A-7 structure in silico may be equally applied to models of modified IgSF domains obtained by methods of the present invention, and this application forms a further aspect of the present invention. Thus having determined the conformation of 12Y-1, 12Y-2, 12A-9 or 1A-7, such conformation may be used in a computer-based method of rational design of modified domains for diagnostic or therapeutic applications as described herein.","The structure of 12Y-1, 12Y-2, 12A-9 or 1A-7 can also be used to solve the crystal structure of other IgNAR domains, where X-ray diffraction data or NMR spectroscopic data of these other domains has been generated and requires interpretation in order to provide a structure.","One method that may be employed for these purposes is molecular replacement. In this method, the unknown IgNAR domain crystal structure, may be determined using the 12Y-1, 12Y-2, 12A-9 or 1A-7 structure coordinates as provided herein. This method will provide an accurate structural form for the unknown crystal more quickly and efficiently than attempting to determine such information ab initio.","Examples of computer programs known in the art for performing molecular replacement are CNX (Brunger 1998a (also commercially available from Accelerys San Diego, Calif.)) or AMORE (Navaza 1994).","Thus, in a further aspect, the invention provides a method for determining the structure of a protein, which method comprises; providing the co-ordinates of Appendix I(a), (b), (c) or (d), and either (a) positioning the co-ordinates in the crystal unit cell of said protein so as to provide a structure for said protein or (b) assigning NMR spectra Peaks of said protein by manipulating the coordinates of Appendix I(a), (b), (c) or (d).","In another aspect, the present invention provides systems, particularly a computer system, the systems containing at least one of the following: (a) atomic coordinate data according to Appendix I, said data defining the three-dimensional structure of 12Y-1, 12Y-2, 12A-9 or 1A-7 or at least selected coordinates thereof; (b) structure factor data (where a structure factor comprises the amplitude and phase of the diffracted wave) for 12Y-1, 12Y-2, 12A-9 or 1A-7, said structure factor data being derivable from the atomic coordinate data of Appendix I; (c) atomic coordinate data of an IgSF domain generated by homology modelling of the IgSF domain based on the data of Appendix I; (d) atomic coordinate data of the IgSF domain generated by interpreting X-ray crystallographic data or NMR data by reference to the data of Appendix I; and (e) structure factor data derivable from the atomic coordinate data of (c) or (d).","For example the computer system may comprise: (i) a computer-readable data storage medium comprising data storage material encoded with the computer-readable data; (ii) a working memory for storing instructions for processing said computer-readable data; and (iii) a central-processing unit coupled to said working memory and to said computer-readable data storage medium for processing said computer-readable data and thereby generating structures and\/or performing rational drug design.

For example, RASMOL (Sayle 1995) is a publicly available computer software package which allows access and analysis of atomic coordinate data for structure determination and\/or rational drug design.","On the other hand, structure factor data, which are derivable from atomic coordinate data (see e.g. Blundell 1976), are particularly useful for calculating e.g. difference Fourier electron density maps.","A further aspect of the invention provides a method of providing data for generating structures and\/or performing rational drug design for IgSF domains, the method comprising: (i) establishing communication with a remote device containing computer-readable data comprising at least one of: (a) atomic coordinate data according to Appendix I, said data defining the three-dimensional structure of 12Y-1, 12Y-2, 12A-9 or 1A-7, at least one sub-domain of the three-dimensional structure of 12Y-1, 12Y-2, 12A-9 or 1A-7, or the coordinates of a plurality of atoms of 12Y-1, 12Y-2, 12A-9 or 1A-7; (b) structure factor data for 12Y-1, 12Y-2, 12A-9 or 1A-7, said structure factor data being derivable from the atomic coordinate data of Appendix I; (c) atomic coordinate data of a modified IgSF domain generated by homology modelling of the domain based on the data of Appendix I; (d) atomic coordinate data of a protein generated by interpreting X-ray crystallographic data or NMR data by reference to the data of Appendix I; and (e) structure factor data derivable from the atomic coordinate data of (c) or (d); and (ii) receiving said computer-readable data from said remote device.","A further aspect of the invention provides a method of providing data for generating structures and\/or performing rational drug design for IgSF domains, the method comprising: (i) establishing communication with a remote device containing computer-readable data comprising at least one of: (a) atomic coordinate data according to Appendix I, said data defining the three-dimensional structure of 12Y-1, 12Y-2, 12A-9 or 1A-7, at least one sub-domain of the three-dimensional structure of 12Y-1, 12Y-2, 12A-9 or 1A-7, or the coordinates of a plurality of atoms of 12Y-1, 12Y-2, 12A-9 or 1A-7; (b) structure factor data for 12Y-1, 12Y-2, 12A-9 or 1A-7, said structure factor data being derivable from the atomic coordinate data of Appendix I; (c) atomic coordinate data of a modified IgSF domain generated by homology modelling of the domain based on the data of Appendix I; (d) atomic coordinate data of a protein generated by interpreting X-ray crystallographic data or NMR data by reference to the data of Appendix I; and (e) structure factor data derivable from the atomic coordinate data of (c) or (d); and (ii) receiving said computer-readable data from said remote device.","Thus the remote device may comprise, for example, a computer system or computer readable media of one of the previous aspects of the invention. The device may be in a different country or jurisdiction from where the computer-readable data is received. The communication may be via the internet, intranet, email etc. Typically the communication will be electronic in nature, but some or all of the communication pathway may be optical, for example, over optical fibres. Additionally, the communication may be through radio signals or satellite transmissions.","The folding topologies of the 12Y-1, 12Y-2, 12A-9 and 1A-7 structures show the characteristic immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) fold, identified by a \u03b2-sandwich structure formed by two \u03b2-sheets, packed face-to-face and linked by a disulfide bond between strands B and F (Bork 1994, Chothia 1998). The inner-strand features are turns, coils and loops including two loop regions analogous to CDR1 and CDR3 loops.","The structures comprise eight \u03b2-strand regions, designated A, A\u2032, B, C, D, E, F and G according to , and nine loop regions, designated 1 to 9 according to . As used herein, a \u201cloop region\u201d is a portion of peptide sequence that extends either from or between a \u03b2-strand conformation or \u03b2-strand conformations. As used herein, a \u201c\u03b2-strand region\u201d contains an extended \u03b2-strand conformation, i.e. \u03b2-strands comprising at least 4, preferably at least 5 amino acids. Loop regions are typically free of extended \u03b2-strand conformations but may include shortened \u03b2-strand conformations, i.e. \u03b2-strands comprising less than 4 amino acids. Apart from N- and C-terminal loop regions, the loop regions connect \u03b2-strands running in opposite directions.","Preferably, loop region 5 contains shortened \u03b2-strand conformations. We have also found that loop region 8 may contain \u03b2-strand conformations, which may be either shortened or extended, and these are discussed in more detail below. Preferably, no other loop regions contain \u03b2-strand conformations.","Detailed analysis of the 12Y-1, 12Y-2, 12A-9 and 1A-7 frameworks indicates a novel folding topology which resembles the intermediate (I-set) fold in a number of important characteristics, but also with distinct structural features found in variable (V-set) domains. More particularly, the structures comprise 8 \u03b2-strand regions, designated A, A\u2032, B, C, D, E, F and G according to , and nine loop regions, designated 1 to 9 according to , in which loop region 5 comprises 2 shortened \u03b2-strand regions, designated D\u2032 and C\u2032, and 3 loop regions, designated 5a, 5b and 5c, according to .","From the data assimilated, Table 3 presents a breakdown of the number of amino acid residues present in the various loop and \u03b2-strand regions of Type 2 Vs. Loop region 4 is analogous to a conventional CDR1 loop. Loop region 8 is analogous to a conventional CDR3 loop. As loop region 8 can contain a variable number of amino acids ranging from about 5 to 30, a default value of 18 is used on which to base the residue numbering for subsequent regions. Consequently, the residue numbering does not necessarily correlate with the total number of amino acid residues present in the sequence. It is based on loop region 8 having a default value of 18 amino acid residues.","Table 3A presents a breakdown of the number of amino acid residues present in the loop region 5 of Type 2 Vs. Loop region 5 comprises 2 shortened \u03b2-strand regions, designated D\u2032 and C\u2032, and 3 loop regions, designated 5a, 5b and 5c.","Both V-set and I-set proteins have a typical kink in the first strand (A\u2032), which allows the first part of the strand (A) to hydrogen bond to one part of the \u03b2-sandwich sheet and the second part (A\u2032) to the extended G strand of the other \u03b2-sheet. This first-strand kink is found in the Vproteins as depicted in . It starts with the highly conserved cis-proline (Pro7), the most typical residue in first-strand kinks of variable domains (Spada 1998). Like V-set proteins, 12Y-1, 12Y-2, 12A-9 and 1A-7 also have bulges in the C terminal G strand (conserved Gly-Ala-Gly motif) and in the C\u2032 strand. Most significantly, 12Y-1, 12Y-2, 12A-9 and 1A-7 resemble I-set proteins in having a short C\u2032 strand (three H-bonds) and a very short C\u2033 strand (labelled as D\u2032 in ) which atypically switches from one \u03b2-sheet to the other, such that a single hydrogen bond links it to the D strand rather than the C\u2032 strand as in V-set domains.","The 12Y-2 chain A and B (r.m.s.d. of 0.53 \u212b for C of 113 residues), and the 12Y-1 framework (r.m.s.d. of 0.72 \u212b for C of 100 residues) are closely related (see ). Further structural comparison (see ) of the 12Y-2 chain A to diverse variable and intermediate set proteins for which structural information is available, shows Vs to be most closely related to I-set molecules such as the Neural Cell Adhesion Molecules (NCAMs) (Harpaz 1994; Chothia 1997; Soroka 2003,) and Telokin (Chothia 1997; Holden 1992). This similarity is heavily biased by the absence of extended C\u2032 and C\u2033 strands, connected by a CDR2 loop, that in conventional antibodies extends up to the top of the molecule and participates in immune recognition. In contrast, comparison of the 12Y-2 chain A to conventional T cell receptor (TCR) V\u03b1, and V, V, and single-domain VH antibodies, shows little consistent structural identity beyond a core of residues based around the major strands, minus the C\u2032, C\u2033 and CDR regions. The single VH domains found in the Camelidae may be expected to be similar to the Vstructure, however, these single domain antibodies clearly arose from a mammalian IgG-like progenitor, successively acquiring solubilizing, stabilizing, and extensive CDR3 mutations (Nguyen 2002). The low structural homology between VH and Vs is consistent with their very low sequence homology, and reflects convergent evolutionary solutions to the problem of achieving solvent solubility and binding affinity.","In , the relative positions of the three classically defined antibody CDR or hypervariable loop regions are shown. Sequence alignments show IgNAR antibody variability confined to the loop regions 4 and 8 corresponding to conventional CDR1 and CDR-3 regions, and this is confirmed by our structural analysis where a loop region analogous to a typical \u201cCDR2 loop\u201d is missing and its bottom turn appears to be well separated from the antigen-binding face (or paratope). Sequence analysis also suggests that loop region 4 is the minor loop component, invariant in length and limited in diversity. This region is confined to residues 28-33 (12Y-1: SYGLES; SEQ ID NO: 112; 12Y-2: SFELKD; SEQ ID NO: 113), with a topology close to that of canonical structure 2 observed in antibody light chain variable domains (see ; Cr.m.s.d. of 1.22 \u212b with 1 hzh V) (Chothia 1989). Where a half cysteine is present in the Vloop region 4, it is exclusively found at positions 29 or 32. The side chains of these two residues extend outward and upward towards the extended loop region 8, and are ideally positioned to make contact with the concomitant half cysteine in this region (see ). Given the enormous topological latitude inherent in the highly diverse loop regions 8, a wide variety of conformations can clearly be adopted by loop region 8, despite the restraints of these stabilizing disulphide linkages. Such extreme diversity has also been observed for the CDR3 loop of Vsingle domain antibodies, with a single antigen eliciting a highly varied immune response with significantly different loop topologies (Desmyter 2002).","The 12Y-2 CDR3 loop is present in two crystal forms, corresponding to chains A and B, and extends from residues Phe86 to Glu103. Unusually, the chain A loop region 8 adopts a clear \u03b2-hairpin configuration with \u03b2-strands from Phe86-Leu89, and Leu98-Glu103, separated by a flexible loop (Pro90-Ser97). For chain B, the \u03b2-hairpin extends even further into loop region 8 with residues Phe86-Asp93 and Tyr96-Glu103 involved in \u03b2-strand formation (see ). Structurally, the \u03b2-hairpins are formed by the main chain hydrogen bonds (<3A): Tyr87 (O)-Phe100(N); Tyr87 (N)-Phe100(O); Leu89 (N)-Leu98 (O); Leu89 (O)-Leu98 (N), and, Asp93(O)-Tyr96(O) (). Additional H-bonds for loop region 8 of chain B are: Asp93 (N)-Tyr96 (O); Asp93 (O)-Tyr96 (N); and, Leu91 (O)-Tyr96 (O). Thus, the 12Y-2 loop region 8 extends outward and upward from the immunoglobulin framework, at the furthest point extending \u02dc20A above the conserved \u03b2-sheet framework, and tipped by the bulky side-chains of tyrosine residues at positions 94 and 96 (see ). Such extended antigen binding paratopes have been observed in but a limited number of antibodies, for example the camel anti-lysozyme VH cAb-Lys3 (Desmyter 1996), and the H3 loop of human antibody b12, which penetrates deeply into the HIV gp120 binding cleft (Sapphire 2001). A comparison of the extended loop lengths of the 12Y-2 region 8 with these antibodies reveals that the 12Y-2 loop region 8 is of greater length and may bind antigen in a similar manner. Thus, it is apparent that structures based on the 12Y-2 loop region 8 with its extended \u03b2-hairpin structure may prove ideal for penetrating buried clefts and cavities in for example enzyme active sites, parasite coat proteins, or viral canyons.","We previously identified two mutations in the 12Y-2 loop region 8 which independently enhanced AMA1 antigen binding affinity 10-fold (Nuttall 2004). Without being limited by theory, it is believed that these mutations (Pro90Leu and Phe100Leu) probably act to increase the flexibility of the \u03b2-hairpin around hinge regions relative to the rest of the framework (see ). For example, the three aromatic residues: Phe29 of CDR1, and Tyr87 and Phe100 of loop region 8 have side chains involved in stabilizing C\u2014H.\u03c0-interactions (d<4.8A, where X is the centre-of-mass of the \u03c0-system (Brandl 2001)). Additional stability comes from hydrogen bond Tyr87 (OH)-Glu103(O\u03b5). Thus, binding of 12Y-2 to the AMA1 target is probably mediated by the rigid \u03b2-hairpin, with increased access to the antigen mediated by flexibility at the bottom of the loop structure. In contrast, the 12Y-1 loop region 8 is unresolved in the crystal structure and is probably highly flexible in solution around similar hinge-like residues. The aromatic loop region 8 residues of 12Y-2 are replaced with Arg87 and Pro98 in 12Y-1, reducing the stability of the loop region, i.e. the Phe29 of loop region 4 is now hydrogen bonded to Glu101 (Glu103 in 12Y-2) (Tyr29(OH)-Glu101(O\u03b5)) leaving the hinges of the loop region 8 unsupported.","We turn now to the impact of the unusual VC\u2032C\u2033D strand topology on antigen recognition. The V\u201cCDR2\u201d loop is non-existent, replaced by a short \u03b2-turn at the bottom of the molecule. This is graphically illustrated in , where the V\u201cCDR2\u201d is aligned with that of a typical human antibody. The \u201cbottom\u201d position of this loop, combined with the low sequence variability, strongly suggests that this region has little impact on the interaction with antigen. However, the loss of the conventional C\u2033 and D strands suggests a possible alternative model for antigen binding, where the extended 12Y-2 loop region 8 combines with the large concave pocket opened in the absence of the conventional CDR2 (). Additional structural variability is also observed in the 12Y-1 and 12Y-2 structures for the C strand loop ranging from residues Lys40 to Glu46, just prior to the \u201cCDR2\u201d (). Comparison of Vs from different shark species shows significant sequence heterogeneity in this region, which most likely reflects an area under less intensive selection pressure than the rest of the molecule, and susceptible to some degree of structural plasticity.","Lack of an extended CDR2 loop also has a significant impact on the interaction between isolated Vs. Both 12Y-1 and 12Y-2 form crystallographic 2-fold symmetry dimers, which form a continuous 8-stranded \u03b2-sheet underneath the loop regions 4 and 8, which correspond to conventional CDR1 and CDR3 loops respectively (see ). Contact areas are highly conserved between the 12Y-1 and 12Y-2 proteins, despite different crystal forms (12Y-1 tetragonal; 12Y-2 orthorhombic). A comparison of the 12Y-2 and 12Y-1 dimeric forms shows that the interaction surface between the 2-fold monomers is not continuous and can be subdivide into three areas: (i) the main-chain \u03b2-sheet interactions between D strands; (ii) the interaction between loop regions 4; and (iii) the interactions between loop regions 8 (see  and Table 4). While the contact between loop regions 8 in 12Y-2 is extensive, the dimeric arrangement is preserved in 12Y-1 crystals notwithstanding the more flexible and significantly distorted loop region 8, indicating that the conformation of loop region 8 is not absolutely required. Thus, the most significant dimer contacts are probably mediated by the loop regions 4 and especially by the D strands, where the main-chain interactions are independent of side-chain variation. With a buried surface area of \u02dc1760 \u212b, the 12Y-2 dimer appears to be a true protein-protein interaction site, as the statistical probability of finding a non-specific interface of such dimensions in a crystal is <1% (Lo Conte 1999). We suggest that this configuration is a general phenomenon for independent IgNAR variable domains (i.e. not tethered to constant domains), as we have also observed such dimeric species in other recombinant Vs (Nuttall 2002).","In heterodimeric immune receptors such as V\/Vantibodies and V\u03b1\/V\u03b2 TCRs, the paired domains interact across a broad hydrophobic interface. This non-solvent exposed region is formed by a conserved patch of residues on the AGFCC\u2032 \u03b2-strands, with additional CDR3 interactions. In contrast, many IgSF-based cell surface receptors are single domains in solution and this face of the \u03b2-sandwich takes on a more charged\/polar character. We have compared this region on the 12Y-2 V, a camel VH, a TCR V, an antibody V, and NCAM and Telokin domains. The hydrophobic region of inter-domain contact is immediately apparent for the TCR and antibody domains, centred around aromatic residues at the centre of the interface. The surface character is altered for VH domains, for example by mutations Leu45Arg and Gly44Glu, to give a more charged character. However, the relatively short evolutionary time since the development of these single domain antibodies in the Camelidae mean that other solutions have also been adopted, for example the illustrated antibody where part of the loop region 8 (analogous to a conventional CDR3 loop) descends to partly cover the former Vinterface, for example residues Asp121 and Tyr120. Although these camelid adaptations can be directly transplanted to murine and human antibody variable domains, the resulting proteins often achieve increased solubility by non-predictable conformational changes (Riechmann 1996). Isolation of soluble human single variable domains can also depend on conformational perturbations, for example the side chain of conserved residue Trp47 flipping into a cavity on the Vinterface (Jespers 2004).","In contrast, for the Vs this face is dominated by the charged and polar residues Tyr37, Glu46, Lys82, Gln84, Arg101, and Lys104. Residues Glu46, Lys82, and Lys104 especially are well conserved across type 2 Vs, and in this instance form a charged pocket with a pattern of hydrogen bonds between side-chains (i.e. Glu46O\u03b51-Lys104 N\u03b6) and to adjacent water molecules (i.e. Glu46O\u03b52-H0-Lys82 N\u03b6). The central Tyr37 is well-conserved as an aromatic species across the immunoglobulin superfamily, and it and residues Gln84 and Arg101 also participate in forming a framework-CDR3 hydrogen bond network (Arg101(NH2)-Gln84(N\u03b62); Tyr87(OH)-Arg101(NH). The combined effect of these residues is to form a conserved charged pocket, which displays a high degree of solvent solubility such that it is ringed by water molecules in the crystal forms. The conservation of the Glu46, Lys82, and Lys104 trio suggests a stable and well-established face. A similar situation is observed in NCAM, where this face is dominated by the charged residues Lys76 and Glu88, and for Telokin, where a charged and polar interface is maintained by a combination of hydrogen bonds.","Modifications to the IgNAR Variable Domain","Analysis of the crystal structures has revealed the potential of Vproteins as, for example, therapeutic, diagnostic and bioarray reagents. For example, Vproteins have potential to act as cleft-binding antibodies in which the \u03b2-hairpin structures are extended to form paratopes capable of penetrating otherwise cryptic antigenic sites. Furthermore, these proteins have a high degree of stability which offers significant advantages in terms of their manipulation and practical application.","Thus, the present invention provides a method of altering a property of an IgNAR variable domain comprising eight N-strand regions, designated A, A\u2032, B, C, D, E, F and G according to , and nine loop regions, designated 1 to 9 according to , said method comprising modifying the IgNAR variable domain within at least one of the \u03b2-strand regions or loop regions.","The IgNAR variable domain is modified such that a property of the IgNAR variable domains is altered.

Solubility may be improved by, for example, either removing disulphide bond-forming cysteines and\/or replacing disulphide bond-forming cysteines from within the solvent exposed loops with amino acids such as alanine or serine.","Modifications to improve solubility may be desirable where the IgNAR variable domains are being designed to function in an intracellular context and\/or their method of production favours expression in a soluble form. It will also be evident to the skilled person that it may be necessary to modify the solubility characteristics of the IgNAR variable domains at the same time or even prior to making other modifications, such as, changing the binding characteristics.","The physicochemical properties, such as stability and solubility, of the IgNAR variable domains may be qualitatively and\/or quantitatively determined using a wide range of methods known in the art. Methods which may find use in the present invention for characterizing the biophysical\/physicochemical properties of the binding moieties include gel electrophoresis, chromatography such as size exclusion chromatography, reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry, ultraviolet absorbance spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, circular dichroism spectroscopy, isothermal titration calorimetry, differential scanning calorimetry, analytical ultra-centrifugation, dynamic light scattering, proteolysis, cross-linking, turbidity measurement, filter retardation assays, immunological assays, fluorescent dye binding assays, protein-staining assays, microscopy, and detection of aggregates via ELISA or other binding assay. Structural analysis employing X-ray crystallographic techniques and NMR spectroscopy may also find use.","Protein stability (e.g. structural integrity) may, for example, be determined by measuring the thermodynamic equilibrium between folded and unfolded states.","In one embodiment, stability and\/or solubility may be measured by determining the amount of soluble protein after some defined period of time. In such an assay, the protein may or may not be exposed to some extreme condition, for example elevated temperature, low pH, or the presence of denaturant. Because unfolded and aggregated protein is not expected to maintain its function, e.g. be capable of binding to a predetermined target molecule, the amount of activity remaining provides a measure of the binding moieties stability and solubility. Thus, one method of assessing solubility and\/or stability is to assay a solution comprising a binding moiety for its ability to bind a target molecule, then expose the solution to elevated temperature for one or more defined periods of time, then assay for antigen binding again.","Alternatively, the modified IgNAR binding domains could be expressed in prokaryotic expression systems and the protein isolated from the cell lysate by a series of biochemical purification steps including differential centrifugation, affinity isolation chromatography using attached tags such as poly histidine, ion-exchange chromatography and gel filtration chromatography. A measure of the improvement in the solubility of the modified polypeptide can be obtained by making a comparison of the amount of soluble protein obtained at the end of the purification procedure to that obtained using the unmodified polypeptide, when starting with a similar amount of expressed unfractionated product. Levels of expression of product in culture can be normalized by a comparison of product band densities after polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of equivalent aliquots of SDS detergent-solubilised cell lysate.","In addition, IgNAR variable domains can be unfolded using chemical denaturant, heat, or pH, and this transition be monitored using methods including, but not limited to, circular dichroism spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, absorbance spectroscopy, NMR spectroscopy, calorimetry, and proteolysis. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the kinetic parameters of the folding and unfolding transitions may also be monitored using these and other techniques.","The solubility of the IgNAR variable domains of the present invention preferably correlates with the production of correctly folded, monomeric polypeptide. The solubility of the modified IgNAR variable domains may therefore also be assessed by HPLC or FPLC. For example, soluble (non-aggregated) domains will give rise to a single peak on a HPLC or FPLC chromatograph, whereas insoluble (aggregated) domains will give rise to a plurality of peaks. Furthermore, the ability to be able to correctly fold and form ordered crystal leads and structures is also often indicative of good solubility.","As an example of an accelerated stability trial, aliquots of the IgNAR variable domain can be stored at different temperatures, such as \u221220\u00b0 C., 4\u00b0 C., 20\u00b0 C. and 37\u00b0 C. and an activity of the IgNAR variable domain assayed at different time intervals. For example, successful maintenance of activity during storage at 37\u00b0 C. for 12 weeks is roughly equivalent to storage stability for 12 months at 4\u00b0 C. The trial can also be conducted to compare the effect of different protecting additives in the storage buffer on the stability of the protein. Such additives can include compounds such as glycerol, sorbitol, non-specific protein such as bovine serum albumin, or other protectants that might be used to increase the shelf life of the protein.","Modifications of Members of the IgSF Based on the IgNAR Variable Domain","The results presented herein also identify structural features in IgNAR variable domains that are important for antigen binding or solubility\/stability of these domains.

Preferably, the modification involves the introduction of polar or charged amino acids in these positions.","In another embodiment, the method involves modifying one or more residues of a TCR V\u03b1 or V\u03b2 domain, wherein the one or more residues is located at the interface between the V\u03b1 and V\u03b2 domains. In a preferred embodiment, the one or more amino acid residue is selected from the group consisting of Ser31, Pro43, Leu89 and Phe106 and combinations thereof. Preferably, the modification involves the introduction of one or more charged amino acids in these positions.","In another embodiment, the method involves modifying one or more residues of an antibody Vor Vdomain, wherein the one or more residues is located at the interface between the Vand Vdomains. In a preferred embodiment, the one or more amino acid residue is equivalent to an amino acid of the TCR V\u03b1 or V\u03b2 domain selected from the group consisting of Ser31, Pro43, Leu89 and Phe106 and combinations thereof. Preferably, the modification involves the introduction of one or more charged amino acids in these positions.","In a preferred embodiment, the modification improves the solubility of the I- or V-set domain.","In a further aspect, the present invention provides a method of modifying an I- or V-set domain, said method comprising introducing a modification into a region of the I- or V-set domain equivalent to loop region 4 and\/or loop region 8 of an IgNAR variable domain as defined by .","In another aspect, the present invention provides a modified V-set domain produced by a method of the present invention.","Multimers","The present invention also provides a binding moiety comprising a multimer comprising:\n\n","The following description is directed to IgNAR domain multimers. It will, however, be apparent to the skilled person that many of the embodiments described with respect to IgNAR domain multimers can equally be applied to I-set and V-set domain multimers. Furthermore, it will be apparent to the skilled person that the various embodiments of the invention described herein in relation to IgNAR variable domains, I-set domains and V-set domains equally apply to IgNAR variable domains, I-set domains and V-set domains, respectively, present in the multimer embodiments of the invention.","Preferably, the multimer comprises two IgNAR variable domains.","In a preferred embodiment, the one or the at least two of the IgNAR domains is\/are variable IgNAR domains(s) comprising eight \u03b2-strand regions, designated A, A\u2032, B, C, D, E, F and G according to , and nine loop regions, designated 1 to 9 according to .","In a preferred embodiment, at least one IgNAR variable domains is modified by substitution, deletion or addition of at least one amino acid within in at least one of the \u03b2-strand or loop regions as described hereinabove.","Where the multimer comprises at least two IgNAR variable domains, the two domains preferably form stable homodimers, preferably at least partially through salt bridges. Thus, a preferred modification is one in which at least one of the IgNAR variable domains has been modified such that the propensity to form a stable homodimer is increased. In a further preferred embodiment, the least one IgNAR variable domain has been modified so as to increase the dissociation constant of the homodimer formed compared to the homodimer formed by the unmodified IgNAR variable domain.","Preferably both IgNAR variable domains have been modified such that the propensity to form a stable homodimer is increased. Preferably, this is achieved by replacing the following residues of one or both of the unmodified monomers (as defined in Table 1) with cysteine residues: residues 57 and\/or 61; residues 51 and either 61 or 62; residues 32 and\/or 33; residue 99; or residue 59.","We have now cloned the full wobbegong shark () IgNAR coding sequence (see ). The coding sequence encodes a single polypeptide chain encompassing one IgNAR I-set domain and 5 C-domains. In the mature IgNAR antibody, these chains form a dimer mediated by half-cystine residues at positions Cys430 and Cys660. The resulting two disulphide bridges are located (1) C-terminal to constant domain 3 and N-terminal to constant domain 4 and (2) C-terminal to constant domain 5.","Thus in a further embodiment, the multimer comprises at least one IgNAR variable domain and at least one IgNAR constant domain. Preferably the constant domain is the C1 constant domain of an IgNAR, i.e. the constant domain closest to the IgNAR variable domain in nature. We have found that connecting an IgNAR variable domain to an IgNAR constant domain has no effect on the level of binding affinity (see Example 16). This means it is possible to add mass to the binding moieties without facilitating multimerisation or loss of binding affinity. Therefore, such multimer constructs have potential as commercial biosensor reagents.","Multimers are one preferred design for therapeutic reagents since they have the potential to provide increased avidity and slower blood clearance rates which may provide favorable pharmacokinetic and biodistribution properties. The IgNAR domains may be connected either through covalent linkage or non-covalent linkage or a combination of linkages, including the use of chemical or genetically-encoded linkers. Linkers used to link protein domains are well-known and well understood in the art, in particular in relation to proteins in the immunoglobulin superfamilies (e.g. Casey J L et al., 2002 Br J. Cancer., 86(9):1401-10; Plutckthun, A., and Pack, P 1997. Immunotechnology, 3, 83-105). Therefore, the skilled person will appreciate that any suitable hinge or means of connection may be used to connect the two at least IgNAR domains. Examples of suitable chemical linkage include linking the two domains using a suitable cross-linker such as dimaleimide. Alternatively, the two domains may be linked by providing cysteine residues at the respective C- and N-terminals and forming a disulphide bond. In addition, they could be linked using single chain GlySer linkers such as GlyGlyGlyGlySer (SEQ ID NO: 114). The domains may also be linked genetically using techniques well-know in the art.","The resulting multimers from any of these linker strategies described may possess the same, or different target specificities thus providing multivalent or multispecific reagents. In a preferred embodiment, two IgNAR variable domains may be joined to form a heterodimer through either covalent linkage or non-covalent linkage or a combination of linkages thereby providing two target binding affinities. If two or more IgNAR variable domains in the multimer have the same target specificity, the multimer will be multivalent and have increased avidity (functional affinity) for binding to two or more target molecules.","In the case of multimers, it will be appreciated by the skilled person that the IgNAR domains must be suitably orientated with respect to each other. The first IgNAR domain should be suitably hinged or connected to the second IgNAR domain. Where the multimer comprises an IgNAR variable domain and an IgNAR constant domain, the domains are preferably orientated with respect to each other as they would be in the respective native protein(s) from which they are derived.","Binding Moieties","With regards to binding moieties of the present invention comprising IgNAR variable domains, such binding moieties comprise an IgNAR variable domain which has been modified such that at least one property of the IgNAR variable domain is altered. It will be understood that such binding moieties do not encompass and do not relate to the full-length, wild-type proteins from which suitable IgNAR variable domains may be derived. Rather, they encompass and relate to portions of IgNARs comprising the variable domain, which have been removed or isolated from their natural environments.","In a preferred embodiment, the IgNAR variable domain of the binding moiety accounts for at least 25%, preferably at least 40%, more preferably at least 50%, yet more preferably at least 70%, even more preferably at least 80%, yet more preferably at least 90% and most preferably at least 95% by weight of the total molecular weight of and\/or number of amino acid residues in the binding moiety. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the binding moiety consists essentially of the CBD.","Preferably, the only binding domains present in the binding moieties of the present invention are the modified IgNAR variable domain, the I-set domain or the V-set domain.","The binding moieties of the invention may be in a substantially isolated form. It will be understood that the protein may be mixed with carriers or diluents which will not interfere with the intended purpose of the protein and still be regarded as substantially isolated. Binding moieties of the invention may also be in a substantially purified form, in which case they will generally comprise the protein in a preparation in which more than 90%, e.g. 95%, 98% or 99% of the protein in the preparation is a binding moiety of the invention.","The binding moieties of the invention may also be linked to other molecules, for example by covalent or non-covalent means. In preferred embodiments, the binding moieties of the invention may be linked (without restriction) to molecules such as enzymes, drugs, lipids, sugars, nucleic acids and viruses.","In one aspect, the present invention provides a binding moiety of the present invention linked to a diagnostic reagent.","In a preferred embodiment of this aspect, the diagnostic reagent is selected from the group consisting of streptavidin, biotin, a radioisotope, dye marker, other imaging reagent and combinations thereof.","In another aspect, the present invention provides a binding moiety of the present invention immobilised on a solid support or coupled to a biosensor surface.","In one embodiment, the binding moiety may contain solvent exposed cysteine residues for the site-specific attachment of other entities.","Binding moieties of the invention can be linked to other molecules, typically by covalent or non-covalent means. For example, binding moieties may be produced as fusion proteins, linked to other polypeptide sequences. Fusion partners can include enzymes, detectable labels and\/or affinity tags for numerous diagnostic applications or to aid in purification. Fusion partners, without restriction, may be GFP (green fluorescent protein), GST (glutathione S-transferase), thioredoxin or hexahistidine. Other fusion partners include targeting sequences that direct binding moieties to particular sub-cellular locations or direct binding moieties to extracellular locations e.g. secretion signals. In a preferred embodiment, binding moieties of the invention do not comprise other regions of the protein from which they are derived i.e. any fusion partners are heterologous to the IgNAR or protein from which I-set or V-set domains are derived. The heterologous sequence may be any sequence which allows the resulting fusion protein to retain the activity of the modified IgNAR variable domain, modified I-set domain or modified V-set domain. The heterologous sequences include for example, immunoglobulin fusions, such as Fc fusions, or fusions to other cellular ligands which may increase stability or aid in purification of the protein.","Diagnostic or therapeutic agents that can be linked to the binding moieties of the invention include pharmacologically active substances such as toxins or prodrugs, immunomodulatory agents, nucleic acids, such as inhibitory nucleic acids or nucleic acids encoding polypeptides, molecules that enhance the in vivo stability or lipophilic behaviour of the binding moieties such as PEG, and detectable labels such as radioactive compounds, dyes, chromophores, fluorophores or other imaging reagents.","Binding moieties may also be immobilised to a solid phase, such as a substantially planar surface (e.g. a chip or a microtitre plate) or beads. Techniques for immobilising polypeptides to a solid phase are known in the art. In addition, where libraries of binding moieties are used (e.g. in screening methods), arrays of binding moieties immobilised to a solid phase can be produced (Lee Y S and Mrksich, M, 2002 Trends Biotechnol. 20(12 Suppl):S14-8. and references contained therein).","In another embodiment of the invention, the binding moieties of the invention function as a protein scaffold with other polypeptide sequences being inserted into solvent-exposed regions of the binding moiety for display on the surface of the scaffold. Such scaffolds may, for example, serve as a convenient means to present peptides in a conformationally constrained manner. The scaffolds may be used to produce IgNAR variable domains, I-set domains or V-set domains with altered binding specificities and also to produce and\/or screen for binding moieties having specificity for any target molecule of interest.","Heterologous polypeptide sequences may be inserted into one or more solvent exposed regions such as, for example, one or more loops of the IgNAR variable domains, I-set domains or V-set domains. The IgNAR variable domain, I-set domain or V-set domain of the binding moiety functions as a protein scaffold for the inserted heterologous sequences, displaying the heterologous sequences on the surface of the binding moiety.","The heterologous sequences may replace all or part of the loop of the IgNAR variable domain, I-set domain or V-set domain into which they are inserted, or may simply form additional sequence. Preferably, a plurality of heterologous sequences are inserted into a plurality of loops.","The heterologous sequences may be derived from solvent exposed regions such as, for example, loops of another IgNAR variable domain, I-set domains or V-set domains. They may also be derived from other molecules or be partially of fully randomised.","Polynucleotides Vectors and Hosts","The present invention provides a polynucleotide encoding a IgNAR variable domain or multimeric reagent according to the present invention.","The present invention also provides a vector comprising a polynucleotide of the present invention.","The present invention further provides a host cell comprising the vector of the invention.","The present invention also provides a method of producing a binding moiety according to the present invention which comprises culturing a host cell of the present invention under conditions enabling expression of the binding moiety and optionally recovering the IgNAR variable domain. In a preferred embodiment of this aspect the IgNAR variable domain or multimeric reagent is unglycosylated.","Polynucleotides of the invention may comprise DNA or RNA. They may be single-stranded or double-stranded. They may also be polynucleotides which include within them synthetic or modified nucleotides. A number of different types of modifications to oligonucleotides are known in the art. These include methylphosphonate and phosphorothioate backbones, addition of acridine or polylysine chains at the 3\u2032 and\/or 5\u2032 ends of the molecule. For the purposes of the present invention, it is to be understood that the polynucleotides described herein may be modified by any method available in the art. Such modifications may be carried out in order to enhance the in vivo activity or life span of polynucleotides of the invention.","Polynucleotides of the invention can be incorporated into a recombinant replicable vector. The vector may be used to replicate the nucleic acid in a compatible host cell.","Preferably, a polynucleotide of the invention in a vector is operably linked to a control sequence that is capable of providing for the expression of the coding sequence by a host cell or using an in vitro transcription\/translation system, i.e. the vector is an expression vector. The term \u201coperably linked\u201d means that the components described are in a relationship permitting them to function in their intended manner. A regulatory sequence \u201coperably linked\u201d to a coding sequence is ligated in such a way that expression of the coding sequence is achieved under condition compatible with the control sequences.","The control sequences may be modified, for example by the addition of further transcriptional regulatory elements to make the level of transcription directed by the control sequences more responsive to transcriptional modulators.","Vectors of the invention may be transformed or transfected into a suitable host cell to provide for expression of a binding moiety according to the invention. This process may comprise culturing a host cell transformed with an expression vector under conditions to provide for expression by the vector of a coding sequence encoding the binding moiety, and optionally recovering the expressed binding moiety.","The vectors may be, for example, plasmid, phagemid or virus vectors provided with an origin of replication, optionally a promoter for the expression of the said polynucleotide and optionally a regulator of the promoter. The vectors may contain one or more selectable marker genes, for example an ampicillin resistance gene in the case of a bacterial plasmid or a neomycin resistance gene for a mammalian vector. Vectors may be used, for example, to transfect or transform a host cell.","Control sequences operably linked to sequences encoding the protein of the invention include promoters\/enhancers and other expression regulation signals. These control sequences may be selected to be compatible with the host cell for which the expression vector is designed to be used in. The term \u201cpromoter\u201d is well-known in the art and encompasses nucleic acid regions ranging in size and complexity from minimal promoters to promoters including upstream elements and enhancers.","The promoter is typically selected from promoters which are functional in prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells. With respect to eukaryotic promoters, they may be promoters that function in a ubiquitous manner or, alternatively, a tissue-specific manner. They may also be promoters that respond to specific stimuli. Viral promoters may also be used, for example the Moloney murine leukaemia virus long terminal repeat (MMLV LTR) promoter, the rous sarcoma virus (RSV) LTR promoter or the human cytomegalovirus (CMV) IE promoter.","It may also be advantageous for the promoters to be inducible so that the levels of expression of the binding moiety can be regulated during the life-time of the cell. Inducible means that the levels of expression obtained using the promoter can be regulated.","In a number of embodiments of the present invention, heterologous sequences are inserted into the various domains (including IgNAR variable domains, I-set domains and V-set domains) of the present invention. Such modifications are generally made by manipulating polynucleotides of the invention encoding the respective domain. This may conveniently be achieved by providing cloning vectors that comprise a sequence encoding a domain which sequence comprises one or more unique insertion sites to allow for easy insertion of nucleotide sequences encoding heterologous sequences into the appropriate region of the domain.","Each \u201cunique\u201d insertion site typically contains a nucleotide sequence that is recognised and cleaved by a type II restriction endonuclease, the nucleotide sequence not being present elsewhere in the cloning vector such that the cloning vector is cleaved by the restriction endonuclease only at the \u201cunique\u201d insertion site. This allows for easy insertion of nucleotide sequences having the appropriate ends by ligation with cut vector using standard techniques well know by persons skilled in the art. Preferably the insertion site is engineered\u2014i.e. where the domain is derived from a naturally occurring sequence, the insertion site does not naturally occur in the natural sequence.","Vectors and polynucleotides of the invention may be introduced into host cells for the purpose of replicating the vectors\/polynucleotides and\/or expressing the binding moiety according to the invention encoded by the polynucleotides. Any suitable host cell may be used, including prokaryotic host cells (such as spp. and ) and eukaryotic host cells. Suitable eukaryotic host cells include insect cells (e.g. using the baculovirus expression system), mammalian cells, fungal (e.g. yeast) cells and plant cells. Preferred mammalian cells are animal cells such as CHO, COS, C 127, 3T3, HeLa, HEK 293, NIH 3T3, BHK and Bowes melanoma (particularly preferred being CHO-K1, COS7, Y1 adrenal and carcinoma cells).","Vectors\/polynucleotides of the invention may introduced into suitable host cells using any of a large number of techniques known in the art such as, for example, transfection (for example calcium phosphate transfection or DEAE-Dextran mediated transfection), transformation and electroporation. Where vectors\/polynucleotides of the invention are to be administered to animals, several techniques are known in the art, for example infection with recombinant viral vectors such as retroviruses, herpes simplex viruses and adenoviruses, direct injection of nucleic acids and biolistic transformation.","Host cells comprising polynucleotides of the invention may be used to express proteins of the invention. Host cells are cultured under suitable conditions which allow for expression of the binding moieties according to the invention. Expression of the binding moieties may be constitutive such that they are continually produced, or inducible, requiring a stimulus to initiate expression. In the case of inducible expression, protein production can be initiated when required by, for example, addition of an inducer substance to the culture medium, for example dexamethasone or IPTG, or inducible expression may achieved through heat-induction, thereby denaturing the repressor and initiating protein synthesis.","Binding moieties according to the invention can be extracted from host cells by a variety of techniques known in the art, including enzymatic, chemical and\/or osmotic lysis and physical disruption.","Cell-free translation systems can also be used to produce the peptides of the invention. Appropriate cloning and expression vectors for use with prokaryotic and eukaryotic hosts are described in Sambrook (1989).","Libraries of Binding Moieties","Binding moieties according to the invention may be provided as libraries comprising a plurality of binding moieties which have different sequences in the IgNAR variable domains, I-set domains or V-set domains. Preferably, the variations reside in one or more loops. These libraries can typically be used in screening methods to identify a binding reagent with an activity of interest, such as affinity for a specific target molecule of interest.","Libraries of binding moieties are conveniently provided as libraries of polynucleotides encoding the binding moieties. The polynucleotides are generally mutagenized or randomised to produce a large number of different sequences which differ at one or more positions within at least one \u03b2 strand or loop region.","Mutations can be introduced using a variety of techniques known in the art, such as site-directed mutagenesis. A number of methods for site-directed mutagenesis are known in the art, from methods employing single-stranded phage such as M13 to PCR-based techniques (see \u201cPCR Protocols: A guide to methods and applications\u201d, M. A. Innis, D. H. Gelfand, J. J. Sninsky, T. J. White (eds.). Academic Press, New York, 1990). Another technique is to use the commercially available \u201cAltered Sites II in vitro Mutagenesis System\u201d (Promega\u2014U.S. Pat. No. 5,955,363). Techniques for site-directed mutagenesis are described above. Pluralities of randomly mutated sequences can be made by introducing mutations into a nucleotide sequence or pool of nucleotide sequences \u2018randomly\u2019 by a variety of techniques in vivo, including; using \u2018mutator strains\u2019, of bacteria such as mutD5 (Low et al., 1996, J Mol Biol 60: 9-68); and using the antibody hypermutation system of B-lymphocytes (Yelamos et al., 1995, Nature 376: 225-9). Random mutations can also be introduced both in vivo and in vitro by chemical mutagens, and ionising or UV irradiation (Friedberg et al., 1995, DNA repair and mutagenesis. SM Press, Washington D.C.), or incorporation of mutagenic base analogues (Zaccolo et al., 1996 J Mol Biol 255: 589-603). \u2018Random\u2019 mutations can also be introduced into genes in vitro during polymerisation for example by using error-prone polymerases (Leung et al., 1989, Technique 1: 11-15).","It is generally preferred to use mutagenesis techniques that vary the sequences present in the loop regions of the IgNAR variable domains, although framework changes (e.g. changes in the \u03b2 stands) may also occur which may or may not be desirable. One method for targeting the loop regions is to provide a plurality of relatively short nucleotide sequences that are partially or fully mutagenized\/randomised and clone these sequences into specific insertion sites in the IgNAR variable domains.","Another approach is to synthesise a plurality of random synthetic oligonucleotides and then insert the oligonucleotides into a sequence encoding the IgNAR variable domain, I-set domain or V-set domain and\/or replace a sequence encoding the IgNAR variable domains, I-set domain or V-set domain with the random synthetic oligonucleotides. A suitable method is described in WO 97\/27213 where degenerate oligonucleotides are produced by adding more than one nucleotide precursor to the reaction at each step. The advantage of this method is that there is complete control over the extent to which each nucleotide position is held constant or randomised. Furthermore, if only C, G or T are allowed at the third base of each codon, the likelihood of producing premature stop codons is significantly reduced since two of the three stop codons have an A at this position (TAA and TGA).","Oligonucleotide synthesis is performed using techniques that are well known in the art (see Eckstein, Oligonucleotides and Analogues: A Practical Approach, IRL Press at Oxford University Press 1991). Libraries can also be specified and purchased commercially. The synthetic process can be performed to allow the generation of all or most possible combinations over the length of the nucleic acid, thus generating a library of randomised nucleic acids. These randomised sequences are synthesised such that they allow in frame expression of the randomised peptide with any fusion partner.","In one embodiment, the library is fully randomised, with no sequence preferences or constants at any position. In another embodiment, the library is biased, i.e. partially randomised in which some positions within the sequence are either held constant, or are selected from a limited number of possible variations. Thus some nucleic acid or amino acid positions are kept constant with a view to maintaining certain structural or chemical characteristics.","The randomised oligonucleotides can then be inserted into a suitable site and\/or replace a suitable sequence encoding a IgNAR variable domains, I-set domain or V-set domain.","Generally the library of sequences will be large enough such that a structurally diverse population of random sequences is presented. This ensures that a large subset of shapes and structures is represented and maximises the probability of a functional interaction.","It is preferred that the library comprises at least 1000 different nucleotide sequences, more preferably at least 10, 10or 10different sequences. Preferably, the library comprises from 10to 10different sequences. Preferably at least 5, 10, 15 or 20 amino acid residues of the peptides encoded by the nucleotide sequences are randomised.","Typically, the inserted peptides encoded by the randomised nucleotide sequences comprise at least 5, 8, 10 or 20 amino acids. Preferably, they also comprise fewer than 50, 30 or 25 amino acids.","In another aspect, the present invention provides a method of selecting a binding moiety of the present invention with an affinity for a target molecule which comprises screening a library of polynucleotides of the present invention for expression of a binding moiety with an affinity for the target molecule.","The libraries of polynucleotides encoding binding moieties can be screened using any suitable technique to identify a binding moiety having an activity of interest. For example, to identify a binding moiety that binds to a target molecule of interest, the library of polynucleotides is incubated under conditions that allow for expression of the binding moiety polypeptides encoded by the polynucleotides and binding of the polypeptides to the target molecule assessed. Binding is typically assessed in vitro or using whole cell assays.","Suitable techniques for screening the library for binding moieties having an activity of interest include phage display and ribosome display as well as the use of viral vectors, such as retroviral vectors and in vivo compartmentalisation screening by protein bioarray.","In a preferred embodiment this method involves displaying the IgNAR variable domain or multimeric reagent of the present invention as gene III protein fusions on the surface of bacteriophage particles.","In another preferred embodiment the method involves displaying the IgNAR variable domain or multimeric reagent of the present invention in a ribosomal display selection system.","The sequence of binding moieties identified in the screen can conveniently be determined using standard DNA sequencing techniques.","Diagnostic\/Therapeutic Uses of Binding Moieties","Binding moieties of the invention, including those identified in the screening methods of the invention, may be used in methods of diagnosis\/therapy by virtue of their specific binding to a target molecule of interest. Such uses will be analogous to the plethora of diagnostic\/therapeutic applications already known in relation to antibodies and fragments thereof. For example, binding moieties of the invention may be used to detect the presence or absence of molecules of interest in a biological sample.","For diagnostic purposes, it may be convenient to immobilise the binding reagent to a solid phase, such as a dipstick, microtitre plate or chip.","As discussed above, binding moieties of the invention when used diagnostically will typically be linked to a diagnostic reagent such as a detectable label to allow easy detection of binding events in vitro or in vivo. Suitable labels include radioisotopes, dye markers or other imaging reagents for in vivo detection and\/or localisation of target molecules.","Binding moieties may also be used therapeutically. For example, binding moieties may be used to target ligands that bind to extracellular receptors.","In addition, binding moieties of the invention may be used, in a similar manner to antibodies, to target pharmacologically active substances to a cell of interest, such as a tumour cell, by virtue of binding to a cell surface molecule present specifically on the tumour cell to which the binding moiety binds specifically.","Administration","In another aspect the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising an IgNAR variable domain or multimeric reagent according to the present invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent.","In another aspect the present invention provides a method of treating a pathological condition in a subject, which method comprises administering to the subject a pharmaceutical composition according to the present invention.","Binding moieties of the invention including binding moieties identified by the screening methods of the invention may preferably be combined with various components to produce compositions of the invention. Preferably the compositions are combined with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, adjuvant or diluent to produce a pharmaceutical composition (which may be for human or animal use). Suitable carriers and diluents include isotonic saline solutions, for example phosphate-buffered saline. The composition of the invention may be administered by direct injection. The composition may be formulated for parenteral, intramuscular, intravenous, subcutaneous, intraocular, oral or transdermal administration. Typically, each protein may be administered at a dose of from 0.01 to 30 mg\/kg body weight, preferably from 0.1 to 10 mg\/kg, more preferably from 0.1 to 1 mg\/kg body weight.","Polynucleotides\/vectors encoding binding moieties may be administered directly as a naked nucleic acid construct. When the polynucleotides\/vectors are administered as a naked nucleic acid, the amount of nucleic acid administered may typically be in the range of from 1 \u03bcg to 10 mg, preferably from 100 \u03bcg to 1 mg.","Uptake of naked nucleic acid constructs by mammalian cells is enhanced by several known transfection techniques for example those including the use of transfection agents. Example of these agents include cationic agents (for example calcium phosphate and DEAE-dextran) and lipofectants (for example Lipofectam\u2122 and Transfectam\u2122). Typically, nucleic acid constructs are mixed with the transfection agent to produce a composition.","Preferably the polynucleotide or vector of the invention is combined with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent to produce a pharmaceutical composition. Suitable carriers and diluents include isotonic saline solutions, for example phosphate-buffered saline. The composition may be formulated for parenteral, intramuscular, intravenous, subcutaneous, oral, intraocular or transdermal administration.","The routes of administration and dosages described are intended only as a guide since a skilled practitioner will be able to determine readily the optimum route of administration and dosage for any particular patient and condition.","The various features and embodiments of the present invention, referred to in individual sections above apply, as appropriate, to other sections, mutatis mutandis.

Cultures were then induced with IPTG (1 mM final), grown for a further 16 hours at 28\u00b0 C. and harvested by centrifugation (Beckman JA-14\/6K\/10 min\/4\u00b0 C.). Periplasmic fractions were isolated by the method of Minsky (Minsky 1994) and recombinant protein purified by affinity chromatography through an anti-FLAG antibody-Sepharose column (10\u00d71 cm).

Band shifts were observed for Lutetium (III) Acetate Hydrate (LAH; Lu(OCH)) and Potassium Hexachloro Rhenium (PHR; KReCl). Isomorphous heavy atom derivatives were obtained by soaking 12Y-1 crystals for \u02dc30 min in 0.8 l of 50 mM of LAH or PHR. Heavy atom sites were identified and refined with the statistical phasing program SHARP (La fortell 1997), and solvent-fattening procedures DM and SOLOMON used to resolve the phase ambiguity. The residual and anomalous difference Fourier maps produced by SHARP were examined in order to locate further heavy atom peaks, which were included in subsequent cycles of phase refinement and calculation using SHARP. Several iterations of this cycle located additional positions and improved phases to 2.82 \u212b. This result was achieved using the phasing power of both Lu and Re.","The model was manually built using XtalView (McRee 1999) into the electron-density map (centroid map) produced by SHARP. The model was then refined against the native 12Y-1 data using CNS (Brunger 1998) and CCP4 (CCP) packages. Difference electron density maps 2m|F|-D|F| and m|F|-|F| were used to improve the model in the XtalView program. During the model building and refinement, 5% of the data was flagged for cross-validation to monitor the progress of refinement.","The electron density map allowed unambiguous tracing of all residues except the CDR3 analogous loop residues (88-98), which disordered. Water molecules were located automatically with the program ARP (Lamzin 1997) for >2\u03c3 peaks in the m|F|-|F| map and retained if they satisfied H-bond criteria and returned 2 m|F|-D|F| density after refinement. Following the convergence in standard refinement, a further improvement of more than 2% in R factors was achieved by refining all protein atoms as one anisotropic domain with the TLS procedure in CCP4 REFMAC5 (Wins 2001). The libration tensor showed significant anisotropy. The final R and Rvalues were 0.166 and 0.254, respectively for a 6-2.82 \u212b range of refined data. The final 12Y-1 model contains 100 amino acids (residues 1-87 and 99-111) and 97 water molecules.

The search model was the 12Y-1 structure (above) without the CDR3 analogous loop. Two 12Y-2 monomers (A and B) were identified in the asymmetric unit of the I222, space group. Iterative model building using XtalView and refinement using REFMAC5 allowed a complete trace of A and B monomers including extended CDR3 analogous loops. The electron density was well defined in the CDR3 analogous loop region. Progress of the refinement was monitored using the Rstatistic based on a set encompassing 5% of the observed diffraction amplitudes. Water molecules were added automatically with the program ARP as described for 12Y-1.

This analysis indicates that modifications to loop region 8 may lead to the generation of novel diagnostic or therapeutic binding moieties. Additionally, modifications to other regions of the Vscaffold, and in particular the 12Y-2 scaffold, may also lead to the generation of novel diagnostic or therapeutic binding moieties. Examples of modifications include:","1. Grafting of Extended CDR3 Loops with Specifically Designed Amino Acid Sequences onto the VScaffold in the Vicinity of Loop Region 8","For example, the sequence RVGPYSWDDSPQDNYYM (SEQ ID NO: 116) may be grafted onto the 12Y-2 scaffold in the vicinity of loop region 8 to form an extended loop corresponding to the anti-HIV antibody b12 (1 HZH) and thereby provide novel binding moiety with an IgNAR scaffold capable of binding HIV gp120. The grafting may involve, for example, replacement of amino acid residues 86 to 103 of 12Y-2 (or a portion of these residues) with RVGPYSWDDSPQDNYYM (SEQ ID NO: 116).","In another example, the sequence CSKPSDSNC (SEQ ID NO: 117), representing a protruding loop of the major surface antigen (HBsAg) from hepatitis B virus (HBV) may be grafted onto the Vscaffold 24G-3 (SEQ ID NO: 101), in place of the CDR3 loop. The resulting IgNAR could then be used to assess the interaction of the HBsAg loop with other HBV proteins.","2. Grafting of CDR1 Loops with Specifically Designed Amino Acid Sequences onto the VScaffold in the Vicinity of Loop Region 4.","For example, the sequence GYRFSNFVI (SEQ ID NO: 118) of the anti-HIV antibody b12 (1 HZH) may be grafted onto the 12Y-2 scaffold in the vicinity of loop region 4 and, when combined with the CDR3 loop graft of the anti-HIV antibody b12 described in (1) above, will enhance the binding affinity to gp120. The grafting may involve, for example, replacement of amino acid residues 28 to 33 of 12Y-2 (or a portion of these residues) with the sequence GYRFSNFVI (SEQ ID NO: 118).","To determine if CDR1 loop grafting would change the affinity and expression qualities of the 12Y-2 V, the N-terminal half of the 14M-15 clone (SEQ ID NOs: 11 & 12) of 12Y-2 was replaced with a library of sequences. This effectively produced a library of CDR1\/N-terminus framework variants combined with a fixed CDR3. 88 CDR1 shuffled Vclones were analysed by ELISA for binding to AMA1 antigen. Nineteen clones had affinity for AM-1, whilst the remaining 69 showed no binding. No clones had detectable affinity for a negative control antigen (bovine serum albumin). This indicates that the CDR1 sequence and conformation is vital to IgNAR binding.  presents the results of ELISA analysis of five clones with high affinity and 5 clones with no detectable affinity. Comparative expression levels are also given.  presents the amino acid sequence alignment of the clones from  (SEQ ID NOs: 11, 15 and 102-111, respectively).","Of the clones with highest affinity, three had similar CDR1 sequences (24A-58, 24A-75, 24A-46) but the remaining two were significantly different (24A-82 and 24A-72). The similar clones shared the common CDR1 sequence \u201cRDTSCAFSSTG\u201d (SEQ ID NO: 119) and had 1-3 residues differing in the framework region near the N-terminus. The sequences for 5 clones with no detectable antigen affinity also had significant variability. Additionally, the amount of IgNAR protein present varied among the clones (only 4 of 88 produced no detectable protein). This indicates that the CDR1 sequence and conformation are also vital to IgNAR expression levels and protein production. Sequence differences map predominantly to the CDR1 loop region, with some contribution from framework residues, and have a marked affect on both affinity and protein expression levels.","3. Mutation or Insertion of Specific Residues in Loop Region 8.","For example, mutating residues Pro90 and\/or Phe100 may enhance the flexibility of loop region 8 thereby resulting in improved antigen binding.","A randomly generated library of 12Y-2 variant containing on average one amino acid change per 100 residues was screened against AMA1 antigen. Two high affinity clones were isolated each separately showing 10-fold enhanced affinity over the wild type 12Y-2. These were designated 14M-15 (Pro90Leu) (SEQ ID NOs: 11 & 12) and 14M-8 (Phe100Leu) (Nuttall et al. 2004).","4. Randomisation of the Entire Loop Region 8, Varying in Length and Amino Acid Composition.","This is in effect the creation of new shark libraries which are described in various Examples below.","5. Randomisation of the Entire Loop Region 8, Varying in Length and Amino Acid Composition Together with Improvement of the Loop Region-Framework Junctions by Incorporation of the Combinations of Paired Junction Residues: Gly84+Glu103, or Gln84+Gly102.","The Vlibrary was expanded by designing new degenerate oligonucleotide primers for CDR3 (loop region 8) with loop lengths of either 12 or 13 residues and framework residue combination of either: Gly84+Glu103, or Gln84+Gly102.

The \u201cbottom\u201d position of this loop, combined with the low sequence variability, strongly suggests that this region has little impact on the interaction with antigen. However, the loss of the conventional C\u2033 and D strands suggests a possible alternative model for antigen binding, where the extended 12Y-2 loop region 8 combines with the large concave pocket opened in the absence of the conventional CDR2. This concave pocket is a potential antigen binding face. The pocket comprises residues loop region 8, loop region 5 and C & D \u03b2-strands.

The Ig-like domains flanking the catalytic domain enable binding of MLCK to myosin. Independent transcription of the C-terminal Ig-like domain of MLCK from an internal promoter gives rise to the production of the mature protein, Telokin. Telokin is an I-set Ig domain and has phosphorylation sites at Ser-12 and Ser-18.

I-set domains such as ICAM-1 have been implicated as receptors for viruses such a rhinovirus. Binding loops on ICAM-1 specific for rhinovirus binding can be grafted to Vframeworks, giving rise to novel binding moieties. This can be further expanded to other viral diagnostics based on I-set domains.","For example, the following modifications may be made to shark NARs:\n\n","VLRs are the variable loop regions of V-set and I-set domains, these being the loop regions which typically extend between \u03b2-strand conformations and which demonstrate natural amino acid variation without compromising the framework structure of the domain. VLRs include those regions typically referred to as CDRs.","CDR2 loops generated by the C\u2032 and C\u2033 strands of the V-set immunoglobulin superfamily proteins are important in antigen binding and maintenance of the solvent solubility of the immunoglobulin. With the shark domain CDR2 loop equivalent in \u201cbottom\u201d position, there is now a solvent-exposed patch of residues at the C-terminus of loop region 4 and in the C and D \u03b2-strands, which in other immunoglobulin domains is shielded by the CDR2 loop. This solvent-exposed face consists mainly of the 12Y-2 residues Lys32, Asp33, Thr34, Gly35, Tyr55, Glu57, Thr58. The charged and polar patch formed by residues Asp33-Thr34-Glu57 appears to be particularly significant.","In one example, these residues may be \u201ctransferred\u201d to I-set variable domains, for example neural cell adhesion molecules (NCAMs), to render these proteins more soluble when expressed in a single domain format.","In another example, these residues may be \u201ctransferred\u201d to V-set domains such as TCRs and antibodies, where the CDR2 loop has been removed to avoid superantigen stimulation.

Comparison of the 12Y-1 and 12Y-2 Vs to the TCR \u03b1 (and \u03b2) domains show a number of aspects where the human TCR could be modified by reference to the shark structure. \u201cSharkisation\u201d gives us the opportunity to separately produce the TCR V\u03b1 or V\u03b2 domain and enhance its solubility by directed mutation.","Table 6 presents a comparison of TCR interfaces with the 12Y-2 and camelid variable domains. This analysis suggests that the following modifications may be made to enhance solubility of TCR domains:\n\n","Attempts in the past to produce single antibody variable domains have encountered solubility and expression problems. Comparison of the 12Y-1 and 12Y-2 Vs to antibody VH and VL domains shows a number of aspects where these individual domains could be modified by reference to the shark structure, to improve solubility and expression levels. For example:\n\n","The 12Y-1 & 12Y-2 dimer forms are a continuous 8-stranded \u03b2-sheet underneath the loop regions (buried surface area at interface \u02dc1760 \u212b). The interactions between the 2-fold monomers involve main-chain \u03b2 sheet interactions between D strands and between loop region 8 as well as side-chain interactions and water mediated contacts. This suggests a significant propensity for dimer interactions with non-standard involvement of loop regions in complex formation.","The dimer form may act as a single binding entity with the loop region 8 residues and framework residues of the dimer available for mutation and library selection. This suggests that the following modifications may be made to generate binding moieties with potential diagnostic or therapeutic applications:\n\n","If the crystallographic dimer is a natural form, and the continuous 8-stranded \u03b2-sheet is formed under physiological conditions, then various residues are paired across the dimer interface. Thus, in the crystallographic structure the side chains of Leu99 residue are adjacent, in the correct orientation, and of appropriate distance (\u02dc3A) to from a disulphide bridge.","To test this hypothesis, the double 12Y-2 mutant Pro90Leu and Leu99Cys was created. These mutations enhance the natural affinity for the target antigen (Pro90Leu), making binding easier to detect, and are in the correct position to moderate dimerisation (Leu99Cys).","Overlap PCR using oligonucleotide primers was used to construct DNA clone 21B-5 (SEQ ID NO: 13 & 14). This was confirmed as correct by DNA sequencing.","The resultant clone 21B-5 was clearly visible as a dimer form by FPLC and by SDS-PAGE in the absence of reducing agent (see ) & (e)), compared to the wild type (14M-15, Pro90Leu only). Purified monomer bound immobilised AMA1 by ELISA and by biosensor (See ) & (d)). The purified disulphide-linked dimer did not bind the target antigen, demonstrating both the importance of the CDR3 and that the novel dimer form appears to present a different interface to antigen than the monomeric protein. The dimer species could be crystallised, is stable, and may form the basis of a binding interface different from that of monomeric IgNAR forms.","Shark IgNAR antibodies are structurally close to I-set domain immunoglobulins such as Telokin and domain 1 of NCAM. Specifically, what would otherwise be a CDR2 loop is at the \u201cbottom\u201d of the molecule. The foregoing structural, protein engineering, and library selection experiments suggest that the principles learnt from shark IgNAR antibody structures can be successfully applied to the generation of binding repertoires of human I-set immunoglobulins. Such libraries are anticipated to primarily contain variability in the CDR1 and CDR3 analogous regions. The foregoing experiments also indicated that downstream affinity maturation strategies targeting framework regions (as well as the loop regions) of the NCAM and Telokin domains may result in altered and enhanced binding affinities and specificities.","Shark IgNAR antibodies and NCAM domain 1 and Telokin were modelled to determine the best CDR-framework junction residues for mutation and incorporation of library randomisation. This allowed incorporation of randomised \u201cCDR\u201d loops which varied in both length and sequence. Additionally, in at least one variant for each of NCAM and Telokin, the human CDR3 framework was extended by analogy with the successful human\/shark model 5 loop grafts, to provide a CDR3 loop extending several residues above the NCAM or Telokin scaffold (NCAM\/A0988 library; Telokin\/A1017 library).","Following identification of framework junctions, oligonucleotide primers were designed to build human-scaffold-based libraries, based on both NCAM domain 1 and Telokin domain.","NCAM library oligonucleotide primers: A0980 NCAM CDR1 randomisation 6-loop (SEQ ID NO: 82); A0981 NCAM CDR1 randomisation 7-loop (SEQ ID NO: 83); A0982 NCAM CDR3 randomisation: rev compl; 8 loop (SEQ ID NO: 84); A0987 NCAM CDR3 randomisation: rev compl; 11 loop (SEQ ID NO: 85); A1018 NCAM CDR3 randomisation: rev compl; 14 loop (SEQ ID NO: 86); A0988 NCAM CDR3 randomisation: rev compl; 8 loop based on Model 5 (SEQ ID NO: 87).\n\nTelokin library oligonucleotide primers: A1001 Telokin CDR1 randomisation; 7 loop (SEQ ID NO: 94); A1002 Telokin CDR1 randomisation; 9 loop (SEQ ID NO: 95); A1000 Telokin CDR3 randomisation: rev compl; 6 loop (SEQ ID NO: 97); A1003 Telokin CDR3 randomisation: rev compl; 9 loop (SEQ ID NO: 98); A1004 Telokin CDR3 randomisation: rev compl; 12 loop (SEQ ID NO: 99); A1017 Telokin CDR3 randomisation: rev compl; 9 loop based on Model 5 (SEQ ID NO: 100).\n","Three molecular libraries were constructed as follows:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0398","num":"0434"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00005","num":"00005"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"63pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["No","Library","CDR coverage","Final Size"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["1","NCAM 1 + 3","CDR1, CDR3","6 \u00d7 10"]},{"entry":["2","NCAM 3","CDR3","7 \u00d7 10"]},{"entry":["3","Telokin 1","CDR1","5. \u00d7 10\u2009"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"Library numbers 1 and 2 from the above table were pooled and immunopanned by bacteriophage display against amyloid a\u03b2 (1-42) peptide and the Carcino Embryonic Antigen (CEA).  shows the results of the panning against amyloid a\u03b2 (1-42) peptide (panels and A and B) and CEA (panels and C and D).

For example, addition of the 12Y-2 variable domain to varying numbers of constant domains produces a set of molecules with identical affinities for the target antigen AMA1, but with varying molecular weights.
