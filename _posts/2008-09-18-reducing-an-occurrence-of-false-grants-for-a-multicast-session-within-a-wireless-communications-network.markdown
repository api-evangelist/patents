title: Reducing an occurrence of false grants for a multicast session within a wireless communications network
abstract: Aspects of reducing an occurrence of false grants for a multicast session within a wireless communications network are disclosed. For example, an access network receives an announce message to be transmitted to a plurality of access terminals, the received announce message configured to announce a given multicast session. The access network determines whether sufficient resources are available to support the given multicast session, The access network configures the received announce message to convey whether sufficient resources are available to support the given multicast session based on the determining step, and transmits the configured announce message to the plurality of access terminals. A given access terminal receives the announce message, and determines whether the received announce message indicates whether sufficient resources are available to support the given multicast session. The given access terminal sends an announce acknowledgment (ACK) message that indicates an acceptance or rejection of the given multicast session.

Field of the Invention","The invention relates to communications in a wireless telecommunication system and, more particularly to methods of reducing an occurrence of false grants for a multicast session within a wireless communications network.","2. Description of the Related Art","Wireless communication systems have developed through various generations, including a first-generation analog wireless phone service (1G), a second-generation (2G) digital wireless phone service (including interim 2.5G and 2.75G networks) and a third-generation (3G) high speed data\/Internet-capable wireless service. There are presently many different types of wireless communication systems in use, including Cellular and Personal Communications Service (PCS) systems. Examples of known cellular systems include the cellular Analog Advanced Mobile Phone System (AMPS), and digital cellular systems based on Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA), Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA), the Global System for Mobile access (GSM) variation of TDMA, and newer hybrid digital communication systems using both TDMA and CDMA technologies.","The method for providing CDMA mobile communications was standardized in the United States by the Telecommunications Industry Association\/Electronic Industries Association in TIA\/EIA\/IS-95-A entitled \u201cMobile Station-Base Station Compatibility Standard for Dual-Mode Wideband Spread Spectrum Cellular System,\u201d referred to herein as IS-95. Combined AMPS & CDMA systems are described in TIA\/EIA Standard IS-98. Other communications systems are described in the IMT-2000\/UM, or International Mobile Telecommunications System 2000\/Universal Mobile Telecommunications System, standards covering what are referred to as wideband CDMA (WCDMA), CDMA2000 (such as CDMA2000 1xEV-DO standards, for example) or TD-SCDMA.","In wireless communication systems, mobile stations, handsets, or access terminals (AT) receive signals from fixed position base stations (also referred to as cell sites or cells) that support communication links or service within particular geographic regions adjacent to or surrounding the base stations. Base stations provide entry points to an access network (AN)\/radio access network (RAN), which is generally a packet data network using standard Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) based protocols that support methods for differentiating traffic based on Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. Therefore, the base stations generally interact with ATs through an over the air interface and with the AN through Internet Protocol (IP) network data packets.","In wireless telecommunication systems, Push-to-talk (PTT) capabilities are becoming popular with service sectors and consumers. PTT can support a \u201cdispatch\u201d voice service that operates over standard commercial wireless infrastructures, such as CDMA, FDMA, TDMA, GSM, etc. In a dispatch model, communication between endpoints (ATs) occurs within virtual groups, wherein the voice of one \u201ctalker\u201d is transmitted to one or more \u201clisteners.\u201d A single instance of this type of communication is commonly referred to as a dispatch call, or simply a PTT call. A PTT call is an instantiation of a group, which defines the characteristics of a call. A group in essence is defined by a member list and associated information, such as group name or group identification.","Conventionally, data packets within a wireless communication network have been configured to be sent to a single destination or access terminal. A transmission of data to a single destination is referred to as \u201cunicast\u201d. As mobile communications have increased, the ability to transmit given data concurrently to multiple access terminals has become more important. Accordingly, protocols have been adopted to support concurrent data transmissions of the same packet or message to multiple destinations or target access terminals. A \u201cbroadcast\u201d refers to a transmission of data packets to all destinations or access terminals (e.g., within a given cell, served by a given service provider, etc.), while a \u201cmulticast\u201d refers to a transmission of data packets to a given group of destinations or access terminals. In an example, the given group of destinations or \u201cmulticast group\u201d may include more than one and less than all of possible destinations or access terminals (e.g., within a given group, served by a given service provider, etc.). However, it is at least possible in certain situations that the multicast group comprises only one access terminal, similar to a unicast, or alternatively that the multicast group comprises all access terminals (e.g., within a cell or sector), similar to a broadcast.","Broadcasts and\/or multicasts may be performed within wireless communication systems in a number of ways, such as performing a plurality of sequential unicast operations to accommodate the multicast group, allocating a unique broadcast\/multicast channel (BCH) for handling multiple data transmissions at the same time and the like. A conventional system using a broadcast channel for push-to-talk communications is described in United States Patent Application Publication No. 2007\/0049314 dated Mar. 1, 2007 and entitled \u201cPush-To-Talk Group Call System Using CDMA 1x-EVDO Cellular Network\u201d, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. As described in Publication No. 2007\/0049314, a broadcast channel can be used for push-to-talk calls using conventional signaling techniques. Although the use of a broadcast channel may improve bandwidth requirements over conventional unicast techniques, the conventional signaling of the broadcast channel can still result in additional overhead and\/or delay and may degrade system performance.","The 3Generation Partnership Project 2 (\u201c3GPP2\u201d) defines a broadcast-multicast service (BCMCS) specification for supporting multicast communications in CDMA2000 networks. Accordingly, a version of 3GPP2's BCMCS specification, entitled \u201cCDMA2000 High Rate Broadcast-Multicast Packet Data Air Interface Specification\u201d, dated Feb. 14, 2006, Version 1.0 C.S0054-A, is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.","Embodiments of the invention are directed to systems and methods of reducing an occurrence of false grants for a multicast session within a wireless communications network. For example, an access network receives an announce message to be transmitted to a plurality of access terminals, the received announce message configured to announce a given multicast session. The access network determines whether sufficient resources are available to support the given multicast session. The access network configures the received announce message to convey whether sufficient resources are available to support the given multicast session based on the determining step, and transmits the configured announce message to the plurality of access terminals. A given access terminal receives the announce message, and determines whether the received announce message indicates whether sufficient resources are available to support the given multicast session. The given access terminal sends an announce acknowledgment (ACK) message that indicates an acceptance or rejection of the given multicast session, in response to the received announce message, based on the determining step.","Aspects of the invention are disclosed in the following description and related drawings directed to specific embodiments of the invention. Alternate embodiments may be devised without departing from the scope of the invention. Additionally, well-known elements of the invention will not be described in detail or will be omitted so as not to obscure the relevant details of the invention.","The words \u201cexemplary\u201d and\/or \u201cexample\u201d are used herein to mean \u201cserving as an example, instance, or illustration.\u201d Any embodiment described herein as \u201cexemplary\u201d and\/or \u201cexample\u201d is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other embodiments. Likewise, the term \u201cembodiments of the invention\u201d does not require that all embodiments of the invention include the discussed feature, advantage or mode of operation.","Further, many embodiments are described in terms of sequences of actions to be performed by, for example, elements of a computing device. It will be recognized that various actions described herein can be performed by specific circuits (e.g., application specific integrated circuits (ASICs)), by program instructions being executed by one or more processors, or by a combination of both. Additionally, these sequence of actions described herein can be considered to be embodied entirely within any form of computer readable storage medium having stored therein a corresponding set of computer instructions that upon execution would cause an associated processor to perform the functionality described herein. Thus, the various aspects of the invention may be embodied in a number of different forms, all of which have been contemplated to be within the scope of the claimed subject matter. In addition, for each of the embodiments described herein, the corresponding form of any such embodiments may be described herein as, for example, \u201clogic configured to\u201d perform the described action.","A High Data Rate (HDR) subscriber station, referred to herein as an access terminal (AT), may be mobile or stationary, and may communicate with one or more HDR base stations, referred to herein as modem pool transceivers (MPTs) or base stations (BS). An access terminal transmits and receives data packets through one or more modem pool transceivers to an HDR base station controller, referred to as a modem pool controller (MPC), base station controller (BSC) and\/or packet control function (PCF). Modem pool transceivers and modem pool controllers are parts of a network called an access network. An access network transports data packets between multiple access terminals.","The access network may be further connected to additional networks outside the access network, such as a corporate intranet or the Internet, and may transport data packets between each access terminal and such outside networks. An access terminal that has established an active traffic channel connection with one or more modem pool transceivers is called an active access terminal, and is said to be in a traffic state. An access terminal that is in the process of establishing an active traffic channel connection with one or more modem pool transceivers is said to be in a connection setup state. An access terminal may be any data device that communicates through a wireless channel or through a wired channel, for example using fiber optic or coaxial cables. An access terminal may further be any of a number of types of devices including but not limited to PC card, compact flash, external or internal modem, or wireless or wireline phone. The communication link through which the access terminal sends signals to the modem pool transceiver is called a reverse link or traffic channel. The communication link through which a modem pool transceiver sends signals to an access terminal is called a forward link or traffic channel. As used herein the term traffic channel can refer to either a forward or reverse traffic channel.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","104","120","102","126","102","108","110","112","102","108","110","112"]},"Referring back to , the components of the wireless network  and interrelation of the elements of the exemplary embodiments of the invention are not limited to the configuration illustrated. System  is merely exemplary and can include any system that allows remote access terminals, such as wireless client computing devices ,,,  to communicate over-the-air between and among each other and\/or between and among components connected via the air interface  and RAN , including, without limitation, carrier network , the Internet, and\/or other remote servers.","The RAN  controls messages (typically sent as data packets) sent to a base station controller\/packet control function (BSC\/PCF) . The BSC\/PCF  is responsible for signaling, establishing, and tearing down bearer channels (i.e., data channels) between a packet data service node  (\u201cPDSN\u201d) and the access terminals \/\/\/. If link layer encryption is enabled, the BSC\/PCF  also encrypts the content before forwarding it over the air interface . The function of the BSC\/PCF  is well-known in the art and will not be discussed further for the sake of brevity. The carrier network  may communicate with the BSC\/PCF  by a network, the Internet and\/or a public switched telephone network (PSTN). Alternatively, the BSC\/PCF  may connect directly to the Internet or external network. Typically, the network or Internet connection between the carrier network  and the BSC\/PCF  transfers data, and the PSTN transfers voice information. The BSC\/PCF  can be connected to multiple base stations (BS) or modem pool transceivers (MPT) . In a similar manner to the carrier network, the BSC\/PCF  is typically connected to the MPT\/BS  by a network, the Internet and\/or PSTN for data transfer and\/or voice information. The MPT\/BS  can broadcast data messages wirelessly to the access terminals, such as cellular telephone . The MPT\/BS , BSC\/PCF  and other components may form the RAN , as is known in the art. However, alternate configurations may also be used and the invention is not limited to the configuration illustrated. For example, in another embodiment the functionality of the BSC\/PCF  and one or more of the MPT\/BS  may be collapsed into a single \u201chybrid\u201d module having the functionality of both the BSC\/PCF  and the MPT\/BS .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 2"],"b":["126","126","160","165","170","175","170","160","175","170","102","108","110","112","120","160","160","160","120","122"]},"Referring to , the broadcast serving node (BSN)  may be configured to support multicast and broadcast services. The BSN  will be described in greater detail below. The BSN  communicates with the RAN  (e.g., the BSC\/PCF ) via a broadcast (BC) A10 connection, and with the application server  via the Internet . The BCA10 connection is used to transfer multicast and\/or broadcast messaging. Accordingly, the application server  sends unicast messaging to the PDSN  via the Internet , and sends multicast messaging to the BSN  via the Internet .","Generally, as will be described in greater detail below, the RAN  transmits multicast messages, received from the BSN  via the BCA10 connection, over a broadcast channel (BCH) of the air interface  to one or more access terminals .","Referring to , an access terminal , (here a wireless device), such as a cellular telephone, has a platform  that can receive and execute software applications, data and\/or commands transmitted from the RAN  that may ultimately come from the carrier network , the Internet and\/or other remote servers and networks. The platform  can include a transceiver  operably coupled to an application specific integrated circuit (\u201cASIC\u201d ), or other processor, microprocessor, logic circuit, or other data processing device. The ASIC  or other processor executes the application programming interface (\u201cAPI\u201d)  layer that interfaces with any resident programs in the memory  of the wireless device. The memory  can be comprised of read-only or random-access memory (RAM and ROM), EEPROM, flash cards, or any memory common to computer platforms. The platform  also can include a local database  that can hold applications not actively used in memory . The local database  is typically a flash memory cell, but can be any secondary storage device as known in the art, such as magnetic media, EEPROM, optical media, tape, soft or hard disk, or the like. The internal platform  components can also be operably coupled to external devices such as antenna , display , push-to-talk button  and keypad  among other components, as is known in the art.","Accordingly, an embodiment of the invention can include an access terminal including the ability to perform the functions described herein. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the various logic elements can be embodied in discrete elements, software modules executed on a processor or any combination of software and hardware to achieve the functionality disclosed herein. For example, ASIC , memory , API  and local database  may all be used cooperatively to load, store and execute the various functions disclosed herein and thus the logic to perform these functions may be distributed over various elements. Alternatively, the functionality could be incorporated into one discrete component. Therefore, the features of the access terminal in  are to be considered merely illustrative and the invention is not limited to the illustrated features or arrangement.","The wireless communication between the access terminal  and the RAN  can be based on different technologies, such as code division multiple access (CDMA), WCDMA, time division multiple access (TDMA), frequency division multiple access (FDMA), Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM), the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM), or other protocols that may be used in a wireless communications network or a data communications network. The data communication is typically between the client device , MPT\/BS , and BSC\/PCF . The BSC\/PCF  can be connected to multiple data networks such as the carrier network , PSTN, the Internet, a virtual private network, and the like, thus allowing the access terminal  access to a broader communication network. As discussed in the foregoing and known in the art, voice transmission and\/or data can be transmitted to the access terminals from the RAN using a variety of networks and configurations. Accordingly, the illustrations provided herein are not intended to limit the embodiments of the invention and are merely to aid in the description of aspects of embodiments of the invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"]},"In , one of a plurality of access terminals (\u201cAT 1\u201d) in communication with the RAN  (\u201cPTT initiator\u201d) requests to initiate a PTT session, or multicast session. Accordingly, the PTT initiator sends a PTT call request to the application server  (e.g., a PTT server). Next, in , the application server  forwards an announce message to the RAN , and the RAN  transmits the announce message, , announcing the PTT session to each multicast group member for the PTT session. For example, the application server  forwards the announce message to the RAN  via the PDSN  and\/or BSN , , and the RAN  transmits the announce message over the air interface  to a plurality of ATs 1 . . . N, . The announce message is transmitted in multiple sectors within the wireless communication system . ATs 1 . . . N may each be present within the same sector, or alternatively may be present within different sectors of the wireless communications system . Furthermore, the RAN  communicating with AT 1 and the RAN  communicating with ATs 2 . . . N may be different.","In , a given AT (\u201cAT 2\u201d) among ATs 2 . . . N responds to the announce message by sending an announce acknowledgment (ACK) message on a reverse link access channel to the RAN . The announce ACK message may indicate either of an acceptance (i.e., indicating AT 2 is interested in the announced PTT session) or a rejection (i.e., indicating AT 2 is not interested in the announced PTT session) of the announced PTT session. For convenience of description, assume that the first responder AT 2 is interested in the announced PTT session and sends an announce ACK message indicating an acceptance to the RAN  in .","In , the RAN  forwards the announce ACK message to the application or PTT server . While not shown explicitly within , the announce ACK message is sent along with a BCMCSFlowRegistration message to register for the BCMCS flow associated with the announce message. The RAN  receives the BCMCSFlowRegistration message and adds AT A to a multicast group for the announced PTT session (not shown).","In , once the application server  receives a first announce ACK message indicating an acceptance of the announced PTT session (i.e., the announce ACK message sent in ), the application server  sends the PTT initiator AT 1 a message granting AT 1 the floor. After AT 1 is granted the floor, the user of AT 1 can begin sending data (e.g., speaking, video streaming, text messaging, etc.) to one or more multicast group members that have registered for or are otherwise monitoring the announced PTT session. The multicast data (i.e., the spoken words or other audio\/video, from ) are received at the application server , and are forwarded to the RAN  for transmission on a downlink broadcast channel (BCH) within sectors containing or in proximity to sectors known\/expected to contain one or more interested multicast group members.","In , before allocating resources on the downlink BCH for multicast message transmission associated with the announced PTT session, the RAN  determines, whether sufficient resources are actually available for allocation. In an example, this determination may be performed on a sector-by-sector basis.","In an example, assume that AT 2 is present within sector X, and sector X (e.g., and its adjacent sectors) do not have sufficient downlink BCH resources to handle the announced PTT session. Accordingly, the RAN determines, , that sufficient BCH resources are not available, and drops the forwarded multicast messages, .","As will be appreciated from the above description of the process of , the granting of the floor to the PTT initiator AT 1 when the PTT session cannot actually be handled by the RAN , referred to as a \u201cfalse grant\u201d, wastes system resources, and can also cause frustrate the user of AT 1 because the user begins sending data (e.g., speaking) subsequent to being granted the floor only to later be informed that no one was actually \u201clistening\u201d.","As discussed above, \u201cfalsely\u201d granting a PTT initiator the floor when the RAN  cannot support the PTT session can waste system resources and cause an unsatisfactory user experience. Accordingly, embodiments of the present invention are directed to reducing the occurrence of false grants.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","120","170","505","170","120"]},"In , the RAN  determines whether sufficient BCH resources are available to support the PTT session within each sector of the wireless communication system . As will be appreciated, the level of load on the downlink BCH can vary from sector to sector because each sector can be carrying different multicast sessions at different times (e.g., based on where interested multicast group members are located). For example, the RAN  may compare the current load on the downlink BCH, within each sector, with a threshold load value. If the current load is greater than the threshold load value, the RAN  determines sufficient BCH resources to be unavailable for that sector. Otherwise, if the current load is not greater than the threshold load value, the RAN  determines sufficient BCH resources to be available for that sector.","While not shown explicitly within , implicit within the determining of step  is a recognition, at the RAN , that the announce message forwarded in  is associated with the downlink BCH. Conventionally, this association is not known at the RAN , which simply acts as a conduit for transmission of the announce message from the application server  to the ATs 1 . . . N. In other words, the announce message is an application-layer message, and the RAN  conventionally does not analyze the content of messaging transferred via the RAN  at the application level. However, in the process of , the RAN  is configured to perform the determining of  responsive to announce messages for PTT or multicast sessions, and as such includes functionality to recognize announce messages.","For convenience of description, assume that the RAN  determines, at , that sufficient BCH resources are unavailable for at least one sector. In , the RAN  configures the announce message to include an indication, for target ATs within the at least one sector, that sufficient BCH resources are not available to support the PTT session in that sector(s). It will be appreciated that the announce message is not simply dropped after the RAN  determines the PTT session cannot be supported in one or more sectors because the application server  would interpret the drop as unintentional (i.e., the application server  would have no way of knowing that the RAN  determined to drop the announce message), and may resend the announce message again and again until one or more announce ACKs are received at the application server .","The configuring of  may be performed in a number of ways, which will now be described in greater detail with respect to a number of illustrative examples.","In a first example, the RAN  can transmit the announce message including and\/or along with an access control message (ACM). As used herein, if an announce message is sent along with an ACM, the combination of the announce message and ACM may collectively be referred to as the announce message, in an example. The ACM controls how ATs receiving the announce message and interested in registering for the announced PTT session can access the reverse link channel in order to respond\/register for the announced PTT session.

It will be appreciated that using the RA field of the ACM to indicate the BCH resource status need not be used in conjunction with a multicast DOS message embodiment, but rather can be appended or included along with any announce message format.","In a second example, assume the RAN  packages the announce message received from the application server  into a data over signaling (DOS) message upon receiving the announce message in . DOS messages are well-known in the art within EV-DO protocols. DOS messages are defined by EV-DO standards as a unicast message addressed to a unicast access terminal identifier (UATI) that identifies a single intended access terminal recipient, and are not associated with multicast messaging in the EV-DO standard. However, the announce message can be addressed to the multicast access terminal identifier (MATI) and can be transmitted on a downlink control channel to ATs 1 . . . N, with ATs 1 . . . N each being configured to recognize that a DOS message addressed to the MATI, or a \u201cmulticast DOS message\u201d, is intended to be interpreted as a multicast message (i.e., an announce message). The conversion of an announce message into a multicast DOS message is discussed in greater detail in U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60\/974,833, entitled \u201cMULTICAST MESSAGING WITHIN A WIRELESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM\u201d, filed on Sep. 24, 2007, assigned to the assignee hereof, and expressly incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.","Conventional unicast DOS messages, or DOS messages addressed to the UATI with a singled intended AT recipient, include a 1-bit Acknowledgment Required (\u201cACK_REQ\u201d) field. Thus, if the ACK_REQ field is set to a first logic level (e.g., a higher logic level or logic \u201c1\u201d), a given AT is prompted to transmit an acknowledgment to the unicast DOS message, and if the ACK_REQ field is set to a second logic level (e.g., a lower logic level or logic \u201c0\u201d), the given AT is not prompted to transmit the acknowledgment. Within the context of multicast DOS messages, acknowledgment messages are not logical in the sense that the number of AT recipients of the multicast DOS message can be relatively high, and acknowledgments sent by ATs in response to a multicast DOS message would interfere with each other and clog the reverse link channel.","Accordingly, because an ACK_REQ=1 condition is not likely to actually be used to trigger acknowledgments responsive to multicast DOS messages, a system designer can configure each of ATs 1 . . . N to interpret a multicast DOS message having an ACK_REQ field set to the first logic level (i.e., ACK_REQ=1) as an indicator that BCH resources for the PTT session announced by the multicast DOS message are unavailable. Thus, in this example, if the RAN  determines that sufficient BCH resources are not available to support the PTT session in , the configuring of  may set the ACK_REQ field to the first logic level so as to indicate the BCH resource status to ATs 1 . . . N.","In a third example, the RAN  can transmit the announce message including and\/or along with a BRM if the BCH resources are not available. In this example, if the announce message is not sent included within and\/or along with a BRM, ATs interpret the announce message as indicating that sufficient BCH resources are available to handle the announced PTT session. As used herein, if an announce message is sent along with an BRM, the combination of the announce message and BRM may collectively be referred to as the announce message, in an example.","Returning to , after configuring the announce message in , the RAN  transmits the configured announce message (e.g., including an ACM having an RA field set to a given logic level, packaged as a multicast DOS message, etc.) in , within sectors that have been determined not to have sufficient BCH resources, , to announce the PTT session to each of ATs 1 . . . N. While not illustrated in , a conventional announce message, or an announce message not configured to indicate BCH resource unavailability, can be transmitted in sectors that have sufficient BCH resources to support the PTT session as determined in .","Each of ATs 1 . . . N receive the configured announce message and determine whether the configured announce message indicates that sufficient BCH resources are not available in . For example, in , each of ATs 1 . . . N check the status or logic level of the RA field included in the ACM that is appended to the announce message to determine whether the configured announce message indicates that sufficient BCH resources are not available. In another example, in , each of ATs 1 . . . N check the status or logic level of the ACK_REQ field of the multicast DOS message to determine whether the configured announce message indicates that sufficient BCH resources are not available. In yet another example, in , each of ATs 1 . . . N may check the status or logic levels of both the RA field of the ACM and the ACK_REQ field of the multicast DOS message to determine whether the configured announce message indicates that sufficient BCH resources are not available. Thus, the logic level of a field (e.g., the RA field of the ACM, the ACK_REQ field of the multicast DOS message, etc.) set at the RAN  can be used to signal or convey a BCH resource status to ATs receiving the announce message. Accordingly, it will be appreciated that embodiments of the present invention need not be limited to conveying the BCH resource status information with ACMs and\/or multicast DOS messages, but rather any type of message format or field may be used to convey this information.","For convenience of explanation, assume that a given AT (\u201cAT 2\u201d) determines, in , that sufficient BCH resources are not available to support the announced PTT session in AT 2's current sector. In , AT 2 sends an announce ACK to the RAN  to indicate a rejection of the announced PTT session. Conventionally, the announce ACK \u201creject\u201d message is sent by ATs that are not interested in joining or participating in an announced PTT session. However, because AT 2 determines that insufficient BCH resources are available to support the announced PTT session, , AT 2 sends the announce ACK rejection irrespective of whether AT 2 is interested in the announced PTT session, . It will be appreciated that steps  and  of  can concurrently be performed at any number of ATs among ATs 2 . . . N.","In , the RAN  receives the announce ACK reject message from AT 2 and forwards the announce ACK reject message to the application server . Thus, the application server  does not grant the floor to AT 1 because the received announce ACK message is rejecting, and not accepting, the announced PTT session. Accordingly, the condition of \u201cfalsely\u201d granting AT 1 the floor is avoided.","In , the RAN  transmits a broadcast reject message (BRM) in each sector that is determined, in , to lack sufficient BCH resources to support the announced PTT session. The BRM instructs ATs to ignore the announced PTT session such that no announce ACK message (e.g., neither an announce ACK \u201caccept\u201d message nor an announce ACK \u201creject\u201d message) need be sent. For a further discussion of announce ACK message suppression methodologies, see U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60\/974,831, entitled \u201cMETHODS OF MANAGING ACKNOWLEDGMENT TRANSMISSIONS FROM MULTICAST GROUP MEMBERS OF A MULTICAST GROUP WITHIN A WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS NETWORK\u201d, filed on Sep. 24, 2007, assigned to the assignee hereof, and expressly incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.","As will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art, by determining, at the RAN , whether sufficient BCH resources are available to support an announced PTT session and indicating, to ATs, the BCH resource status information along with the announce message, the number of false grants can be reduced. The BCH resource status can be conveyed from the RAN  to one or more ATs in any number of ways, including but not limited to an RA field within an ACM included along with the announce message, an ACK_REQ field of the announce message if the announce message is converted into a multicast DOS message and transmitted on the downlink control channel, a BRM sent along with the announce message, and\/or any combination thereof.","Those of skill in the art will appreciate that information and signals may be represented using any of a variety of different technologies and techniques.
