title: Wagering game with hot pick bonus
abstract: Disclosed are games, gaming machines, gaming systems and methods including a hot pick bonus. A player selects one of a number of indicia/symbols and initiates a primary slot machine game spin. If a predetermined number of the selected symbols appear as the result of the spin, a bonus feature is initiated. Because the symbols selectable by the player occur with different frequency on the reels, the symbol chosen by the player affects the likelihood of triggering a bonus game. In general, the amount won in a bonus game is correlated to the frequency with which the selected triggering symbol combination may occur.

This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/371,598, filed Aug. 6, 2010, which is also incorporated by reference in its entirety.","A portion of the disclosure of this patent document contains material that is subject to copyright protection. The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent document or the patent disclosure, as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent files or records, but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever.","1. Field of the Disclosure","This disclosure is directed to wagering games, gaming machines, networked gaming systems and methods and, more particularly, to wagering games, gaming machines, networked gaming systems and methods having a player-selectable bonus trigger.","2. Description of the Related Art","In the prior art, various types of gaming machines have been developed with different features to captivate and maintain player interest. In general, a gaming machine allows a player to play a game in exchange for a wager. Depending on the outcome of the game, the player may be entitled to an award which is paid to the player by the gaming machine, normally in the form of currency or game credits. Gaming machines may include flashing displays, lighted displays, or sound effects to capture a player's interest in a gaming device.","Another important feature of maintaining player interest in a gaming machine includes providing the player with many opportunities to win awards, such as cash or prizes. For example, in some slot machines, the display windows show more than one adjacent symbol on each reel, thereby allowing for multiple-line betting. Feature games of various types have been employed to reward players above the amounts normally awarded on a standard game pay schedule. Generally, such feature games are triggered by predetermined events such as one or more appearances of certain combinations of indicia in a primary game. In order to stimulate interest, feature games are typically set to occur at a gaming machine on a statistical cycle based upon the number of primary game plays.","Some gaming machine games today include one or more progressive prize awards. In some configurations, the progressive prize may have a small probability of being won by a player. Such a configuration makes it possible to have a larger progressive prize. In other game configurations, the progressive prize may be a small amount, which enables a player to win the progressive prize more frequently. In most typical game configurations, the player wins the progressive prize as a result of a specific game outcome within the primary or main game.","While gaming machines including feature games and progressive prizes have been very successful, there remains a need for games that provide a player with enhanced excitement and increased opportunity of winning. In particular, there remains a need for a game in which the player may choose between a frequently occurring small award and an infrequently occurring large award.","A gaming system for playing a base game and a bonus game having a plurality of symbol indicia that are selectable prior to play of the base game and are associated with the bonus game is disclosed. The system includes: an interactive display screen, a plurality of reel indicia, one or more player-activated buttons, and a processor. The interactive display screen displays the plurality of selectable symbol indicia to a player and for receiving player input, wherein prior to play of the base game, the player selects one of the pluralities of symbol indicia. Each of the plurality of symbol indicia is associated with a bonus game having a different bonus hit frequency and bonus prize pay range, enabling the player to select a bonus hit frequency and a bonus prize pay range by selecting the associated symbol indicia. The pluralities of reel indicia are spun during the play of the base game. One or more player-activated buttons receive player input. The processor executes game software and processes input from the player-activated buttons. Activation of the base game includes rotating of the plurality of reel indicia, wherein display of particular symbol indicia on one or more of the reels after the rotation has stopped determines whether a winning game outcome has occurred. A bonus game that has a higher bonus hit frequency has a lower bonus prize pay range, and a bonus game that has a lower bonus hit frequency has a higher bonus prize pay range. Preferably, selection of the symbol indicia does not change an overall return to the player of the game.","Other features and advantages will become apparent from the following detailed description, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, which illustrate by way of example, the features of the various embodiments.","Various embodiments are directed to a game, gaming machine, gaming networks and method for playing a game, wherein the game includes adjustable multi-part indicia. The embodiments are illustrated and described herein, by way of example only, and not by way of limitation. Referring now to the drawings, and more particularly to , there are shown illustrative examples of games, gaming machines, gaming networks and methods for playing a game in accordance with various aspects of the invention.","An example game in accordance with one or more aspects of the disclosed embodiments is shown in . Referring to , a wagering game with a hot pick bonus  is implemented on an interactive display screen  using the indicia of three spinning reels . A number of pay line patterns (not shown) passes through one indicium on each of the three reels. For example, a first pay line may extend horizontally through the top row of each of the three reels. The disclosed embodiment of the wagering game with a hot pick bonus  may be implemented with any number of reels and any number of selected symbols appearing to trigger the bonus feature. The number of pay lines and their patterns are by way of example only and may vary.","The player selects the number of played pay lines and the number of credits or coins wagered on each line using touch screen controls or gaming device control buttons . A win PAID meter and CREDITS meter provide the player with information about the amount paid by the last game played and the total number of credits available for play. A TOTAL BET meter displays the size of the currently selected wager. The player may collect the balance of his credits by pressing a COLLECT button (not shown).","In one embodiment, prior to the initiation of a spin of the primary game, the player selects (by touching a touchscreen or by another selection means) one of a number of indicia\/symbols . The player then initiates the primary game spin. If three, for example, of the selected symbol appear on a payline or are scattered as the result of the spin, the bonus feature is initiated. For example, shown in , the player has selected the \u201cBAR\u201d symbol. The reels then spin, resulting in an outcome shown in .","The player is paid for all line wins appearing (in this case, three Bars on payline 7). Then, because the player selected \u201cBar\u201d and three Bars appear in the reel window, the bonus is initiated. In one embodiment, the bonus is an onscreen wheel feature, but any feature game may be triggered by a player's \u201csuccessful\u201d selection.","In the present example, because the player selected \u201cBar,\u201d had the spin not contained three scattered Bars, the bonus feature would not have been initiated. An example of such an unsuccessful outcome is shown in .","One embodiment requires that three \u201cnatural\u201d selected symbols to appear; substitutions as the results of wilds and mixed bars or mixed sevens do not apply toward initiating the bonus. However, another embodiment may allow such substitutions. In some embodiments, the availability of the feature game may be restricted based on the size of the wager.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"98pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"Symbol","Pulls per Hit","Pay Range"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"98pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Wild","1,372","125x-1250x"]},{"entry":[{},"Red 7","2,058","100x-1000x"]},{"entry":[{},"Blue 7","772","50x-500x"]},{"entry":[{},"Green 7","123","10x-100x"]},{"entry":[{},"Bar 5","23","2x-20x"]},{"entry":[{},"Bar 1","17","1x-10x"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}}},"As shown, there is an increased player interactivity on every spin and player control over the play experience, in terms of bonus frequency and volatility.","In operation, the player initiates game play by pressing a SPIN\/ENROLL touch screen button. In some embodiments, the player may simultaneously select all pay lines at the maximum number of coins or credits allowed per line by pressing a MAX BET button (not shown). Buttons (see , ) on gaming machine  () or other touch screen buttons may be used to perform the actions described here without deviating from the scope of the disclosed embodiments. The reels - are made to spin and stop in predetermined stop positions. A determination is then made whether the stop positions of the reels resulted in a winning game outcome.","The player may view the pay table associated with the primary game on the primary game display by way of a HELP\/PAYS or similar button. In alternate embodiments, the pay table may be presented on a second video or printed display attached to the gaming device (i.e., display  or \u201cpay glass\u201d , ). A winning combination, for example, could be three or more symbols adjacent to one another on an active pay tine. For each winning combination, the game device awards the player the award in the pay table, adjusted as necessary based on the number of credits wagered on the pay line on which the win occurred. For example, three RED 7 symbols adjacent to one another from left-to-right on an active pay line might pay 100 times the player's wager.","In accordance with one or more embodiments, progressive prizes may be awarded as part of primary or feature game play. The progressive prizes may be calculated by a progressive controller such as a controller manufactured by Mikohn, Inc. The progressive controller monitors wagering during base game play, calculates a current value for one or more progressive jackpot pools and transmits the current pool values to the gaming machine. In one or more embodiments, progressive awards are accumulated during regular play as a percentage, such as three percent, of the game play take. The prizes may be sized according to the preferences of the casino operator. The number of prizes may vary without deviating from the scope of the disclosed embodiments. The size of the prizes is dependent on the amount of play prior to initiating feature play and may come from the contributions of a single gaming machine or a number of linked gaming machines. In another aspect, the prizes may be set amounts established by the casino operator from non-coin-in funds, such as marketing funds.","In one or more embodiments, the prizes for feature game play may be accumulated based on funding mechanisms other than a percentage of wagers accumulated by the gaming machine. For example, an operator may initially fund various award pools with a pre-determined amount of money, such as $1000 for one progressive, $500 for a second progressive, $100 for a third progressive. The amounts of one or more of the awards at pre-determined times may be periodically or randomly selected with a range of times or periods. Once a win has occurred at any level, the award levels may be rolled back to the initial funding level. In one or more embodiments, only the winning award level is rolled back to the initial funding level.","In one or more embodiments, the prizes for feature game play may be set amounts, i.e., non-progressive. In one or more embodiments, the algorithms to determine the amounts may be determined by a statistical percentage based on an average take of a gaming machine and the likelihood of the win over a period of time. In the case where one or more gaming machines are networked, a common award table may be utilized where the award algorithms are determined based on an average take (total wagers) of all the networked gaming machines and the likelihood of a win of an award over a period of time. Each award may be calculated in a similar manner based on the likelihood of a winning outcome being achieved during a game play session.","Referring to , gaming machine  is shown, in accordance with one or more embodiments, including cabinet housing , processor , primary game display  upon which a primary game and feature game may be displayed, top box  which may display multiple progressives that may be won during play of the feature game, player-activated buttons , player tracking panel , bill\/voucher acceptor  and one or more speakers . Cabinet housing  may be a self-standing unit that is generally rectangular in shape and may be manufactured with reinforced steel or other rigid materials which are resistant to tampering and vandalism. Cabinet housing  may alternatively be a handheld device including the gaming functionality as discussed herein and including various components described herein. For example, a handheld device may be a cell phone, personal data assistant, or laptop or tablet computer, each of which may include a display, a processor, and memory sufficient to support either stand-alone capability, such as gaming machine , or thin client capability, such as that incorporating some of the capability of a remote server.","In one or more embodiments, cabinet housing  houses a processor, circuitry, and software (not shown) for receiving signals from the player-activated buttons , operating the games, and transmitting signals to the respective displays and speakers. Any shaped cabinet may be implemented with any embodiment of gaming machine  so long as it provides access to a player for playing a game. For example, cabinet  may comprise a slant-top, bar-top, or tabletop style cabinet, including a Bally Cinevision\u2122 or CineReels\u2122 cabinet. The operation of gaming machine  is described more fully below.","The plurality of player-activated buttons  may be used for various functions such as, but not limited to, selecting a wager denomination, selecting a game to be played, selecting a wager amount per game, initiating a game, or cashing out money from gaming machine . Buttons  may be operable as input mechanisms and may include mechanical buttons, electromechanical buttons or touch screen buttons. Optionally, a handle  may be rotated by a player to initiate a game.","In one or more embodiments, buttons  may be replaced with various other input mechanisms known in the art such as, but not limited to, a touch screen system, touch pad, track ball, mouse, switches, toggle switches, or other input means used to accept player input. For example, one input means is a universal button module as disclosed in U.S. application Ser. No. 11\/106,212, entitled \u201cUniversal Button Module,\u201d filed on Apr. 14, 2005, which is hereby incorporated by reference. Generally, the universal button module provides a dynamic button system adaptable for use with various games and capable of adjusting to gaming systems having frequent game changes. More particularly, the universal button module may be used in connection with playing a game on a gaming machine and may be used for such functions as selecting the number of credits to bet per hand.","Cabinet housing  may optionally include top box  which contains \u201ctop glass\u201d  comprising advertising or payout information related to the game or games available on gaming machine . Player tracking panel  includes player tracking card reader  and player tracking display . Voucher printer  may be integrated into player tracking panel  or installed elsewhere in cabinet housing  or top box .","Game display  may present a game of chance wherein a player receives one or more outcomes from a set of potential outcomes. For example, one such game of chance is a video slot machine game. In other aspects of the disclosed embodiment, gaming machine  may present a video or mechanical reel slot machine, a video keno game, a lottery game, a bingo game, a Class II bingo game, a roulette game, a craps game, a blackjack game, a mechanical or video representation of a wheel game or the like.","Mechanical or video\/mechanical embodiments may include game displays such as mechanical reels, wheels, or dice as required to present the game to the player. In video\/mechanical or pure video embodiments, game display  is, typically, a CRT or a flat-panel display in the form of, but not limited to, liquid crystal, plasma, electroluminescent, vacuum fluorescent, field emission, or any other type of panel display known or developed in the art. Game display  may be mounted in either a \u201cportrait\u201d or \u201clandscape\u201d orientation and be of standard or \u201cwidescreen\u201d dimensions (i.e., a ratio of one dimension to another of at least 16\u00d79). For example, a widescreen display may be 32 inches wide by 18 inches tall. A widescreen display in a \u201cportrait\u201d orientation may be 32 inches tall by 18 inches wide. Additionally, game display  preferably includes a touch screen or touch glass system (not shown) and presents player interfaces such as, but not limited to, credit meter (not shown), win meter (not shown) and touch screen buttons (not shown). An example of a touch glass system is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,942,571, entitled \u201cGaming Device with Direction and Speed Control of Mechanical Reels Using Touch Screen,\u201d which is hereby incorporated by reference.","Game display  may also present information such as, but not limited to, player information, advertisements and casino promotions, graphic displays, news and sports updates, or even offer an alternate game. This information may be generated through a host computer networked with gaming machine  on its own initiative, or it may be obtained by request of the player using either one or more of the plurality of player-activated buttons ; the game display itself, if game display  comprises a touch screen or similar technology; buttons (not shown) mounted about game display  which may permit selections such as those found on an ATM machine, where legends on the screen are associated with respective selecting buttons; or any player input device that offers the required functionality.","Cabinet housing  incorporates a single game display . However, in alternate embodiments, cabinet housing  or top box  may house one or more additional displays  or components used for various purposes including additional game play screens, animated \u201ctop glass,\u201d progressive meters or mechanical or electromechanical devices (not shown) such as, but not limited to, wheels, pointers or reels. The additional displays may or may not include a touch screen or touch glass system.","Referring to , electronic gaming machine  is shown in accordance with one or more embodiments. Electronic gaming machine  includes base game integrated circuit board  (EGM Processor Board) connected through serial bus line  to game monitoring unit (GMU)  (such as a Bally MC300 or ACSC NT), and player interface integrated circuit board (PIB)  connected to player interface devices  over bus lines , , , , , . Printer  is connected to PIB  and GMU  over bus lines , , base game integrated circuit board , PIB , and GMU  connect to Ethernet switch  over bus lines , , . Ethernet switch  connects to a slot management system (SMS) and a casino management system (CMS) network over bus line . GMU  also may connect to the SMS and CMS network over bus line . Speakers  connect through audio mixer  and bus lines ,  to base game integrated circuit board  and PIB . The proximity and biometric devices and circuitry may be installed by upgrading a commercially available PIB , such as a Bally iView unit. Coding executed on base game integrated circuit board , PIB , and\/or GMU  may be upgraded to integrate a game having adjustable multi-part indicia as is more fully described herein.","Peripherals  connect through I\/O board  to base game integrated circuit board . For example, a bill\/ticket acceptor is typically connected to a game input-output board  which is, in turn, connected to a conventional central processing unit (\u201cCPU\u201d) base game integrated circuit board , such as an Intel Pentium microprocessor mounted on a gaming motherboard. I\/O board  may be connected to base game integrated circuit board  by a serial connection such as RS-232 or USB or may be attached to the processor by a bus such as, but not limited to, an ISA bus. The gaming motherboard may be mounted with other conventional components, such as are found on conventional personal computer motherboards, and loaded with a game program which may include a gaming machine operating system (OS), such as a Bally Alpha OS base game integrated circuit board  which executes a game program that causes base game integrated circuit board  to play a game. In one embodiment, the game program provides a slot machine game having adjustable multi-part indicia. The various components and included devices may be installed with conventionally and\/or commercially available components, devices, and circuitry into a conventional and\/or commercially available gaming machine cabinet, examples of which are described above.","When a player has inserted a form of currency such as, for example and without limitation, paper currency, coins or tokens, cashless tickets or vouchers, electronic funds transfers or the like into the currency acceptor, a signal is sent by way of I\/O board  to base game integrated circuit board  which, in turn, assigns an appropriate number of credits for play in accordance with the game program. The player may further control the operation of the gaming machine by way of other peripherals , for example, to select the amount to wager via electromechanical or touch screen buttons. The game starts in response to the player operating a start mechanism such as a handle or touch screen icon. The game program includes a random number generator to provide a display of randomly selected indicia on one or more displays. In some embodiments, the random generator may be physically separate from gaming machine ; for example, it may be part of a central determination host system which provides random game outcomes to the game program. Thereafter, the player may or may not interact with the game through electromechanical or touch screen buttons to change the displayed indicia. Finally, base game integrated circuit board  under control of the game program and OS compares the final display of indicia to a pay table. The set of possible game outcomes may include a subset of outcomes related to the triggering of a feature game. In the event the displayed outcome is a member of this subset, base game integrated circuit board , under control of the game program and by way of I\/O Board , may cause feature game play to be presented on a feature display.","Predetermined payout amounts for certain outcomes, including feature game outcomes, are stored as part of the game program. Such payout amounts are, in response to instructions from base game integrated circuit board , provided to the player in the form of coins, credits or currency via I\/O board  and a pay mechanism, which may be one or more of a credit meter, a coin hopper, a voucher printer, an electronic funds transfer protocol or any other payout means known or developed in the art.","In various embodiments, the game program is stored in a memory device (not shown) connected to or mounted on the gaming motherboard. By way of example, but not by limitation, such memory devices include external memory devices, hard drives, CD-ROMs, DVDs, and flash memory cards. In an alternative embodiment, the game programs are stored in a remote storage device. In one embodiment, the remote storage device is housed in a remote server. The gaming machine may access the remote storage device via a network connection, including but not limited to, a local area network connection, a TCP\/IP connection, a wireless connection, or any other means for operatively networking components together. Optionally, other data including graphics, sound files and other media data for use with the EGM are stored in the same or a separate memory device (not shown). Some or all of the game program and its associated data may be loaded from one memory device into another, for example, from flash memory to random access memory (RAM).","In one or more embodiments, peripherals may be connected to the system over Ethernet connections directly to the appropriate server or tied to the system controller inside the EGM using USB, serial or Ethernet connections. Each of the respective devices may have upgrades to their firmware utilizing these connections.","GMU  includes an integrated circuit board and GMU processor and memory including coding for network communications, such as the G2S (game-to-system) protocol from the Gaming Standards Association, Las Vegas, Nev., used for system communications over the network. As shown, GMU  may connect to card reader  through bus  and may thereby obtain player card information and transmit the information over the network through bus . Gaming activity information may be transferred by the base game integrated circuit board  to GMU  where the information may be translated into a network protocol, such as S2S, for transmission to a server, such as a player tracking server, where information about a player's playing activity may be stored in a designated server database.","PIB  includes an integrated circuit board. PID processor, and memory which includes an operating system, such as Windows CE, a player interface program which may be executable by the PID processor together with various input\/output (I\/O) drivers for respective devices which connect to PIB , such as player interface devices , and which may further include various games or game components playable on PIB  or on a connected network server and PIB  is operable as the player interface. PIB  connects to card reader  through bus , display  through video decoder  and bus , such as an LVDS or VGA bus.","As part of its programming, the PID processor executes coding to drive display  and provides messages and information to a player. Touch screen circuitry interactively connects display  and video decoder  to PIB , such that a player may input information and cause the information to be transmitted to PIB  either on the player's initiative or responsive to a query by PIB . Additionally, soft keys  connect through bus  to PIB  and operate together with display  to provide information or queries to a player and receive responses or queries from the player. PIB , in turn, communicates over the CMS\/SMS network through Ethernet switch  and busses ,  and with respective servers, such as a player tracking server.","Player interface devices  are linked into the virtual private network of the system components in gaming machine . The system components include the iVIEW processing board and game monitoring unit (GMU) processing board. These system components may connect over a network to the slot management system (such as a commercially available Bally SDS\/SMS) and\/or a casino management system (such as a commercially available Bally CMP\/CMS).","The GMU system component has a connection to the base game through a serial SAS connection and is connected to various servers using, for example, HTTPs over Ethernet. Through this connection, firmware, media, operating system software, and gaming machine configurations can be downloaded to the system components from the servers. This data is authenticated prior to installing on the system components.","The system components include the iVIEW processing board and game monitoring unit (GMU) processing board. The GMU and iVIEW can combined into one like the commercially available Bally GTM iVIEW device. This device may have a video mixing technology to mix the EGM processor's video signals with the iVIEW display onto the top box monitor or any monitor on the gaming device.","In accordance with one or more embodiments,  is a functional block diagram of a gaming kernel  of a game program under control of base game integrated circuit board . The game program uses gaming kernel  by calling into the application programming interface (API) , which is part of game manager . The components of game kernel , as shown in , are only illustrative, and should not be considered limiting. For example, the number of managers may be changed, additional managers may be added or some managers may be removed without deviating from the scope and spirit of the disclosed embodiments.","As shown in the example, there are three layers: a hardware layer ; an operating system layer , such as, but not limited to, Linux; and a game kernel layer  having game manager  therein. In one or more embodiments, the use of a standard operating system , such a UNIX-based or Windows-based operating system, allows game developers interfacing to the gaming kernel to use any of a number of standard development tools and environments available for the operating systems. This is in contrast to the use of proprietary, low-level interfaces, which may require significant time and engineering investments for each game upgrade, hardware upgrade, or feature upgrade. The game kernel layer  executes at the user level of the operating system , and itself contains a major component called the I\/O Board Server . To properly set the bounds of game application software (making integrity checking easier), all game applications interact with gaming kernel  using a single API  in game manager . This enables game applications to make use of a well-defined, consistent interface, as well as controlling access points to gaming kernel  controlled, where overall access is controlled using separate processes.","For example, game manager  parses an incoming command stream and, when a command dealing with I\/O comes in (arrow ), the command is sent to an applicable library routine . Library routine  decides what it needs from a device and sends commands to I\/O Board Server  (see arrow ). A few specific drivers remain in operating system 's kernel, shown as those below line . These are built-in, primitive, or privileged drivers that are (i) general (ii) kept to a minimum and (iii) are easier to leave than extract. In such cases, the low-level communications is handled within operating system  and the contents passed to library routines .","Thus, in a few cases library routines may interact with drivers inside operating system , which is why arrow  is shown as having three directions (between library utilities  and I\/O Board Server , or between library utilities  and certain drivers in operating system ). No matter which path is taken, the logic needed to work with each device is coded into modules in the user layer of the diagram. Operating system  is kept as simple, stripped down, and common across as many hardware platforms as possible. The library utilities and user-level drivers change as dictated by the game cabinet or game machine in which it will run. Thus, each game cabinet or game machine may have a base game integrated circuit board  connected to a unique, relatively dumb, and as inexpensive as possible, I\/O adapter board , plus a gaming kernel  which will have the game-machine-unique library routines and I\/O Board Server  components needed to enable game applications to interact with the gaming machine cabinet. Note that these differences are invisible to the game application software with the exception of certain functional differences (i.e., if a gaming cabinet has stereo sound, the game application will be able to make use of API  to use the capability over that of a cabinet having traditional monaural sound).","Game manager  provides an interface into game kernel , providing consistent, predictable, and backwards-compatible calling methods, syntax, and capabilities by way of game application API . This enables the game developer to be free of dealing directly with the hardware, including the freedom to not have to deal with low-level drivers as well as the freedom to not have to program lower-level managers , although lower-level managers  may be accessible through game manager 's interface  if a programmer has the need. In addition to the freedom derived from not having to deal with the hardware level drivers and the freedom of having consistent, callable, object-oriented interfaces to software managers of those components (drivers), game manager  provides access to a set of upper level managers  also having the advantages of consistent callable, object-oriented interfaces, and further providing the types and kinds of base functionality required in casino-type games. Game manager , providing all the advantages of its consistent and richly functional interface  as supported by the rest of game kernel , thus provides a game developer with a multitude of advantages.","Game manager  may have several objects within itself, including an initialization object (not shown). The initialization object performs the initialization of the entire game machine, including other objects, after game manager  has started its internal objects and servers in appropriate order. In order to carry out this function, the kernel's configuration manager  is among the first objects to be started. Configuration manager  has data needed to initialize and correctly configure other objects or servers.","The upper level managers  of game kernel  may include game event log manager  which provides, at the least, a logging or logger base class, enabling other logging objects to be derived from this base object. The logger object is a generic logger; that is, it is not aware of the contents of logged messages and events. The log manager's () job is to log events in non-volatile event log space. The size of the space may be fixed, although the size of the logged event is typically not. When the event space or log space fills up, one embodiment will delete the oldest logged event (each logged event will have a time\/date stamp, as well as other needed information such as length), providing space to record the new event. In this embodiment, the most recent events will thus be found in the log space, regardless of their relative importance. Further provided is the capability to read the stored logs for event review.","In accordance with one embodiment, meter manager  manages the various meters embodied in the game kernel . This includes the accounting information for the game machine and game play. There are hard meters (counters) and soft meters; the soft meters may be stored in non-volatile storage such as non-volatile battery-backed RAM to prevent loss. Further, a backup copy of the soft meters may be stored in a separate, non-volatile storage such as EEPROM. In one embodiment, meter manager  receives its initialization data for the meters, during startup, from configuration manager . While running, the cash in () and cash out () managers call the meter manager's () update functions to update the meters. Meter manager  will, on occasion, create backup copies of the soft meters by storing the soft meters' readings in EEPROM. This is accomplished by calling and using EEPROM manager .","In accordance with still other embodiments, progressive manager  manages progressive games playable from the game machine. Event manager  is generic, like log manager , and is used to manage various gaming machine events. Focus manager  correlates which process has control of various focus items. Tilt manager  is an object that receives a list of errors (if any) from configuration manager  at initialization, and during game play from processes, managers, drivers, and the like, that may generate errors. Random number generator manager  is provided to allow easy programming access to a random number generator (RNG), as a RNG is required in virtually all casino-style (gambling) games. RNG manager  includes the capability of using multiple seeds.","In accordance with one or more embodiments, a credit manager object (not shown) manages the current state of credits (cash value or cash equivalent) in the game machine, including any available winnings, and further provides denomination conversion services. Cash out manager  has the responsibility of configuring and managing monetary output devices. During initialization, cash out manager , using data from configuration manager , sets the cash out devices correctly and selects any selectable cash out denominations. During play, a game application may post a cash out event through the event manager  (the same way all events are handled), and using a callback posted by cash out manager , cash out manager  is informed of the event. Cash out manager  updates the credit object, updates its state in nonvolatile memory, and sends an appropriate control message to the device manager that corresponds to the dispensing device. As the device dispenses dispensable media, there will typically be event messages being sent back and forth between the device and cash out manager  until the dispensing finishes, after which cash out manager , having updated the credit manager and any other game state (such as some associated with meter manager ) that needs to be updated for this set of actions and sends a cash out completion event to event manager  and to the game application thereby. Cash in manager  functions similarly to cash out manager , only controlling, interfacing with, and taking care of actions associated with cashing in events, cashing in devices, and associated meters and crediting.","In a further example, in accordance with one or more embodiments, I\/O server  may write data to the gaming machine EEPROM memory, which is located in the gaming machine cabinet and holds meter storage that must be kept even in the event of power failure. Game manager  calls the I\/O library functions to write data to the EEPROM. The I\/O server  receives the request and starts a low priority EEPROM thread  within I\/O server  to write the data. This thread uses a sequence of 8 bit command and data writes to the EEPROM device to write the appropriate data in the proper location within the device. Any errors detected will be sent as IPC messages to game manager . All of this processing is asynchronous.","In accordance with one embodiment, button module  within I\/O server , polls (or is sent) the state of buttons every 2 milliseconds. These inputs are debounced by keeping a history of input samples. Certain sequences of samples are required to detect a button was pressed, in which case the I\/O server  sends an inter-process communication event to game manager  that a button was pressed or released. In some embodiments, the gaming machine may have intelligent distributed I\/O which debounces the buttons, in which case button module  may be able to communicate with the remote intelligent button processor to get the button events and simply relay them to game manager  via IPC messages. In still another embodiment, the I\/O library may be used for pay out requests from the game application. For example, hopper module  must start the hopper motor, constantly monitor the coin sensing lines of the hopper, debounce them, and send an IPC message to the game manager  when each coin is paid.","Further details, including disclosure of lower level fault handling and\/or processing, are included in U.S. Pat.
