More particularly, the present invention relates to a system and method for consolidating and correlating intrusion detection information.","Electronic systems and circuits have made a significant contribution towards the advancement of modern society and are utilized in a number of applications to achieve advantageous results. Numerous electronic technologies such as digital computers, calculators, audio devices, video equipment, and telephone systems have facilitated increased productivity and reduced costs in analyzing and communicating data, ideas and trends in most areas of business, science, education and entertainment. Frequently, electronic systems designed to provide these advantageous results are realized through the use of networked resources that facilitate leveraged utilization of centralized utility and data resources by distributed components. While the leveraged utilization of the centralized resources is advantageous, organization and maintenance of the centralized resources is usually very complex and often susceptible to detrimental intrusive attacks.","Centralizing certain resources within a distributed network typically provides desirable benefits. For example, centrally storing and\/or processing information typically reduces wasteful duplicative storage and\/or processing resources at each remote networked system. The ever increasing demand for centralized type services is largely attributable to the ever growing cost of specialized information technology services and the increasing complexity of managing mission critical Enterprise and Internet applications. In supporting desirable flexibility and extensibility, centralizing resources can involve handling diverse applications, architectures and topologies (e.g., associated with a multi-vendor environment). Managing the infrastructure of a large and complicated centralized networked resource environment raises many challenging operational issues.","Providing security for important centralized network assets is usually very important and also often complex. Offering ubiquitous access to a diverse set of centralized resources introduces challenges associated with protecting the centralized resources from intrusive attacks (e.g., that can detrimentally affect service quality). Traditional intrusion detection systems are usually limited to one type of sensing capability with each type of intrusion detection sensing involving different strengths and weaknesses. A host intrusion detection system (HIDS) usually tries to detect intrusion on a host. A HIDS is usually limited to sensing very localized events and often only detects events on a particular host system and no where else. Some HIDS are focused on data integrity which may expend a lot of resources on false alarms that are solely triggered by a date problem and do not necessarily provide a reliable indication of an intrusion attempt. A network intrusion detection system (NIDS) usually tries to detect intrusions directed at traffic on a network segment. For example, NIDS are usually limited to sniffing network traffic at a switching point. While NIDS may often be deployed to service a rather significant part of a network, it is usually limited to deployment at a network egress point. Since traditional intrusion detection systems do not typically have broad sensing capabilities, it usually means that the systems have weak or no protection from the types of intrusion attacks which are not the primary focus of a particular sensor.","It is desirable to have protection against a variety of different potential types of intrusion attacks. However, traditionally this involves a variety of different intrusion detection systems and sensors from multiple vendors. Managing diverse overall system intrusion detection is usually difficult and expensive, and often produces increased management difficulties. The various intrusion detection sensors usually issue alerts with different severity assignments and different attributes. Traditionally, it is very difficult to resolve the differences in the sensor alerts to achieve an indication as to the true character and\/or severity of an intrusion. For example, different conventional intrusion detection systems have different consoles and databases and intrusion detection sensors often sense different things such as signatures, data anomalies, file changes, and\/or source addresses. Dealing with diverse alerts from multi-vendor equipment is usually resource intensive (e.g., an IDS management console for each system) and interpreting the intrusion detection information is usually laborious and often requires a significant level of knowledge and expertise on each proprietary IDS system management console. The diversity can also increase susceptibility to flaws associated with human error (e.g., to circumvention of the underlying infrastructure protection measures through security holes introduced by human error).","The diversity can introduce duplication problems. A system may include two different types of sensors that have at least partially overlapping detection intrusion sensing indications that provide duplicate alarms. Interpreting and recognizing the redundancy can be difficult. Misinterpreting and not recognizing the duplication can be wasteful and lead to detrimental interruptions. For example, some resource administrators may respond to an intrusion attempt by haulting and\/or shutting down a system repeatedly. In addition, trying to manually interpret alarms in multi-vendor and multi-type sensor systems can lead to false positive and false negative indications of intrusion attempts. For example, conventional attempts at interpreting a variety of different unconsolidated and uncorrelated alarms can easily result in a false indication of an intrusion attempt or a false indication that an intrusion attempt is not occurring.","In addition to detecting a potential intrusion attempt, it is usually desirable to implement corrective action. Implementing proper corrective action usually relies upon an indication of an intrusion attempt and proper interpretation of the detection information. Traditional attempts at responding to diverse intrusion detection alarms are usually resource intensive and laborious. Understanding the possible appropriate corrective mechanisms to implement an effective incident response strategy and operational framework with traditional event handling operational principles is complex and traditionally a difficult endeavor.","A present invention integrated intrusion detection method integrates intrusion detection information. In one embodiment, intrusion detection information is gathered from a plurality of different types of intrusion detection sensors. The information is processed in a manner that provides a consolidated correlation of the information. A response is assigned to the information and the response is implemented.","Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. While the invention will be described in conjunction with the preferred embodiments, it will be understood that they are not intended to limit the invention to these embodiments. On the contrary, the invention is intended to cover alternatives, modifications and equivalents, which may be included within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims. Furthermore, in the following detailed description of the present invention, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. However, it is understood the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, some readily understood methods, procedures, components, and circuits have not been described in detail as not to unnecessarily obscure aspects of the current invention.","Some portions of the detailed descriptions that follow are presented in terms of procedures, logic blocks, processing, and other symbolic representations of operations on data bits within a computer memory. These descriptions and representations are the means generally used by those skilled in data processing arts to effectively convey the substance of their work to others skilled in the art. A procedure, logic block, process, etc., is here generally conceived to be a sequence of steps or instructions that guide operations of a system to a desired result. The steps include physical manipulations of physical quantities. Usually, though not necessarily, these quantities take the form of electrical, magnetic, optical, or quantum signals capable of being stored, transferred, combined, compared, and otherwise manipulated in a processing system. It has proven convenient at times, principally for reasons of common usage, to refer to these signals as bits, values, elements, symbols, characters, terms, numbers, or the like.","It should be borne in mind, however, that all of these and similar terms are associated with the appropriate physical quantities and are merely convenient labels applied to these quantities. Unless specifically stated otherwise as apparent from the following discussions, it is appreciated that throughout the present application, discussions utilizing terms such as \u201cprocessing\u201d, \u201ccomputing\u201d, \u201ccalculating\u201d, \u201cdetermining\u201d, \u201cdisplaying\u201d or the like, refer to the action and processes of a computer system, or similar processing device (e.g., an electrical, optical, or quantum computing device), that manipulates and transforms data represented as physical (e.g., electronic) quantities. The terms refer to actions and processes of the processing devices that manipulate or transform physical quantities within a system's components (e.g., registers, memories, other such information storage, transmission or display devices, etc.) into other data similarly represented as physical quantities within the same or other components.","The present invention facilitates flexible consolidation and correlation of intrusion detection information from a variety of different Intrusion Detection System (IDS) sensors and systems. The present invention is capable of leveraging network and application management platform (e.g., OVO) features to provide improved and effective newly deployed IDS solutions in a cost effective manner. The present invention also reduces resources required to coordinate and implement an effective enterprise network and host intrusion detection system.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 1A","b":["101","101","102","109","109","102","109","102"]},"In one embodiment, intrusion detection integration console  includes data collection module , integration module , reaction determination module  and reaction execution module . Data collection module  receives information from a plurality of different types of security examination components, wherein the information indicates potential security issues. Integration module  integrates the information in a network application management platform. Reaction determination module  determines appropriate responses to an indication of the potential security issues and reaction direction module  directs the response.","Intrusion detection integration system  is readily adaptable for use with a network application management platform (e.g., an open view operations network application management platform) to log information. In one exemplary implementation, data collection module  collects detection system alert data from a variety of different types of sensors (e.g., HIDS and NIDS) and systems (e.g., from multiple vendors). The data collection module  collects the data as directed by integration module . For example, the integration module  selects appropriate \u201chooks\u201d in one of the intrusion detection systems from which to retrieve information. In one embodiment, data collection module  logs information on intrusion detection indications (e.g., in alarms and\/or alerts). For example, the alerts can be provided by a simple network management protocol, a system log and\/or an application program interface. The collection module  can also analyze a plurality of manners in which an alert can be provided and can select the manner that is the most secure with the least dependencies in a communication path.","Referring still to , integration module  consolidates and correlates the intrusion detection information. Integration module  can filter intrusion alarm information (e.g., filter out information that is not qualitatively or quantitatively relevant) and organize the alarm attribute information (e.g., include and organize by time stamp, component name, attacker detail, details about the target of the attack, etc.). The integration of the intrusion detection information can be performed in accordance with an intrusion detection strategy or policy. For example, if an intrusion detection policy indicates that a predetermined number of attacks directed at a particular destination (e.g., a host) within a certain amount of time is indicative of a type of potential intrusion attack, integration module  can direct organization (e.g., consolidation and correlation) of the information accordingly and also assign an appropriate severity indication in accordance with the intrusion detection policy. Integration module  also provides a coordination of different received message terminology into a severity assignment hierarchy with unified terminology (e.g., normal, warning, minor, critical, etc.).","Reaction determination module  and reaction direction module  facilitate workflow management of intrusion alarm event resolution. In one exemplary implementation, network application management software is utilized to implement event workflow management for an effective incidence response strategy. The workflow management can also facilitate implementation of role based supervision. For example, there can be an operator role permitting a user to participate in intrusion detection without changing the operations (e.g., policies, delete alarms, remove sensors, etc.) and an administrator role that can participate in and change intrusion detection operations. In one embodiment, the modules of intrusion detection consolidation console  are embodied as computer readable code on a computer usable storage medium and can cause a computer system to implement consolidated intrusion detection.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 1B","FIG. 1B"],"b":["100","100","100","100","100"]},"In the present embodiment, UDC  includes switches  through , equipment racks ,  and  and network operations center . The switches  through  are communicatively coupled to each other in a switch fabric organization. Each equipment rack ,  and  include various equipment. For example, equipment rack  includes computers  through  communicatively coupled to switch , equipment rack  includes computers  through  communicatively coupled to switch , and equipment rack  includes disk arrays  through  communicatively coupled to switch . It is appreciated that the switches  through  can be coupled to other equipment (not shown), including computers that are not included in an equipment rack. In this embodiment, the switches and computer systems are interconnected using cables or the like. However, wireless connections between devices in UDC  are also contemplated.","In general, UDC  includes a programmable infrastructure that enables the virtual connection of selected computing resources as well as the isolation of selected computing resources, thereby enabling security and segregation of computing resources at varying infrastructure levels. The resources included in UDC  can be dynamically programmed to logically reconfigure and \u201cseparate\u201d the resources into a number of various virtual local area networks (VLANs). In one exemplary implementation, Network Operations Center  (NOC) includes server  coupled to a user interface  and a utility database .","The NOC  provides for overall control over the UDC . In one embodiment, the NOC  acts as an interface to the UDC  and is manned by network technicians that monitor the management and allocation of computing resources in the UDC .","Utility controller database  comprises configuration information pertaining to the various resources in UDC , including descriptions of the configuration, characteristics, and\/or features of a component. For example configuration information can include but not necessarily be limited to indications of the types of devices in UDC , representations of each VLAN, a network or MAC (media access control) address for the resources of UDC , port numbers of the configurable components, VLAN identifiers associated with each of the port numbers, socket identifier for each cable connected to each of the resources of UDC , manufacturer identifiers, model indicators, and\/or serial numbers. As resources in UDC  are changed (e.g., reallocated), the information in utility controller database  is also changed accordingly (e.g., to reflect the reallocation). Changes to the utility controller database  can also be used to drive changes to the allocation of resources in UDC .","In one embodiment, utility controller database  is embodied as a computer-readable network map. It is understood that such a map need not exist in the form conventionally associated with human-readable maps. It is also appreciated that a computer-readable network map can be synthesized on-the-fly from the information stored in utility controller database . The network map can include information pertaining to each of the computing resources in the UDC  (e.g., configuration attributes).","Server  includes a network application management platform  (e.g., an open view operation network application management platform) for managing resources in UDC  in accordance with information included in utility database . For example, utility controller  enables the creation, deployment, allocation, and management of VLANs. In one exemplary implementation, utility controller  can monitor deployed VLANs, and automatically reallocate resources when there is a reason to do so. In addition, the utility controller  monitors shared infrastructure resources, alerting NOC  of failures or other significant events. Utility controller  utilizes network application management platform  to manage resources in UCD .","Network application management platform  also includes an intrusion detection integration console . Intrusion detection integration console  consolidates intrusion detection alarms from various sensors and IDS systems. For example, intrusion detection system consolidation console  consolidates information from NIDS sensors  through  and HIDS sensors  through  and  through . IDS consolidation console  facilitates centralized management of multi-vendor and multi-type sensors with minimal user effort. Intrusion detection integration console  provides a centralized alert logging wherein the alerts are consolidated and standardized in the severity assignment and at the same time correlated based on various alert attributes. The correlation of events by intrusion detection integration console  helps to provide a high level of confidence in the intrusion alerts by reducing the probability of false positives and false negatives (e.g., beyond what is already done by an individual vendor IDS sensor engine). The correlation also facilitates automated configuration of reactions for the alerts based on various factors, including conforming the reactions to a standard enterprise response strategy.","The flexibly integrated centralized features of intrusion detection integration console  provide a number of benefits. As a centralized alert repository, intrusion detection integration console  automatically provides data redundancy. Thus, enabling consolidation of investment costs in protecting a centralized repository (e.g., via either backup, digitally signing the database records etc) which provides greater return on investment than the same amount of resources being applied to individual IDS repositories. A mechanism is provided to implement an effective incident response strategy operational framework that is compatible with traditional event handling operational principles and to initiate requisite reactions via the same platform. These mechanisms also enable enforcement of enterprise wide IDS related policies uniformly on the IDS sensors (e.g., via easy-to-use centralized intrusion detection integration console ). The centralization of the alerting and management framework for the IDS as disclosed herein, helps in reducing cost by facilitating reduction of the number of operators having specialized knowledge of using each proprietary IDS system management console otherwise required to attempt a flexible and extensive IDS solution implementation.","In addition to computer systems and switches, the UCD  can include other types of components such as, but not limited to, routers, load balancers, firewalls, and hubs. These other types of devices may also be programmable or configurable. Although described primarily in the context of UDC , the features of the present invention are not so limited. The present invention can be used with a variety of components in various configurations.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","200","200"]},"In step , information from a plurality of different types of intrusion detection sensors is gathered. The present invention is compatible with a variety of interfaces provided by different vendors for network or IDS components to log new alerts to a third party product. For example, mechanisms can include a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), syslog or an Application Programming Interface (API) through which the alerts are pushed out as they are raised. In one exemplary implementation, a HIDS provides the API, a NIDS provides SNMP traps, while the network devices log to a system log (e.g., syslog). The present invention is also able to react to a device or system that includes more than one way to provide the alerts to an external interface by analyzing each of the ways and selecting the method that is the most secure and has fewer dependencies in its communication path. For example, the API can be a preferred method because with the help of management application network platform (e.g., OVO) agent features it is possible to ensure that an alert does not leave the system on which the alert is detected. Alternatively, even though syslog approach and SNMP can be equally secure, SNMP can be more desirable than the syslog approach because it is less difficult to scale and less accessible for use by rogue applications that can embed false alerts into the syslog. In addition, a determination can be made whether the same channels are used by an IDS or network device to log any specific errors, so that those errors can also be channeled to a central repository.","At step , the information is processed in a manner that provides a consolidated correlation of the information. For example, after selecting the appropriate hooks in the IDS or network devices, a determination is made on how the information can be integrated with management network application platform mechanisms. In one exemplary implementation, an open view operation (OVO) SNMP trap interceptor can be used to handle SNMP trap based alerts. An OVO logfile encapsulator can handle syslog-based alerts, and an OVO message interceptor can be made to handle API propagated alerts with the help of an operation center message (opcmsg) mechanism. In one embodiment, a small program\/script is written to convert the API alerts into an operation center message (opcmsg) created with OVO message alerts. For SNMP trap based alerts, the MIB (Management Information Base) can be used to configure the SNMP trap templates, and then these templates can be applied in an OVO managed host that is not only reachable by the SNMP trap originating host, but also is the closest, is trusted, and provides redundant channels of communication to both the SNMP originating host and the OVO manager server. When utilizing the OVO logfile encapsulator, logfile templates can be configured to match the IDS messages logged to syslog and then these templates can be applied to an OVO agent on the trusted syslog server. Finally, the OVO message templates can be configured to correctly handle (e.g., match) the operation center messages (opcmsg) created OVO messages and they can be applied to the host on which the opcmsgs get instantiated.","The management network application platform templates provide a convenient and efficient way to consolidate and correlate various alarm information. For example, in an OVO environment the same message group (e.g., IDSAlert) is configured for each template handling IDS alerts and another common message group (e.g., IDSError) is configured for handling IDS errors. Using a variable feature provided in OVO templates to parse and filter through the incoming alert information, the alert message is re-configured to a standardized format. For example, the alert message can be reconfigured in a format specified in an enterprise wide security policy, so that the resulting consistency with the established enterprise wide security policy makes it easy for an operator to relate to the information and easily and quickly correlate the implications of different alarms.","Referring still to step  of , standardizing the format for incorporating the IDS alerts into templates includes information related to correlation attributes and incidence response attributes of the alarm in one embodiment. For example, alarm correlation information can include a date and time stamp (which can be assigned by default), severity, component or sensor name (e.g., Domain Name Server name, Internet Protocol address, firewall interface name, etc.) and type (e.g., NIDS, HIDS, firewall, etc.), attacker details, signature type or attack details, and attacked victim host details. The alarm incidence response attribute information can include cause information (e.g., what is the root cause of an alert), recommended action(s) for an operator to take (or alternatively provide a document that explains the response strategy policy framework and provides actions to be taken for attacks of differing seventies), automatic reactions configured as a response, and references to more detailed information about the alerts (e.g., the IDS generalized user interface console specifics, or a pointer to a document \/ site that explains the attack detected). In one exemplary implementation, the messages use consistent message terminology.","While configuring the templates, a standard methodology for assigning severities to the incoming alerts is utilized. The severity that an individual IDS solution might have already assigned to a particular alert is not necessarily accepted. In one embodiment, the severity assignment is accepted if severity assignment is already standardized across the IDS solutions while configuring them individually. This can be done using the alert content (including severity assigned to it by the individual IDS) and enterprise wide security policy defined standards\/guidelines.","With continued reference to step  of , standardizing the severity assignment for the IDS alerts includes a normal category, a warning category, a minor alert category, a major alert category and a critical alert category in one embodiment of the present invention. The normal category includes messages resulting from normal system operations that do not require an operator response. For example, log file rollover or a component restarting as part of normal operations. The warning category includes messages that do not require an operator response but are not part of normal system operation. For example, a common attack that does not require an explicit response (e.g., a ping based port scan) is detected. The minor category includes messages that require an operator response but are not extremely time-sensitive (e.g., the response could happen within hours instead of minutes). For example, a security component has failed over to the backup unit. The major category includes messages that require an operator response and are time-sensitive (e.g., the response should happen within minutes instead of hours). For example, a significant attack (e.g., a password attack) is happening or a security component without a hot-standby backup unit is inoperative or is not functioning properly. The critical category messages include those requiring an immediate operator response. For example, a resource has been compromised.","In one embodiment, event correlation features of an OVO network application management platform are utilized for correlating the alarm events based on various configurable parameters and weight allocation strategies. The weight allocation strategies can be based upon a variety of factors, including importance of alarm event, frequency of occurrence (e.g., from same destination), and type of attack. The parameters can also include identification of the attacker host, identification of the victim host (e.g., the host being attacked), type of attack, severity of attack, time of attack, recurrence count of attack, sensor that detected the attack, etc. These parameters can then be appropriately configured in the templates that handle the alerts to which the correlation applies. The event correlation can be done by using simple template based correlation server features (e.g., that can provide aggregation capabilities based on specific parameters), or with advanced ECS (Event Correlation Service) framework of the OVO platform that provide the same capabilities as a professional IDS correlation product if configured appropriately. In addition to using the event correlation for correlating events for better analysis, correlation can also be used for reducing false positives, reassigning severities, initiating reactions, etc. The correlation of alerts can facilitate maximization of effectiveness for a properly configured IDS solution, and also provide quick response to attacks with less error rates in terms of false negatives or positives.","A response is assigned to the information in step . For example, if the alerts are properly isolated and a very definitive reactive strategy has been defined, then reactions can be also configured in the templates. These reactions can be either automated or operator initiated. The automated actions can be used for active reactions (e.g., re-configuring the firewall rule sets or shutting down a host). In one exemplary implementation, automated reactions are configured if the reaction is for critical alerts where there is little room for error in detecting an intrusion attempt and has very fast response requirements. Automated reactions can also be used for activating a different alerting mechanism for major or critical severity alerts (e.g., email, page, etc,). The operator-initiated actions can be configured for minor, major or critical alerts where operator validation of the attack is required before the response. Some alerts can have both reactions configured to break down the reaction phase (e.g., automatically page the operator, and provide an operator-initiated host shutdown action for the operator to initiate after validating that a host has been compromised with a virus).","In step , the response is implemented. In one embodiment, an OVO platform also provides a proper framework for an incident response strategy to be implemented. It provides role based access control for different message groups based on the host from which the messages are originating (e.g., the domain which is being monitored by a specific sensor). In one exemplary implementation, the message group and node group configuration responsibility feature are utilized. An OVO platform can also provide a mechanism to implement the lifecycle of an incident handling process, including providing ways to figure out if a specific operator is responding to an alert, providing and indication which stage is the alert is in, if there are notes the operator has documented regarding a response, and providing an indication if the alert is ripe for re-assignment to an active pool.","In one embodiment of the present invention, intrusion detection method  also facilitates management of detection sensors. For example, the application feature of an OVO platform can be used for centralized IDS sensor management in which an authorized operator is able to access different sensor resources. In one exemplary implementation, one operator is able to read an IDS configuration file, while another operator is able to actually re-configure the file remotely, including starting and stopping an IDS sensor process after the reconfiguration. In one exemplary implementation, a variety of techniques (e.g., network node manager, SNMP trap handling, monitor templates, etc) can be utilized to detect a sensor is operating (e.g., \u201calive\u201d) and monitor specific performance metrics via a scheduled script (e.g., checking the state of the IDS sensor process, its resource usage, its memory usage etc). An OVO platform can also utilize a template to schedule work on IDS sensors (e.g., backing up the evidence logs and creating fresh logs). Thus, the features of an OVO platform can facilitate effective management of a sensor via a centralized console. In addition, centralized policies regarding the management issues can be uniformly enforced via these mechanisms (e.g., backing up evidence logs across sensors every hour across the infrastructure).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","300","174","200","300","357","351","352","353","354","359","355","357","351","352","353","354","357","355"]},"The components of computer system  cooperatively function to provide a variety of functions, including performing emulation application revision in accordance with the present invention. Communication bus  communicates information.

Bulk storage component  also provides storage of information. Input component  facilitates communication of information to computer system . Display module  displays information to a user.

The present invention is capable of integrating different types of IDS components from different vendors, including a Host based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS) and a Network based Intrusion Detection System (NIDS). The present invention can seamlessly incorporate information from existing legacy systems and provide new functionality for interpreting and utilizing the information. Providing a standardized aggregate correlated alert view of the report that would otherwise be various interfaces depending upon the vendors, improves effectiveness by reducing false positives and false negatives.","The present invention also provides a more effective response mechanism to take care of an attack and permits detection and reaction based on the overall security policy of the enterprise. The centralized management (e.g., sensor health checks) of multi-vendor and different type sensors helps to ensure that the entire solution is working correctly as expected. The present invention also provides a way to implement a very effective incident response mechanism that can adhere to the security policy of an enterprise while also providing a traditional event handling operational framework. The solution also provides ways to enforce enterprise IDS security policies over different IDS sensors uniformly via a centralized standard easy to use framework.
