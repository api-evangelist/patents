ROM  represents any device that is primarily read-only including electrically erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM), flash memory, etc. RAM  represents any random access memory such as Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory.","Within the computer , input\/output bus  is connected to the data\/address bus  via bus controller . In one embodiment, input\/output bus  is implemented as a standard Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) bus. The bus controller  examines all signals from the processor  to route the signals to the appropriate bus. Signals between the processor  and the system memory  are merely passed through the bus controller . However, signals from the processor  intended for devices other than system memory  are routed onto the input\/output bus .","Various devices are connected to the input\/output bus  including hard disk drive , floppy drive  that is used to read floppy disk , and optical drive , such as a CD-ROM drive that is used to read an optical disk . The video display  or other kind of display device is connected to the input\/output bus  via a video adapter .","A user enters commands and information into the computer  by using a keyboard  and\/or pointing device, such as a mouse , which are connected to bus  via input\/output ports .

For example, when the user wants to load a software application , the operating system  interprets the instruction and causes the processor  to load software application  into RAM  from either the hard disk  or the optical disk . Once software application  is loaded into the RAM , it can be used by the processor . In case of large software applications , processor  loads various portions of program modules into RAM  as needed.","The Basic Input\/Output System (BIOS)  for the computer  is stored in ROM  and is loaded into RAM  upon booting. Those skilled in the art will recognize that the BIOS  is a set of basic executable routines that have conventionally helped to transfer information between the computing resources within the computer . Operating system  or other software applications  use these low-level service routines.","In one embodiment computer  includes a registry (not shown) which is a system database that holds configuration information for computer . For example, Windows\u00ae 95 and Windows\u00ae NT by Microsoft maintain the registry in two hidden files, called USER.DAT and SYSTEM.DAT, located on a permanent storage device such as an internal disk.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","205","220","210","215","220","220","225","210","225","210","220","225","205","222","210","205","100","1"]},"According to various embodiments of the invention, a set of communication software applications execute on storage servers  and provide a set of interfaces such that client computers  can access virtual storage areas  using any one of several different methods. Each method offers different advantages in control, performance and ease of use. For example, in one embodiment, access to the virtual storage areas  is fully integrated with operating system  executing on each client computer . In this embodiment, the user can directly access a virtual storage area  via the operating system's user interface. Software applications  executing on client computer  can access the corresponding virtual storage area  through operating system  by calling standard file management routines provided by operating system . In this embodiment, operating system  packetizes data files and metadata received from the management routines and communicates the data to storage servers  via network . In this embodiment, operating system  handles all communication with storage servers  such that virtual storage area  can be accessed as if it were local to client computer .","In another embodiment, the user can access virtual storage area  by invoking a communications application  such as a web browser or an FTP utility. In this embodiment, the communications application  handles communication across network . The underlying communications between client computers  and storage servers  can follow a variety of protocols. Typically, the communications use TCP\/IP as a base protocol and additionally use the HTTP protocol, the FTP protocol or even a proprietary data-backup protocol.","The following sub-sections describe the various techniques by which, according to the invention, client computers  access virtual storage areas  via storage servers  and global computer network .","Access via the Operating System","According to the invention, in one embodiment, the user can access virtual storage area  via operating system  in the same manner by which the user accesses local storage devices ,  and . In this embodiment, the user interacts with the user interface presented by operating system  and manages virtual storage area  as if it were a local storage volume. For example, by interacting with operating system  the user can perform all common file management tasks including coping files between hard disk  and remote storage area , as well as renaming and deleting data files. The user is able to browse directory structures within virtual storage area  as if it were a local storage volume.
