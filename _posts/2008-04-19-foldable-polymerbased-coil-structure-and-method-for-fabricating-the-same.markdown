For a retinal prosthesis specifically, a receiving coil with high self-inductance and low series resistance (i.e., high Q) is needed to optimize the efficiency of the system. However, thin film coils made by existing conventional planar micromachining technology cannot achieve this requirement due to geometrical restrictions. Some techniques, such as electroplating and suspended structures (see, for example, Jae Y. Park and Mark G. Allen, -, IEEE Transactions on Magnetics, Vol. 35, NO. 5, (1999) 3544-3546), have been developed to make high-Q coils, but the processes are usually expensive, complicate, and unreliable.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0006","num":"0005"},"figref":"FIG. 1","sub":["1","2","s ","s"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["L","s"]},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mn":"2","mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u00d7","\u2062","\u2062"],"mi":"\u03c0","mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"1.1em","height":"1.1ex"}}}],"msup":{"mi":"dN","mn":"2"},"mrow":[{"msup":{"mn":"10","mrow":{"mo":"-","mn":"9"}},"mo":["[","\u2062","]"],"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mrow":[{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":"ln","mo":"\u2062","mfrac":{"mrow":{"mn":"4","mo":"\u2062","mi":"d"},"mi":"t"}}},{"mo":["(","\u2062",")"],"mrow":{"mn":"1","mo":"+","mrow":{"mfrac":{"msup":{"mi":"t","mn":"2"},"mrow":{"mn":"24","mo":"\u2062","msup":{"mi":"d","mn":"2"}}},"mo":"\u2062","mi":"\u2026"}},"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.6em","height":"0.6ex"}}}}],"mo":"\u2062"},{"mfrac":{"mrow":[{"mn":"43","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"msup":{"mi":"t","mn":"2"}},{"mn":"288","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"msup":{"mi":"d","mn":"2"}}]},"mo":"\u2062","mi":"\u2026"}],"mo":["-","+"],"mfrac":{"mn":["1","2"]}},"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.6em","height":"0.6ex"}}}},{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"Henries"}]}},"mo":","}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"1"}}]},{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["R","s"]},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mi":"\u03c1","mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mfrac":{"mi":"L","msub":{"mi":["A","c"]}},"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"Ohm"}}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"2"}}]}]}}}},"Where Lis the self-inductance, N is the number of turns, d (in cm) is the mean diameter of the coil, t (in cm) is the coil width, Ris the series resistance, \u03c1 is the metal resistivity, L is the total wire length, and Ais the cross section area of the metal wire. See, for example, Herbert Dwight, , McGraw Hill Book Company, 1945, ch 31, p 267. With these known parameters, the intrinsic Q-factor, which represents the efficiency of an inductor, is defined by the following formula, where \u03c9 is the angular resonant frequency of the AC signal (i.e., 2\u03c0\u00d71 MHz for the current system),",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002","num":"00002"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["Q","t"]},"mo":"=","mfrac":{"mrow":{"mi":"\u03c9","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"msub":{"mi":["L","s"]}},"msub":{"mi":["R","s"]}}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"3"}}]}}}}},"Theoretically, the higher the Q-factor, the more efficiently the coil performs. That means the power transfer efficiency of the system can be improved significantly by both increasing the self-inductance and lowering the series resistance of the receiving coil. Therefore, multiple layers of metal and thick metal are more desirable, but in reality this is difficult to fabricate using conventional micromachining techniques.","Y. C. Tai, F. Jiang, Y. Xu, M. Liger, S. Ho and C. M. Ho, .

Other parylenes, polymers or plastics, can be used as the insulating material instead of parylene C. Moreover, the thickness of the insulating layer can be varied for different application environments. The thickness of the metal layers can be any kind of thickness, e.g., 20 nm to 4 \u03bcm. The thickness of each polymer layer can range, for example, from 2 \u03bcm to 20 \u03bcm.","After the parylene-based skin is released from the substrate, the structure is folded, and then a thermal bonding process is performed in a vacuum oven to fuse the separate layers together. The vacuum oven is used to prevent the oxidation of parylene C, which could make parylene very fragile. The bonding temperature should be below the melting point of parylene C (typically about 290\u00b0 C.), for example 200\u00b0 C. for 2 days. Other mechanisms can be used to heat up parylene skins instead of the thermal method, such as microwave.","According to an embodiment of the disclosure, the coil shown so far can be specifically designed for intraocular retinal prostheses. A particular case of such embodiment provides for a coil having 28 turns of metal wires, and being 10 mm in outer diameter. The metal can be encapsulated by 9 \u03bcm of parylene C.","As already mentioned above, the person skilled in the art will understand that the techniques shown so far can also be used for coils having a number of layers greater than, two. In this case, alignment between layers during folding could become an issue if too many layers are made with this technique.","In applications with a large number of such layers, a special jig (i.e. a guiding and holding device or mold for aligning and holding) matching the size of the coil can help to ensure good alignments. Good alignment is desired to achieve the maximum theoretically possible self-inductance (L). Such self-inductance will drop down in presence of misalignment.  shows an example of such jig (), which comprises a top metal piece () and a bottom metal piece () to allow the parylene skins to be aligned and sandwiched in between during the thermal bonding process. For example, the jig can be made of aluminum which does not stick to parylene C at high temperature, and allows the device to be easily peeled off after thermal bonding. Alternatively, the jig can be made of Teflon\u00ae. Additionally, to improve the thermal bonding process, clamping force or pressure can be applied on the jig. Alignment can occur through the presence of alignment holes () (see ) adapted to match alignment poles () provided in the jig.","Stackable coils can be an alternative approach for making high-Q coils with multiple layers of metal.  shows a perspective schematical view of a stackable coil (), in accordance with a further embodiment of the present disclosure. In this embodiment, each layer () of coil is fabricated individually with vertical interconnection vias () precisely positioned and fully opened. Then the parylene\/metal skins are aligned and stacked together with the assistance of a matching jig (), (). Also in this case, small (e.g., 500 microns diameter) poles ()\u2014see also FIG. \u2014can be built on the jig, to match the alignment holes () on the periphery of the coils (). The parylene\/metal skins () can be aligned by feeding the poles () through the holes (). After that, a similar thermal treatment process in vacuum oven is used to bond the layers () together. Finally, silver paste can be filled into the open vias to build the interconnections between layers, while the top opening is sealed with biocompatible epoxy or parylene to render an implantable final device. Instead of silver paste, other conductive materials, such as conductive epoxy and solder can be used for making the contacts between layers.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIG. 5"],"b":["320","400","410","420","430","440","450","460","450"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":["FIG. 11","FIG. 10"],"b":"460"},"In summary, according to some of the embodiments of the present disclosure, a polymer-based foldable coil employing a multilayer polymer\/metal thin film is shown.

Microfabrication refers to processes for building miniature structures, with sizes in micron-scale and smaller, such as photolithography, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), E-beam evaporation, oxygen plasma etching, and wet etching process.
