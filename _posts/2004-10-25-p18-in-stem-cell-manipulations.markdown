No. 60\/620,154 (filed 19 Oct. 2004), the contents of which are incorporated by reference here.","Certain claims of this application may have been reduced to practice using National Institutes of Health grant numbers DK02761-01 and\/or HL70561.","Stem cells (for example, hematopoietic stems cells, or \u201cHSCs\u201d) provide many potential therapeutic uses in vivo. Stem cells' ability to differentiate into a variety of mature cell types indicates that undifferentiated stem cells may be clinically useful, for example, in treating disease both malignant (e.g., chronic myelogenous leukemia, acute myelogenous leukemia) and non-malignant (e.g., severe aplastic anemia, inherited metabolic disorders). A problem in using human stem cells in vivo, however, is that while stem cells may differentiate into a variety of mature cell types, the lifespan of a specific human stern-cell cell culture is limited by the cell line's ability to \u201cself-renew\u201d or propagate new undifferentiated stem cells (called \u201cself-renewal\u201d). Thus, the art has sought a way to increase the lifespan of human stem cell cultures or cell lines, by increasing self-renewal.","I have found a way to increase human-compatible stem cell self-renewal. My invention involves reducing or eliminating the presence of the protein \u201cp18\u201d in the undifferentiated stem cell culture. This may be done, for example, by downregulating expression of the p18 gene, or by attacking the p18 polypeptide with an enzyme or chemical.","The protein \u201cp18\u201d (p18, INK4C, Cdlcn2c) is known in the art. See e.g., H. HIRAI et al., \u201cNovel INK4 proteins, p19 and p18, are specific inhibitors of the cyclin D-dependent kinases CDK4 and CDK6\u201d, 15(5) M. C. B2672 (1995) (disclosing primary amino acid sequence of mouse p18); K. L. GUAN et al., \u201cGrowth suppression by p18, a p16INK4\/MTS1- and p14INK4B\/MTS2-related CDK6 inhibitor, correlates with wild-type pRb function,\u201d 8(24) GD2939 (1994) (disclosing primary amino acid sequence of human p18). p18 is a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CKI). P18 is an INK4 family protein. It acts at the early G1-phase of the cell cycle.","p18 has a unique role in inhibiting self-renewal of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in vivo. Increased stem cell self-renewal might be readily achieved in vitro due to the absence of p18. To demonstrate this, we first performed the Dexter long-term culture of bone marrow cells. This enumerates the cobble stone area-forming cell (CAFC). This is an in vitro surrogate for murine HSC.","There was no difference of CAFC yield in the first 4 weeks of the long-term culture between p18\u2212\/\u2212 (the genotype for cells lacing the p18 gene) and p18+\/+ flasks. However, significantly more CAFCs were constantly generated in p18\u2212\/\u2212 than in p18+\/+ flasks (p<0.01, n=4) from 6 weeks to 19 months after the initial culture. Strikingly, the frequency of CAFC at week 19 in p18\u2212\/\u2212 culture was still equivalent to its level at week 5, whereas the p18+\/+ culture nearly lost its ability of producing CAFCs at week 19. In addition, the higher production of CAFCs in p18\u2212\/\u2212 culture was also associated with a higher production of non-adherent cells, which were dominated by differentiated cells in myeloid lineage.","This hints that the difference was due to the intrinsic deficiency of p18 in HSCs, but does not confirm it. To confirm it, irradiated stromal cells from wild type bone marrow were used instead in the long-term culture with limiting dilution of the input cells from p18\u2212\/\u2212 or p18+\/+ marrow. Using these cells, there was 2-fold increase of CAFC frequency (week 5-6) in p18\u2212\/\u2212 plates compared to the p18+\/+ plates.","To further assess HSC proliferation in a defined population, we examined in vitro cell divisions of the highly purified HSCs, namely the CD34Linc-KitSca-1 (CD34LKS) cells. The repopulating ability of the sorted CD34LKS cells (CD45.2) was validated by the limiting dilution assay for competitive repopulating unit (CRU) in the congenic (CD45.1) mice. Three months after transplantation, we were able to determine approximately one CRU in 20 CD34LKS cells from p18+\/+ marrow and one CRU in 10 CD34LKS cells from the p18\u2212\/\u2212 marrow examined. Single CD34LKS cells were deposited to Terasaki plates (one cell\/well) and cultured in serum free medium supplemented with SCF, Flt3L and TPO. While most cells entered cell cycle within 3 days, which was in agreement with previous studies by others, surprisingly, there was no significant difference of the rate of cell division between p18\u2212\/\u2212 and p18+\/+ CD34LKS cells (>100 cells\/experiment, 5 experiments).","This indicates that p18 deficiency does not increase the proliferative rate of HSC. Rather. P18 deficiency may modulate the fate-choice of HSC toward symmetric cell divisions. To directly test this hypothesis, single CD34-KSL cells were cultured for two days and paired daughter cells along with minimal Sca-1 depleted competitor cells (CD45.1\/2 F1) were separately transplanted into different recipients. Positive engraftment was found in the single daughter HSC transplanted mice.","Together, these findings suggest that p18 deficiency favors symmetric divisions in the compartment of HSC though a cell-cycle independent manner. Down modulating p18 may pen-nit enhanced stem cell expansion in vitro, a method that can be used in stem cell expansion and in defining other active agents for stem cell expansion. Given the nonspecific expression of p18 in hematopoietic cells, this approach can also be applied to other stem cell types in the body.","Stem cells in vivo have a unique ability to reproduce themselves (self-renewal or self-regeneration) in physiologically determined balance with differentiation or cell death. Cell cycle regulation is one of the fundamental mechanisms underlying cell fate determination. Emerging data indicate that cell cycle status per se is a critical determinant of stem or progenitor cell function, but molecular events orchestrating these deterministic roles are largely undefined. In mammalian cells, entry into the cell cycle requires sequential activation of the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) 4\/6 and CDK2, which are inhibited by the INK4 proteins (p16, p15, p18, and p19) and the Cip\/Kip proteins (p21, p27and p57), respectively.","Both INK4 and Cip\/Kip families compose an important class of cell cycle inhibitors, termed CDK inhibitors (CKIs). While a complex array of extracellular signals and intracellular transduction pathways participate in communicating cell cycle regulatory cues, CKIs appear to be critical mediators of cell cycle control that may function in a cell autonomous manner. As previously shown in murine hematopoietic cells, p21 deficiency resulted in an enlarged hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) pool under homeostasis, but stem cell function was compromised in stress conditions. Given that the two CKI families target distinct components in the cell cycle machinery, we hypothesized that the INK4 proteins functioning earlier in G1 may influence the fate of stem cell division upon mitogenic stimuli in a unique manner. This hypothesis was indirectly supported by recent studies indicating p16and p19as downstream mediators of the Bmi-1 protein regulating HSC self-renewal. The distinct INK4 family member p18is expressed in multiple tissue types including hematopoietic cells, the loss of which in mice results in organomegaly with higher cellularity and increases the incidence of tumorigenesis with advanced age or in the presence of carcinogens. We now report an inhibitory role of p18 in HSC self-renewal through the use of reconstituted mice with p18 deficient hematopoietic cells and extensive in vivo evaluation of stem cell function.","Hematopoietic stem cells are responsible for long-term hematopoietic reconstitution of irradiated mice and their functions can be definitively examined in transplant models. We first took the approach of competitive bone marrow transplantation to directly assess the possible impact of p18 absence on hematopoietic reconstitution. Our data is shown in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 16"},"In , equal numbers (2\u00d710) of bone marrow nucleated cells from p18+\/+ mice and p18\u2212\/\u2212 mice were co-transplanted into lethally irradiated recipients. The relative contribution from each genotype was quantified with a semi-quantitative PCR approach. Based on the standardization simultaneously generated under identical PCR conditions (see ), p18\u2212\/\u2212 blood cells constituted 93.3% (vs. 6.7% of p18+\/+ genotype on average) in the mixed populations. Therefore, there was on average a 14-fold greater abundance of the long term repopulating ability (LTRA) in p18\u2212\/\u2212 bone marrow cells compared with the same number of p18+\/+ marrow cells.","To determine whether the increased engraftment of the p18\u2212\/\u2212 genotype cells occurred at the HSC or the hematopoietic progenitor cell (HPC) level, quantitative assays for colony forming cell (CFC) (in vitro surrogate for HPC) and long-term culture initiating cell (LTC-IC) (in vitro surrogate for HSC), were performed with subsequent colony genotypic analyses by PCR.

LKS or CD34LKS cells were sorted into 384-well plates (Nunc) at one cell per well using the MoFlo High-Speed Cell Sorter with subsystems of CyCLONE Automated Cloner and SortMaster Droplet Control. Each well contained 50 \u03bcl of IMDM supplemented with 50 ng\/ml of Flt3 ligand (Flt3-L), 50 ng\/ml of SCF and 10 ng\/ml of TPO. After culture for 14 days, the morphology of each colony was examined under a microscope and the colonies were lysed for PCR.","Sorted CD34LKS cells from p18\u2212\/\u2212 mice in the background of C57BL\/6 (CD45.2) were used for measuring the competitive repopulating unit (CRU). CD34LKS cells at a limiting dose (40, 20 or 10 cells\/mouse) were mixed with 1\u00d710Sca-1-depleted bone marrow cells from F1 mice of C57BL\/6 and B6.SJL (CD45.1 and CD45.2). The cell suspension was injected through tails into B6.SJL (CD45.1) mice that were irradiated at a fractioned dose of 11Gy. Ten recipients were included for each group at each dose. Blood cells from the recipients were stained with PE-CD45.1 and FITC-CD45.2 to determine engraftment level of donor cells after transplantation. 2.5% or higher of CD45 cells containing granulocytes, monocytes and lymphocytes was defined as positive engraftment in a given animal. The Beckman-Coulter XL cytometer was used for data acquisition. Based on the Poisson distribution of the negatively engrafted mice, CRU values were calculated with the software L-Calc (StemCell Technologies) and plotted in a graph. Animals that died during the course were not counted in the limiting dilution analysis. As an independent test to determine the engraftment levels, additional 5 recipient animals for each group were transplanted with a higher dose of CD34LKS cells (80 cells\/mouse).","Bone marrow cells were labeled with one \u03bcM of CFSE (Molecular Probes) as described. 1\u00d710CFSE labeled p18+\/+ or p18\u2212\/\u2212 bone marrow cells were injected into a lethally irradiated mouse. Two days after transplantation, recipient marrow cells were stained with the antibody cocktail for lineage markers, Sca-1 and c-Kit. MoFlo High-Speed Cell Sorter was used for data acquisition and the ModFit LT software (Version 3.0, Verity Software House) was used for cell proliferation analysis.","Statistical Analysis","The student's t test was used to analyze the statistical differences between p18\u2212\/\u2212 and p18+\/+ groups with the p values indicated in the related graphs.","Summary","While both p21 and p18 appear to affect cycling kinetics in primitive cells, they have very distinct phenotypes: p21\u2212\/\u2212 stem cells undergo premature exhaustion, while p18\u2212\/\u2212 stem cells self-renew. Without overwhelmingly non-specific proliferation in other cell populations, increased regeneration of p18\u2212\/\u2212 HSCs suggests that the balance of differentiation to self-renewal in the absence of p18 favors self-renewal. This notion is indirectly supported by the data from others demonstrating that p18 expressing cells have an increase in asymmetric division. It is believed that critical decisions of cell fate are made during the G1-phase. Upon mitogenic stimuli, cyclin D is upregulated and interacts with CDK4\/6, resulting in Rb phosphorylation to initiate cell cycle progression. White Cip\/Kip proteins (such as p21) broadly inhibit CDK2 in late G1\/S and possibly CDK1 in M phase, they are not capable of inhibiting CDK4\/6 activity early in G1. In contrast, INK4 proteins (such as p18) are able to specifically compete with cyclin D to bind CDK4\/6 in early G1. Given the distinct effects of these two CKI families in stem cell regulation, we propose a model in which modulation of a distinct CKI or its class at a specific position of the cell cycle may be an important mechanism for balancing self-renewal and differentiation in stem cells. Down modulating p18 may permit enhanced stem cell expansion, a hypothesis that can now be tested in adult cells.","While I have discussed various specific examples in some detail above, one of skill in the art could, with the teachings here, readily develop alternative solutions. Thus, I intend the coverage of my patent to be defined not by the specific abstract nor examples discussed here, but rather by the appended claims and their legal equivalents.","In the claims, I use certain terms in specific ways. For example, the singular allows for more than one (e.g., the claim phrase, \u201ca compound selected from the group consisting of A, B and C\u201d covers a composition with at least one\u2014and perhaps two or more\u2014of the enumerated compounds).","I use the claim term \u201csymmetrically self-renewing population\u201d to encompass both in vitro cell culture and in vivo culture as, for example, a therapeutic or experimental implant.","I use the claim term \u201chuman-compatible\u201d to mean able to be survivably-implanted in a human. This may be done by, for example, using a non-immunogenic cell line which will provoke little or no immune response, or by the conjoint administration to the human patient of an immunosuppressant pharmaceutical to suppress the immune response to the stem cell implant. A non-immunogenetic cell line may be, for example, the patient's own stem cells, extracted from the patient and cultured ex vivo for autologous delivery back to the patient.","I use the term \u201cintracellular environment\u201d to mean the intracellular environment of the stem cell culture. I use the term \u201csubstantially free\u201d to mean an amount less than the amount which would materially inhibit cell line regeneration. One may control the intracellular environment by, for example, limiting expression of the p18 protein; this may be done by deleting or mutating the p18 gene (to make a p18\u2212\/\u2212 genotype cell) or its promoter (to make a p18\u2212 phenotype cell), or by downregulating the gene promoter, or by providing a compound capable of binding and thus neutralizing the p18 protein. One known approach to down-regulating gene expression is inhibiting expression of p18 by using \u201cRNA interference,\u201d that is, using small interfering RNA or RNA-directed gene silencing. I do not imply any unstated temporal limitation on this; thus, for example, I intend my claims to cover transient downregulation of p18 transcription, or transient binding or enzymatic lysis of the p18 protein, such that the cells may revert to a p18+ phenotype once the p18-inhibiting factor is removed.","In the claims, I use the term \u201cp18\u201d to mean the polypeptide as known in the art (see supra), but also any mutation of it which differs from it insubstantially. Thus, for example, a wild-type variant or mutant which, despite its nominal difference from the published sequence for p18, achieves a similar function of impeding a cell line's regenerative capacity, is considered \u201cp18\u201d for the claims appended.","A Change of p18 expression level or a block of p18 function in cell lines can be used to screen potential drug candidates for stem cell renewal, to assay the effectiveness of potential drug candidates on p18+ and p18\u2212 cells. Thus, in the claims, I use the term \u201ccandidate composition\u201d to mean a composition of matter which is a candidate for some kind of therapeutic use; it can be a small organic chemical, for example, or a polypeptide.","Background\u2014In April 2003, Dr. Tao Cheng disclosed a method of extending the self-renewal of murine hematopoietic stem cells by elimination of the CDK inhibitor p18. The technology was returned to him in October, and he personally filed a provisional patent based on a manuscript he had submitted for publication (it was published in Nature Cell Biology in May 2004). Dr. Cheng has now made a significant advance in this technology\u2014he has achieved the same enhancement of self-renewal in human hematopoietic stem cells by transiently blocking p18 expression with siRNA. He is submitting an update to OTM to ask for reconsideration based on this new development.\n\nTechnology Summary\u2014While embryonic stem cells can be maintained indefinitely in an undifferentiated state in culture, adult-derived stem cells typically do not display the same property of self-renewal. In fact, the biggest hurdle to the use of adult-derived stem cells is the difficulty in expanding the undifferentiated cell population in vitro. In particular, hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are rapidly depleted in culture\u2014a recent report states it has \u201cnot yet been possible to identify a distinct hematopoietic stem cell with the capacity of self-renewal and in-vivo reconstitution of hematopoiesis\u201d (, May 2004).\n","Dr. Cheng has shown that p18 deficient murine HSCs show dramatically improved self-renewal in vitro as compared with wild type HSCs. This is apparently accomplished not by increasing the rate of cell division, but by postponing differentiation of the cell. Not only were the HSCs able to maintain an undifferentiated state for a longer period of time in culture, they demonstrated a remarkable engraftment advantage, with a 14-fold greater abundance of long-term repopulating ability than wild type HSCs in irradiated mice. The dominance of the p18 deficient phenotype was observed in all major blood cell types, indicating multilineage differentiation, even in secondary recipients.","Recently, Dr. Cheng was able to demonstrate the same effect in human CD34 cells. He identified expression of the p18 protein in human HSCs and then used a targeted siRNA to reduce its expression. Using two different methods to deliver the siRNA to the cell he was able to produce p18 deficient HSCs and to maintain the cells in vitro. He is currently examining the engraftment of these HSCs in NOD\/SCID mice. Because of p18 expression is not unique to HSCs, it is anticipated that this approach could be used to enhance the in vitro expansion of other types of adult-derived stem cells as well.","Currently, the only known method of increasing HSC self-renewal is by genetically modifying the cell to express the exogenous gene, HOXB4. The current method provides advantages over the HOXB4 approach because it allows for transient disruption of p18 during in vitro expansion without the genetic manipulation of the cell. Such an approach is likely to be viewed more favorably from a regulatory perspective, as it minimizes the risk of unforeseen results from genetic manipulation, such as the development of leukemic transformation that was observed after transduction with HOXB8.","Requested Action\u2014Under normal circumstances, OTM might reasonably wait for data from the SCID mouse experiments before making a decision to approve the current technology for patenting. However, because a provisional patent already exists, it will be necessary to take action prior to the filing deadline in October. If based on this new information, OTM decides that it wishes to approve the patent filing then the current data and the provisional would need to be combined in a full utility patent application. If OTM decides not to pursue patenting based on this information, Dr. Cheng requests that OTM release the new developments so that he may make arrangements for meeting the filing deadline on his own.\n\nOngoing Studies in Human Hematopoietic Stem Cells\n","To explore the potential applications of targeting p18 in human stem cell therapies, we have detected the expression of the p18 protein in human CD34 cells () and defined an effective small RNA interfering sequence for knocking the p18 protein down in the human cells (). In addition, we have tried two approaches in delivering the siRNAs into human cells. One was the electroporation () and another one is lentiviral vector (). With either method, we were able to achieve a considerable level of transduction in the human cells (more than 50%). A functional assessment after targeting p18 in human CD34 cells involving the use of NOD\/SCID mice is currently under the way, ()."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"i":["a ","a "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 1","i":"b "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 2","i":"a "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 2","i":"b "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 2","i":"c "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 3","i":"a "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 3","i":"b "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 3","i":"c "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 3","i":"d "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 4","i":"a "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 4","i":"b "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIGS. 6","FIG. 5"],"b":["7","8"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 1-5","FIG. 10"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIG. 9"],"sup":"5 "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIG. 12","FIG. 12","FIG. 12"],"i":["a ","b "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 13"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 15"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIG. 16","FIGS. 1 and 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 17"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 18"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
