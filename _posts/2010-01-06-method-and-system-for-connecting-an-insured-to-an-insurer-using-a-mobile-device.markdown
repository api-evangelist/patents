{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61\/142,665, filed on Jan. 6, 2009, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.","The invention relates to a method and system for connecting insureds to insurers using a mobile device. In particular, the present invention relates to a method and system for connecting insureds more closely to insurers by leveraging the most technically advanced mobile smart phone technology, such as the Apple iPhone.","Currently, an insured or potential customer (hereinafter the \u201cinsured\u201d) must call an insurance company or carrier (hereinafter the \u201cinsurer\u201d) to make an inquiry, modify an existing policy or report a loss. The insured will provide some preliminary information, such as the insured's name, policy number and the purpose of the communication, and then be instructed to gather and\/or provide additional information specific to that interaction. The collection and processing of this information can be time consuming and complex, involving many manual steps and duplicative actions on the part of the insured and the insurer.","As a result, the known process of interaction of insureds with insurers causes extended timelines, claim backlogs and delayed resolutions to the communication, whether that entails forming a new policy, modifying an existing policy, settling a claim, coordinating subrogation or the like. It is known that such delays have numerous negative effects on the insurance system. For instance, the insurer's ability to capture a potential customer as a new insured and the satisfaction of the insured with the insurer is impacted, in part, by the length and complexity of the interactions. In addition, the insurer's liability exposure on a claim increases as the amount of time between filing and resolution of the claim increases. There is a need for a means of enabling insureds and insurers to interact in a faster and more streamlined manner.","The known interaction of insureds and insurers also consumes a significant amount of resources. In particular, the lengthy resolution of interactions diverts resources away from selling new business, improving the insured's experience with the insurer and improving the operation of the insurer. For instance, resources expended by the insurer on customer service and claim handling cannot be used to sell new business and retain existing insureds. As a result, there are few incentives to effectively perform customer service, claim handling and routine maintenance tasks. There is a need for a means of reducing the amount of resources expended by the insureds and, particularly, the insurers to interact with one another.","The known interaction of insureds and insurers also results in duplicative actions on the part of the insured and the insurer. In particular, during a typical interaction over the telephone, the insured verbally states information to a customer service representative, a claim handler or another representative (hereinafter an \u201cagent\u201d) of the insurer who transcribes the stated information, for instance, into a computer program. Verbal transmission of information is slow, inaccurate and can result in a negative experience for the insured. There is a need for a means of enabling the insured and the insurer to interact with less verbal transmission of information.","However, some verbal interaction is necessary and even desirable. The known interaction of insureds and insurers is verbally intensive and although some information can be gathered automatically or using a touch-tone phone entry system, such as a call directory or an authorization system, there is an inherent inaccuracy or degree of imprecision in these systems that must be corrected verbally. In addition, verbal communication provides an opportunity for personal contact that fosters loyalty and trust. There is a need for a means of enabling the insured and the insurer to interact in a more accurate and precise manner that emphasizes loyalty and trust building exchanges.","The known interaction of insureds and insurers also relies upon a variety of communication channels. Telephones play a central role in connecting the insureds and insurers, but are not capable of transmitting all required information. For instance, photographs of a loss, such as a car accident, and copies of invoices for repairs or replacements relating to the loss may need to be mailed through the post or transmitted via facsimile. Using a variety of communication channels increases the complexity of administering the information flow between the insureds and insurers. There is a need for a means of enabling the insured and the insurer to interact through a unified communication channel that can transmit all, or nearly all, required information.","The object of the present invention is, therefore, to provide an improved system for connecting insureds and insurers, which, among other desirable attributes, significantly reduces or overcomes the above-mentioned deficiencies of prior interactions.","Accordingly, the present invention provides a method and system for connecting insureds more closely to insurers by leveraging the most technically advanced mobile smartphone technology, such as the Apple iPhone, to deliver services to the point at which they are needed most.","It is an object of the present invention to provide a method and system that connects insureds and insurers using a mobile device, such as a smart phone.","It is an object of the present invention to provide a method and system including an insurance software application designed for smart phone mobile devices with a phone mode, a voice recorder mode, a short message service (\u201cSMS\u201d) text mode, an e-mail mode, a digital camera mode, a digital video recording mode, a photograph gallery mode, a video gallery mode, a global positioning system (\u201cGPS\u201d) mode, and other input devices, such as a touch screen, in a coordinated and insurance policy-directed manner.","It is an object of the present invention to provide a method and system that connects insureds and insurers wirelessly in real-time from almost any location, at any time of day.","It is an object of the present invention to provide a method and system that connects insureds to the insurers to access services when and where they are needed most.","It is an object of the present invention to provide a method and system that connects insureds to the insurers to enable the insured to be in constant multifaceted contact with a knowledgeable agent of the insurer substantially immediately after an accident or loss.","It is an object of the present invention to provide a method and system that connects insureds and insurers to enable an insured to access services and information spanning the entire insurance relationship including: policy quotes; policy formation; asset, policy and insurance information; policy coverages and limit information; payment, billing and accounting information; and claim status information.","It is an object of the present invention to provide a method and system that connects insureds and insurers in a timely and streamlined manner.","It is an object of the present invention to provide a method and system that connects insureds and insurers to accomplish tasks that were previously time and labor intensive, or could only be achieved through written communications, a phone call during working hours to an agent or insurer and recently, to a lesser extent, using a personal computer.","It is an object of the present invention to provide a method and system that connects insureds and insurers immediately via the mobile device to enable an insured who suffers a loss to access an agent of the insurer who will provide advice and support to the insured at the scene of the accident or loss.","It is an object of the present invention to provide a method and system that connects insureds and insurers in an efficient manner.","It is an object of the present invention to provide a method and system that connects insureds and insurers in a manner that enables a maximum amount of information to be transmitted via digital text and photographic formats.","It is an object of the present invention to provide a method and system that connects insureds and insurers using a unified communication channel capable of transmitting voice communications, voice recordings, SMS text messages, e-mails, digital photographs, digital video recordings, and GPS information.","It is an object of the present invention to provide a method and system that connects insureds and insurers in a manner that accurately and precisely directs the insured to the proper agent of the insurer and provides the agent with information specific to the insured's communication.","It is an object of the present invention to provide a method and system that connects insureds and insurers in a manner that enhances verbal interactions by emphasizing loyalty and trust building exchanges.","It is an object of the present invention to provide a method and system that connects insurers and, in particular, young automobile policy holder insureds who have statistically high accident rates, are the customers who tend to be early adopters of new technology, and in a manner that provides particular assurance to parents and guardians of the young insureds.","It is an object of the present invention to provide a system including a mobile device insurance software application that allows the insured of a property-casualty insurer to interact, in an immediate online mode, with the insurer to access services that the insured needs most, at the time and location when they are needed. The insured can access services with or without the assistance of a representative of the insurer. By way of example, the insured can report an automobile or home loss contemporaneously with and at the location of the loss. In some instances, the insured's reporting can replace the need to send a representative of the insurer, such as a claim investigator, to the location of the loss. As a result, small claims, for instance, can be settled immediately without the expenditure of significant resources.","As another example, an insured can request a \u2018quick quote\u2019 for a new policy, which results in a binder. If the insured accepts the binder, the insured is immediately provided with the agreed upon policy and an auto insurance identification card. Alternatively, an insured can inquire about policy coverages, quotes, billing and claim status.","As another example, at a home closing, an insured can specify a new mortgagee and have a printable insurance identification card, which is proof of insurance, to complete the transaction.","It is an object of the present invention to provide a method and system that connects insureds and insurers so that the insured can select an action button on a touch screen of the mobile device in order to request professional assistance that is specific to the current content of the touch screen display or the location of an accident or loss, and\/or to be \u201ctracked\u201d remotely.","It is an object of the present invention to provide a method and system that connects insureds and insurers so that the insured can capture digital images of an insurable vehicle, property or asset and have the images securely archived. The images can be captured pre-loss, for instance, at the time of requesting a quote on a new policy related to the vehicle, property or asset, or post-loss, for instance, to report detailed information relating to the loss.","The method and system of the present invention combines four unique software components along with the features of the smart phone mobile device, data from third party providers and insurance industry standards. The method and system of present invention amalgamates ACORD data structures, wireless communications, digital camera, GPS and vehicle, property and asset data from third party providers of information. Insurance inquiries and transactions that, in known approaches, require written or verbal communications between an insured and an insurer, its agent or both, can be completed without assistance or delay providing an immediate conclusion to the transaction.","Due, in part, to the technical efficiencies and interface of the present invention, the economic benefits to the insurer are significant. The wireless device and its communication link are the financial responsibility of the insured and enable the insured to act in a \u2018self-service\u2019 mode that is intuitive, friendly and uses a widely accepted interface with which the insured is already familiar. Furthermore, the insurer accrues several other benefits, including: reduced customer service costs; reduced payouts on filed claims; increased accuracy of documentation of evidence regarding losses; increased appeal to \u2018tech savvy\u2019, more upwardly-mobile and profitable insureds, as well as other family policy holders; increased insured satisfaction and loyalty; and improved, high-profile market differentiation of the insurer.","According to one embodiment of the present invention, a method for connecting an insured to an insurer is provided. The method includes establishing a communication channel between an insured and an insurer using a mobile insurance module of a mobile device associated with the insured and a server insurance module of a server associated with the insurer, and providing an insurance service across the communication channel.","According to another embodiment of the present invention, a method for providing an insurance service is provided. The method includes receiving, using a server insurance module on a networked server of an insurer, a request for an insurance service from a mobile insurance module on a mobile device; determining, using the server insurance module, whether the request satisfies processing criteria; and, if so, delivering, using the server insurance module, the insurance service to the mobile insurance module on the mobile device.","According to another embodiment of the present invention, a system for connecting an insured to an insurer is provided. The system includes a mobile device associated with an insured having a first processor and a first memory, wherein the first memory has a mobile insurance module stored therein, and a server associated with an insurer having a second processor and a second memory, wherein the second memory has a server insurance module stored therein, wherein the mobile insurance module and the server insurance module interact to perform a method for providing a insurance service.","These and other features of the present invention are described with reference to the drawings of preferred embodiments of a system for connecting an insured with an insurer using a mobile communication device. The illustrated embodiments of the system of the present invention are intended to illustrate, but not limit, the invention.","The present invention relates to a system for connecting a prospective or existing policy holder, for instance, an insured, to an insurance company, for instance, an insurer, using a communication network.","Referring to , a communication network  is shown. The communication network  includes mobile devices  that are owned and\/or operated by the insured. The mobile devices  are smart phones, such as an Apple iPhone, that include memory in which software is stored, a processor for processing the software and a user interface  for allowing the insured to interact with the software.
