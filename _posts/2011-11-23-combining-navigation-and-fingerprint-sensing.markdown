{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The present disclosure relates generally to finger print sensing.","Touch sensitive input devices are becoming common for navigating with applications on electronic devices.","Passwords may be used in many situations where a user needs to be authenticated before using a portion of an electronic device. Situations requiring authentication may include the ability to access or use a computer, mobile phone, PDA, or any other device; they may also enable access to a physical location, or allow use of a credit\/debit card or similar instrument. Passwords are typically alphanumeric strings or sequences entered on a keyboard. However, with the advent of touch sensitive input devices, graphical authentication systems are also available. For example, a user may have align icons on a display or touch certain images in a particular order in order to authenticate.","Some systems capture fingerprint data from a user in order to authenticate. Fingerprint sensors may be combined with touch sensitive input devices.","Like reference numerals are used in the drawings to denote like elements and features.","Typically, authentication systems restrict access by requiring a user to authenticate before permitting access to a system or application. Some systems may require a user to re-authenticate after a period of time. The present application discloses a method and system for determining if an application, device or system or portions thereof continues to be used by an authorized user by capturing fingerprint data during normal operation and comparing that data with a stored fingerprint data for an authorized user. The normal operation in some embodiments includes navigating using a touch sensitive input device such as a touch pad or a touch screen. Capturing fingerprint data and checking the captured data against stored data for authorized user can prevent a third party from accessing the application, device or system after an authorized user has authenticated in a manner that does not inhibit regular use. Additionally, the third party is not alerted to the fact that his or her authorization to use the application, device or system is being verified.","If valid fingerprint information can not be captured within a certain time period, a security action can be taken. A number of reasons for not capturing valid fingerprint data can exist and the security action taken can be customized according to the reason or according to the level of security required. For example, it is possible that the enough fingerprint data to compare with the stored fingerprint is not captured for technical reasons. For example, a clear image of the fingerprint could not be recreated because of dirt on the input device. Therefore, in some embodiments, the security actions may be to request that the user input fingerprint data by for example, holding a finger on a fingerprint sensor. It is also possible, that enough data is captured to make the comparison and that the fingerprint data captured does not match stored fingerprint data. When enough data is captured but there is no match, the present user is likely not the authorized user. Thus, possible security actions can include locking the device, requiring some other form of authentication and turning off the device. In some cases, portions or all of the memory of the device may be erased immediately after the time period expires and fingerprint data matching the stored fingerprint data has not been captured or after subsequent authentication fails.","As mentioned, varying levels of security can be accommodated. For example, some implementations may require that the captured fingerprint data match fingerprint data for the user who logged into the current session. In other implementations, the fingerprint data may only need to match any authorized user. In some systems, the fingerprint data may be captured for some applications and not others.","Thus, in one aspect, there is provided a method comprising: during operation of a touch sensitive input device to perform a function other than authentication on an electronic device, attempting to capture fingerprint data; and if, after a threshold time period, fingerprint data matching a stored fingerprint data is not captured, taking a security action related to access to at least a portion of the electronic device.","In another aspect, there is provided a computer-readable medium having computer-executable instructions stored thereon that when executed implement a method, the method comprising: during operation of a touch sensitive input device to perform a function other than authentication on an electronic device, attempting to capture fingerprint data; and if, after a threshold time period, fingerprint data matching a stored fingerprint data is not captured, taking a security action related to access to at least a portion of the electronic device.","In another aspect, there is provided An electronic system comprising: an electronic device; a touch sensitive input device comprising a touch input sensor and a fingerprint sensor; and a processor configured to, during operation of the touch sensitive input device to perform a function other than authentication on an electronic device, attempt to capture fingerprint data from the fingerprint sensor and if, after a threshold time period, fingerprint data matching a stored fingerprint data is not captured, take a security action related to access to at least a portion of the electronic device.","Reference is first made to  which shows in block diagram of a communication system  in which example embodiments of the present disclosure can be applied. The communication system  comprises a number of mobile electronic devices  which may be connected to the remainder of system  in any of several different ways. Accordingly, several instances of mobile electronic devices  are depicted in  employing different example ways of connecting to system . Mobile electronic devices  are connected to a wireless communication network  which may comprise one or more of a Wireless Wide Area Network (WWAN)  and a Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN)  or other suitable network arrangements. In some embodiments, the mobile electronic devices  are configured to communicate over both the WWAN  and WLAN , and to roam between these networks. In some embodiments, the wireless network  may comprise multiple WWANs  and WLANs .","The WWAN  may be implemented as any suitable wireless access network technology. By way of example, but not limitation, the WWAN  may be implemented as a wireless network that includes a number of transceiver base stations  (one of which is shown in ) where each of the base stations  provides wireless Radio Frequency (RF) coverage to a corresponding area or cell. The WWAN  is typically operated by a mobile network service provider that provides subscription packages to users of the mobile electronic devices . In some embodiments, the WWAN  conforms to one or more of the following wireless network types: Mobitex Radio Network, DataTAC, GSM (Global System for Mobile Communication), GPRS (General Packet Radio System), TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access), CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access), CDPD (Cellular Digital Packet Data), iDEN (integrated Digital Enhanced Network), EvDO (Evolution-Data Optimized) CDMA2000, EDGE (Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution), UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunication Systems), HSDPA (High-Speed Downlink Packet Access), IEEE 802.16e (also referred to as Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access or \u201cWiMAX), or various other networks. Although WWAN  is described as a \u201cWide-Area\u201d network, that term is intended herein also to incorporate wireless Metropolitan Area Networks (WMAN) and other similar technologies for providing coordinated service wirelessly over an area larger than that covered by typical WLANs.","The WWAN  may further comprise a wireless network gateway  which connects the mobile electronic devices  to transport facilities , and through the transport facilities  to a wireless connector system . Transport facilities may include one or more private networks or lines, the public Internet, a virtual private network, or any other suitable network. The wireless connector system  may be operated, for example, by an organization or enterprise such as a corporation, university, or governmental department, which allows access to a network  such as an internal or enterprise network and its resources, or the wireless connector system , may be operated by a mobile network provider. In some embodiments, the network  may be realised using the Internet rather than an internal or enterprise network.","The wireless network gateway  provides an interface between the wireless connector system  and the WWAN , which facilitates communication between the mobile electronic devices  and other devices (not shown) connected, directly or indirectly, to the WWAN . Accordingly, communications sent via the mobile electronic devices  are transported via the WWAN  and the wireless network gateway  through transport facilities  to the wireless connector system . Communications sent from the wireless connector system  are received by the wireless network gateway  and transported via the WWAN  to the mobile electronic devices .","The WLAN  comprises a wireless network which, in some embodiments, conforms to IEEE 802.11x standards (sometimes referred to as Wi-Fi) such as, for example, the IEEE 802.11a, 802.11b and\/or 802.11g standard. Other communication protocols may be used for the WLAN  in other embodiments such as, for example, IEEE 802.11n, IEEE 802.16e (also referred to as Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access or \u201cWiMAX\u201d), or IEEE 802.20 (also referred to as Mobile Wireless Broadband Access). The WLAN  includes one or more wireless RF Access Points (AP)  (one of which is shown in ) that collectively provide a WLAN coverage area.","The WLAN  may be a personal network of the user, an enterprise network, or a hotspot offered by an internet service provider (ISP), a mobile network provider, or a property owner in a public or semi-public area, for example. The access points  are connected to an access point (AP) interface  which may connect to the wireless connector system  directly (for example, if the access point  is part of an enterprise WLAN  in which the wireless connector system  resides), or indirectly via the transport facilities  if the access point  is a personal Wi-Fi network or Wi-Fi hotspot (in which case a mechanism for securely connecting to the wireless connector system , such as a virtual private network (VPN), may be appropriate). The AP interface  provides translation and routing services between the access points  and the wireless connector system  to facilitate communication, directly or indirectly, with the wireless connector system .","The wireless connector system  may be implemented as one or more servers, and is typically located behind a firewall . The wireless connector system  manages communications, including email messages, to and from a set of managed mobile electronic devices . The wireless connector system  also provides administrative control and management capabilities over users and mobile electronic devices  which may connect to the wireless connector system .","The wireless connector system  allows the mobile electronic devices  to access the network  and connected resources and services such as a messaging server  (for example, a Microsoft Exchange\u2122, IBM Lotus Domino\u2122, or Novell GroupWise\u2122 email messaging server) having a global address book , and optionally other servers . The other servers  may comprise a content server for providing content such as internet content or content from an organization's internal servers to the mobile electronic devices  in the wireless network , an authentication server and an application server for implementing server-based applications.","The global address book  comprises electronic contact records generated and maintained by an IT (information technology) administrator of the network . Typically, the global address book is maintained exclusively by the messaging server  and there is no local copy on the mobile electronic device . In addition, the global address book typically comprises contact records for all users of the respective network  (e.g., enterprise). The contact records in the global address book  may be one or more of individual contact records (or user records) or a group address or distribution list which lists multiple individual (users).","The wireless connector system  typically provides a secure exchange of data (e.g., email messages, personal information manager (PIM) data, and IM data) with the mobile electronic devices . In some embodiments, communications between the wireless connector system  and the mobile electronic devices  are encrypted. In some embodiments, communications are encrypted using a symmetric encryption key implemented using Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) or Triple Data Encryption Standard (Triple DES) encryption. Private encryption keys are generated in a secure, two-way authenticated environment and are used for both encryption and decryption of data.","The wireless network gateway  is adapted to send data packets received from the mobile electronic device  over the WWAN  to the wireless connector system . The wireless connector system  then sends the data packets to the appropriate connection point such as the messaging server , other servers  or application servers . Conversely, the wireless connector system  sends data packets received, for example, from the messaging server  or other servers  to the wireless network gateway  which then transmit the data packets to the destination mobile electronic device . The AP interfaces  of the WLAN  provide similar sending functions between the mobile electronic device , the wireless connector system  and network connection point such as the messaging server , other servers  and application server .","The network  may comprise a private local area network, metropolitan area network, wide area network, the public Internet or combinations thereof and may include virtual networks constructed using any of these, alone, or in combination. Computers  may be connected to the network  directly or indirectly via an intermediate communication network such as the Internet . When computers  connect to the network indirectly, e.g. via the Internet , a VPN or other mechanism for securely connecting to the network  may be appropriate. Computers  may be of any suitable construction and include at least a processor, and a display screen, one or more user input devices, and a memory each connected to the processor as is known in the art. The computers  could be desktop computers, laptop\/notebook\/netbook computers, or combinations thereof, and may have wired or wireless communication subsystems for connecting to the network .","A mobile electronic device  may alternatively connect to the wireless connector system  using a computer  via the network . In at least some embodiments, for security purposes the computers  with which the mobile electronic devices  can connect to the wireless connector system  are limited to computers  which are directly connected to the network . A link  may be provided for exchanging information between the mobile electronic device  and computer  connected to the wireless connector system . The link  may comprise one or both of a physical interface and short-range wireless communication interface. The physical interface may comprise one or combinations of an Ethernet connection, Universal Serial Bus (USB) connection, Firewire\u2122 (also known as an IEEE 1394 interface) connection, or other serial data connection, via respective ports or interfaces of the mobile electronic device  and computer . The short-range wireless communication interface may be a personal area network (PAN) interface. A personal area network is a wireless point-to-point connection meaning no physical cables are required to connect the two end points.","It will be appreciated that the above-described communication system is provided for the purpose of illustration only, and that the above-described communication system comprises one possible communication network configuration of a multitude of possible configurations for use with the mobile electronic devices . The teachings of the present disclosure may be employed in connection with any other type of network and associated devices that are effective in implementing or facilitating wireless communication. Suitable variations of the communication system will be understood to a person of skill in the art and are intended to fall within the scope of the present disclosure.","Reference is now made to  which illustrates an exemplary embodiment of the mobile electronic device  in which example embodiments described in the present disclosure can be applied. The mobile electronic device  is a two-way communication device having data and voice communication capabilities, and the capability to communicate with other computer systems, for example, via the Internet. Depending on the functionality provided by the mobile electronic device , in various embodiments the mobile electronic device  may be a multiple-mode communication device configured for both data and voice communication, a smartphone, a mobile telephone or a PDA (personal digital assistant) enabled for wireless communication, a tablet device or a computer system with a wireless modem.","The mobile electronic device  includes a rigid case (not shown) housing the components of the mobile electronic device . The internal components of the mobile electronic device  are constructed on a printed circuit board (PCB). The mobile electronic device  includes a controller comprising at least one processor  (such as a microprocessor) which controls the overall operation of the mobile electronic device . The processor  interacts with device subsystems such as a wireless communication subsystem  (sometimes referred to as a radio layer) for exchanging radio frequency signals with the wireless network  to perform communication functions. The processor  interacts with additional device subsystems including a display screen  such as a liquid crystal display (LCD) screen and a touchscreen, input devices  such as a keyboard, a touchpad, a fingerprint sensor and control buttons, flash memory , random access memory (RAM) , read only memory (ROM) , auxiliary input\/output (I\/O) subsystems , data port  such as serial data port, such as a Universal Serial Bus (USB) data port, speaker , microphone , short-range communication subsystem , and other device subsystems generally designated as . Some of the subsystems shown in  perform communication-related functions, whereas other subsystems may provide \u201cresident\u201d or on-device functions.","The mobile electronic device  may comprise a touch screen display in some embodiments. The touch screen display may be constructed using a touch-sensitive input surface connected to an electronic controller and which overlays the display screen . The touch-sensitive overlay and the electronic controller provide a touch-sensitive input device and the processor  interacts with the touch-sensitive overlay via the electronic controller. In some embodiments, a touch screen is integrated directly with the display. In still other embodiments, a touch screen is placed behind the display.","The communication subsystem  includes a receiver , a transmitter , and associated components, such as one or more antenna elements  and , local oscillators (LOs) , and a processing module such as a digital signal processor (DSP) . The antenna elements  and  may be embedded or internal to the mobile electronic device  and a single antenna may be shared by both receiver and transmitter, as is known in the art. As will be apparent to those skilled in the field of communication, the particular design of the wireless communication subsystem  depends on the wireless network  in which mobile electronic device  is intended to operate.","The mobile electronic device  may communicate with any one of a plurality of fixed transceiver base stations  of the wireless network  within its geographic coverage area. The mobile electronic device  may send and receive communication signals over the wireless network  after the required network registration or activation procedures have been completed. Signals received by the antenna  through the wireless network  are input to the receiver , which may perform such common receiver functions as signal amplification, frequency down conversion, filtering, channel selection, etc., as well as analog-to-digital (A\/D) conversion. A\/D conversion of a received signal allows more complex communication functions such as demodulation and decoding to be performed in the DSP . In a similar manner, signals to be transmitted are processed, including modulation and encoding, for example, by the DSP . These DSP-processed signals are output to the transmitter  for digital-to-analog (D\/A) conversion, frequency up conversion, filtering, amplification, and transmission to the wireless network  via the antenna . The DSP  not only processes communication signals, but may also provide for receiver and transmitter control. For example, the gains applied to communication signals in the receiver  and the transmitter  may be adaptively controlled through automatic gain control algorithms implemented in the DSP .","The processor  operates under stored program control and executes software modules  stored in memory such as persistent memory, for example, in the flash memory . As illustrated in , the software modules  comprise operating system software , software applications  comprising an email messaging application  (also referred to as an email client ), a personal address book , a calendar application , a phone application , and fingerprint capture module . The fingerprint capture module  includes instructions for implementing any of the methods described herein. It is recognized that the fingerprint capture module  and its various components as described herein can form a discrete module running on the mobile electronic device , or the functions of the fingerprint capture module  can be distributed on the mobile electronic device  as separate modules or integrated within other existing modules as desired. Such discrete or distributed implementations all fall within the embodiments of the fingerprint capture module  as described herein.","The software applications  also may include a range of applications, including, for example, a notepad application, Internet browser application, voice communication (i.e. telephony) application, mapping application, or a media player application, or any combination thereof. Each of the software applications  may include layout information defining the placement of particular fields and graphic elements (e.g. text fields, input fields, icons, etc.) in the user interface (i.e. the display screen ) according to the application.","Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the software modules  or parts thereof may be temporarily loaded into volatile memory such as the RAM . The RAM  is used for storing runtime data variables and other types of data or information, as will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Although specific functions are described for various types of memory, this is merely one example, and those skilled in the art will appreciate that a different assignment of functions to types of memory could also be used.","In some embodiments, the auxiliary I\/O subsystems  may comprise an external communication link or interface, for example, an Ethernet connection. The mobile electronic device  may comprise other wireless communication interfaces for communicating with other types of wireless networks, for example, a wireless network such as an orthogonal frequency division multiplexed (OFDM) network or a GPS (Global Positioning System) subsystem comprising a GPS receiver or transceiver for communicating with a GPS satellite network (not shown). The auxiliary I\/O subsystems  may comprise a pointing or navigational input device such as a touchpad, a clickable trackball or scroll wheel or thumbwheel, or a vibrator for providing vibratory notifications in response to various events on the mobile electronic device  such as receipt of an electronic message or incoming phone call, or for other purposes such as haptic feedback (touch feedback).","In some embodiments, the mobile electronic device  also includes a removable memory card or module  (typically comprising flash memory) and a memory card interface . Network access is typically associated with a subscriber or user of the mobile electronic device  via the memory card , which may be a Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) card for use in a GSM network or other type of memory card for use in the relevant wireless network type. The memory card  is inserted in or connected to the memory card interface  of the mobile electronic device  in order to operate in conjunction with the wireless network .","The mobile electronic device  also stores other data  in an erasable persistent memory, which in one example embodiment is the flash memory . In various embodiments, the data  includes service data comprising information required by the mobile electronic device  to establish and maintain communication with the wireless network . The data  may also include user application data such as email messages, address book and contact information, calendar and schedule information, notepad documents, image files, and other commonly stored user information stored on the mobile electronic device  by its user, and other data. The data  stored in the persistent memory (e.g. flash memory ) of the mobile electronic device  may be organized, at least partially, into a number of databases each containing data items of the same data type or associated with the same application. For example, email messages, contact records, and task items may be stored in individual databases within the device memory.","The mobile electronic device  also includes a battery  as a power source, which is typically one or more rechargeable batteries that may be charged, for example, through charging circuitry coupled to a battery interface such as the serial data port . The battery  provides electrical power to at least some of the electrical circuitry in the mobile electronic device , and the battery interface  provides a mechanical and electrical connection for the battery . The battery interface  is coupled to a regulator (not shown) which provides power V+ to the circuitry of the mobile electronic device .","The short-range communication subsystem  is an additional optional component which provides for communication between the mobile electronic device  and different systems or devices, which need not necessarily be similar devices. For example, the subsystem  may include an infrared device and associated circuits and components, or a wireless bus protocol compliant communication mechanism such as a Bluetooth\u00ae communication module to provide for communication with similarly-enabled systems and devices.","A predetermined set of applications that control basic device operations, including data and voice communication applications will normally be installed on the mobile electronic device  during or after manufacture. Additional applications and\/or upgrades to the operating system  or software applications  may also be loaded onto the mobile electronic device  through the wireless network , the auxiliary I\/O subsystem , the serial port , the short-range communication subsystem , or other suitable subsystem . The downloaded programs or code modules may be permanently installed, for example, written into the program memory (i.e. the flash memory ), or written into and executed from the RAM  for execution by the processor  at runtime. Such flexibility in application installation increases the functionality of the mobile electronic device  and may provide enhanced on-device functions, communication-related functions, or both. For example, secure communication applications may enable electronic commerce functions and other such financial transactions to be performed using the mobile electronic device .","The mobile electronic device  may provide two principal modes of communication: a data communication mode and a voice communication mode. In the data communication mode, a received data signal such as a text message, an email message, or Web page download will be processed by the communication subsystem  and input to the processor  for further processing. For example, a downloaded Web page may be further processed by a browser application or an email message may be processed by the email messaging application and output to the display . A user of the mobile electronic device  may also compose data items, such as email messages, for example, using the input devices in conjunction with the display screen . These composed items may be transmitted through the communication subsystem  over the wireless network .","In the voice communication mode, the mobile electronic device  provides telephony functions and operates as a typical cellular phone. The overall operation is similar, except that the received signals are output to the speaker  and signals for transmission are generated by a transducer such as the microphone . The telephony functions are provided by a combination of software\/firmware (i.e., the phone application ) and hardware (i.e., the microphone , the speaker  and input devices). Alternative voice or audio I\/O subsystems, such as a voice message recording subsystem, may also be implemented on the mobile electronic device . Although voice or audio signal output is typically accomplished primarily through the speaker , the display screen  may also be used to provide an indication of the identity of a calling party, duration of a voice call, or other voice call related information.","The phone application  can be split into multiple applications or sub-modules, for example one or more user phone modules and a call control module. The user phone modules provide a variety of telephony features through a user interface, while the call control module provides access to common telephony functions desired by the user phone modules, such that telephony requests from phone modules can be coordinated and so that the user phone modules do not need to each provide instructions understood by the wireless communications subsystem . The call control function typically makes telephony features available to user phone modules through an application programming interface (API). It is to be recognized that all or part of the phone application  features or functions could be provided through the operating system or otherwise distributed in the mobile electronic device , while continuing to fall within the term phone application .","Referring now to , a method will be described. At action  the method starts with attempting to capture fingerprint data during operation of a touch sensitive input device to perform a function other than authentication on an electronic device. In some embodiments, the operation comprises navigating within an application.","In some embodiments, the fingerprint data is captured from an input device that combines a touch sensitive input sensor with a fingerprint sensor. Non-limiting examples of such a device include those made by Authentec and IDEX. For example, the SmartFinger\u00ae made by IDEX can be use in some embodiments. The fingerprint sensor in some embodiments is a capacitance sensor. In a capacitance sensor, pixel of a sensor array each acts as one plate of an effective parallel-plate capacitor. The dermal layer of the person's finger acts as the other plate and the epidermal layer acts as a dielectric. Capacitance sensors can be passive or active. Passive sensors use measured capacitance to distinguish between ridges and valleys on the finger. Active sensors apply a voltage to the skin of the finger before taking the measurements, which charges the effective capacitor, creating an electric field that follows the pattern of ridges on the skin. The voltage across the dermal layer and the sensor array on the discharge cycle is compared to a reference voltage to calculate capacitance and thus distinguish between ridges and valleys. In other embodiments the fingerprint sensor is an RF-based sensor. In other embodiments, the fingerprint sensor is an optical sensor. Optical sensors capture a digital image of the finger that is touching the sensor. In still other embodiments, the fingerprint sensor is an ultrasonic sensor, which uses measurements from reflected high frequency sound waves to form an image of the fingerprint.","At action , the method continues with taking a security action related to access to at least a portion of the electronic device if, after a threshold time period, fingerprint data matching a stored fingerprint data is not captured.","In some embodiments, taking the security action comprises denying access to the portion of the electronic device. In some embodiments, taking the security action comprises initiating an authentication process. For example, a login interface may be displayed and successful authentication may be required to continue to use the portion of the device. In some embodiments, taking the security action comprises locking the electronic device. In some embodiments, taking the security action comprises turning off the electronic device. Of course other security action and combinations of security actions are possible. As mentioned, the method is customizable.","In some embodiments, attempting to capture the finger print data takes place after a successful authentication. Thus the capturing of the fingerprint data can add an extra layer of security to another authentication process, which may or may not include fingerprint authentication.","In some embodiments, the stored fingerprint data is fingerprint data for a person authorized to access the portion of the electronic device. The person authorized to access the portion of the electronic device may or may not have already completed a successful authentication process. In some cases, multiple persons may be authorized to use the portion of the device without each logging in separately. By capturing the fingerprint data, this method can ensure that the portion of the device is being used by an authorized person even if the user changes after an initial authentication process. In some embodiments, the stored fingerprint data is fingerprint data for a person presently logged into the portion of the electronic device. In this manner, use of the portion of the electronic device can be restricted to the person presently logged in.","In some embodiments, the attempting to capture the fingerprint data is performed on a periodic basis. The periodic basis can be customized taking into consideration factors such as the level of security desired and the need to conserve battery power by not operating the fingerprint sensor at all times. Various factors can be balances in determining the threshold time period as well.","Fingerprint data for authorized user(s) can be stored locally on the electronic device or remotely, for example on an authentication server. Thus, in some embodiments, the method further comprises transmitting the captured fingerprint data to an authentication server to determine if the captured fingerprint data matches the stored fingerprint data.","There is also provided a computer-readable medium having computer-executable instructions stored thereon that when executed implement any of the methods described herein. In some embodiments, the computer-executable instructions are executed by a processor on the electronic device. In other embodiments, the computer-executable instructions are implemented by a remote processor, for example on a server. In some embodiments, the computer-readable instructions are implemented by more than one processor. In some embodiments, the computer-readable medium is the fingerprint capture module  referred to with reference to .","Referring now to , an electronic system  will be described. The electronic system  comprises an electronic device , a touch sensitive input device  and a processor . The touch sensitive input device  comprises a touch input module  and a fingerprint sensor . The processor  is configured to, during operation of the touch sensitive input device  to perform a function other than authentication on the electronic device, attempt to capture fingerprint data from the fingerprint sensor  and if, after a threshold time period, fingerprint data matching a stored fingerprint data is not captured, take a security action related to access to at least a portion of the electronic device .","The touch sensitive input device  may be located on the electronic device  in some embodiments and in other embodiments is a peripheral device. Examples of the touch sensitive input device include but are not limited to a touch screen display, a touch pad, and a touch sensitive navigation tool.","Examples of the electronic device include but are not limited to the mobile electronic device  described above, a mobile phone, a smart phone, a bank machine, a tablet device, a desktop computer, a laptop computer, a server, a personal digital assistant, and a multi-media device.","In some embodiments, the system  further comprises a memory  on which the stored fingerprint data  is stored. An example embodiment of the system  with the memory  is shown in the block diagram of . The memory  can be located on the electronic device  or remotely. In some embodiments the memory  is located on an authentication server. In some embodiments, the memory is a peripheral device such as an external hard drive. Non-limiting examples of the memory are non-volatile memory and persistent memory.","Referring to , in some embodiments the electronic device  includes the touch sensitive input device  and the processor . In the embodiment shown in , the electronic device also includes the memory . However, as discussed previously, it is to be understood that the memory  need not be part of the electronic device . In other words, the stored fingerprint data  can be stored locally or remotely.","In some embodiments, the electronic system  further comprises a transmitter and the processor  is further configured to cause the transmitter to transmit the fingerprint data to an authentication server to determine if the captured fingerprint data matches the stored fingerprint data. An example embodiment including a transmitter  and an authentication server  is shown in . In the embodiment shown in , the transmitter  is part of the electronic device  and the memory  is part of the authentication server .","While the present disclosure is sometimes described in terms of methods, a person of ordinary skill in the art will understand that the present disclosure is also directed to various apparatus including components for performing at least some of the aspects and features of the described methods, be it by way of hardware components, software or any combination of the two, or in any other manner.
