title: Real-time collaborative document review and transfer method and system
abstract: A computer based document review and transfer system and method is disclosed. In an embodiment, the system receives a request from user for a unique identifier (ID). The system generates a unique ID and assigns it to the user. Users access the system to upload documents and other data. Users can request that documents and data be sent to another user by referencing the other user's unique ID. The system stores all documents and data on a cloud server that is accessible from any type of user device. Data consistency is maintained across devices. Access to documents and data comprises collaborative review of a document simultaneously by multiple users, revision of the document by one or more users; recording comments on the document by one or more users, and transfer of the document to various user devices. Data analytics are also performed on the data and various statistical information made available to users.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["With the growth of technology, individuals today are more connected than they ever before. It is common for a single individual to carry one or more mobile devices at any time. However, with multiple devices, there are challenges when users are interacting with one another. One such challenge occurs when users are submitting information to each other.","There is a growing need to send documents via mobile device and between mobile devices and their users, but current solutions are often not as capable as desired. Current solutions include portable storage solutions, and Bump\u2122 (offered by Bump Technologies, Mountain View, Calif.). It is not feasible for users to carry a portable storage device at all times. Although users can send emails, they cannot easily refer to previously sent or received information seamlessly. Emails may be lost, or become hard to find or track. There are no APIs to build on top of emails for automation. Additionally, when individuals are in a face-to-face professional or corporate setting, none of these solutions are viable solutions. Individuals might not wish to Bump\u2122 phones in a corporate setting.","Current solutions are further limited in their ability to instantly share documents and comments among users. For example, Recsolu\u2122 provides recruiting software to universities. The software aids with management of resumes and organization of career fairs, etc. but does not provide instant transfer of resumes or other documents in real-time from any device to any device between users. There is latency in the Recsolu\u2122 system because a recruiter must first scan the applicant's QR code when the applicant is in front of the recruiter, the QR code is then forwarded to the server over the internet, and the server processes the QR code and then sends the applicant's profile which then allows the recruiter to view the applicant's profile. The resume or profile information cannot be sent in advance to the particular recruiter by the applicant.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0005","num":"0004"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0006","num":"0005"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},"There is a need for a system and method for real-time collaborative document review and transfer including the use of mobile devices.","Embodiments of a method and system for secure real-time collaborative document review and transfer are described. Embodiments enable users to send data and documents with full transparency, and on any device. In addition, users can quickly provide comments on documents, and the comments are stored with the documents in a database accessible to a selected group of users who each can review and comment on the data. For purposes of illustration, and not limitation, aspects of the invention will be described as a method and system for, job applicants and, job recruiters. However, the invention is applicable to other particular environments. The examples used for illustration demonstrate the advantages of instantly communicating data and storing data, including real-time observations. The environment of a career fair with hundreds of applicants and hundreds of employers lends itself to a solution for the problem of having a very large amount of data to review in a short period of time, combined with the goal of having human interaction and making notes on the interaction for later review. Therefore, the career fair environment is used as an example of a use that embodiments of the invention are appropriate for. However, embodiments are not limited to career fairs or job-seeking scenarios.","In this document, a service called Mounza will be used as an example of embodiments of the invention. The service provides each person wishing to transfer (receive or send) data via the service with a unique identification (ID) for transferring data. In an example embodiment as described herein the person can be a job recruiter. The unique ID can be alphanumeric, graphic, or any electronic format that uniquely identifies the individual receiving\/sending the data. The ID can be an email address, a company name plus a recruiter number, a job ID plus a recruiter number, a photo of the recruiter, etc. When a sender is trying to send data to a receiver, the receiver's ID must be provided. The service performs the data transfers on the back end, and the receiver receives a notification that the data is received. The notification is received on any and all supported electronic communication devices. Herein, the terms \u201cdata\u201d and \u201cdocument\u201d are used interchangeably, but the data is not limited to a text document, or other particular form of data. Examples of files types supported include without limitation, .jpg, .gif, .png, .tiff. The service and system as described herein includes necessary software for platform support on individual devices.","According to some embodiments, location-based services (LBS) are used to allow recruiters and students to detect each other's proximity. In such an embodiment, a student does not need to enter a recruiter ID, but can see which recruiters are near at a particular time, and send information to selected ones of the recruiters in proximity. In addition students can send resumes and other information to other students for critique and comments.","Once received, the document can be viewed on any device. Documents can be downloaded and transferred in any way. The received version is stored on a Mounza server. This allows the receiver (and other users) to view the document on any and all devices.","Additionally, Mounza provides a set of application programming interfaces (APIs) for automation. For example, a user can submit a resume to a recruiter at a career fair, and that resume is automatically submitted into the recruitment platform at the organization the recruiter is representing. Previously, this would have required digitizing the applicant's paper resume for submission\u2014a manual process.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 3A","FIG. 3A"],"b":["100","102","102","102","112","102","104","106"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 3B","b":"106"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},"On the right side of the diagram, two recruiter screens are shown. In the View screen, the student's resume appears as soon as the student presses the SEND button. The student sets the status to be displayed on this page. Status options include \u201cavailable right now\u201d, \u201cIdle\u201d, and \u201cNot Available\u201d. The recruiter can SMS the student by pressing the SMS button, or call the student by pressing the CALL button. The contact information entered by the student when signing up for Mounza is accessed for these features. The recruiter has the ability ahead of time to create \u201ctags\u201d appropriate to the company's interest. In this example, the company has identified three qualities that can be tagged: \u201cstrong\u201d, \u201ccommunicator\u201d, and \u201ccontact\u201d. This allows the recruiter to quickly describe the candidate, including the intangibles most important to the firm by clicking on one, all or none of the tags. The recruiter can highlight the text of the resume as shown.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIGS. 5A-5D","FIG. 5A","FIG. 5B"],"b":"1"},"When receiving a document, recruiters will see an alert on their mobile application. The recruiter can open the document within the application, as shown in , and view the student's resume. The recruiter screen includes a Home button, a Resume drop button, a Chat button and a Register button, which will all be described more fully below. As shown in , once the recruiter has reviewed the resume, he or she can play a resume classification game to classify the resume as a Yes, a No or a Maybe for each of multiple jobs the recruiter is looking to fill.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIGS. 6A and 6B","FIG. 6A"]},"A recruiter web site screen is shown in . The recruiter also has a profile button to allow review and update of a profile. There is a resume drop button to view the list of jobs the company is recruiting for. Once selecting the job, the recruiter will see the yes\/maybe\/no classification of the selected job. By classifying the student's application when received, recruiters save time when trying to identify potential hires. There are also Inbox and Sent buttons for viewing messages. This screen shows a collaborative session between the recruiter and their decision-making colleagues. The resume is viewed by all of the collaborators in real-time. This screen lets recruiters see the resumes for a particular, job opening that are in the yes, maybe or no buckets. After collaboration, if needed, recruiters may re-classify a specific resume in another bucket. The \u201cYes\u201d bucket is the list of candidates that should be interviewed. The \u201cMaybe\u201d bucket is the list of candidates that should be interviewed if there is an interview slot open. The \u201cNo\u201d bucket is the list of candidates that the firm will not interview. The \u201cAll\u201d bucket is a list of all resumes received for the particular job. If desired, the microphone button allows the recruiter to replay a recording of the face-to-face interview with the student. At the bottom of the screen is a record of live chat, where typed communications among the collaborators appear. The classification names and the number of classifications are configurable by the recruiter. These classifications are shown as an example.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},"Students are busy and social driven, so a solution as described herein provides a time-saving and friendly way to organize the job hunt and also share information with other students. Students can share resumes and recommendations. They can share job opportunities with other students and critique other student's resumes. The instant access to recruiter information, and company and career fair information makes planning for the career search easier during an extremely hectic time.","Embodiments of the invention provide a durable professional network for student and recent alumni. In addition, relationships between professors and students are enhanced. Students look to alumni and professors for help, and the invention allows a central \u201cmeeting\u201d place and a way to centrally share data. This is particularly helpful in today's environment where young professional change jobs often. The network allows ongoing support for job seekers, such as periodic reports of job seeker statistics. Recruiters can make themselves and their companies more visible with very current information, helping the right resume go to the right recruiter the first time. In an embodiment, APIs allow corporate recruiter to integrate embodiments of the invention into existing hiring tools. The invention allows for tracking of success. For example, students will almost always provide their updated status to LinkedIn\u2122Integration with LinkedIn allows collection of data on students and alumni who are hired for various jobs over time.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["1102","1104","1110","1112","1114"]},"In an embodiment, the system includes an analytics engine (not shown) that analyzes data items from the documents and their contexts and produces various statistical data for users.
