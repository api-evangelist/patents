title: Use and enforcement of provenance and lineage constraints
abstract: Provided are techniques for managing constraints. Content data and content metadata that is associated with the content data is stored. In response to receiving a change to one of the content data and the content metadata, a provenance value is calculated based on the change, wherein the provenance value represents a change in content between the changed content data or the content metadata and an original version of the content data or the content metadata, and a lineage value is calculated based on the change, wherein the lineage value represents a change in authorship between the changed content data or the content metadata and the original version of the content data or the content metadata. It is determined whether the calculated provenance value violates at least one constraint. It is determined whether the calculated lineage value violates at least one constraint. In response to determining that the calculated provenance value or the calculated lineage value violates at least one constraint, one or more actions associated with the violated constraint are performed, wherein the one or more actions include allowing the change and preventing the change.

No. 13\/183,840, filed on the same date herewith, and entitled \u201cVersioning of Metadata, Including Presentation of Provenance and Lineage for Versioned Metadata\u201d; and (2) application Ser. No. 13\/183,847, filed on the same date herewith, and entitled \u201cDetermining and Presenting Provenance and Lineage for Content in a Content Management System\u201d; the entire contents of each of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.","Embodiments of the invention relate to use and enforcement of provenance and lineage constraints in, for example, a content management system.","Provenance and lineage information may be stored and updated in a computing system. Provenance information may be described as an indication of how much one version of content differs from another version of that content (e.g., how much one version of a document differs from the original version of the document). Lineage information may be described as an indication of authorship. For example, an initial version of a document may be created by a first author and updated by a second author.","Provided are a method, computer program product, and system for managing constraints. Content data and content metadata that is associated with the content data is stored. In response to receiving a change to one of the content data and the content metadata, a provenance value is calculated based on the change, wherein the provenance value represents a change in content between the changed content data or the content metadata and an original version of the content data or the content metadata, and a lineage value is calculated based on the change, wherein the lineage value represents a change in authorship between the changed content data or the content metadata and the original version of the content data or the content metadata. It is determined whether the calculated provenance value violates at least one constraint. It is determined whether the calculated lineage value violates at least one constraint. In response to determining that the calculated provenance value or the calculated lineage value violates at least one constraint, one or more actions associated with the violated constraint are performed, wherein the one or more actions include allowing the change and preventing the change.","In the following description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof and which illustrate several embodiments of the invention. It is understood that other embodiments may be utilized and structural and operational changes may be made without departing from the scope of the invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","110","120","130","100","150","150","160","170","180","180","182","184","182","160","184"]},"The content manager  manages the content data  (e.g., documents, images, videos, etc.). For example, the content manager  tracks multiple versions of content data (e.g., multiple versions of a document). The content manager  associates metadata  with the content data . The content manager  allows new content data  and new content metadata  to be added. The content manager  allows existing content data  and existing content metadata  to be changed (e.g., deleted or updated). In particular, the content manager  allows the content data  to be checked-out, changed, and checked-in.","The provenance and lineage engine  automatically takes actions based on the content data  or content metadata  that may be continuously ingested into the content management system . The actions may include performing actions (e.g., sending a notification) or preventing actions (e.g., preventing an update to the content data  or the content metadata ). In the case of provenance and lineage information , as the content data  and content metadata  are changed, the provenance and lineage engine  tracks (i.e., updates) the provenance and lineage information  for the data , .","The provenance and lineage engine  provides the ability to report and\/or display the provenance and lineage information  using the content manager .","As the provenance and lineage information  is collected, the provenance and lineage engine  in the content management system manages the constraints  that deal with provenance and lineage. The provenance and lineage engine  makes the content data  actionable (i.e., actions may be taken as the content data  is changed). That is, the provenance and lineage engine  takes actions or prevents actions based on the provenance and lineage information . For example, the provenance and lineage engine :\n\n","The provenance and lineage engine  takes as input the provenance and lineage information  for the content data  and\/or the content metadata . Based on user supplied constraints , the provenance and lineage engine  takes actions on the content data  and\/or the content metadata . The provenance and lineage engine  may prevent changes to the content data  or the content metadata  if the changes violate the user defined constraints  for provenance and\/or lineage. Also, custom user-defined actions may be defined to deal with violations of the constraints.","The provenance and lineage engine  allows users to form constraints on the content data  and the content metadata  with the provenance and lineage information  that is maintained by the content management system .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["200","110","170","160","184"]},"In , a user may use element  to set a provenance constraint. In this example, the province constraint sets a minimum value to a threshold of 50%. The user may use element  to set a lineage constraint. In this example, the lineage constraint sets a minimum value to a threshold of 50%. Also, the user may use element  to select an action to take in response to the modifications causing the provenance or lineage to drop below the set thresholds. Referring again to , in certain embodiments, the provenance and lineage engine  presents options to the user to describe the actions (e.g., prevent change or allow change) that can be taken when a constraint is violated. Also, the provenance and lineage engine  allows a user to select creation of a custom action, and then, the user may supply a separate script or action to take when the constraint is violated. This can be used to cover additional corrective actions or custom notifications that the user wishes to include. For example, if a new user changes data , , then, the provenance and lineage engine  may send a notification to other users of the new author. Also, the custom script or action may indicate that a workflow process is to be executed, and the workflow processor  would be initiated to execute the workflow process.","In certain embodiments, the constraints may be for either the content data  or for the content metadata  (e.g., specific metadata values). For content metadata , each provenance and lineage enabled attribute may have associated thresholds for provenance and lineage constraints .","The provenance and lineage engine  enforces these thresholds for provenance and lineage by employing a check that looks to see whether provenance or lineage constraints are enabled, and, if they are enabled, then the provenance and lineage engine  checks values to see if they violate the constraints that the user has configured. If any constraints  are violated, the provenance and lineage engine  takes the user-defined action associated with the constraint .","The provenance and lineage engine  is able to calculate for provenance, how much difference there is between versions, and display this information. This type of information may be used in determining whether a constraint  has been violated. Also, the provenance and lineage engine  may determine the difference between two versions of the content data  or the content metadata  based on portions of the data ,  changed or based on the data ,  as a whole.","The provenance and lineage engine  also can determine whether the most recently changed version of data ,  has such minimal changes that the data ,  is ready for a next process in a workflow (e.g., review or publication).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0029"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIGS. 1 and 3"],"b":["300","110","160","184","302","110","100","110","304"]},"In block , the provenance and lineage engine  calculates a provenance value and a lineage value based on the change. In certain embodiments, the content data  and metadata  (excluding provenance and lineage attributes) are used to calculate provenance and lineage values using differences in changes between one version (or revision) and another (for provenance) and the extent to which different users have authored the content (for lineage). The end result of the provenance and lineage calculations for both content data  and metadata  is the provenance and lineage information . In block , the provenance and lineage engine  determines whether the provenance or lineage constraints are enabled. If so, processing continues to block , otherwise, processing continues to block .","In block , the provenance and lineage engine  determines whether the provenance or lineage values violate any constraints. If so, processing continues to block , otherwise, processing continues to block . In block , the provenance and lineage engine  performs one or more actions associated with the violated constraints.","In block , the provenance and lineage engine  completes the change to the content data  or the content metadata  based on the received change. In block , the provenance and lineage engine  returns a success code (e.g., to a calling Application Programming Interface (API)).","In certain embodiments, prior to the processing of block , a user checks-out the content data  or the content metadata . Then, after the change is received in block , the provenance and lineage engine  determines whether a lineage constraint has been violated, and, if so, performs the action associated with the violated constraint, otherwise, the processing continues to blocks - of  to process the provenance constraints. In particular, if only one author is allowed, then the changes may be rejected, without having to check the provenance constraints.","The provenance and lineage engine  uses the provenance and lineage values (e.g., percentages) to implement a constraint  and to inform viewers of the content data  of changes that the content data  may have undergone since the initial creation of the content data .","The provenance and lineage engine  applies the provenance and lineage values to implement constraints  on the amount of change to the content data  or the content metadata  that the content management system  would permit.","For example, such constraints  may be useful if the user (the creator of the content data , administrator, etc.) wants to prevent changes to the content data  when the provenance drops below 50%. For example, a user may create a test plan where the user has carefully laid out a detailed set of actions and wants the test plan to be more or less preserved. The user could set a provenance constraint of 80%, for example, which might be enough for other people to modify dates in the plan but not much else. As another example, more edits may be allowed, but when a threshold is reached, the edits would trigger a custom script to execute some set of actions to generate a review process of the test plan again.","For lineage, the user may want to limit how many different authors can contribute to the test plan (maybe for discovery or liability purposes) or may want to trigger some re-approval process through a custom action once the lineage drops below a threshold.","With the provenance and lineage engine , the constraint system could be used to prevent drastic actions where someone starts destroying content or completely re-writing content in a malicious way (either intentionally or unintentionally).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIGS. 1 and 4","FIG. 3"],"b":["110","400","110","160","184","402","110","182","304","404","110","160","184","160","160"]},"As will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, aspects of the present invention may be embodied as a system, method or computer program product.
