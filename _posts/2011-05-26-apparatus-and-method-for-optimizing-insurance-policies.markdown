{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This application is a continuation-in-part of European Patent Application No. EP 11158962.8, filed Mar. 21, 2011, and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13\/043,317, filed Mar. 8, 2011, the entire disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates generally to an apparatus and method for optimizing insurance policies. More particularly, the present invention relates to an apparatus and method for identifying coverage discrepancies in credit insurance policies, managing the process of obtaining the maximum amount of desired coverage from credit insurance policies, actively monitoring credit insurance policies to determine whether a customer's coverage goals are being met, actively monitoring, customers' and debtors' activities to identify any compliance issues with the terms and conditions of credit insurance policies, automating the processes required to obtain\/retain the coverage required to meet a customer's coverage goals, and automating the processes required to obtain\/retain compliance with the terms and conditions of credit insurance policies.","2. Background of the Related Art","Business credit insurance, or trade credit insurance, (hereinafter referred to more generally as \u201ccredit insurance\u201d) is an insurance policy and\/or risk management product that businesses purchase to insure payment of any credit extended by that business (i.e., their accounts receivable). In other words, credit insurance is insurance that covers the payment risk resulting from the delivery of goods or services. Credit insurance typically covers a portfolio of a business's debtors and pays a predetermined percentage of a credit that remains unpaid as a result of certain debtor activity, such as protracted default, insolvency, or bankruptcy.","Credit insurance is a very powerful tool, capable of providing tremendous protection and value for businesses. However, like all powerful tools, it requires proper maintenance and management to deliver optimal results. More specifically, credit insurance not only requires significant maintenance and management, most policyholders do not realize what the requirements of their policies are or how to comply with those requirements. Nor do policyholders have the resources available to perform the functions necessary to identify and comply with those requirements. As a result, a majority of policyholders are not receiving the full desired protection and value from their credit insurance policies. In other words, their credit insurance policies are not optimized.","Optimized credit insurance policies generally include three primary features: 1) they provide the maximum amount of coverage desired by the policyholder, 2) they ensure the payability of covered claims, and 3) they provide the maximum coverage available relative to the premium paid (i.e., they maximize the coverage\/premium ratio). And as discussed in more detail below, conventional credit insurance policies typically lack one or more of those features. Accordingly, conventional credit insurance policies are not optimized.","Credit Insurance Coverage","Many credit insurance programs do not provide the maximum coverage desired by the policyholder due to non-optimal coverage issues, such as cancelled coverage, denied coverage, out-of-compliance Discretionary Credit Limit (DCL) coverage, etc. Some of those problems have arisen as a result of credit insurers changing their risk tolerance in response to the economic downturn in the late 2000s, which is reflected in the changes credit insurers have made to their underwriting guidelines. For example, it used to be the default position of credit insurers to offer coverage to a potential policyholder unless the credit insurer had negative information on that potential policyholder's debtors. But now it is the default position of credit insurers to NOT provide coverage to a potential policyholder unless the credit insurer has good information about that potential policyholder's debtors. Therefore, the responsibility of telling credit insurers why coverage should be provided is now on the policyholder or potential policyholder.","In many cases, to justify why coverage should be provided, the policyholder or potential policyholder must provide financial information to a credit insurer, such as Cash Flow Statements, Balance Sheets, and Income Statements for each debtor that coverage is needed. That is generally not a simple task because many debtors are private companies, from which it typically requires substantial time and effort to obtain financial information. In addition, when the debtors are foreign, those financial statements must also be translated to English, or U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) standards, to enable underwriters to make their decision whether to cover those debtors. Accordingly, policyholders and potential policyholders must now allocate significant time and resources to obtain credit insurance.","Even where a debtor is a public company or otherwise has readily accessible financial statements, there are still other challenges that require potential policyholders to allocate significant time and resources to obtain credit insurance. For example, credit insurers are now subject to more challenges for reinsuring their portfolios. In other words, many coverages that otherwise would have been previously granted are not being granted and, as a result, the capacity of credit insurers to provide certain coverages has been diminished. Accordingly, potential policyholders are often unable to obtain the total amount of desired coverage from a single credit insurer.","Payability of Credit Insurance Claims","Obtaining payment for a claim often presents a significant challenge in the credit insurance industry. As a result, a significant percentage of all claims submitted to the credit insurers are denied. According to some reports, almost 50% of submitted claims are initially denied by credit insurers. And most of those initial denials come as a surprise to the policyholder who is filing those claims. That is because of the complexity of most credit insurance policies.","In more detail, credit insurance policies typically include a plethora of terms and conditions with which a policyholder must comply to ensure that the policy is valid and any claims thereon are payable. For example, there are over fifteen pages of detailed descriptions in most credit insurance policies that set forth various terms and conditions that must be satisfied in order for the credit insurer to remain obligated to pay a claim. In other words, most credit insurance policies include over fifteen pages of reasons why a credit insurer will NOT be required to pay a policyholder's claim. And more often than not, those terms and conditions are not even known by the policyholder, which is why policyholders are often surprised to discover that their claims are not payable due to the failure to satisfy one or more of those terms and\/or conditions.","Even when a policyholder is aware of the plethora of terms and conditions that must be satisfied for a claim to be payable, the amount of time and resources required to properly comply with those terms and conditions is too great and, despite the policyholder's best efforts, they are still unable to satisfy those terms and conditions. For example, a condition that one of the largest and most well-respected credit insurers puts on their policyholders requires the filing and acceptance of accounts receivable over $10K that are past due 60 days or more for any named debtor, regardless of the upper limit of the credit insurance policy. In other words, if any amount over $10K is more than 60 days past due and has not been properly filed and recognized by the credit insurer, then the entire limit for that debtor is not eligible for a claims payment (i.e., the limit is cancelled). It is compliance issues such as those that prevent most policyholders from obtaining payment for their credit insurance claims. And as in most cases of compliance, that problem is exacerbated by the fact that the policyholder typically will not realize that it did not comply with a term and\/or condition until after it files its claim, at which point their coverage will have already been canceled and the claim therefore denied.","Credit Insurance Premium","Because there are often multiple credit insurance and credit protection solutions available to potential policyholders, it is often difficult to determine the availability and coverage of those products at the right prices. More specifically, finding the right availability and coverage at the optimum price is a manual process that requires a significant amount of work, which often does not get done due to time restrictions. Moreover, a manual attempt by a broker, or by a potential policyholder, often results in human error. Accordingly, potential policyholders often do not obtain the credit insurance programs that are the best for their needs.","The difficulty in finding the right availability and coverage at the best price is further exacerbated by the fact that the carriers and providers of credit insurance products are always changing the availability and rates for those products, with their ability and\/or willingness to take on certain debtors and their price tolerances changing on an almost daily basis. Moreover, the difficulty of manually sorting through the different credit insurance products offered by different carriers and providers means that those carriers and providers often do not have to compete for a policyholder's or potential policyholder's business. In other words, it is often too burdensome for a policyholder or potential policyholder to compare different credit insurance products to one another and make an educated guess as to which product to purchase. Accordingly, policyholders and potential policyholders rarely obtain a credit insurance policy that provides the maximum amount of coverage desired for the price that they are paying.","In view of the above problems with conventional credit insurance policies, and as will become more evident from the advantages of the present invention discussed below, there is a need in the art for an apparatus and method for digitally processing various terms and conditions and continuously monitoring a customer's compliance with those terms and conditions. More particularly, there is a need for an apparatus and method that enables potential policyholders to obtain a credit insurance policy with the maximum amount of coverage desired, the maximum payability of covered claims, and the maximum coverage available relative to the premium paid. And that apparatus and method preferably operate in real time so as to ensure that the credit insurance policy is optimized for the policyholder in an ongoing manner after it has obtained the desired credit insurance policy or policies.","Accordingly, it is an object of the invention to provide an apparatus and method for optimizing insurance policies. The apparatus and method include a processing device that is configured to import the various terms and conditions from one or more insurer systems and to import accounts receivable information from one or more customer systems, the processing device being in electronic data communication with the one or more insurer systems and the one or more customer systems via a network connection; a compliance module that is configured to instruct the processing device to import the various terms and conditions from the one or more insurer systems, to import the accounts receivable information from the one or more customer systems, to identify overdue accounts receivable and time periods for which those accounts receivable have been overdue, and to compare the terms and conditions to the time periods to determine if the customer is not in compliance with any of one of the various terms and conditions, and to generate an alert when the customer is not in compliance with any one of the various terms and conditions; and a graphical user interface in electronic data communication with the processing device that is configured to generate a graphical display that includes the overdue accounts receivable identified by the processing device.","According to another object of the present invention, the accounts receivable information corresponds to one or more of the customer's debtors, the various terms and conditions identify a deadline for filing a claim on the overdue accounts receivable for the one or more debtors, and the compliance module is further configured to instruct the processing device to electronically submit a claim to one or more insurers via the one or more insurer systems as the time period for the overdue accounts receivable for the one or more debtors covered by the one or more insurers comes within a predetermined number of days from the deadline for filing the claim.","And according to yet another object of the present invention, the accounts receivable information corresponds to one or more of the customer's debtors, the various terms and conditions identify a deadline for submitting a notification to one or more insurers that the one or more debtors have disputed an invoice and\/or entered protracted default, and the compliance module is further configured to instruct the processing device to electronically submit a notification to the one or more insurers via the one or more insurer systems as the time period for the overdue accounts receivable for the one or more debtors covered by the one or more insurers comes within a predefined time of the deadline for filing the notification.","Those and other objects, advantages, and features of the present invention will become more readily apparent by the following written description, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings and claims.","I. Introduction","The present invention overcomes the shortcomings of the prior art by providing a comprehensive platform designed to optimize customers' credit insurance policies. The present invention is designed to ensure that customers receive the full value out of their risk mitigation product. The apparatus and method of the present invention can be implemented at any point during the effective period of a risk mitigation product and immediately provides the critical functions required to enable a customer's risk mitigation product to be optimized. The apparatus and method of the present invention optimizes a customer's risk mitigation product or products by providing functionality for use in 1) obtaining the maximum amount of coverage desired, 2) ensuring the payability of covered claims, and 3) maximizing coverage available relative to the premium paid.","a. Maximizing Credit Insurance Coverage","The present invention allows a user to obtain the maximum amount of coverage required from various risk mitigation products by remediating various non-optimal coverage issues. For example, it automatically appeals any denials of coverage and\/or coverage cancellations that may take place. It electronically communicates with the computer systems of the risk mitigation product carriers, if available, to understand the root cause of why those denials and\/or cancellations occurred. And whether the reason provided from the carrier is a lack of information, country risk, industry risk, etc., the present invention automatically implements the proper appeals process to overturn that carrier's decision deny and\/or cancel coverage.","In many cases, the only way for a policyholder to overturn the decision of the risk mitigation product carrier is to prove to that carrier that the debtor in question is, in fact, worthy of coverage. That often requires obtaining financial statements for the debtors. Accordingly, the present provides a fully automated process for electronically obtaining financial statements from the appropriate sources. And in the event that a carrier denies, cancels, or reduces coverage due to lack of capacity, or due to the debtor not being financially sound, the present invention will automatically communicate with other carriers, such as those that specialize in high-risk debtors, to obtain credit insurance coverage for the debtor in question. By providing such easy and automated access to multiple carriers and their respective risk mitigation products, the present invention maximizes the coverage of those products by, for example, covering accounts receivable that are not able to be covered at all or in full by a policyholder's primary insurance carrier.","b. Maximizing Credit Insurance Claims Payability","The present invention maximizes the payability of risk mitigation products by fully automating compliance issues proactively so as to ensure a policyholder's compliance with the various terms and conditions of its respective risk mitigation products. By fully automating the process of complying with the rules and conditions of its risk mitigation product or products, the present invention is able to notify the policyholder at any point in time if it would be eligible to be paid for a claim on its accounts receivable and, if not, what term and\/or condition needs to be satisfied to obtain eligibility. Accordingly, the present invention works to ensure that a claim will be paid prior to those claims ever being filed.","To support that functionality, all the terms and conditions of various risk mitigation products are digitally processed and digitally processed into rules by the apparatus of the present invention, which are used to constantly monitor and measure whether a policyholder is in compliance with those terms and conditions. In the event that a debtor, or the policy in its entirety, is identified as being out of compliance with any term and\/or condition of one or more risk mitigation products, the present invention will immediately alert the policyholder and initiate various automated Actions that will place the debtor\/policyholder back in compliance with that term and\/or condition. Accordingly, the present invention proactively eliminates the occurrence of surprise denials of claim payments, enabling policyholders to be fully confident in the knowledge that their coverages are in place and providing the desired amount of protection.","c. Maximizing Coverage\/Premium Ratio","The present invention ensures that a policyholder has the proper amount of premium relative to the amount of coverage available (i.e., the best coverage\/premium ratio) at a given point in time in a given market. It does that by automating the otherwise time-consuming process of exploring various markets, carriers, and risk mitigation products. The present invention automates that process by automatically and continuously exploring all markets, carriers, and risk mitigation products so that, at any time a policyholder's coverage\/premium ratio is determined NOT to be optimized, it can alert the policyholder and make any adjustments required. That functionality is also implemented when a policyholder is looking for new risk mitigation products or is determining whether to renew an expiring credit insurance policy.","By automatically exploring all markets, carriers, and products, the present invention can understand as quickly as possible which carriers have what availability, as well as what combination of risk mitigation products from which carriers will provide the optimal coverage\/premium ratio. Without such automation, the process would be almost impossible due to the fact that there are so many different types of risk mitigation products and carriers, as well as the fact that they are constantly changing. As a result, what is available on one day may not be available the next day. Accordingly, the present invention locks down the best available structure and price for risk mitigation products as they become available by constantly monitoring those risk mitigation products and working to put the best solution together, whether it is from a single carrier or a combination of carriers. Such real-time optimization is unique to the present invention.","Those and other advantages provided by the present invention can be better understood from the description of the preferred embodiments below and in the accompanying drawings. In describing the preferred embodiments, specific terminology is resorted to for the sake of clarity. However, the present invention is not intended to be limited to the specific terminology so selected, and it is to be understood that each specific term includes all technical equivalents that operate in a similar manner to accomplish a similar purpose. For example, the terms \u201ccredit insurance policy\u201d and \u201ccredit insurer\u201d are used below not only to refer to credit insurance policies and the carriers of those policies, but also to refer to all other comparable risk management products and the carriers of those products.","II. Apparatus for Optimizing Credit Insurance Policies","The invention can be implemented by a computer having a processor to perform various functions and operations in accordance with the invention. The computer can be, for example, a personal computer (PC), server, or mainframe computer. In addition to the processor, the computer hardware may include one or more of a wide variety of components or subsystems including, for example, a co-processor, input devices, monitors, and a memory or storage device, such as a database. All or parts of the system and processes can be implemented at the processor by software or other machine executable instructions that are stored on or read from computer-readable media for performing the processes described. Unless indicated otherwise, those processes are preferably implemented automatically by the processor in real time without delay. Computer-readable media may include, for example, hard disks, floppy disks, DVDs, memory sticks. CD-ROMs, downloadable files, read-only memory (ROM), or random-access memory (RAM).","Turning to the drawings,  is a schematic diagram illustrating a system  for optimizing credit insurance policies according to a non-limiting embodiment of the present invention. The system  includes one or more applications servers  and one or more database servers  for digitally processing various terms and conditions and continuously monitoring a customer's compliance with those terms and conditions, one or more user interfaces  for receiving input from a user and generating graphical displays, and one or more external computer systems -. The one or more applications servers , one or more database servers , one or more user interfaces , and one or more external systems - are in electronic data communication with each other via any suitable network connection (e.g., ethernet connection, Digital Subscriber Line (DSL), telephone line, coaxial cable, etc.) so as that the system  forms a communications network (e.g., Local Area Network (LAN), Wide Area Network (WAN), Virtual Private Network (VPN), etc.). That communications network is preferably formed by secured network connections so as to protect the system  from unauthorized access.","At least one applications server , at least one database server , and at least one user interface  provide the primary functionality of the present invention via a multi-tiered architecture. The applications server  includes a processing device that receives instructions from different modules for performing various automated processes and it operates as the business logic tier, or middle tier, by coordinating the applications, process commands, and logical decisions and evaluations that provide the functionality of the present invention. The applications server  also moves and processes data between the database server  and the user interface based on those instructions. The database server  also includes a processing device that receives instructions from different modules for performing various automated processes and it operates as the data tier, or lower tier, by utilizing a database computer language (e.g., Structured Query Language (SQL), Extensible Markup Language (XML), etc.) to store and retrieve the data required to provide the functionality of the present invention in a relational database management system (RDBMS). And the user interface  operates as the presentation tier, or upper tier, by providing a graphical user interface that translates tasks and results into information a user can understand, such as by providing that information in a graphical display. The user interface  also provides a mechanism for a user to manually input data into the applications server  and database server . That multi-tiered architecture improves scalability and supports cost-efficient application building. And although a separate database server  is described as operating the data tier, it should be understood that the applications server  may operate the data tier instead of the database server  without departing from the spirit of the invention.","The applications server  is integrated or interfaced with the various external systems - to facilitate the exchange of data between the applications server  and those external systems -. Preferably, the applications server  is integrated with the Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) of those external systems - so that they may seamlessly exchange data using automated processes. For example, the applications server  may use an automated process to identify and import various terms and conditions directly from credit insurance policy documents stored on a credit insurer system  and digitally process them into rules that will be used to trigger Actions (e.g., alerts, reminders, automated processes, etc.) that will ensure a policyholder complies with those terms and conditions. And the applications server  may also use an automated process to import and digitally process specific debtor's accounts receivable information from a customer's AR system  and to import and digitally process financial data about that specific debtor from an institutional system  (e.g., a financial statement document system, a trade reference document system, a bank reference document system, a credit report document system, etc.) to determine when to trigger those Actions. In addition to or as an alternative to those automated processes, a user may also retrieve data from those external systems - via manual access techniques (e.g., browsing web pages and downloading data, browsing web pages and\/or electronic documents and cutting and pasting data, etc.).","The functionality of the present invention is preferably provided using web-based applications. In that way, a user (e.g., a customer, broker, account manager, administrator, etc.) can access the functionality of the present invention via a user interface  (e.g., personal computer, laptop computer, personal digital assistant (PDA), smart phone, etc.) using industry standard web browsers (e.g., the CHROME brand web browser from Google, Inc., the FIREFOX brand web browser from the Mozilla Foundation, the INTERNET EXPLORER brand web browser from the Microsoft Corporation, etc.). Preferably, the functionality of the present invention is accessed via a user interface  using a secure communication protocol (e.g., Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS), Internet Protocol Security (IPsec), Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS), Secure Socket Tunneling Protocol (SSTP), etc.) so as to protect the applications server  and database server  from unauthorized access.","As discussed in more detail under separate headings below, the functionality of the present invention is provided by three separate software modules that work together to help customers, or brokers on behalf of their customers, obtain the desired amount of credit insurance coverage, maintain the payability of covered claims, and obtain the maximum coverage available relative to the premium paid. A Marketplace Module provides functionality for customers review and analyze debtors, policies, and markets when choosing credit insurance policies. A Goal\/Compliance Module provides functionality for automating the ongoing processes required to ensure customers' credit insurance policies are meeting their goals and to ensure that the customers remain in compliance with those credit insurance policies. And a Brokerage Module provides functionality for brokers, account managers, or other organizations to access, manage, and evaluate multiple customers' credit insurance policies. But, while those three software modules are described as having their own separate functionality, those descriptions are of preferred embodiments. Accordingly, it should be understood that the functionality in those three software modules may also be provided in any number of software modules and\/or shared between any of number of software modules without departing from the spirit of the present invention.","III. Marketplace Module","The Marketplace Module provides functionality for a user (e.g., a customer, broker, account manager, administrator, etc.) to compare a current credit insurance policy or policies against market information to determine if that policy is optimized for that user's specific needs and\/or desires. More specifically, it enables a user to determine whether its current credit insurance policy provides the highest level of coverage for the lowest costs. Based on that determination, the user can cancel its existing policy and rewrite it as required to reduce costs and\/or increase coverage. Or when renewing an expiring credit insurance policy or obtaining a new one, the user can identify which credit insurance product from which credit insurer will offer the highest level of coverage for the lowest costs. Accordingly, a user can utilize the functionality of the Marketplace Module at any point it is determined that a specific credit insurance policy is not satisfying a customer's needs and\/or desires with respect to structure, price, and\/or coverage.","For identifying which credit insurance product from which credit insurer will offer the highest level of coverage for the lowest costs for a specific customer, the Marketplace Module provides Debtor Analysis Functionality, Policy Analysis Functionality, and Market Analysis Functionality. The Debtor Analysis Functionality enables the user to determine the insurability of specific debtors; the Market Analysis Functionality enables the user to view the performance trends over time for credit insurance products from a specific credit insurer or within an entire market; and the Policy Analysis Functionality enables the user to compare aggregates for one credit insurer's product to those of other credit insurers or to the entire market. The Marketplace Module also includes Quote Summary Functionality for viewing the responses to requests for quotes from various credit insurers. But, while that functionality is described as being provided in the Marketplace Module, that description is of a preferred embodiment. Accordingly, it should be understood that the functionality in the Marketplace Module may also be provided in any other software modules and\/or shared between any of number of software modules without departing from the spirit of the present invention.","a. Debtor Analysis Functionality","The Debtor Analysis Functionality aggregates data from various sources and data objects to determine the insurability of one or more debtors. For example, the applications server  can import and digitally process debtor coverage and decision data for specific debtors from credit insurer systems , import and digitally process accounts receivable data for specific debtors from customers' AR systems , and import and digitally process financial statements from financial statement document systems  (e.g., the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval (EDGAR) System, the System for Electronic Documentation Analysis and Retrieval (SEDAR), etc.). That data can be imported from those external systems - as part of any process previously performed by the present invention's other functionality (e.g., Quote Summary Functionality, Coverage Goal Functionality, Compliance Monitoring Functionality, etc.) and aggregated by the database server  as historical information for subsequent use by the Debtor Analysis Functionality. Accordingly, that data can be retrieved from the database server  based on different time periods, such as the preceding three months or the preceding forty-eight months. In the alternative, a customer can send (e.g., e-mail a file, ground mail a memory device, etc) all or some of that data to an administrator for importing into the applications server  and\/or a user (e.g., a customer, broker, account manager, administrator, etc.) can input all or some of that data into the applications server  via a user interface  using a manual input process (e.g., scanning a document, typing on a keyboard, dictating into voice recognition software, etc.).","The coverage and decision data is retrieved for all the credit insurance products and all the credit insurers from which customers have sought coverage for a debtor. It identifies the total number of requests for coverage of specific debtors; the total number of approvals and partial approvals of those requests, including the decision amounts for each; and the total number of rejections and denials of those requests, including the reasons for each. The accounts receivable data is retrieved for all of the customers with accounts receivable for a specific debtor. It identifies the total number of suppliers that debtor has purchased from, the total number customers that the debtor paid on time or late, the total amounts paid on time or late, and the total number of late payments made within 30 days, 60 days, 90 days, or greater than 90 days of their due date. And the financial statements are retrieved for each debtor and include balance sheets, cash flow statements, income statements, and credit reports.","As  illustrates, the Debtor Analysis Functionality of the present invention analyzes all of that data and provides it to a user as a graphical display, or Debtor Analysis Report , at a user interface . More specifically, the applications server  averages the coverage and decision data and displays the corresponding information in a Coverage Decision History window ; calculates the associated percentages from accounts receivable data and displays them in an Accounts Payable Summary window ; and calculates standard financial ratios (e.g., Current Ratio, Quick Ratio, Debt to Equity Ratio, and Debt to Net Worth Ratio) and values (e.g., Net Worth and Net Income) from the financial statements and displays them in a Financial Summary window . The Financial Summary window  also displays the different types of financial statements (e.g., Balance Sheets, Cash Flow Statements, Income Statements, Credit Reports, etc.) that were utilized to calculate those standard financial ratios and values and that are available and required to submit to obtain coverage for a debtor. Using all of that data as a guide, a user can determine the insurability of specific debtors.","For example, the Coverage Decision History window  of  illustrates that, of three requests for $250,000 of coverage for Debtor A (one from insurer A and two from Insurer C), only one was approved (the 11\/26\/20 request from Insurer C). Moreover, the one request that was approved was only approved for $175,000. Accordingly, the Coverage Decision History window  graphically illustrates that Debtor A demonstrates a 33% partial approval rate (one in three requests for coverage resulted in a partial approval), a 67% denial rate (two in three requests were denied), an average approved coverage value of $58,333 ($175,000\/3), and an average denied coverage value of $191,667 ([(3\u00d7$250,000)\u2212$175,000]\/3). Accordingly, Debtor A is more than likely not insurable for values much larger than $175,000.","The Accounts Payable Summary window  and Financial Summary window  help explain why Debtor A is not as insurable as a customer might desire. For example, although Debtor A only made 12% (e.g., 12 of 100 payments) of its payments late, the value associated with that 12% of late payments made up 27% of the total value owed by Debtor A. Moreover, the Current Ratio and Debt\/Net Worth Ratio calculated for Debtor A indicate that it may not have sufficient liquidity. Accordingly, the Accounts Payable Summary window  and Financial Summary window  give a representative picture of why credit insurers have not been willing to cover Debtor A for values much larger than $175,000.","b. Market Analysis Functionality","The Market Analysis Functionality utilizes premium, deductible, and coverage data for various credit insurers and credit insurance policies to determine which credit insurer and credit insurance policy will most likely be able to satisfy a customer's credit insurance Coverage Goals (e.g., good coverage\/premium ratio and low deductible) over the full effective period of desired coverage. The applications server  can import that data from credit insurer systems  as part of an automated process performed by the Market Analysis Functionality or as part of any process previously performed by the present invention's other functionality (e.g., Quote Summary Functionality, Coverage Goal Functionality, Compliance Monitoring Functionality, etc.), as discussed above. That data is aggregated by the database server  as historical information for subsequent use by the Market Analysis Functionality. Accordingly, that data can be retrieved from the database server  based on different time periods. In the alternative, a customer can send (e.g., e-mail a file, ground mail a memory device, etc.) all or some of that data to an administrator for importing into the applications server  and\/or a user (e.g., a customer, broker, account manager, administrator, etc.) can input all or some of that data into the applications server  via a user interface  using a manual input process (e.g., scanning a document, typing on a keyboard, dictating into voice recognition software, etc).","Instead of analyzing data for specific debtors, as discussed above with respect to the Debtor Analysis Functionality, the Market Analysis Functionality analyzes the trends of specific credit insurers and\/or their respective credit insurance products within a specific market, such as a specific industry (e.g., an industry defined by Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes, North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), etc.), region (e.g., North America, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA); South America; etc.), country (e.g., United States, Canada, United Kingdom, etc.), or revenue range (e.g., $5M\/year, $500,000\/year, etc.). More specifically, the Market Analysis Functionality identifies the trends over time of how premiums change, how premiums plus deductibles change, and how the percentage of requested coverage being approved changes within a specific market. And the premiums, deductibles, and coverage percentages that are used to identify those changes correspond to the specific type of credit insurance coverage a customer desires, which a user can define by inputting certain criteria as Coverage Goals into the applications server  via a user interface . A user can also identify the specific market for which it would like to obtain those values by inputting that criteria into the applications server  via a user interface  (e.g., inputting SIC codes, regions, countries, revenue ranges, periods of time, etc.). Some of those criteria may be input as a customer's Coverage Goals, as discussed in more detail below with respect to the Quote Summary Functionality and Coverage Goal Functionality of the present invention.","The Market Analysis Functionality also utilizes the changes in the percentage of requested coverage being approved over time to assign a coverage stability score to a credit insurer and\/or credit insurance product within a specific market. That score provides a measure of whether the percentage of requested coverage for debtors that is actually approved by credit insurers is increasing or decreasing within a specific market over the effective period of the policy. In other words, it demonstrates whether credit insurers have tended to increase, reduce, or cancel the percentage of coverage provided for debtors over the relevant effective periods of their respective credit insurance policies. And the manner in which credit insurers increase, reduce, or cancel coverage determines the effectiveness and costs of those policies. Accordingly, together with the premiums and deductibles for a credit insurer, the coverage stability score can be used to predict not only the likelihood that a credit insurer will reduce or cancel coverage during the effective period of a credit insurance policy, but also to predict the likelihood that a credit insurance policy provided by the credit insurer will become less effective, provide less value and\/or become more costly during that effective period.","As  illustrates, the Market Analysis Functionality of the present invention analyzes all of that data and provides it to a user as a graphical display, or Credit Insurer Market Analysis , at a user interface . More specifically, the applications server  plots the values of premium rates, premium plus deductible rates, percentage of coverage, and coverage stability score over a designated period of time. Those values are plotted in a Premium Rates chart , Premium Plus Deductible Rates chart , Percentage of Coverage chart , and Coverage Stability Score chart , respectively.","The premium rates and premium plus deductible rates are plotted as a basis point (bp) value that represents a percentage of the policyholders' sales (e.g., 0.01%); the percentages of coverage are plotted as a percentage of credit limits authorized versus those requested for debtors; and the coverage stability scores are plotted as scores on a scale of 200 to 900. And although only one credit insurer is illustrated in , data for multiple credit insurers may also be plotted to provide side-by-side comparisons between those credit insurers. Using all of that data as a guide, a user can determine the likelihood that one or more credit insurers and\/or credit insurance products will satisfy a customer's credit insurance Coverage Goals over the full effective period of desired coverage as well as which credit insurer will provide the optimum amount of credit insurance during that period.","For example,  illustrates the trend of premium rates, premium plus deductible rates, percentages of coverage, and coverage stability scores over a twelve month time period for a single credit insurer within a specific market. The premium rates and premium plus deducible rates for Insurer C have decreased over the last twelve months; the percentages of coverage approved by Insurer C have shown a steady increase starting in May; and overall coverage stability score for Insurer C have remained constant and close to the maximum level. Accordingly, Insurer C is likely to satisfy the customer's credit insurance Coverage Goals over a twelve month effective period of coverage.","c. Policy Analysis Functionality","The Policy Analysis Functionality of the present invention utilizes the information from a customer's current credit insurance policy or from a quote for a new or renewed credit insurance policy to provide a comparison of that credit insurance policy to the average values of premium rates, premium plus deductible rates, percentages of coverage, and coverage stability scores determined by the Market Analysis Functionality. The applications server  can import that data from credit insurer systems  as part of an automated process performed by the Market Analysis Functionality or as part of any process previously performed by the present invention's other functionality (e.g., Quote Summary Functionality, Coverage Goal Functionality, Compliance Monitoring Functionality, etc.). That data is aggregated by the database server  as historical information for subsequent use by the Market Analysis Functionality. Accordingly, that data can be retrieved from the database server  based on different time periods. In the alternative, a customer can send (e.g., e-mail a file, ground mail a memory device, etc) all or some of that data to an administrator for importing into the applications server  and\/or a user (e.g., a customer, broker, account manager, administrator, etc.) can input all or some of that data into the applications server  via a user interface  using a manual input process (e.g., scanning a document, typing on a keyboard, dictating into voice recognition software, etc.).","Instead of analyzing data for specific credit insurers and\/or their respective credit insurance products over time in a specific market (e.g., industry, region, country, or revenue range), as discussed above with respect to the Market Analysis Functionality, the Policy Analysis Functionality compares a customer's current policy or a quote for a new or renewed credit insurance policy to credit insurance policies of another credit insurer or to an entire market. More specifically, the Policy Analysis Functionality compares the customer's current policy or a quote for a new or renewed credit insurance policy to credit insurance policies provided by another credit insurer or to an entire market based on the average values of premium rates, premium plus deductible rates, percentages of coverage, and coverage stability scores that are determined by the Market Analysis Functionality.","As  illustrates, the Policy Analysis Functionality of the present invention provides that data to a user as a graphical display, or Policy Report , at a user interface . More specifically, the applications server  displays the average values of premium rates, premium plus deductible rates, percentage of coverage, and coverage stability score for a specific market or credit insurer side-by-side with the corresponding values for a customer's current credit insurance policy. Those values are plotted in a Premium Rates bar chart , Premium Plus Deductible Rates bar chart , Percentage of Coverage bar chart , and Coverage Stability Score bar chart , respectively.","The premium rates and premium plus deductible rates are plotted as a basis point (bp) value that represents a percentage of the policyholders' sales (e.g., 0.01%); the percentages of coverage are plotted as a percentage of credit limits authorized versus those requested for debtors; and the coverage stability scores are plotted as scores on a scale of 200 to 900. Using all of that data as a guide, as user can determine how its current credit insurance policy compares to those of a specific credit insurer or those within a specific market.","For example,  illustrates a comparison of a customer's current credit insurance policy versus those of Insurer C. The customer's current credit insurance policy has higher premiums and deductibles than those of Insurer C, but the customer's current credit insurance policy provides significantly more coverage than those of insurer C. And because the indicated values provide a direct comparison (i.e., the two Premium Rates are determined using the same basis point and the two Percentages of Coverage are determined using the same requested amount), they can be used to determine the coverage\/premium ratio (Percentage of Coverage\/Premium Rates=Coverage\/Premium Ratio) for the customer's current credit insurance policy (68.75\/26.47=2.60) and those of Insurer C (60.00\/25.00=2.40), which reveals that the customer's current credit insurance policy has a better coverage\/premium ratio than those of Insurer C. Moreover, the customer's current credit insurance policy is also more stable than those of Insurer C. Accordingly,  indicates that the customer's current credit insurance policy meets the customer's Coverage Goals better than those of Insurer C.","The Policy Analysis Functionality of the present invention also utilizes the average values of premium rates and premium plus deductible rates that are determined by the Market Analysis Functionality and assign a customer's current credit insurance policy a competiveness score within a specific market based on how the customer's current credit insurance policy compares to those averages within that specific market.","As  illustrates, that data is provided to a user as a graphical display, or Competitiveness Report , at a user interface  so the user can see how a customer's current credit insurance policy is structured within a specific market. A score between 0 and 3 indicates that the customer's current credit insurance policy has a much higher premium than the rest of the market; a score between 3 and 7 indicates an average pricing structure; and a score between 7 and 10 indicates a superior pricing structure. And the customer's policy competitiveness score is indicated by a needle  that points to that score on a color-coded, semi-circular score meter , wherein had scores (1-3) appear within a red portion of the score meter , average scores (3-7) appear within a yellow portion of the score meter , and good scores appear within a green portion of the score meter .","d. Quote Summary Functionality","Based on the information provided by the above functionality, a customer may decide to rewrite its current credit insurance policy, renew an expiring credit insurance policy, or obtain a new credit insurance policy. But because premium rates fluctuate regularly, that information does not necessarily reflect credit insurer's current risk tolerance, which may change on a day-to-day basis. Accordingly, the customer can request quotes from different credit insurers to determine whether rewriting, renewing, or obtaining a new credit insurance policy will actually better meet its credit insurance requirements.","Desired credit insurance policy structure information may be input as part of a registration processes, or transition process, during which a customer and\/or its credit insurance policy or polices are introduced into, or registered with, the system  of the present invention. If the customer is introduced into the system  without a current credit insurance policy, those credit insurance requirements can be used to identify a new credit insurance policy. If the customer is introduced into the system  with one or more current credit insurance policies, those credit insurance requirements can be used to rewrite that credit insurance policy. And if the customer and its credit insurance policy are already in the system , those credit insurance requirements can be used to either rewrite its current credit insurance policy or to renew that policy or replace it with a new one when its effective period expires.","A user (e.g., a customer, broker, account manager, administrator, etc) can input the customer's credit insurance policy structure information into the applications server  via a user interface . For example, the customer can input the following credit insurance policy structure information:\n\n","After a user has input the customer's credit insurance requirements into the applications server , the applications server  electronically submits requests for quotes to the credit insurer systems  of various credit insurers based on those credit insurance requirements. When inputting those credit insurance requirements, the user can also identify the specific credit insurers from which it wants to request quotes. Both the specific credit insurers identified and the credit insurance requirements can be guided by the information provided by the Debtor Analysis Functionality, Market Analysis Functionality, and Policy Analysis Functionality. In other words, the user can narrow down which credit insurers it would like quotes from based on how credit insurance policies from those credit insurers compared to the customer's current credit insurance policy. And the user can tailor the customer's credit insurance requirements based on the amounts, rates, percentages, etc. of coverage that those credit insurers have demonstrated a likelihood of approving. As a result, the user can greatly improve its chances of obtaining approvals and quotes.","As  illustrates, the Quote Summary Functionality of the present invention provides the solicited credit insurer's quotes to a user as a graphical display, or Quote Comparison Report , at a user interface . The user can specify which credit insurers  from which it would like to solicit quotes in a \u201cclosed\u201d quote solicitation process, the user can solicit quotes more generally from all of the credit insurers  that are registered with the system  and that have chosen to participate in an \u201copen\u201d quote solicitation process. Regardless of whether the user uses the closed or open process, the credit insurers  that choose to respond to those solicitations will input data detailing the structure and coverage  they are willing to offer. Where no structure and coverage  information is provided for a credit insurer (e.g., Insurer E), that credit insurer either did not approve a policy that fell within the customer's credit insurance requirements, or it simply chose not respond to the request for a quote.","After reviewing the quotes provided, an account manager or broker can use a user interface  to input its comments and recommendations  for each quote. Those comments and recommendations  will also be provided for viewing in the graphical display. A customer can then leverage all of that information to make an informed decision as to which credit insurer to award its credit insurance policy.","IV. Goal\/Compliance Module","The Goal\/Compliance Module provides functionality for a user (e.g., a customer, broker, account manager, administrator, etc.) to quantify a customer's Coverage Goals in terms of the level of coverage provided to its debtors, risk mitigation, and costs. The Goal\/Compliance Module also provides functionality for monitoring the customer's current credit insurance policy or policies, as well as all other available credit insurance policies, and to determine whether that customer's Coverage Goals are being met in the best way available. If one or more of those Coverage Goals is not being met, the applications server  will automatically move through a series of automated steps, or Milestones, to bring the customer's coverage back within those Coverage Goals with little or no input required from the user. Or the applications server  will initiate automated Actions that will guide the user through a series of Milestones in which the user performs various process steps (e.g., selecting a \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d option, importing a document or file, inputting text with a keyboard, etc.) to complete those Milestones and bring the customer's coverage back within those Coverage Goals. Either of those processes may be initiated in response to an Alert that is sent to the user requesting authorization to take the appropriate Action.","In addition to providing functionality that ensures a customer's coverage remains within its Coverage Goals, the Goal\/Compliance Module also provides functionality that ensures that all the customer's credit insurance policies are, in fact, providing the amount of coverage set forth in those credit insurance policies by monitoring all the terms and conditions in those credit insurance policies that must be complied with to enforce that coverage. And when the customer is not in compliance with any of those terms and conditions, the applications server  will automatically move through a series of automated Milestones or guide the user through a series of process steps to bring the customer back in compliance with those terms and conditions, just as when a customer's Coverage Goals are not being met. Also as when a customer's Coverage Goals are not being met, either of those processes may be initiated in response to an Alert that is sent to the user requesting authorization to take the appropriate Action.","For ensuring that a customer's Coverage Goals are being met and that the customer is in compliance with the terms and conditions of each of its credit insurance policies, the Goal\/Compliance Module includes Coverage Goal Functionality and Compliance Monitoring Functionality. The Goal\/Compliance Module also includes Claim Filing Functionality for automatically filing claims on those credit insurance policies as the claims arise and Overdues Notification Functionality for automatically generate Past Due Reports and Notifications of Overdues to ensure the payability of such claims. And the Goal\/Compliance Module includes Dashboard Functionality and Executive Summary Functionality for providing a user with an overview not only of how well the customer is meeting its Coverage Goals and how well the customer is complying with the terms and conditions of its credit insurance policy or policies, but also to provide the user with an overview of the state\/status of various other processes for managing that customer, its credit insurance policy or policies, and the various aspects of those policies. That functionality works in conjunction with the functionality of the Marketplace Module to help ensure that customers' credit insurance policies are optimized at all times by alerting customers of non-optimal coverage issues, such as a cancellation or reduction of coverage, and automating the processes required to remediate those issues. But while that functionality is described as being provided in the Goal\/Compliance Module, that description is of a preferred embodiment. Accordingly, it should be understood that the functionality in the Goal\/Compliance Module may also be provided in any other software modules and\/or shared between any of number of software modules without departing from the spirit of the present invention.","a.

AR Range\u2014Defines the range of values from the customer's most recent accounts receivable for which debtors will be included in determining whether that customer's credit insurance policy or policies are meeting that customer's Coverage Goals (e.g., include all debtors with accounts receivable over $25,000 in analyzing the customer's Coverage Goals); and","8. Geographic Area\u2014Defines the specific geographic area from which debtors will be included in determining whether that customer's credit insurance policy or policies are meeting that customer's Coverage Goals (e.g., include all debtors in the same continent, country, etc. in analyzing the customer's Coverage Goals).\n\nThe first three Coverage Goals are the primary Coverage Goals, which can be further refined with the subsequently listed Coverage Goals. And although eight total Coverage Goals are listed as examples, a user can define an unlimited number of Coverage Goals, or even a single Coverage Goal, as required to suit a specific customer's needs and\/or desires. Those Coverage Goals can be met by multiple credit insurance policies whereas the credit insurance requirements discussed above with respect to the Quote Summary Functionality must be met by the specific credit insurance policy for which a quote is being sought. Accordingly, the Coverage Goal Functionality further allows a customer to define different Coverage Goals that must be met by different credit insurance policies and\/or to define Coverage Goals that can be met by a combination or all of its credit insurance policies.\n"]}}}},"As discussed above, the step  of inputting a customer's Coverage Goals preferably occurs as part of a transition processes during which a customer and\/or its credit insurance policy or polices are introduced into, or registered with, the system  of the present invention. In that way, as soon as a customer is registered with the system , the applications server  can being monitoring those Coverage Goals in an ongoing manner to ensure that the customer's coverage stays within those Coverage Goals. To determine if a customer's coverage falls within or outside of those Coverage Goals, in addition to any other coverage requirements, the applications server  imports and digitally processes data from various credit insurer systems  at step  and imports and digitally processes data from the customer's AR system  at step .","At step , the applications server  imports and digitally processes the customer's current coverage information from the credit insurer systems  of credit insurers currently providing credit insurance to the customer at step . The applications server  imports that information from those credit insurer systems  in electronic form, if available, via its network connection with those credit insurer systems , preferably by extracting it in tabular form (e.g., as a MICROSOFT EXCEL brand spreadsheet, Extensible Markup Language (XML) table, etc.). In the alternative, a customer can send (e.g., e-mail a file, ground mail a memory device, etc.) that information to an administrator for importing into the applications server  and\/or a user (e.g., a customer, broker, account manager, administrator, etc.) can input that information into the applications server  via a user interface  using a manual input process (e.g., scanning a document, typing on a keyboard, dictating into voice recognition software, etc.). All of that information is then stored in a relational database by the database server .","The current coverage information identifies the various attributes of the customer's current credit insurance policy or policies, including premiums, deductibles, coverage, etc. Because a credit insurer may take an action that changes the coverage of the customer's current credit insurance policy at any time (e.g., cancellation), the applications server preferably imports, digitally processes, and updates that information one or more times a day. Step  may also occur as part of a transition process during which a customer and\/or its credit insurance policy or polices are introduced into, or registered with, the system  of the present invention. And it may also occur as part of rewriting a current credit insurance policy, renewing an expiring credit insurance policy, or obtaining a new credit insurance policy, as discussed above with respect to the Quote Summary Functionality.","At step , the applications server  imports and digitally processes an AR Aging Report from the customer's AR system , typically on a monthly basis. The applications server  imports that information from the customer's AR system  in a similar manner to that described above with respect to step . In the alternative, a customer can send (e.g., e-mail a file, ground mail a memory device, etc.) that information to an administrator for importing into the applications server  and\/or a user (e.g., a customer, broker, account manager, administrator, etc.) can input that information into the applications server  via a user interface  using a manual input process (e.g., scanning a document, typing on a keyboard, dictating into voice recognition software, etc.). That information is then stored in the relational database by the database server .","The AR Aging Report lists all of the customer's debtors and their respective outstanding accounts receivable at a specific moment in time, typically at the end of each month. That information is used to identify which debtors are covered by which credit insurance policies, if any, and to determine whether those debtors are in compliance with the terms and conditions of their respective credit insurance policies. Because those AR Aging Reports are typically updated from month-to-month, the applications server  preferably imports them from the customer's AR system  on a monthly basis. The applications server  may also import those AR Aging Reports more frequently, as required to identify any change in the debtors or debtors accounts receivable that need to be covered by a credit insurance policy to meet the customer's Coverage Goals. For example, the applications server  may import AR Aging Reports on a daily basis to identify whether the customer has taken on any new debtors that need to be covered, or the applications server  can import AR Aging Reports in response to any one of those reports being updated.","At step , the applications server  identifies any non-optimal coverage issues, such as insufficient account coverage, and automatically generates Alerts in real-time using the Coverage Goals input at step , the current coverage information and potential coverage information imported and digitally processed at steps , and the AR Aging Report imported and digitally processed at step . More specifically, the applications server  compares the Coverage Goals to the current coverage information and the AR Aging Report and determines whether the customer's current coverage satisfies those Coverage Goals for the debtors identified in the AR Aging Report. In other words, the applications server  measures all of the customer's combined coverages\/protections (e.g., an insurance policy and an excess insurance policy) and determines whether the customer's Coverage Goals are being met by its current credit insurance policies. And if those Coverage Goals are not being met by the customer's credit insurance policies, the applications server  will generate an Alert that identifies any Coverage Goal that is not being met, any debtor for which that Coverage Goal is not being met, and the reason that Coverage Goal is not being met.","The applications server  determines the reason that a Coverage Goal is not being met based on a number of factors and data integration points. For example, because the applications server  is able to import and digitally process current coverage information from the credit insurer systems  of credit insurers currently providing credit insurance to the customer, the applications server  also is able to determine if the Coverage Goal is not being met as a result of an action taken by the credit insurer, such as a cancellation of coverage, denial of coverage, or failure to obtain coverage. And if the applications server  determines that the Coverage Goal is not being net as a result of an action taken by the credit insurer, the applications server  is able to extract the specific reason code for that action from the corresponding credit insurer system  (e.g., \u201ccancellation\u201d due to \u201clack of information\u201d, \u201cdenial\u201d due to \u201cbad sector\u201d, etc.). The applications server  can thereby generate an Alert to notify the customer of a credit insurer's action and the reason for that action as soon as it occurs.","In addition to identifying Coverage Goals that are not being met, debtors for which Coverage Goals are not being met, and the reasons that those Coverage Goals are not being met, the applications server  automates the processes required to satisfy those Coverage Goals based on the market, carrier, and product information imported and digitally processed at step . Those processes include submitting requests for an increase in the coverage provided by the customer's current credit insurance policy or policies and\/or obtaining new credit insurance policies using the functionality of the Marketplace Module. As discussed above, the functionality of the Marketplace Module also provides a comparison of the customer's current credit insurance policy or policies to other credit insurance policies in the same marketplace so the customer can quickly and easily identify any other credit insurers and\/or credit insurance policies that will help that customer meet its Coverage Goals, such as by rewriting, replacing, and\/or supplementing that customer's current credit insurance policy or policies.","In other words, the applications server  will automatically review the customer's current coverage information and identify the Actions that need to be taken to get the customer's current credit insurance policy or policies to satisfy the customer's Coverage Goals, such as rewriting those policies to obtain new or additional coverage. The applications server  will automatically review the potential coverage information from various credit insurers gathered by the Marketplace Module and identify any additional amount of coverage and\/or new credit insurance policy or policies that will enable the customer to meet its Coverage Goals. And the applications server  will even recommend new credit insurance policies based on the information generated by the Marketplace Module, such as a potential credit insurer's stability score. In that way, the Coverage Goal Functionality can work in conjunction with the functionality of the Marketplace Module to help a customer meet its Coverage Goals.","For example, if the applications server  determines that a specific debtor cannot be sufficiently covered or is not covered by the customer's current credit insurance policy or policies, it will identify any credit insurance policies that are available to cover the debtor in question (e.g., credit insurance policies provided by credit insurers specializing in high-risk debtors). In addition or in the alternative, the applications server  will determine the steps that can be taken to bring that debtor within the coverage of the customer's current credit insurance policy or policies (e.g., submitting financial statements to the credit insurer). In that way, the Alert will provide options and\/or outline the process that needs to be implemented to bring the customer's coverage within the customer's Coverage Goals.","At step , the customer is notified of the Alert via a user-specific method of communication (e.g., e-mail, Short Message Service (SMS) text message, Instant Messaging (IM) text message, telephone call, etc.) The customer can select that user-specific method of communication, along with various other personal settings (e.g., passwords, account information, etc.), by accessing the applications server  with a user interface  and inputting the pertinent data (e.g., postal address, e-mail address, cellular telephone number, etc.) in a similar manner to that described with respect to step . If the customer elects to be contact via telephone call, it may be contacted by the applications server  using Interactive Voice Response (IVR) technology or by the user assisting them with their policy (e.g., a broker or an account manager). The customer can also select the type of Alerts it would like to receive, which may include electing not to receive certain Alerts.","Regardless of the method of communication selected, the customer will initially be presented with two options for responding any Alert it receives: 1) handle the Alert or 2) ignore the Alert. For example, the customer may receive the following Alert via e-mail:\n\n","As  illustrates, the Alert may include a copy of or a link to a graphical display, or Gap Report , that identifies any holes in the customer's coverage. More specifically, the Gap Report  identifies any debtors  who are not covered by the customer's current credit insurance policy or policies in accordance with that customer's Coverage Goals as well as the specific Coverage Goals  (e.g., Percentage of Debtors, AR Range, Coverage Type, Region, and Country) that are not being met by those debtors . Where applicable, the Gap Report may also identify the percentage of actual coverage provided  for those debtors  as compared to the percentage of desired coverage  for those debtors. Using that data as a guide, a user can determine how well a customer's Coverage Goals are being met and the reasons why any Coverage Goals are not being met.","For example, the Gap Report  of  lists the five debtors  that are not meeting the customer's Coverage Goals , which include providing 100% coverage to all debtors in all geographic areas for all AR ranges. The Gap Report  of  also lists the most recent outstanding accounts receivable amounts , the requested coverage amounts , and the actual coverage amounts  for each of those debtors  as well as coverage notes  that provide reason why Coverage Goals  are not being met. Accordingly, a user can tell from Figure that three debtors  (i.e., Debtor A, Debtor B, and Debtor D) are not meeting the customer's Coverage Goals  because their most recent outstanding accounts receivable amounts  are greater than their actual coverage amounts  and that two debtors  (i.e., Debtor C and Debtor E) are not meeting the customer's Coverage Goals because they are not in compliance with one or more terms and\/or conditions in their respective credit insurance policy or policies, as explained in the corresponding coverage notes  (i.e., the actual coverage for which Debtor C and Debtor E previously qualified has been canceled or reduced below the desired coverage amount due to non-compliance issues). And because five of the customer's nine debtors  are not meeting that customer's Coverage Goals, the Gap Report  illustrates that the percentage of actual coverage provided  for those debtors  is only 44% (i.e., 5\/9*100=44%), as compared to the 100% desired coverage .","At step , the applications server  will automatically initiate the processes for completing the various Milestones required to remediate the cause of the Alert generated at step . The applications server  may also provide functionality for walking a user through one or more Milestones that require user interaction to complete those processes. In the example of , those processes might include obtaining coverage for the debtors  that currently have no actual coverage (i.e., Debtor A, Debtor B, and Debtor D) and submitting financial documents to one or more credit insurers for the two debtors  that are not in compliance with one or more terms and\/or conditions in their respective credit insurance policy or policies (i.e., Debtor C and Debtor E).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0120","num":"0135"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 8","FIG. 8"],"b":["712","802","900","802","900","800","902","200","300","3100","802","802"]},"At step , the applications server  determines whether the credit insurers identified at step  are registered within the system . If a credit insurer is registered within the system , the applications server  will automatically submit a request for coverage with that credit insurer at step  via electronic data exchanges with the credit insurer system  maintained by that credit insurer. And if a credit insurer is NOT registered within the system , the user will need to manually submit a request for coverage with that credit insurer at step  via e-mail, ground mail, facsimile, filling out fields in a web page, or other suitable manual process.

Those steps - may also be performed at the beginning of the coverage request process illustrated in , such as before the step  of identifying potential credit insurers for filling the customer's coverage gaps.","If customer is found NOT to be a licensed user of the system  at step , is found NOT to have already purchased credits at step , and declines to purchase any credits at step , the Action will be closed at step , as discussed in more detail below. But if customer is found to be a licensed user of the system  at step , the applications server  will query that customer's AR system  at step  to obtain the most recent financial data from in the possession of the customer. Because licensed customers will generally be registered within the system , that query can be performed electronically and the subject financial data retrieved via electronic data exchanges with the customer's AR system . If the subject financial data is found on the customer's AR system  at step , the applications server  will determine whether the financial data obtained from the customer is current (e.g., within seven days of the prior month) at step . If the required financial data is found to be current at step , the applications server  will underwrite that financial data at step , as discussed in more detail below. Similarly, if the required financial data is found in the central database at step  and it is found to be current at step , the applications server  will also underwrite that financial data at step , as discussed in more detail below.","If the required financial data is found NOT to be current at step , if the subject financial data is NOT found on the customer's AR system  at step , if the customer decides to purchase credits at step , or if the customer is found to have already purchased credits at step , the required financial data will be obtained from the subject debtor  at step . The step  of obtaining the required financial data from the subject debtor  may include several different Activities. For example, it may involve contacting the customer to obtain the customer's permission to use its name when attempting to obtain the required financial data from the subject debtor . It may also include contacting the subject debtor  and inputting the required financial data into the applications server . The required financial data may be input into the applications server  using a manual input process (e.g., scanning a document, typing on a keyboard, dictating into voice recognition software, etc.) or using an electronic import (e.g., saving a file from an e-mail, saving a file from a memory device, importing file from a web page, importing a file from a remote server, etc.).","A time limit will generally be set for performing the step  of obtaining the required financial data from the debtor , and at step  the applications server  will check to see if the step  of obtaining the required financial data from the debtor  has been completed within the set time limit. If required financial data has not been obtained from the debtor  within the set time limit, the Action will be temporarily closed, or put on hold, at step  and scheduled for follow-up Activities at a later date. Those follow-up Activities may include placing a phone call or e-mail to the debtor , escalating the step  of obtaining the required financial data from the debtor  in a user's worklist queue, and\/or generating a reminder Alert at a later date for completing step .","When the applications server  verifies that the required financial data has been obtained at step , it will underwrite that data at step . Underwriting the required financial data includes transforming that data by applying different formulas to determine such things as the subject debtor's  current ratio, quick ratio, debt-to-equity ratio, net worth, net income, and debt-to-net worth ratio. The applications server  compares those values to the one or more terms and\/or conditions with which the subject debtor  was not in compliance at step  to determine whether that debtor  is now in compliance with that one or more terms and\/or conditions. If the debtor  is found to be in compliance with the one or more terms and\/or conditions at step , the required financial data will be submitted to the appropriate credit insurer at step . The financial data will be submitted to the appropriate credit insurer via electronic data exchanges with that credit insurer's credit insurer system . Or if that credit insurer is not registered within the system , the financial data can be submitted to the credit insurer manually, as discussed above with respect to step .","Even if the debtor  is found NOT to be in compliance with the one or more terms and\/or conditions at step , the customer can choose to submit the subject financial data to the appropriate credit insurer anyway at step . Or the customer can choose NOT to submit that financial data at step , in which instance the applications server  will initiate a new Action at step  in which the functionality of the Marketplace Module can be used to go to market and obtain new and\/or additional coverage for the subject debtor . That Action may also be initiated if the credit insurer does not withdraw the cancellation of coverage for that debtor  at step . In the alternative, the applications server  can initiate a new Action at step  for appealing the cancellation coverage for the subject debtor . But if the credit insurer does withdraw the cancellation of coverage for the subject debtor  at step , the applications server  will end the financial submission process and that Action will be identified as being \u201cClosed\u201d in its corresponding Action Report  ().","As the examples above demonstrate, the step  of completing the required Action for remediating the cause of an Alert can include multiple process steps, or Milestones, for completing that Action. That Action may also be linked to other Actions. Similarly, each Milestone may include different Activities that must be completed as part of that Milestone. Those Actions, Milestones, and Activities and the manner in which they are performed to ensure a customer is meeting its Coverage Goals may be preprogrammed in the applications server . They may also be defined by a user as required to meet its individual needs and\/or desires.","A user can utilize \u201cwizard\u201d functionality provided with the system  to define different Actions, Milestones, and Activities and the manner in which they are performed. The data structure of those Actions, Milestones, and Activities is defined to enable customizable, comprehensive, and flexible implementation of the processes required to handle any Event that is causing a customer's Coverage Goal NOT to be met, as well as the corresponding process steps, or Milestones, required to respond to that Event so the customer's Coverage Goals will again be met. Like the Milestones themselves, the wizard functionality will guide users through the process steps required to define different Actions, Milestones, and Activities by asking a series of predefined questions and\/or presenting predefined options from which the user can select. In that way, different users can utilize different steps in different orders to respond to different Events in different ways. Different users can also utilize different steps for responding to the same Events. Accordingly, each Action, Milestone, and Activity may be specific to each customer, credit insurer, credit insurance policy, debtor, or broker.","As  illustrates, the applications server  compiles all of the Events that may require a responsive Action and presents them to a user in a graphical display, or Event List . A user can add a new Events to the Event List  by clicking on or otherwise selecting an \u201cAdd\u201d button , edit an Event identified in the Events List  by clicking on or otherwise selecting an \u201cEdit\u201d button , and\/or delete an Event identified in the Events List  by clicking on or otherwise selecting a \u201cDelete\u201d button . Preferably, that functionality is only available to an administrator or a manager. Administrators can be part of a brokerage organization or employees of the party that maintains the system  of the present invention. And managers are generally parties that manage multiple brokers within a brokerage organization. Those parties can access the functionality of the Event List  to define and modify various Events as required to meet specific customer's needs and\/or desires.","Upon clicking on or otherwise selecting one of the \u201cAdd\u201d button  or \u201cEdit\u201d button in the Event List , the applications server  will navigate a user to a graphical display, or New Event Input Page , where that user can add the name and a detailed description of a new Event or edit the name and\/or detailed description of an existing Event. In the latter instance, the user will be asked to select which Event in the Event List  is to be edited before navigating the user to the New Event Input Page . As  illustrates, the New Event Input Page  includes an \u201cEvent Name\u201d box  where the user can add or edit the name of an Event by typing or otherwise inputting text, a \u201cDescription of Event\u201d box  where the user can add or edit the detailed description of the Event by typing or otherwise inputting text, and a \u201cSubmit\u201d button  that the user can click on or otherwise select to submit that new or edited Event to the database server  for storage on the central database. Upon clicking on or otherwise selecting the \u201cSubmit\u201d button  in the New Event Page Input , the new or edited Event will thereafter appear in the Events List  with the name added or edited using the New Event Input Page .","Upon clicking on or otherwise selecting an Event in the Event List , the applications server  will navigate the user to a graphical display, or Action Definition Page , where the user can define or edit the appropriate Action for responding to that Event. As  illustrate, the Action Definition Page  includes a Start Condition  for the subject Event and Milestones  and Activities  for carrying out the process steps of one or more Actions in response to that Event. Different Events have their own unique Start Conditions  defined by different combinations of conditions. For example the Start Condition  may be defined based on conditions such as the reason  the Event occurred, the credit insurer  associated with the Event, the broker  managing the associated credit insurance policy or policies, the debtor type  of the subject debtor , the coverage type  provided by the associated credit insurance policy or policies, the minimum credit limit  and maximum credit limit  provided the associated credit insurance policy or policies, the region  and country  where the subject debtor  is located, and the minimum outstanding balance  and maximum outstanding balance  of the subject debtor's  accounts receivable. And although not illustrated in , the Start Condition  may also be based on conditions such as start date, completion date, length of time overdue, status, policy, customer, and parent action.","As illustrated in , each of those different conditions - can be chosen from a pulldown list that includes different choices for each condition -, a user can add different choices to those pull-down lists in a similar manner to that described below with respect to the answer  in an Activity . A user can also add or remove entire conditions from the Start Condition . Accordingly, there can effectively be an unlimited number of Start Conditions  defined by an unlimited number of different combinations of conditions.","Each combination of conditions - within a Start Condition  is unique to a specific Event and has a corresponding process  for responding to that Event. That process  is defined by the different Milestones  and Activities  that are used to carry out the steps of that process . Each Milestone  includes one or more Activities  that must be completed before the process  continues on to the next Action, Milestone , or Activity . And each Activity  includes a description  of the process step that is to be conducted by that Activity  and a question  that is to be answered as a result of that Activity . The user can name the process  and compose the description  and question  for each Activity  by typing or otherwise inputting text into the corresponding areas of the Action Definition Page . Although not illustrated in  and B, each Activity  may also include areas for inputting a start date, completion date, responsible user, and notes.","A user can also define different answers  to the question  in each Activity  along with a different result  for each different answer . A user can add different answers  to that question  by clicking on or otherwise selecting an \u201cAdd Answer\u201d link  provided on the Action Definition Page . As illustrated in , the applications server  will display a pop-up window  on the Action Definition Page  when a user clicks on or otherwise selects the \u201cAdd Answer\u201d link . Within that pop-up window , a user can type or otherwise input answer text  that corresponds to a potential answer  to the question . The answers  defined by that answer text  may binary (e.g., \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d), free-form (e.g., \u201cCustomer Could Not Be Reached\u201d, \u201cDebtor Disputes Invoice\u201d, etc.) or numerical (e.g., \u201c>60\u201d, \u201c0.25\u201d, $25,000\u201d, etc.). The user can also choose a result type  from a pull-down menu of result types  to define what will occur if the answer  defined by the answer text  is arrived at in response to the question .","For example, a user can choose the \u201cBegin New Action\u201d result type  to begin a new Action; a user can choose the \u201cBegin New Activity\u201d result type  to begin a new Activity  within a Milestone ; a user can choose the \u201cBegin New Milestone\u201d result type  to begin a new Milestone  within an Action; a user can choose the \u201cClose Action\u2014Success\u201d result type  to close the Action; or a user can choose the \u201cClose Action\u2014Other\u201d result type  to temporarily close, or put on hold, completion of the Action.

And upon choosing the \u201cClose Action\u2014Other\u201d result type , the applications server  will automatically navigate the user to scheduling functionality for scheduling a time or identifying an Event that will re-initiate the Action at a later date. The lists of processes , Activities , and Milestones  from which the user can choose are preferably provided in a similar manner and with similar functionality to the Event List  and New Event Input Page  described above.","A user can create a plurality of answers  for each question  with a corresponding number of different results . Because each result  may be linked to any new Action, Milestone , or Activity , and because a user can define their own Actions, Milestones , and Activities  using the wizard functionality, a user can effectively define an unlimited number of answers  and results  for each question . Those answers  can be manually selected or otherwise chosen from a pull-down menu by a user, or they can be automatically selected or otherwise chosen by the applications server  using logical decisions and evaluations programmed into the business logic tier. Accordingly, each Action, Milestone , and Activity  may be performed by a user, the applications server , or a combination thereof.","A user can also specify a duration  of time during which each Activity  is expected to be completed. The user can specify the duration  of each Activity  by typing or otherwise inputting the desired length of time into the corresponding area of the Action Definition Page . As that length of times expires, the applications server may generate an Alert to inform the user responsible for completing that Activity  that it is overdue or coming overdue. The applications server  may also escalate that Activity  or its corresponding Milestone  in that user's worklist queue. A user can define how the applications server  reacts to an Activity  being overdue or coming overdue as required to suit its needs and\/or desires, such as scheduling a follow-up Action to occur after a specific length of time has passed since an Action should have been completed.","The exemplary Action Definition Page  of  corresponds to the Action, or coverage request process, illustrated in . As  illustrate, the Event that triggered that Action was that a debtor was not covered under the customer's credit insurance policy or polices (i.e., \u201cEvent: Debtor Not Covered\u201d). The reason  for that Event is that the subject debtor \u201cDoes Not Qualify\u201d for coverage under the credit insurance policy or policies provided by the identified credit insurer  (i.e., \u201cInsurer C\u201d), as set forth in the Start Condition  of the process  for responding to that Event. The process  for responding to that Event is to \u201cObtain New Coverage\u201d for the subject debtor.","The first Milestone  (i.e., \u201cMilestone: Does Customer Want to Obtain New Coverage?\u201d) of the process  illustrated in  corresponds to step  of the Action illustrated . As illustrated in , that Milestone  includes one Activity  (i.e., \u201cActivity: A\u201d), which involves contacting the customer to discuss the coverage gap identified in a Gap Report , as described in the description . Based on that discussion, the user obtains an answer  to the question  of whether the customer granted permission to obtain coverage for the debtor that does not qualify for coverage under the customer's current credit insurance policy or policies. Obtaining the answer  to that question  completes the Activity  and determines how the process  will proceed based on the result  associated with that answer .","As illustrated in , a user has defined the result  for the answer  \u201cYes\u201d with a \u201cBegin New Milestone\u201d result type  so that the process  will proceed to the second Milestone  (i.e., \u201cIdentify Potential Insurers\u201d) when the answer  to the question  is determined to be \u201cYes\u201d. And as illustrated in , the result  for the answer \u201cNo\u201d is defined with a \u201cClose Action\u2014Success\u201d result type  so that the process  will proceed end and the Action will be designated as \u201cClosed\u201d when the answer  to the question  is determined to be \u201cNo\u201d. There may also be a result  for the answer \u201cCustomer Could Not Be Reached\u201d defined with a \u201cClose Action\u2014Other\u201d result type  so that the process  will be temporarily closed, or put on hold, until a later date, at which time another attempt to contact the customer will be made.","The second Milestone  (i.e., \u201cMilestone: Does Customer Want to Obtain New Coverage?\u201d) of the process  illustrated in  corresponds to step  of the Action illustrated in . As illustrated in , that Milestone  includes two Activities  (i.e., \u201cActivity: A\u201d and \u201cActivity: B\u201d). The first Activity  involves determining the insurability of the subject debtor within the pertinent market using a Debtor Analysis Reports  created with the Debtor Analysis Functionality. Based on that determination, the user obtains an answer  to the question  of whether any credit insurers have been willing to provide coverage for the subject debtor. Obtaining the answer  to that question  completes the first Activity  of the second Milestone  and determines how the process  will proceed based on the result  associated with that answer .","As illustrated in , a user has defined the result  for the answer  \u201cYes\u201d with a \u201cBegin New Activity\u201d result type  so that the process  will proceed to the second Activity  (i.e., \u201cActivity B\u201d) within the second Milestone  when the answer  to the question  is determined to be \u201cYes\u201d. And when the answer  to the question  is determined to be \u201cNo\u201d, the Action may be temporarily closed, or put on hold, by a \u201cClose Action\u2014Other\u201d result type  so that an attempt to find coverage for the subject debtor can be made at a later date.

Such new Actions or Milestones  might include, for example, a process of appealing a denial of coverage for the subject debtor. Proceeding with such a new Action or Milestone  will complete the second Milestone .","The second Activity  of the second Milestone  involves analyzing the stability of the credit insurance policies provided by the credit insurers identified during the first Activity  of the second Milestone using a Credit Insurer Market Analysis  created with the Market Analysis Functionality and\/or a Coverage Stability Summary  created with the functionality of the Brokerage Module. Based on that analysis, the user obtains an answer  to the question  of whether any of those credit insurers have earned a stability score of greater than 700. Obtaining the answer  to that question  completes the second Activity  of the second Milestone  and determines how the process  will proceed based on the result  associated with that answer .","As illustrated in , a user has defined the result  for the answer  \u201cYes\u201d with a \u201cBegin New Milestone\u201d result type  so that the process  will proceed to the third. Milestone  (i.e., \u201cIs Insurer Registered?\u201d) when the answer  to the question  is determined to be \u201cYes\u201d. And when the answer  to the question  is determined to be \u201cNo\u201d, the Action may be temporarily closed, or put on hold, by a \u201cClose Action\u2014Other\u201d result type  so that an attempt to find coverage for the subject debtor can be made at a later date.

Such new Actions or Milestones  might include, for example, repeating the process step of the second Activity , except that the answer  to the question  is based on whether any of the subject credit insurers have earned a stability score of greater than 600 rather than 700. The process steps can continue on in that manner until the answer to the question  is determined to be \u201cYes\u201d (i.e., until at least one credit insurer has a stability score higher than the set value), at which point the second Milestone  will be completed and the process  will return to and proceed with the third Milestone  (i.e., \u201cMilestone: Is insurer Registered?\u201d) illustrated in .","The third Milestone  of the process  illustrated in  corresponds to step  of the Action illustrated in .

Compliance Monitoring Functionality",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0151","num":"0166"},"figref":"FIG. 14","b":["1400","102","108","102","102","102","106","104"]},"The applications server  scrapes the credit insurer systems  of various credit insurers to detect any changes in the terms and conditions of the policies offered by those credit insurers. When such changes are identified, the applications server  imports and digitally processes the pertinent information and the database server  uses it to update the central database. And because that information may change from day-to-day, the applications server  preferably imports and digitally processes that information on a daily basis. In that way, the applications server  maintains an up-to-date listing of all of the possible terms and conditions that may appear in a customer's credit insurance policy or policies.","At step , each of the terms and conditions imported, digitally processed, and\/or updated at step  is used to create corresponding rules and triggering Events that will be used by the applications server  to automatically monitor the whether a customer is in compliance with the terms and conditions of its credit insurance policy or policies. Those rules and triggering Events can be created automatically by the applications server  using data recognition, parsing, and transformation techniques. They may also be defined by a user via the wizard functionality discussed above. In that way, the rules and triggering Events can be used to drive automated processes that will identify, alert users of, and correct any non-compliance issues with the terms and conditions of the customer credit insurance policy or policies. And the Milestones \/Activities  required to identify, alert users of, and correct those non-compliance can be automatically performed by the applications server  and\/or performed by a user via interactive features that will walk that user through one or more of those Milestones \/Activities .","To help support those automated processes, the terms and conditions imported and digitally processed by the applications server  at step  are categorized based on the type of coverage provided by their corresponding credit insurance policies because those terms and conditions closely relate to the type of coverage provided. For example, Whole Turnover policies provide coverage for every debtor in a customer's accounts receivable portfolio up to a predetermined limit; Named Debtor policies (also called \u201ccritical customer policies\u201d) provide coverage only for those debtors expressly named in the policy; Discretionary Credit Limit (DCL) policies provide coverage to any debtors that satisfy specific qualifying requirements set forth in the policy (e.g., qualifying values that must be represented in accounts receivable information for one or more debtors to qualify for insurance coverage), without pre-approval from the credit insurer, up to a predetermined limit; and Rating-Multiplier policies (e.g., EZ COVER brand Rating-Multiplier policies) provide coverage to any debtors with a high enough rating assigned by the credit insurer up to a predetermined limit that has a multiplier based on that rating. And the debtors covered by Whole Turnover policies and Named Debtor policies must be pre-approved by the credit insurer, while debtors covered by DCL policies can be qualified for coverage at any point during the effective period of the policy. As a result, the terms and conditions required to comply with such policies are more extensive than those for Whole Turnover policies and Named Debtor policies. Those terms and conditions are therefore categorized based on the type of policy they define.","By way of more specific example, a debtor may only be eligible for coverage under a DCL policy if all of that debtor's payments were made within 90 days of their due date during the preceding twelve months, excluding invoices with balances of under $2,000 and payment periods that did not exceed previous payment periods by more than 60 days. And a debtor may only remain covered under a DCL policy if 10% or more of that debtor's undisputed balance of all amounts owed does not become 60 days or more past due from its original or extended due date. A customer will also need to prove and maintain a debtor's credit-worthiness via the submission of various reports and references.","By contrast, the credit-worthiness of a debtor covered under a Named Debtor policy will have already been established during the pre-approval process. Therefore, that debtor's compliance with such policies will primarily be determined based on that debtor's recent payment history with the customer, such as whether 10% or more of that debtor's undisputed balance of all amounts has become 60 days or more past due from its original or extended due date. But regardless of the type of credit insurance policy, policy-level qualifications and compliance will generally be based on the following:\n\n","By importing and digitally processing all of the terms and conditions for various credit insurers' credit insurance policies at step  and using that information to create corresponding rules and triggering Events at step , the applications server  is able to maintain an up-to-date monitoring \u201cprofile\u201d that not only includes all of the terms and conditions that may potentially appear in a customer's credit insurance policy or policies, but also the corresponding rules and triggering Events for automating the processes required for the customer to maintain compliance with those terms and conditions. That monitoring profile may be substantially the same as or similar to the Event List  and New Event Input Page  discussed above, wherein a user can add new triggering Events to the monitoring profile as required to address any term and\/or condition that may appear in a customer credit insurance policy or policies. Similarly, a user can define the various Actions, Milestones , and Activities  required to keep a customer in compliance with those terms and conditions based on different Start Conditions  that correspond to those triggering Events.","Steps  and  are performed on an ongoing basis to ensure that the monitoring profile remains up to date so that whenever a customer registers its credit insurance policy or policies within the system , the rules and triggering Events required to comply the terms and conditions of that policy or policies will already exist within the system . In that way, the applications server  can quickly identify and implement the Actions required to maintain that customer's compliance with the terms and conditions of that credit insurance policy or policies by selecting the appropriate Actions from among those defined in the monitoring profile.","At step , the applications server  imports and digitally processes the terms and conditions for each of the customer's current credit insurance policies. The applications server  imports that information in electronic form, if available, from the credit insurer systems  of the credit insurers from whom the customer obtained those policies. And the terms and conditions of those credit insurance policies are extracted directly from the corresponding electronic policy documents. In the alternative, a customer can send (e.g., e-mail a file, ground mail a memory device, etc.) that information to an administrator for importing into the applications server  and\/or a user can input that information into the applications server  via a user interface  using a manual input process (e.g., scanning a document, typing on a keyboard, dictating into voice recognition software, etc.). That information is then stored in the relational database by the database server .","The step  of importing and digitally processing the terms and conditions for each of the customer's current credit insurance policies preferably occurs as required to include all of the terms and conditions for all of that customer's current credit insurance policies. For example, step  may occur as part of a transition processes during which a customer and\/or its credit insurance policy or polices are introduced into, or registered with, the system  of the present invention. And it may also occur as part of rewriting a current credit insurance policy, renewing an expiring credit insurance policy, or obtaining a new credit insurance policy, as discussed above with respect to the Quote Summary Functionality. In that way, as soon as a customer is registered with the system  and\/or rewrites, renews, or obtains a new credit insurance policy, the applications server  can match the terms and conditions in the customer's credit insurance policy or policies to the corresponding rules and triggering Events in the monitoring profile so it can begin monitoring the terms and conditions in those policies in an ongoing manner, thereby ensuring the payability of any potential claims a customer may make on those policies. And if those policies include any unique terms and conditions that do not yet exist in the monitoring profile (e.g., terms and conditions that may have been customized for a specific customer in a specific credit insurance policy), steps  and  will be repeated for those terms and conditions so they can be added to the monitoring profile with the appropriate rules and triggering Events for maintaining compliance therewith.","Step  may also include importing the customer's current coverage information from the customer's AR system  if that information has not already been imported by the Coverage Goal Functionality at step . Or in the alternative, the terms and conditions for each of the customer's current credit insurance policies may be imported from the customer's AR System  as part of step . But regardless of when the customer's coverage information is imported, that information is needed by the Compliance Monitoring Functionality to determine which debtors are covered by which of the customer's credit insurance policies so it can be used at step  to match those debtors to the respective terms and conditions that must be satisfied to maintain coverage for them under their respective credit insurance policies.","To determine if the terms and conditions of a customer's credit insurance policy or policies are being satisfied (i.e., to identify any non-optimal coverage issues), the applications server  imports AR Aging Reports from the customer's AR system  and digitally processes them at step . The applications server  imports those AR Aging Reports from the customer's AR system  in a similar manner to that described above with respect to step , preferably by extracting the pertinent information in tabular form. In the alternative, a customer can send (e.g., e-mail a file, ground mail a memory device, etc.) that information to an administrator for importing into the applications server  and\/or a user (e.g., a customer, broker, account manager, administrator, etc.) can input that information into the applications server  via a user interface  using a manual input process (e.g., scanning a document, typing on a keyboard, dictating into voice recognition software, etc.). That information is then stored in the relational database by the database server .","Because AR Aging Reports are typically updated from month-to-month, the applications server  preferably imports them from the customer's AR system  on a monthly basis. The applications server  may also import those AR Aging Reports more frequently, as required to identify compliance issues with any terms or conditions that require action in shorter periods than one month. For example, if a customer must report an unpaid accounts receivable that is past due by fifteen days, the applications server  will import the corresponding AR Aging Reports fifteen days from the past due date. Depending on the required timing, step  may be performed by the Coverage Goal Functionality at step  or vice versa.","At step , the applications server  identifies any non-optimal coverage issues, such as overdue accounts receivable, and automatically generates Alerts in real-time using the terms and conditions and coverage information for each of the customer's current credit insurance policies imported and digitally processed at step \/, the terms and conditions for various credit insurance policies imported and digitally processed at step , the AR Aging Reports imported and digitally processed at step \/, and the debtor compliance information imported and digitally processed at step . More specifically, the applications server  compares the accounts receivable information and the debtor compliance information to the terms and conditions in each of the customer's current credit insurance policies and determines whether the customer and its debtors are in compliance with those terms and conditions. And the applications server  makes those comparisons using the various rules and triggering Events that were\/are created from the terms and conditions imported and digitally processed at step .","As part of step , the applications server  performs a line-by-line analysis of the AR Aging Reports and compares the data therein with the terms and conditions required for the associated debtor to be covered by the customer's credit insurance policy or policies. For example, the applications server  will automatically identify any past due payments, the amount of those past due payments, and the debtor responsible for those past due payments. And if any debtor is identified as being out of compliance with any of those terms and conditions, the applications server  will generate an Alert that identifies those debtors and the reasons that those debtors are not in compliance with those terms and conditions.","In more detail, the applications server  uses the customer's current coverage information to identify which debtors are covered by which of the customer's credit insurance policies and then compares the accounts receivable and\/or debtor compliance information for those debtors to the terms and conditions of the appropriate credit insurance policies to make sure those debtors are in compliance with the corresponding terms and conditions. And if the applications server  determines that any debtors are not in compliance or may fall out of compliance with the corresponding terms and\/or conditions if the appropriate Action is not taken, it will identify which terms and\/or conditions are not being complied with by which debtors and the appropriate Action to place those debtors in compliance with those terms and\/or conditions. The applications server  can thereby generate an Alert to notify the customer that those debtors are not in compliance or may fall out of compliance with their respective credit insurance policies and, therefore, claims on those debtor's accounts receivable may not be payable. Moreover, it allows the customer to take the appropriate corrective Action to maintain compliance or get back into compliance with the terms and conditions of its credit insurance policy or policies.","Those corrective Actions include processes for meeting credit insurers' reporting requirements, submitting financial information for debtors, and even submitting requests for an increase in the coverage provided by the customer's current credit insurance policy or policies and\/or obtaining new credit insurance policies using the functionality of the Marketplace Module. Such additional and\/or new coverage can be obtained when no other corrective Action will result in a debtor being covered under the customer's current credit insurance policy or policies. For example, if a debtor becomes such high risk that the customer's current credit insurer or insurers refuse to provide coverage for that debtor, the functionality of the Marketplace Module will identify any credit insurance policies that are available to cover the debtor in question (e.g., credit insurance policies provided by credit insurers specializing in high-risk debtors).","At step , the customer is notified of the Alert via a user-specific method of communication (e.g., e-mail, SMS text message, IM text message, telephone call, etc.) The customer can select that user-specific method of communication, along with various other personal settings (e.g., passwords, account information, etc), by accessing the applications server  with a user interface  and inputting the pertinent data (e.g., postal address, e-mail address, cellular telephone number, etc.) in a similar manner to that described with respect to step . If the customer elects to be contact via telephone call, it may be contacted by the applications server  using Interactive Voice Response (IVR) technology or by the user assisting them with their policy (e.g., a broker or an account manager). The customer can also select the type or Alerts it would like to receive, which may include electing not to receive certain Alerts.","Regardless of the method of communication selected, the customer will be presented with two options for responding any Alert it receives: 1) handle the Alert or 2) ignore the Alert. For example, the customer may receive the following Alert via e-mail:\n\n","As  illustrates, the Alert may include a copy of or a link to a graphical display, or Debtor List , that identifies any of the customer's debtors  that are not in compliance with the terms and conditions of a credit insurance policy. The Debtor List  includes a \u201cCompliance for Coverage\u201d column that displays a color-coded status buttons  for each of the debtors . The color of those status buttons  indicates whether or not the corresponding debtor  is in compliance with the terms and conditions of its corresponding credit insurance policy. For example, a white status button  indicates that the debtor  is not covered by any credit insurance policy (e.g., Debtor A, Debtor C, and Debtor D); a green status button  indicates that the debtor  is in compliance with its credit insurance policy (e.g., Debtor F and Debtor B); and a red status button  indicates that the debtor is out of compliance with its credit insurance policy (e.g., Debtor E and Debtor F).","Upon clicking on or otherwise selecting a white status button , the applications server  will automatically navigate a user to the functionality of the Marketplace Module so the user can evaluate and obtain the appropriate coverage for any non-covered debtors  by rewriting an existing credit insurance policy or obtaining a new credit insurance policy. Upon clicking on or otherwise selecting a green status button , the applications server  will automatically navigate a user to a historical record of the Actions taken to keep the corresponding debtor  in compliance, such as a Required Reporting Report  (). And upon clicking on or otherwise selecting a red status button , the applications server  will automatically navigate a user to a graphical display, or Issues Report , that identifies any compliance issues that may have resulted in the corresponding debtor  not being in compliance. In the alternative, the applications server  will automatically navigate a user to the same location regardless of the color of the status button  clicked on or otherwise selected. That same location may be an issues Report .","As  illustrates, such an Issues Report  lists any issues that have been \u201cClosed\u201d, are \u201cIn Progress\u201d, or that are \u201cOpen\u201d. More specifically, the Issues Report  will list any overarching out-of-compliance issues  and the corresponding sub-issues  and  that must be addressed to prevent and\/or remediate those overarching out-of-compliance issues . The Issues Report  will also list the action status  of those issues -. In , for example, Debtor B's out-of-compliance issue  is that it is responsible for accounts receivable of greater than $10,000 that have gone unpaid for 61 to 90 days past their due date. And the corresponding sub-issues  and  needed to address that out-of-compliance issue  are to report the out-of-compliance issue  and its reason to the appropriate credit insurer on a monthly basis. One sub-issue  was remediated for the month of June by reporting that the outstanding amount was the result of a disputed invoice. That sub-issue is therefore identified as being \u201cClosed\u201d. However, such a report has not been filed for July, which is why another sub-issue  remains \u201cOpen\u201d. And because there are still \u201cOpen\u201d sub-issues , the out-of-compliance issue  is identified as being \u201cIn Progress.\u201d If no Action had been taken to address any of those sub-issues (i.e., if the report had not been sent in June)  and , the out-of-compliance issue  would be identified as being \u201cOpen.\u201d","Returning to , the Debtor List  also includes an \u201cActions Pending\u201d column that displays the action numbers  that correspond to any Actions that may be pending with respect to a debtor . For example, out-of-compliance debtors  (e.g., Debtor E and Debtor F) will have action numbers  that correspond to Actions that must be taken to bring those debtors back into compliance with the terms and conditions of their respective credit insurance policies (e.g., report disputed invoice, report debtors with past due accounts receivable to credit insurer , submit financial statements to credit insurer, etc.). Debtors  that are not covered by any credit insurance policy (e.g., Debtor A and Debtor D) will have action numbers  that correspond to Actions that must be taken to obtain coverage for those debtors  (e.g., submit financial statements, rewrite existing credit insurance policy, obtain new credit insurance policy, etc.)). And debtors  that have no outstanding accounts receivable (e.g., Debtor C) and\/or that are adequately covered (e.g., Debtor B and Debtor C) will not have action numbers . The user can sort the information in the Debtor List  as required to filter the list to a manageable number of entries, such as by sorting it by coverage type  (e.g., Whole Turnover, Named, DCL, etc.).","Clicking on or otherwise selecting an action number  will navigate a user to a graphical display, or Action Report , that identifies any such Actions. A user may also be navigated to an Action Report  by clicking on or otherwise selecting an out-of-compliance issue  or sub-issue  and  in an Issues Report . In the former instance, the subject matter of the Action Report  will correspond to the Milestone that needs the most immediate attention. And in the latter instance, the subject matter of the Action Report  will correspond to the Milestone needed to prevent and\/or remediate the selected issue -.","As  illustrates, such an Action Report  identifies the Action(s) needed to complete, or \u201cClose\u201d, any out-of-compliance issues  or sub-issues  and . Those Actions are identified and implemented at step . More specifically, the applications server  will automatically identify the appropriate corrective Action required to bring any out-of-compliance debtors  back into compliance with the terms and conditions of their respective credit insurance policies . And the applications server  will either automatically move through a series of automated Milestones \/Activities  to bring those debtors  back into compliance with the terms and conditions of their associated credit insurance policies  with little or no input required from the user, or it will initiate automated processes that will guide the user through a series of Milestones \/Activities  in which the user performs various process steps (e.g., selecting a \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d option, downloading or importing a document or file, inputting text with a keyboard, etc.) to complete the associated corrective Action and bring those debtors  back into compliance with the terms and conditions of their associated credit insurance policy or policies . The applications server  may also implement a combination of those two processes to bring debtors  back into compliance with the terms and conditions of their associated credit insurance policies , either of which may be initiated by clicking on or otherwise selecting the appropriate item in a Debtor List  or an Issues Report .","In , for example, the applications server  has initiated an automated process to guide the user through a series of Milestones \/Activities  that must be completed to bring Debtor B back into compliance with the terms and conditions of its associated credit insurance policy . The Action Report  identifies the reason  that Debtor B is not in compliance with the terms and conditions of its associated credit insurance policy  as well as the current Milestone  that needs to be completed to bring that debtor  back into compliance with its associated credit insurance policy . More specifically, the reason  that Debtor B is not in compliance with the terms and conditions of its associated credit insurance policy  is a \u201cDisputed Invoice\u201d. That reason  corresponds to the reason  set forth in the Start Condition  for the Action that will bring that debtor  back into compliance with its associated credit insurance policy . And that Milestone  corresponds to one of the Milestones  that must be completed as part of that Action (i.e., \u201cCheck-In [with credit insurer ] Regarding Invoice Status\u201d).","To complete the Milestone  listed in the Action Report  of , the user can communicate with the credit insurer  external to the system  (e.g., via telephone, facsimile, etc.) or via the electronic communications of the system  (e.g., electronic transmission between the applications server  and the credit insurer system  of the appropriate credit insurer ) to update the credit insurer  on the state\/status of the disputed invoice. In the former instance, the user can make the telephone call and then update the action status  of the corresponding issue - in a status box  in the Action Report . And in the latter instance, the user can click on or otherwise select the current Milestone  so that the applications server  automatically navigates the user to Require Reporting Report , as illustrated in  or .","As  illustrates, such a Required Reporting Report  identifies the reporting requirement  that corresponds to the reason  why a term and\/or condition has not been met. It also identifies each reporting instance that corresponds to that reporting requirement , including the reporting due date  and reporting status  of each instance. For a reporting status  of \u201cSubmitted\u201d, the appropriate report has been submitted and the associated issue - is therefore \u201cClosed.\u201d For a reporting status  of \u201cNot Submitted\u201d, the appropriate report is due or about to become due and the associated issue - is therefore \u201cOpen\u201d or \u201cIn Progress.\u201d And for a reporting status  of \u201cNot Yet Required\u201d, the appropriate report is not yet due with the associated reporting due date  indicating when that report will become due.","Upon clicking on or otherwise selecting a \u201cSubmitted\u201d reporting status , the applications server  will automatically navigate a user to a record of the submitted report, which may include a copy of the report as well as the time and date it was submitted. And upon clicking on or otherwise selecting a \u201cNot Submitted\u201d reporting status , the applications server  will automatically obtain and electronically submit the required report to the appropriate party or navigate a user to functionality for obtaining and electronically submitting the required report to the appropriate party, such as a dialog box that allows a user to select and upload a file from the database server  to a credit insurer system  or that allows the user to identify a location from which the applications server  can automatically upload files as reports come due. The \u201cNot Yet Required\u201d reporting status  does not provide such functionality, but when the corresponding reporting due date  approaches, or after the preceding reporting requirement  is satisfied, the reporting status  of \u201cNot Yet Required\u201d will automatically change to \u201cNot Submitted\u201d so as to provide the required functionality. Upon submitting the required records via that functionality, the applications server will automatically change the action status  of the corresponding issue - to \u201cClosed\u201d and update any related status indicator (e.g., a status button  under a \u201cPolicy Reporting\u201d heading in the Dashboard  ()). All such data communications between are stored by the database server .","Such Required Reporting Reports  are available for any number of different reporting requirements for any number of credit insurers . In , for example, a Required Reporting Report  sets forth the reporting requirement  for submitting an AR Aging Report for all outstanding accounts receivable that are greater than $10,000. That reporting is required on a monthly basis throughout the effective period (i.e., January 2010 through December 2010) of the associated credit insurance policy  (i.e., Policy number: 450604701). And a user can use that Require Reporting Reports  to review previously submitted AR Aging Reports, to submit current AR Aging Reports, and to identify the future dates at which any AR Aging Reports will be due. In a similar manner, a Required Reporting Report  can be provided to help a user easily identify and satisfy substantially any type of reporting requirement.","Returning to , the Action Report  includes a status button  for each Milestone \/ that must be completed to bring a debtor  back into compliance with the terms and conditions of its credit insurance policy  and\/or to keep that debtor  in compliance with those terms and conditions. The Action Report  also includes the corresponding Milestone due dates  and Milestone completion dates  for each of those Milestones \/. And when those Milestones \/ include satisfying reporting requirements, the Milestone due dates  will be the same as the reporting due dates  (e.g., ). As  also illustrates, the size of a specific status button  (e.g., M) will become larger compared to the size of other status buttons  (e.g., M, M, M, and M) when the Milestone \/ that corresponds to that specific status button  is \u201cOpen\u201d or \u201cIn Progress\u201d, thereby drawing a user's attention to that Milestone \/. The shape of a specific status button  (not shown) may also change to indicate a change in status.","The color of the status buttons  in the Action Report  indicate whether or not the corresponding Milestone \/ has been accomplished. For example, a white status button  may indicate that the Milestone \/ is not yet due (e.g., M); a green status button  may indicate that the Milestone \/ has been completed (e.g., M, M, and M) and a red status button  may indicate that a Milestone \/ is past due (e.g., M). And if the color of any status button  in the Action Report  is red for any debtor  (i.e., if any Milestone \/ remains outstanding for placing a debtor  in compliance with the terms and conditions of its credit insurance policy ), the status button  for that debtor  in the \u201cCompliance for Coverage\u201d column of the Debtor List  will also be red so as to draw a user's attention to that outstanding Milestone \/.","Upon clicking or otherwise selecting a white status button , the applications server  will automatically navigate a user to a graphical display that includes the requirements that will need to be met to complete that Milestone \/ when it comes due, such as an Action Report . Upon clicking on or otherwise selecting a green status button , the applications server  will automatically navigate a user to a historical record of the completed Milestone \/, which may include a copy of any documents used to complete that Milestone \/ as well as the time and date those document were used\/submitted. And upon clicking on or otherwise selecting a red status button , the applications server  will automatically complete the Milestone \/ or navigate a user to functionality for completing that Milestone \/, such as a dialog box that allows a user to select and upload a file from the database server  to a credit insurer system  or that allows the user to identify a location from which the applications server  can automatically upload files as they come due.","All of that functionality for placing a debtor back in compliance with the terms and conditions of its corresponding credit insurance policy is part of steps -, wherein non-compliance issues are identified at step , the user is notified at step , and the appropriate corrective Action is implemented at step . For example, a debtor may be identified as no longer being insurable at step  because of bad financial data. The customer needing coverage for that debtor may be notified that the debtor is no longer insurable because of the had financial data at step . And the customer or another user (e.g., the customer's broker) user can submit good financial data to the subject credit insurer at step  to remediate that issue.","When the appropriate corrective Action of step  includes submitting debtor compliance information, such as good financial data, to a credit insurer, the applications server  can import that debtor compliance information from the customer's AR system . That information can be imported from the customer's AR system  on a monthly basis, or more frequently, depending on the customer's payment terms. For example, if a customer requires a debtor to make payments every fifteen days, the applications server  can import the associated debtor compliance information for that debtor every fifteen days.","The applications server  can import debtor compliance information from the customer's AR system  and digitally process it in a similar manner to that described above with respect to step , preferably by extracting the pertinent documents (e.g., financial statements, trade references, bank references, credit reports, dispute information, etc.). Debtor compliance information may also be imported from various other systems (i.e., institutional systems ) from which the pertinent documents can be obtained. For example, financial statements may be imported from the EDGAR system and\/or SEDAR, and trade reference documents can be imported from the FCIB's World Trade Reference system. In the alternative, a customer can send that information (e.g., e-mail a file, ground mail a memory device, etc.) to an administrator for importing into the applications server  and\/or a user (e.g., a customer, broker, account manager, administrator, etc.) can input that information into the applications server  via a user interface  using a manual input process (e.g., scanning a document, typing on a keyboard, dictating into voice recognition software, etc.). That information is then stored in the relational database by the database server .","As discussed above, the appropriate corrective Action taken at step  can be defined using the wizard functionality of the present invention. More specifically, a user can utilize the wizard function to define different Actions, Milestones , and Activities  that can be implemented to bring out-of-compliance debtors back into compliance with the terms and conditions of their respective credit insurance policies, thereby prevent in-compliance debtors from falling out of compliance with the terms and conditions of their respective credit insurance policies. For example, those Actions, Milestones , and Activities  can be defined to submit documents (e.g., financial statements, trade references, credit reports, etc.) and other information (e.g., Past Due Report, Notification of Overdues, etc.) to credit insurers to satisfy the requirements of different terms and conditions.","There may be any number of different terms and conditions with which a debtor may be out of compliance, and the applications server  will automatically perform the specific steps required to address each of those terms and conditions based on the Actions, Milestones , and Activities defined in the monitoring profile. For example, the applications server  may auto-generate a list of out-of-compliance debtors (e.g., debtors with accounts receivable past due >30 days) and electronically send a Notification of Overdues to the credit insurer system  of the credit insurer who issued the policy with which those debtors are out of compliance. Or in the alternative, the applications server  may provide interactive functionality that guides a user through the steps required to generate and submit that list.","By way of more specific example,  illustrates an Action, or account reporting process, that may be performed at step  to satisfy the reporting requirements for a debtor that has overdue accounts receivable. As a result, the customer is out of compliance with one or more of the terms and conditions of its credit insurance policy or policies. In the alternative, the customer may be at risk of being out of compliance with one or more of those terms and conditions. In either instance, the overdue accounts receivable serve as a triggering Event requiring a corrective Action.","The Start Condition  for the Action illustrated in  is driven by the condition that a debtor has exceeded the maximum outstanding balance  of accounts receivable for one of the customer's credit insurance policies. However, no reason  may have been provided for the maximum outstanding balance  being exceeded. Accordingly, the first step  of the Action illustrated in  is determining whether the accounts receivable remain outstanding due to a disputed invoice. If the accounts receivable remain outstanding due to a disputed invoice, the next step  of the corrective Action of  is to contact the customer and establish the details of the disputed invoice (e.g., damaged goods, noncompliance of goods\/services with contracts, goods\/services not received, etc.). And if the accounts receivable do NOT remain outstanding due to a disputed invoice, the next step  of the corrective Action of  is to determine how long the accounts receivable have been outstanding (e.g., >30 days, >60 days, >90 days, etc.). Determining the details of the disputed invoice at step  may also include the step  of determining the length of time the accounts receivable have been outstanding, as indicated by the dashed arrow in .","The details of the disputed invoice may be obtained outside the system  by contacting the customer directly, such as via telephone, e-mail, etc. And the length of time the accounts receivable have been outstanding may be obtained from the AR Aging Reports imported from the customer's AR system  at step . Accordingly, even though the step  of determining the details of the disputed invoice may include determining the length of time the accounts receivable have been outstanding, it is a separate step from the step  determining the length of time the accounts receivable have been outstanding because the former step  may require performing Activities outside of the system . In the alternative, the details of the disputed invoice and\/or the length of time the accounts receivable have been outstanding may be obtained by providing a user with a link or pop-up window that includes interactive features that will walk the user through the process of obtaining and inputting the details of the disputed invoice and\/or the length of time the accounts receivable have been outstanding, such as navigating the user to the location of a file for download or import.","At step , the applications server  determines the reporting requirements for the overdue accounts receivable based on the reason for the disputed invoice and\/or the length of time the accounts receivable have been outstanding. Those reporting requirements are determined from the terms and conditions of the customer's credit insurance policy or policies that are imported, digitally processed, and matched to the corresponding rules and triggering Events in the monitoring profile at step . Accordingly, step  incorporates the appropriate Action defined for those rules and triggering Events into the Action illustrated in . For example, the Activity  performed at step  will include a question  as to the reason  the outstanding balance remains overdue. If the answer  to that question  is that the invoice was disputed, the result  will be defined by a \u201cBegin New Action\u201d result type  that is linked to an Action for completing a Past Due Report. And if the answer the answer  to that question  is that the invoice is overdue by more than thirty days due but is not disputed, the result  will be defined by a \u201cBegin New Action\u201d result type  that is linked to an Action for completing a Notification of Overdues. Those two instances may be handled with different Actions because the reporting requirements are different for disputed invoices and accounts receivable that are overdue without reason (i.e., a Past Due Report is different than a Notification of Overdues). And those Actions may include completing a Overdues Report  () to generate the appropriate Past Due Report and\/or Notification of Overdues, as discussed in more detail below with respect to the Overdues Notification Functionality of the present invention.","Upon completing the appropriate Action at step , the applications server  determines whether the credit insurer that provided the subject credit insurance policy is registered within the system  at step . If the credit insurer is registered within the system , the applications server  will automatically submit the Past Due Report or Notification of Overdues to that credit insurer at step  via electronic data exchanges with the credit insurer system  maintained by that credit insurer. And if a credit insurer is NOT registered within the system , the user will need to manually submit the Past Due Report or Notification of Overdues with that credit insurer at step  via e-mail, ground mail, facsimile, filling out fields in a web page, or other suitable manual process. In either instance, the applications server  can be used during the step  to automatically complete Past Due Report forms or Notification of Overdues forms that are available electronically by auto-populating fields in those forms with any corresponding data for the subject customer and debtor  stored on the central database by the database server . Upon submitting the completed Past Due Report or Notification of Overdues at step  or , the Action illustrated in  is closed at step .","The Milestones  and Activities  for carrying out steps - of the Action, or account reporting process, illustrated in  may be defined with the wizard functionality of the present invention in a similar manner as that described above with respect to  and . In a similar manner, other Actions, Milestones , and Activities  can also be defined to remediate and\/or prevent almost any issue that may arise with respect to a non-compliance issues, such as submitting AR Aging Reports, paying premiums, filing claims, and submitting evidence of insurability. Those Actions, Milestones , and Activities  can be defined by a user via the wizard functionality provided with the system , they can be downloaded from the provider of the system , and\/or they can be predefined by the provider of the system and provided as part of the system .","As should be understood from the description above, the processes of the Compliance Monitoring will intertwine with the processes of the Coverage Goal Functionality in some instances. For example, if a customer is out of compliance with one or more of the terms and\/or conditions of its credit insurance policy or policies, coverage may be canceled or reduced for one or more of that customer's debtors. As a result, the customer may then fail to meet one or more of its Coverage Goals (see, e.g., , Debtors C and E). Accordingly, the process required to bring the customer back into compliance with the terms and conditions of its credit insurance policy or policies may be the same as the processes required to help meet that customer's Coverage Goals (e.g., a process for appealing a cancellation or reduction of coverage, a process for satisfying a reporting requirement, a process for establishing the insurability of a debtor, etc.).","However, the processes of the Compliance Monitoring Functionality will preferably identify and remediate any potential out-of-compliance issues with the customer credit insurance policy or policies before coverage is cancelled or reduced for any debtors so as to ensure the payability of claims for those debtors. And the processes of the Coverage Goal Functionality will preferably identify whether any gaps in that coverage exist when the customer is in compliance with all of the terms and conditions of its credit insurance policy or policies so as to ensure that customer's Coverage Goals are being met. For example, the Compliance Monitoring Functionality will identify when outstanding accounts receivable may result in the cancellation or reduction of coverage, and the Coverage Goal Functionality will identify when those outstanding accounts receivable are in amounts larger than the largest amounts covered by the customer's credit insurance policies. In that way, the Compliance Monitoring Functionality and the Coverage Goal Functionality work together to proactively ensure the payability of a customer's claims in amounts commensurate with that customer's Coverage Goals before any such claims arise.","c. Claim Filing Functionality","Using automated processes similar to those described above with respect to the Coverage Goal Functionality and the Compliance Monitoring Functionality, the Claim Filing Functionality automatically completes and files claims on a customer's credit insurance policy or policies as those claims arise. More specifically, the applications server  digitally processes a customer's accounts receivable information when it is imported from that customer's AR system , compares it to the terms and conditions of the customer's credit insurance policy or policies, and identifies instances where a claim should be filed, such as when a debtor has accounts receivable past due for more than a specific period of time (e.g., 91 to 120 days). In that instance, the applications server  will generate an Alert that identifies the situation and asks the customer whether it would like to file a \u201cprotracted default\u201d claim for the overdue amount. If the customer chooses to file the claim, the applications server  will automatically complete the Milestones required complete and file the appropriate claim form and\/or it will walk the customer, or another user, through those Milestones. Even if some user input is required to complete the claim form, the applications server  will preferably auto-populate all of the fields in the form for which data is available within the system . And the claim form will preferably be filed electronically via electronic data exchanges between the applications server  and the appropriate credit insurer system .","As another example, the applications server  will also generate an Alert and complete the Milestones for completing and filing a claim when a bankruptcy notice is received for a debtor. That notification may be received from a credit insurer system  or the customer's AR system . Because the applications server  is interfaced with a plurality of credit insurer systems  within the system , that notification need not be received from the credit insurer system  of the credit insurer that is providing credit insurance to the customer that has the debtor that declared bankruptcy. Instead, it can be received from the credit insurer system  of any credit insurer that has provided coverage to that debtor. In that way, the Claim Filing Functionality provides an extra degree of safety for identifying bankruptcy situations.","As  illustrates, the Claim Filing Functionality of the present invention generates a graphical display, or Claims Report , that provides a user (e.g., a customer, broker, account manager, administrator, etc.) with an overview of the state\/status of all of the debtors that are either in protracted default or that have declared bankruptcy. The Claims Report  includes a \u201cSlow Pay\u201d list  that lists the all of the debtors identified as having accounts receivable past due for more than a specific period of time and a \u201cBankruptcy\u201d list  that lists all of the debtors with overdue accounts receivable identified as having bankruptcy status. Each of those lists  and  includes summary data from which the user can quickly assess why an Alert was generated and whether to file a claim for the overdue amounts for specific debtors. For example, both lists  and  include the number of days the user has remaining to file a claim for the overdue amount, the customer's current coverage, and the date of the latest AR Aging Report for each debtor with overdue accounts receivable. The \u201cSlow Pay\u201d list  further includes the overdue amounts for each debtor for different time periods, while the \u201cBankruptcy\u201d list  further includes the total outstanding amount for each bankrupt debtor. Based on that summary data, the user can decide whether and when to file a claim, which he or she can do by clicking on or otherwise selecting a \u201cFile Claim\u201d button  provided for each debtor. And by including the number of days left to file a claim, the Claims Report  allows the user to see the timeframe for submitting such claims, thereby ensuring that those claims are submitted in time to be payable.","The Milestones that define how to complete and file such claims are defined by the terms and conditions of the customer's credit insurance policy or policies, just as the Milestones for complying with reporting requirements, are defined by those terms and conditions, as discussed above. And where user input is required, those Milestones may navigate a user to a graphical display where that user can input any information not available within the system  into a claim form using a graphical user interface . Thus, while the Coverage Goal Functionality and the Compliance Monitoring Functionality ensure that the customer has the appropriate amount of insurance coverage and that the claims under that coverage are payable, the Claim Filing Functionality ensures that those claims are filed accurately and on time.","d. Overdues Notification Functionality","As discussed above, some overdue accounts receivable may be overdue because one or more debtors disputed an invoice. And to ensure the payability of a claim on any subsequent accounts receivable that become overdue, it may be necessary for the customer to report the disputed overdue accounts receivable to an insurer within a certain time frame to obtain authorization to continue shipping goods to the debtor with whom the dispute exists. Accordingly, the Invoice Dispute Functionality of the present invention allows a user to report those disputed invoices before filing a claim for any overdue accounts receivable. That functionality not only allows a user to ensure the payability of a claim when it comes due, it also allows the user parse out which portions of their overdue accounts receivable are the result of disputed invoices so they can be dealt with accordingly.","As  illustrates, the Invoice Dispute Functionality of the present invention generates a graphical display, or Overdues Report , that provides a user (e.g., a customer, broker, account manager, administrator, etc.) with an overview of all of a customer's overdue accounts receivable, including which portions of those overdue accounts receivable are the result of a disputed invoice. The Overdues Report  includes similar formation as that listed in the Claims Report , except that it further includes disputed amount fields , approved amount fields , and notes  fields. Data can be manually input into those fields - by a user via a user interface  and\/or the applications server  can auto-populate data into those fields - with data consumed from commercial dispute notices and\/or bankruptcy notices that have been imported and\/or loaded into the system  of the present invention. That data is then used to generate Past Due Reports and\/or Notifications of Overdues for sending to the credit insurers  that provide coverage for the subject debtors ","In , for example, Debtor A disputed an invoice for $9,000 (e.g., Disputed Amount: $9,000 at 61-90 Days), which the customer has already reported to Insurer A. As a result, in Insurer A allowed Debtor A to continue shipping goods to Debtor A (e.g., Approved by Insurer A: $9,000 at 61-90 Days). Unfortunately, however, Debtor A has not made a payment since the dispute invoice and has even disputed another invoice (e.g., Disputed Amount: $355 at 1-30 Days). Accordingly, the user may need to send Insurer A a Past Due Report and Notification of Overdues for Debtor A. If Insurer A is registered within the system  of the present invention, the applications server  will automatically generate and submit the Past Due Report and Notification of Overdues to Insurer A using the information in the Overdues Report  in combination with other information available within the system . In the alternative, the user can choose to generate and submit the Past Due Report and Notification of Overdues by clicking on or otherwise selecting the \u201cCreate Notification\u201d button  at the bottom of the Overdues Report . Even in the latter instance, the applications server  preferably auto-populates all of the fields in the Past Due Report form and the Notification of Overdues form for which the corresponding data is available within the system.","Also in , Debtor C has disputed an invoice (e.g., Disputed Amount: $9,000 at 61-90 Days) and failed to pay subsequent invoices. And Debtors B and D have failed to pay invoices (e.g., $26,734 at 31-60 Days and $24,885 at 61-90 Days, respectively) due to bankruptcy. Debtors B and D are covered by Insurer A and Debtor C is covered by Insurer B. Accordingly, the user may also need to send Insurers A and B Past Due Reports and Notifications of Overdues. The applications server  can automatically group the data for all of the debtors that correspond to the same insurer so as to generate and submit a single Past Due Report and single Notification of Overdues for all of those debtors, thereby making the notifications process more efficient. Similarly, if the user chooses to generate and submit the Past Due Report and Notification of Overdues by clicking on or otherwise selecting the \u201cCreate Notification\u201d button , he or she can group the data for multiple debtors into a single Past Due Report and\/or single Notification of Overdues by selecting the check boxes  provided beside each of the debtors' names that correspond to a specific insurer (e.g., Debtors A, B, and D for Insurer A). At any point in that process, the user can save the data input into the Overdues Report  and exit the Overdues Notification Functionality by selecting the \u201cSave\u201d button  at the bottom of the Overdues Report , or he or she can exit the Overdues Notification Functionality without saving that data by selecting the \u201cCancel\u201d button  at the bottom of the Overdues Report .","The Milestones that define how to generate and submit such Past Due Reports and Notifications of Overdues are discussed above with respect to the Compliance Monitoring Functionality of the present invention. The Overdues Report  can be used to receive user input to complete one or more of those Milestones and\/or to display data gathered and input by the applications server  while completing those Milestones. And although not shown in , those Overdues Reports  can include a field that lists the days left to file a Past Due Report and\/or Notification of Overdues to ensure they are filed within the time line established by the terms and conditions of a customer credit insurance policy or policies. Completing those Milestones in a timely manner, and therefore completing those Past Due Reports and\/or Notifications of Overdues in a timely manner, helps customer's obtain approval to continue goods to debtors that have disputed invoices and ensure the payability of claims on overdue accounts receivable for debtors who are bankrupt or in protracted default. Thus, the Overdues Notification Functionality performs as part of the Compliance Monitoring Functionality to help ensure that claims under a customer's credit insurance policy or policies are payable.","e. Dashboard Functionality","As  illustrates, the Dashboard Functionality of the present invention generates a graphical display, or Dashboard , that provides a user (e.g., a customer, broker, account manager, administrator, etc.) with an overview of the state\/status of all of the credit insurance policies to which that user has access. The Dashboard  includes a Status Bar  that identifies the different processes and\/or conditions for which the user wants to know the state\/status. And a status button  is provided below each corresponding process and\/or condition identified in the Status Bar  to provide a visual indicator to a user of each of those processes and\/or conditions. The user can define which processes and\/or conditions are identified in the Status Bar  based on its individual preferences, as well as the order in which they appear, for each credit insurance policy .","In the Dashboard , there are four potential colors for each status button  red, yellow, green, or white. And the meaning of each color depends on the process and\/or condition to which that status button  corresponds. But not every status button  will utilize every color. A brief description of the headings for the processes and\/or conditions illustrated in the Status Bar  of  is provided below along with exemplary meanings of the different colors that can be displayed in their respective status buttons .","The status button  under the \u201cCustomer Documents\u201d heading indicates whether the documents required to manage a customer's credit insurance policy or policies have been acquired, uploaded, and stored by the applications server . Those documents are generally acquired as part of a transition process during which a customer and\/or its credit insurance policy or polices  are introduced into, or registered with, the system  of the present invention. A green status button  indicates that all the documents are acquired, uploaded, and stored, while a red status button  indicates that one or more documents is missing beyond its due date. There need only be a single document missing for that status button  to be red. The due date for each document can be customized by the user as required, and a system administrator can define the list of documents required from each customer. By default, the documents that must be acquired, uploaded, and stored by the applications server  include a Broker of Record Later, an Application, a Credit Form, and a Credit Insurance Policy. But the list of documents can be defined differently based on the requirements and\/or preferences of the brokerage company utilizing the present invention.","The status button  under the \u201cTransition Processes\u201d heading indicates whether the required processes have been followed for introducing the customer and\/or its credit insurance policy or polices  into the system  of the present invention. A green status button  indicates that all of the appropriate steps of those processes have been completed by their respective due dates, while a red status button  indicates that one or more of those steps has not been completed by its due date. Only a single step need be incomplete for that status button  to be red. The process list can be defined by the system administrator, with each process step having a defined due date. Moreover, the transition process can be defined differently for different customers, credit insurance policies, types of coverage, and management companies (e.g., a licensed group of users).","The status button  under the \u201cPolicy Goal\u201d heading indicates whether a customer's Coverage Goals are currently being met. That determination is made by the Coverage Goal Functionality. A white status button  indicates that no Coverage Goal has been set for a credit insurer ; a green status button  indicates that all of the customer's Coverage Goals are being met; and a red status button  indicates that one or more of those Coverage Goals is not being met. There need only be a single Coverage Goal not met for that status button  to be red.","The status button  under the \u201cTrust Calls\u201d heading indicates whether periodic status calls have been completed. A green status button  indicates that the most recent status call has been completed and completed according to a defined process; and a red status button  indicates that the most recent status call has not occurred in the required timeframe, has been declined or missed by the parties mandatory to be on the call, or was not completed per the defined process. Those calls generally take place between the policy holder and either the broker, account manager, or someone assisting the policy holder with their credit insurance policy . And a system administrator can define the frequency of those calls, the type of calls (e.g., Initial, Mid-Term, Renewal, etc.), who is required on the calls (e.g., customer contacts, brokers, account managers, solution architects), as well as the information required to be documented for each of those calls.","The status button  under the \u201cOutstanding Actions\u201d heading indicates whether there are any Actions that need to be taken to bring one or more debtors back into compliance with the terms and conditions of the respective credit insurance policies  under which they are to be covered and\/or to ensure a customer's Coverage Goals are being met (e.g., appealing coverage decisions, requesting new credit limits, acquiring financial documents, etc.). And those Actions include completing the appropriate Milestones required to resolve any outstanding compliance issues -. A green status button  indicates that there are no outstanding Actions, while a red status button  indicates that there is one or more outstanding Action. There need only be a single outstanding Action for that status button  to be red.","The status button  under the \u201cPolicy Reporting\u201d heading indicates whether a customer is in compliance with the reporting requirements of its credit insurance policy or policies  (e.g., monthly AR Aging Report, weekly check-ins for disputed invoices, etc.). That determination is made by the Compliance Monitoring Functionality. A white status button  indicates that there are no reporting requirements; a green status button  indicates that there are not outstanding reports; and a red status button  indicates that there is one or more outstanding reports. There need only be a single outstanding report for that status button  to be red.","The status button  under the \u201cAging Documents\u201d heading indicates whether a customer's AR Aging Reports have been acquired, uploaded, and stored by the applications server  as required to enable the Coverage Goal Functionality and Compliance Monitoring Functionality. Accordingly, that determination is made by the Coverage Goal Functionality and Compliance Monitoring Functionality. And in certain instances, the Coverage Goal Functionality and Compliance Monitoring Functionality will require additional and\/or different AR Aging Reports any such reports that are required by a credit insurer  as part of its reporting requirements, which is why those documents are covered under a separate heading than reporting requirements. A green status button  indicates that current (e.g., within seven days of the prior month) AR Aging Reports have been acquired, uploaded, and stored for each of a customer's debtors, while aced status button  indicates that the current AR Aging Report has not been acquired, uploaded, and stored for one or more of a customer's debtors.","The status button  under the \u201cActive Alerts\u201d heading indicates whether a customer has received an Alert notification for a Coverage Goal that is not being met and\/or for a compliance issue - that remains \u201cOpen\u201d or is still \u201cIn Progress\u201d. That determination is made by the Coverage Goal Functionality and\/or the Compliance Monitoring Functionality. A green status button  indicates that all of the Milestones required to remediate the cause of any such Alerts have been completed such that the cause has been remediated; a yellow status button  indicates that all Milestones required to remediate the cause of any such Alerts up until that point have been completed, but that the user is awaiting some other Event to occur before it can proceed to the next Milestone; and a red status button  indicates that one or more Milestone for one or more Alert remains incomplete so that the Alert is still active. There need only be a single incomplete Milestone for a single Alert for that status button  to be red.","The status button  under the \u201cRenewal Process\u201d heading indicates whether a customer and\/or broker have taken the necessary steps to renew one or more of the customer's credit insurance policies . A user can view a list of those steps by clicking on or otherwise selecting the status button  under the \u201cRenewal Process\u201d heading. A yellow status button  indicates that a renewal process is coming due; a green status button  indicates that all the steps required up until that point have been taken to renew the customer credit insurance policy or policies ; and a red status button  indicates that one or more of those steps is past due. A user can define a default timeframe (e.g., two months) before a renewal process comes due at which the status button  will turn from green to yellow. There need only be a single past due step for a single credit insurance policy  for that status button  to be red. And although not illustrated, status buttons  with similar functionality may be provided under separate headings for rewriting or obtaining new credit insurance policies using the Quote Summary Functionality (e.g., \u201cRewriting Process\u201d and \u201cNew Policy Process\u201d headings). Or all three of those processes can be combined under a single heading (e.g., an \u201cApproval Process\u201d heading).","The status button  under the \u201cPolicy Competitiveness\u201d heading indicates how the customer's credit insurance policy or policies  compare in price to the overall market. That determination is made by the Policy Analysis Functionality. A green status button  indicates that the customer's credit insurance policy or policies  have a better than average pricing structure, while a red status button  indicates that the customer's credit insurance policy or policies  have a below average pricing structure.","Although the indications described above for each of the status buttons  is somewhat \u201cabsolute\u201d (i.e., a single instance of a certain Event will result in a red status button ), those indications may also be more \u201crelative\u201d. For example, the status button  under the \u201cPolicy Goal\u201d heading may indicate the percentage of the customer's Coverage Goals that are being met, wherein a green status button  indicates that 100% of the customer's Coverage Goals are being met; a yellow status button  indicates that 80% to 99% of the customer's Coverage Goals are being met; and a red status button  indicates that less than 80% of the customer's Coverage Goals are being met. The status button  under the \u201cPolicy Reporting\u201d heading may indicate the percentage of reporting requirements that are being met for the customer's credit insurance policy or policies, wherein a green status button  indicates that 85%-100% of those reporting requirements are being met; a yellow status button  indicates that 50%-85% of those reporting requirements are being met; and a red status button  indicates that 0%-50% of those reporting requirements are being met And the status button  under the \u201cPolicy Competitiveness\u201d heading may indicate how the customer's credit insurance policy or policies  score compared to other credit insurance policies in terms of pricing structure (i.e., based on its policy competitiveness score), wherein a green status button  indicates that the customer's credit insurance policy or policies  scored 7-10 on a scale of 1-10; a yellow status button  indicates that the customer's credit insurance policy or policies  scored 3-7 on a scale of 1-10; and a red status button  indicates that the customer's credit insurance policy or policies  scored 1-3 on a scale of 1-10. A user can set the ranges of percentages and scores and their corresponding colors as required to suit their specific needs and\/or desires.","Those \u201crelative\u201d indications will be the same as would be indicated in a semi-circular score meter  provided for the associated values, as discussed above with respect to the Competitiveness Report  () and below with respect to the Executive Overview  (). Accordingly, whatever color the needle  points to in one of those semi-circular score meters  will be the same color displayed in the corresponding status button  if the user chooses to display \u201crelative\u201d indications in the Status Bar . But because the user can choose between such \u201cabsolute\u201d and \u201crelative\u201d indications for any of the headings in the Status Bar , the user can choose to have \u201cabsolute\u201d indications in the Status Bar  and \u201crelative\u201d indications in other graphical displays (e.g., a Competitiveness Report  and or an Executive Overview ).","In addition, although some of the status buttons  described above provide indications for overlapping items, they are provided as separate status buttons  because they also provide indications for different items, which allows a user to make quick and intuitive determinations based on different combinations of status buttons . In , for example, the status buttons  under the \u201cCustomer Documents\u201d, \u201cTransition Process\u201d, \u201cTrust Calls\u201d, \u201cPolicy Reporting\u201d, \u201cAging Documents\u201d, and \u201cRenewal Process\u201d headings are green; the status buttons  under the \u201cActive Alerts\u201d and \u201cPolicy Competitiveness\u201d headings are yellow; and the status buttons  under the \u201cPolicy Goal\u201d and \u201cOutstanding Actions\u201d headings are red. Because the status buttons  under the \u201cPolicy Reporting\u201d and \u201cAging Documents\u201d headings are green, a user can intuit that the red indicator button  under the \u201cOutstanding Action\u201d heading was not caused by an unsatisfied reporting requirement or a missing AR Aging Report. And because the only other red indicator button  is under the \u201cPolicy Goal Heading\u201d, the only apparent reason for the red indicator button  under the \u201cOutstanding Action\u201d is a policy goal that is not being met.","The yellow indicator button  under the \u201cActive Alerts\u201d heading helps a user further intuit the potential issue by indicating that the user is waiting for some Event to occur before completing whatever outstanding Action there may be with respect to the customer's Coverage Goals. And the green status button  under the \u201cRenewal Process\u201d heading indicates that the user has indicates that all the steps required up until that point to obtain approval for a rewritten, renewed, or new credit insurance policy or policies. Accordingly, a user is awaiting approval of a rewritten, renewed, or new credit insurance policy to satisfy the policy goal that is not being met. Upon approval and purchase of that policy, the status buttons  under the \u201cPolicy Goal\u201d, \u201cOutstanding Balance\u201d, and \u201cActive Alerts\u201d headings should turn green.","As described in the example above, the indications of the status buttons  in the Dashboard  can be used to quickly and intuitively determine the state of a customer's coverage. That process can be personalized for any user by selecting different types of indications (i.e., \u201cabsolute\u201d or \u201crelative\u201d) for different status buttons  and by selecting different combinations of processes and\/or conditions (i.e., \u201cCustomer Documents\u201d, \u201cTransition Process\u201d, \u201cPolicy Goal\u201d, etc.) to which those indications correspond. A user can further personalize its Dashboard by adding other pertinent information, such as the credit insurer  and credit insurance policy or policies  for which state\/status is being indicated by the status buttons , the renewal\/expiration date  of that credit insurance policy or polices , and the premium amount  of that credit insurance policy or policies . And although state\/status is only being indicated for one credit insurance policy in the Dashboard  of , a user may select any number of credit insurance policies  to appear in the Dashboard . Each different credit insurance policy  may have its own Status Bar  and status buttons , they may share a Status Bar  and have separate status buttons , or they may share both a Status Bar  and status buttons , wherein the state\/status indicated by those status buttons  will correspond to the cumulative state\/status of the different credit insurance policies .","The Dashboard  not only provides a central point at which a user can determine the state\/status of all of the credit insurance policies to which it has access, it also provides a central point from which that user can navigate obtain additional information about the state\/status of those credit insurance policies. More specifically, upon clicking on or otherwise selecting any of the status buttons  in the Dashboard , the applications server  will automatically navigate the user to a graphical display that provides more detailed information about the process and\/or condition to which that status button  corresponds. For example, selecting the status button  under the \u201cPolicy Goal\u201d heading may navigate the user to a Gap Report  (); selecting the status button  under the \u201cOutstanding Actions\u201d heading may navigate the user to an Action Report  (); selecting the status button  under the \u201cPolicy Reporting\u201d or \u201cAging Documents\u201d heading may navigate the user to a Required Reporting Report  (); selecting the status button  under the \u201cActive Alerts\u201d heading may navigate the user to am Issues Report  (); selecting the status button  under the \u201cRenewal Process\u201d heading may navigate the user to a Quote Comparison Report  (); and selecting the status button  under the \u201cPolicy Competitiveness\u201d heading may navigate the user to a Competitiveness Report  (). And when the selected status button  is red or yellow, the applications server  will preferably navigate the user to the graphical display that corresponds to the reason that status button  is red or yellow.","A user can configure the Dashboard  so that it is displayed at the top of any graphical display that the user is viewing (e.g., Debtor Analysis Reports , Credit Insurer Market Analyses , Policy Reports , Competitiveness Reports , Quote Comparison Reports , Gap Reports , Debtor Lists , Issues Reports , Action Reports , Required Reporting Reports , etc.). In , for example, the Dashboard  is displayed at the top of a Gap Report . In that way, the user can monitor the state\/status of its credit insurance policy or policies  at all times while working within the system . And because the status buttons  are updated in real time, the user will see those status buttons  change color as Milestones are completed while working within those different graphical displays.","As also illustrated , a Menu Bar  may be provided at the top of any graphical display that the user is viewing. By clicking on or otherwise selecting tabs in the Menu Bar , a user can navigate from one graphical display to another. For example, selecting the following tabs will navigate a user as described:\n\n","Together with the Dashboard , the Menu Bar  allows a user to navigate from one graphical display to another within the system  as required to view various information, complete various tasks, and make various decisions in an effective and efficient manner. More specifically, the Dashboard  and the Menu Bar  allow a user to quickly identify any problems a customer is having with meeting its Coverage Goals and\/or complying with the terms and conditions of its credit insurance policies and to navigate to the appropriate graphical display to take the appropriate Action to remediate those issues. The Dashboard  and the Menu Bar  also enable a user to quickly compare a customer's current credit insurance policy or policies against market information to determine if that policy or those policies are optimized for that customer's specific needs and\/or desires. In other words, the Dashboard Functionality further streamlines the already-improved processes of the present invention.","f. Executive Summary Functionality","As  illustrated, the Dashboard Functionality of the present invention generates a graphical display, or Executive Overview , that provides a user (e.g., a customer, broker, account manager, administrator, etc.) with a Summary view of the various other graphical displays provided by the present invention. Preferably, those summary views include less information than the graphical displays they represent so as to provide a simple visual summary of the information in those graphical displays, such as in the form of bar charts or scaled meters. One or more of those summary views may also include all of the same information provided in the graphical displays they represent. And one or more of those views may also summarize data for a plurality of graphical displays of a similar type. A user can select what information from what graphical displays are provided in the Executive Overview  as required to suit its needs and\/or desires.","In , for example, the user has elected to display in a summary view \u2032 all of the information from a Competitiveness Report ; the user has elected to display in a summary view \u2032 the actual coverage provided  and a list of debtors  without the desired amount of coverage from a Gap Report , further electing to display the actual coverage provided  on a on a color-coded, semi-circular score meter rather than as a numerical value; the user has elected to display in a summary view \u2032 the percentage of debtors in compliance with their respective credit insurance policies and a list debtors that are not in compliance from a Debtor List , further electing to display that percentage on a on a color-coded, semi-circular score meter rather than as a numerical value; the user has elected to list in a summary view \u2032 a plurality of Actions with \u201cOpen\u201d action items from a plurality of the customer's Issues Reports ; and the user has elected to display in a summary view \u2032 the percentage of a customer's reporting requirements have been satisfied from one or more Required Reporting Reports , further electing to display that percentage only for Named Debtor policies. The user can click on or otherwise select the \u201cClick for Details\u201d link within the Gap Report  summary view \u2032, the Debtor List  summary view \u2032, and the Required Reporting Reports  summary view \u2032 to view the information not included in those views. And the user can click on or otherwise select any one of the action items listed in the Issues Reports  summary view \u2032 to access the Action Report  for that action item. Accordingly, the Executive Overview  provides similar drill down functionality to the Dashboard  and the Menu Bar , allowing the user to quickly navigate from one graphical display to another as required to optimize a customer's credit insurance policy or policies.","V. Brokerage Module","The Brokerage Module provides functionality to a user for generating aggregated statistical information on a plurality of different customers and their respective credit insurance policies. That information can be used by brokers, partners, and other organizations with access to multiple customers' credit insurance policies to assist them with the management of their territories, their account managers, and the representatives managing their customers' accounts. That information is generated and provided to such users in a graphical display, or report, at a user interface . Such graphical displays preferably include tables and\/or graphs that summarize the information the user has selected to view.","A user can select the specific information that will be provided in each of those graphical displays from any of the data captured by the applications server  (e.g., customer information, credit insurer information, accounts receivable information, credit insurance policy information, market information, etc.). That information will be used to populate rows and columns in a table and\/or to generate graphs. And the user can select how that data is arranged\/presented in the table and\/or graph by selecting one type of information as reference data and selecting other types of data as the related data. The reference data will form the first column, or reference column, of a table and\/or the reference axis of a graph, and the related data will form the adjacent columns, or quantity columns, of a table and\/or the quantities displayed in a graph, with descriptions of each of those types of information forming the top row, or header row, of the table and\/or the legends of the graph. And the user can select the reference column and\/or header row of the table to be different than the reference axis and\/or legends of the graph in each graphical display. A user can also select how that information is filtered and sorted within each of those graphical displays.","In , a user has created a graphical display, or Broker Report , that provides data on how well a plurality of account managers are performing according to the broker that is managing them. And in , a user has created a graphical display, or Account Manager Report , that provides data on how well a specific account manager is performing. More specifically, the user has created graphical displays  and  that provide aggregated summary data on how well various account managers are keeping up with completing the tasks required to satisfy their respective customers' Coverage Goals and to keep those customers in compliance with their respective credit insurance policies. That summary data has been aggregated on a week-to-week basis.","To aggregate the data in  on a week-to-week basis, the user has selected the information type for the reference column  of a table as weekly dates and has selected the information type for the quantity columns  of the table as the quantity of customers for which the corresponding account managers are responsible; the quantity of documents required to manage those customers' credit insurance policy or policies that have been acquired, uploaded, and stored; the quantity of required processes that have been followed for introducing those customers and\/or their credit insurance policy or polices into the system  of the present invention; the quantity of those customers' Coverage Goals that are being met; the quantity of status calls that have occurred as required for compliance with those customers' credit insurance policies; the quantity of outstanding Actions that need to be taken to satisfy those customers' Coverage goals and\/or to bring those customers back into compliance with their credit insurance policies; the quantity of reporting requirements for those customers that have been met; the quantity of AR Aging reports that have been acquired, uploaded, and stored for those customers; the quantity of Alerts for those customers that still include Milestones that need to be completed; and the quantity of policy renewal requests that have been submitted for those customers. The data in the quantity columns  is aggregated and displayed according to the corresponding date in the reference column . And a description of the data in each of those columns  and  is provided in a header row  (i.e., \u201cDate\u201d, \u201cCustomers\u201d, \u201cCustomer Documents\u201d, \u201cTransition Process\u201d, \u201cCoverage Goals\u201d, \u201cTrust Calls\u201d, \u201cOutstanding Actions\u201d, \u201cPolicy Reporting\u201d, \u201cAging Documents\u201d, \u201cActive Alerts\u201d, and \u201cRenewal Process\u201d, respectively).","Also in , the user has selected the information type for the legends  of graph as the weekly dates and has selected the information type for the plotted quantities  of the table as the quantity of customers for which the corresponding account managers are responsible; the quantity of documents required to manage those customers credit insurance policy or policies that have been acquired, uploaded, and stored; the quantity of required processes that have been followed for introducing those customers and\/or their credit insurance policy or polices into the system  of the present invention; the quantity of status calls that have occurred as required for compliance with those customers' credit insurance policies; the quantity of reporting requirements for those customers that have been met; and the quantity of AR Aging reports that have been acquired, uploaded, and stored for those customers. The quantities  plotted in the graph correspond to the quantities in the table for those types of information. But all of the data provided in the table need not be plotted in the graph. Instead, as illustrated in , the user can select the specific data from the table that will be plotted in the graph. In that way, the user can obtain both a tabular and graphical representation of various data.","Although the table and graph in  display data for the same types of information, they display different data based on different filtering options . In the Broker Report  of , for example, the user has selected to view all of the data for all of the account managers for which Broker A is responsible (i.e., Account Manager(s): Broker A (All)). And in the Account Manager Report  of , the user has selected to view all of data for only Manager D (i.e., Account Manager(s): Manage D (All)). The user may also filter that data by any other logical grouping (e.g., organization, region, country, area, policy type, etc), such as by the Named credit insurance policies managed by a specific broker (e.g., Account Manager(s): Broker A (Named)). Moreover, a customer can sort the data within each table after it is created based on the content of the data provided in different columns  and  (e.g., alphabetically, numerically, temporally, etc.). In , the data is sorted temporally based on the dates in the reference column , but they may also be sorted by the quantities in any of the quantity columns .","In addition, although the graph in  is a bar graph, any other suitable graph may be generated as desired by the user. For example, the user can choose to create pie charts and line graphs similar to those illustrated in . Accordingly, the user can also use the Brokerage Module to create tables and graphs for a plurality of customers that include similar information to that described with respect to .","In , a user has created a graphical display, or Carrier Summary , that provides data on the various credit insurance policies under its control. More specifically, the user has created a graphical display  that provides aggregated summary data on the number customers with credit insurance policies from different credit insurers as well as the average and total values for the premiums paid on those policies. That graphical display  also provides data on which of those credit insurance policies are new policies and when those new policies were obtained. That data has been aggregated for each of a plurality of credit insurers, with the totals  for all of the corresponding quantities being provided at the bottom of each quantity column .","The Carrier Summary  of  can be created in substantially the same manner described above with respect to the Broker Report  of  and the Account Manager Report  of . In the Carrier Summary  of , however, the user has not selected a filtering option , so the data provided includes information for the credit insurance policies of all the brokers, account managers, etc. for which that user is responsible. In addition, the user has defined two different types of quantity columns \u2014one for \u201cTotal Policies\u201d and one for \u201cNew Policies\u201d. A user can create different types of quantity columns  by grouping those columns  as they are selected and naming those groups. The names of those groups will appear in a separate header row \u2032 so as to properly identify those groups, as illustrated in . A user can group rows in a similar manner.","In , a user has created a graphical display, or Activity Summary , that provides data on the Actions being taken on the various credit insurance policies under its control. More specifically, the user has created a graphical display  that provides aggregated summary data on the number of cancellations, claims denials, and coverage reductions have been appealed in the credit insurance policies for which that user is responsible. That graphical display  also provides aggregated summary data on the number of requests for new credit limits and the number of claims filed on those credit insurance policies. That data has been aggregated based on the status of those Actions (i.e., \u201cOpen,\u201d \u201cSuccessful\u201d, or \u201cUnsuccessful\u201d), with the totals for all of the corresponding quantities being provided at the bottom of each quantity column . The user has not selected a filtering option .","The Activity Summary  of  can be created in substantially the same manner described above with respect to the Broker Report  of , the Account Manager Report  of , and the Carrier Summary  of . In the Activity Summary  of , however, the user has further selected to add a custom row  in which the percentage of \u201cSuccessful\u201d Actions is provided. A user can create custom rows  by defining equations that use cells from the reference column  and\/or the quantity columns  to calculate a desired value e.g., [\u201cSuccessful\u201d Row\/(\u201cSuccessful\u201d Row+\u201cUnsuccessful\u201d Row)* 100]=\u201cSuccess %\u201d). The user can name such custom rows  to describe the result of that equation (e.g., \u201cSuccess %\u201d), with the corresponding name appearing in the reference column . The user can define custom columns (not shown) in a similar manner as required to suit its needs and\/or desires. Accordingly, the Brokerage Module not only provides functionality for a user to create graphical displays that include any of the data captured by the applications server , it also provides functionality for a user to manipulate that data with user-defined equations and to display the results of those equations.","In , a user has created a graphical display, or Renewal Summary , that provides renewal data for the various credit insurance policies under its control. More specifically, the user has created a graphical display  that provides aggregated summary data on the number of credit insurance policies coming up for renewal in the next thirty, sixty, or ninety days. That graphical display  also provides aggregated summary data on the number credit insurance policies for which renewals have been completed in the past thirty days as well as the number of credit insurance policies for which renewal was not sought and\/or obtained. That data has been aggregated for each of a plurality of credit insurers, with the totals for all of the corresponding quantities being provided at the bottom of each quantity column . The user has not selected a filtering option .","The Renewal Summary  of  can be created in substantially the same manner described above with respect to the Broker Report  of , the Account Manager Report  of , the Carrier Summary  of , and the Activity Summary  of . Accordingly, a user can add additional quantity columns  (e.g., adding \u201cNumber of Customers\u201d, \u201cAverage Premium\u201d, and \u201cTotal Premium\u201d columns), remove quantity columns  (e.g., removing the \u201cNon-Renewals\u201d column), and\/or combine quantity columns  (e.g., combining the \u201cNext 30 Days\u201d, \u201cNext 60 Days\u201d, and \u201cNext 90 Days\u201d columns in the Renewal Summary  into a single \u201cNext 90 Days\u201d column that includes all of the credit insurance policies coming due in the next ninety days) as required to suit its needs and\/or desires. The user can also separate the information in the Renewal Summary  into separate groups that are identified by a separate header row \u2032 and\/or add custom rows  or custom columns the Renewal Summary .","In , a user has created a graphical display, or Coverage Stability Summary , that provides data on the propensity of a credit insurer to provide and maintain credit limits on debtors. More specifically, the user has created a graphical display  that provides aggregated summary data on the number of customers, the number of requests for coverage filed by those customers, the number of claims filed by those customers, and the number of those claims that were paid. That graphical display  also provides aggregated summary data on the number of cancellations, reductions, denials, and partial approvals of coverage. That data has been aggregated for a specific time period (i.e., Jan. 1, 2010, through Dec. 31, 2010) and includes the associated dollar amounts and percentages for each of those items of data. As  illustrates, although Insurer C has not canceled many credit limits (i.e., Percent Cancelled=5.7%) or denied many claims (i.e., Percent Denied=12.5%), coverage appears somewhat difficult to obtain from that credit insure (i.e., Percent Denied=46.7% and Percent Partially Approve=24.4%, leaving only 29.9% fully approved).","Each of the graphical displays , , , , , and  discussed above can be customized by a user as required to suit its needs and\/or desires using the functionality of the Broker Module. For example, the user can select any data captured by the applications server  to display, group columns and rows of data, create custom columns and rows of data, add\/remove\/combine columns and rows of data, and add and\/or remove different types of graphs in each of those graphical displays , , , , , and . And because the user can do that for a plurality of different customers, the Broker Module is particularly useful for performing statistical analyses of the activities of brokers and the account managers that those brokers manage. But, while that functionality is described as being provided in the Broker Module, that description is of a preferred embodiment. Accordingly, it should be understood that the functionality in the Broker Module may also be provided in any other software modules and\/or shared between any of number of software modules without departing from the spirit of the present invention.","VI. Summary","Together, the Marketplace Module, the Goal\/Compliance Module, and the Broker Module provide the functionality required to efficiently and effectively optimize credit insurance policies. More particularly, that functionality enables potential policyholders to obtain and maintain credit insurance policies with the maximum amount of coverage desired, the maximum payability of covered claims, and the maximum coverage available relative to the premium paid. And that functionality operates in real time to ensure that those credit insurance policies remain optimized by immediately identifying any Events that might affect optimization and alerting a user of those Events so the user can take the appropriate Action required to return its policy or policies to the optimized state. Moreover, that functionality provides automated processes for automatically implementing the appropriate steps for taking those Actions and\/or for walking the user through the appropriate steps for taking those Actions. And if the present invention is not able to automate or walk a user through those steps, the system  of the present invention is supported by over two hundred back office servicing people around the world that will help the user identify and take those steps.","In practice, the present invention has proven very successful in maintaining optimization of credit insurance policies. For example, the present invention has been used to overturn 62% of coverage cancellations and 68% of coverage denials. And approximately 91.5% of claims filed via the system  of the present invention were paid as compared to an industry average of 65%. Those improved results were achieved because the present invention takes a proactive approach to monitoring compliance issues instead of waiting until after a claim is denied to negotiate with a carrier and appeal a decision.","In addition, there are over eighteen vendors worldwide that offer credit insurance and other types of accounts receivable protection. Accordingly, the task of looking at all options and combinations of options to ensure the optimal value of a customer's coverage would be near impossible without the automated functionality of the present invention. Moreover, allowing customers to choose from all of those options and combinations of options forces the carriers to compete for customers' business.","The foregoing description and drawings should be considered as illustrative only of the principles of the invention. The invention may be configured in a variety of ways and is not intended to be limited by the preferred embodiment. And numerous applications of the invention will readily occur to those skilled in the art. It is therefore not desired to limit the invention to the specific examples disclosed or the exact construction and operation shown and described. Rather, all suitable modifications and equivalents may be resorted to, falling within the scope of the invention."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["Many aspects of the present invention can be better understood with reference to the accompanying drawings, which are part of the specification and represent exemplary embodiments of the present invention.
