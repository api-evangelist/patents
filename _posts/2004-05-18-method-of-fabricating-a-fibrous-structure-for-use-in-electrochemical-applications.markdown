title: Method of fabricating a fibrous structure for use in electrochemical applications
abstract: A method is provided for the fabrication of a fibrous structure. Fibers are deposited in a hopper connected to an electrode. A mesh covers the hopper opening and the hopper is inverted and suspended over an adhesive coated substrate. An electric field is generated between the hopper and the substrate while the hopper is simultaneously shaken. As a result, fibers fall through the mesh, aligned along the electric field lines, travel through the electric field, and are coupled on one end thereof to the adhesive.

Kim, Russell R. Bessette, Michelle M. Dunnell, and Charles J. Patrissi, of whom Russell R. Bessette and Yong K. Kim are common inventors as to this application.","(1) Field of the Invention","The present invention relates generally to methods of manufacturing fibrous structures, and more particularly to a method that utilizes flocking for the fabrication of a fibrous structure that can be used in a variety of electrochemical applications such as an electrode or as a catalyst support.","(2) Description of the Prior Art","A variety of underwater operations are being tasked to unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs). Ideally, the UUVs would utilize an onboard energy source that has a high energy density. Further, it is preferred that the energy source be reusable, efficient, cost effective, environmentally and operationally safe, have a long shelf life and not be prone to spontaneous chemical or electrochemical discharge.","Currently, a standard benchmark energy source for underwater applications is the zinc\/silver oxide (Zn\/AgO) electrochemical couple. However, the low energy density of this material prevents it from being the ultimate onboard energy source for the variety of underwater operations being tasked to UUVs. An energy source that has up to seven times the energy density of zinc\/silver oxide batteries is needed to meet the performance demands of low-power long endurance applications for UUVs.","In order to meet the need for a higher energy density material for use as an energy source for underwater applications, researchers are developing separated flow semi-fuel cells having an anode and a replenishable cathode. For underwater applications, semi-fuel cells are being developed that exhibit efficient usage of an electroactive species such as hydrogen peroxide for the replenishable cathode. The high operational demands of these semi-fuel cells requires concentration polarization at the cathode surface to be reduced while increasing hydrogen peroxide utilization. One way of accomplishing this is to provide a cathode that has a fibrous surface (i.e., like the bristles of a brush) resulting in a higher surface area cathode.","Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a method of fabricating a fibrous structure with a high surface area.","Another object of the present invention is to provide a method of fabricating a fibrous structure for use in electrochemical applications.","Other objects and advantages of the present invention will become more obvious hereinafter in the specification and drawings.","In accordance with the present invention, a method is provided for the fabrication of a fibrous structure. In this method, a first electrode is fixed to the base of a hopper. A plurality of fibers is deposited into the hopper. Then a plastic mesh is secured over the hopper opening. The hopper is then inverted and suspended over an adhesive-coated substrate onto which the fibers are to be flocked. The substrate lies on a second electrode. Using this configuration, the fibers in the hopper lie on the plastic mesh. An electric field is then applied between the second electrode on which the substrate to be flocked lies and the electrode in the hopper. Concurrently, the hopper is shaken to facilitate the passing of the fibers through the mesh. As a result, at least a portion of the fibers leave the first electrically-conductive surface, accelerate through the electric field and are coupled on one end thereof to the adhesive. Once the substrate has been flocked and the adhesive cures, an electrochemical catalyst material is deposited on the fibers.","Referring now to the drawings, and more particularly to , the apparatus used to fabricate a fibrous structure in accordance with the present invention is shown and referenced generally by numeral . Fabrication apparatus  can be used to make fibrous structures for a variety of applications to include electrodes or catalyst supports for fuel cells, semi-fuel cells, batteries, capacitors, electrochemical reactors, photovoltaic cells, or any other electrochemical cells requiring a large specific surface area such as that presented by a fibrous structure. The particular application will dictate the nature of the materials used for fabrication apparatus , and the ultimate fibrous structure that is made. Accordingly, it is to be understood that the present method is not limited to the particular examples that will be described herein.","In general, fabrication apparatus  is used as part of a method that arranges and applies material fibers onto a substrate. Initially, an electrode  is fixed to the base of a hopper . Loose fibers  are then selected based on the particular utilization of the fibrous structure. For example, the uniform diameter and length of the fibers  depend on the utilization of the fibrous structure. In a preferred embodiment, the fibers are essentially cylindrical in shape, 0.5\u20132.0 mm long and 5\u201312 \u03bcm in diameter. Longer fibers with larger diameters may prove more advantageous depending on the end use of the fibrous structure being fabricated. Similarly, the utilization of the fibrous structure determines the material and properties of fibers  such as whether or not they can be electrically conductive or non-conductive. For example, the fibers could be made from carbon when the fabricated structure is to be used as a catalyzed cathode in a semi-fuel cell as will be explained further below. Various forms of carbon could also be used when the fibrous structure is used for lithium insertion research. Fibers  could also be made from a metal oxide if the fibrous structure is to be used in a lithium-ion battery or in photovoltaic devices. Still further, fibers  could be made from various metals when the fibrous structure is to be used in organic electrochemistry or sensor applications.","A measured quantity of fibers  is selected in excess of the amount needed to create the fibrous structure in order to obtain optimum density of fibers . The quantity of fibers  is then pretreated to remove chemical impurities and possibly modify the surface of the fibers, and then heated to a sufficient temperature to remove all moisture so that the fibers  do not stick together in clumps. The fibers  are then spread loosely on the bottom of hopper .","Once the fibers  have been placed in hopper , a plastic mesh  is secured over the opening of hopper . The mesh  should be fine enough so that a fiber  can only fit through the mesh in a vertical and not a horizontal orientation as illustrated in .","A substrate  (the second electrode) that supports an electrically conductive surface A is positioned up to 20 centimeters beneath the hopper . As used herein, the term \u201celectrically conductive\u201d refers to materials that are either highly conductive (e.g., metals) or semi-conductive (e.g., semi-conducting materials and composites). Electrically conductive surface A can be made from a variety of materials (e.g., metals, graphite foil, conductive metal oxides such as indium-tin oxide, high density carbon, etc.) to suit a particular application.","The shape of substrate  can vary depending upon the intended use of the fabricated fibrous structure. In the embodiment illustrated in , the surface is flat and planar, however, it could also be curved, spherical, cylindrical, or string shaped. Accordingly, it is to be understood that the choice of shape for substrate  and consequently conductive surface A is not a limitation of the present invention.","Disposed on surface A is a layer of adhesive . Depending upon the physical consistency of surface A and whether or not adhesive  is wet, adhesive  may need to be applied in several coats. If surface A is very porous or absorbent, then several coatings of adhesive  may need to be applied to fully permeate surface A so that adhesive  is not simply adsorbed into substrate . Adhesive layer  can be any wet or dry adhesive applied or deposited on surface A that will hold fibers  in place as will be explained further below. Wet adhesives include printing inks that are commercially available in electrically conductive formulations. Application of adhesive layer  can be accomplished in several different ways. For example, application can be accomplished through the use of a Meyer rod. There are a series of Meyer rods with different numbers that permit application of different thickness of adhesive. Employing a draw down bar is an alternative means of application. The method of application known in the art as screen-printing is also a successful means of application. The goal is to dispose a thin uniform film of adhesive  on surface A.","Adhesive layer  can be electrically conductive or non-conductive depending on the fibrous structure application and\/or the ability of fibers  to make direct contact with electrically conductive surface A during the flocking process. In most cases the adhesive  should be chemically inert in its interaction with other materials. For example if the fibrous structure being fabricated is to be used as a catalyzed cathode in a semi-fuel cell, then the adhesive  should not react with the various electro-chemicals in the semi-fuel cell.","In operation, hopper  is inverted and suspended over substrate  to be flocked. Using this configuration, the fibers  in the hopper  lie on the mesh , not on the electrode . An electric field generator  is electrically coupled to electrode  and electrically conductive surface A. In general, electric field generator  applies a potential difference to surface A and electrode  such that an electric field is generated between them. As illustrated in , such an electric field generation can be achieved by applying a high voltage to electrode  and electrically coupling substrate  to ground potential. For safety, it is preferable that substrate  be made from a highly conductive (e.g., metal) material.","In operation, with fibers  loosely deposited on plastic mesh  while inverted hopper  is suspended or disposed over adhesive , electric field generator  is turned on. High voltage on electrode  generates corona discharge (ionization of the atmosphere in the hopper). Fibers  in hopper  are charged by the corona discharge.","Concurrently, hopper  must be shaken to allow the fibers to pass through plastic mesh . Shaking hopper  is necessary because the fibers  are lying horizontally on mesh  and can become entangled. Furthermore, the fibers  must be shaken to place them in the proper vertical orientation to pass through the mesh  in a direction perpendicular to the substrate  below. The frequency and magnitude of shaking must be very controlled to get a consistent fibrous structure from one fabrication to the next. The frequency of vibration will vary based on the type of fibers being used as well as the intended use of the fibrous structure.","As the corona charged fibers  fall through mesh , the resulting electric field between electrode  and substrate  causes the fibers  to align themselves end-to-end within the electric field as they drop towards substrate  in an orientation perpendicular to the substrate, in the direction indicated by arrow . Fibers  accelerate through the electric field until one end thereof embeds in adhesive layer . Fiber density and fiber homogeneity are dependent on shaking frequency of hopper , the distance between the fibers  and the electrode , the distance between the substrate  and fibers , and flocking time. The electric field can be continuously applied until some portion or all of fibers  are embedded in adhesive layer . A curing step may be required if adhesive layer  utilizes a wet adhesive such as a screen printing ink. Prior to curing, the previously recorded weight of substrate , and adhesive  is subtracted from the weight of substrate , adhesive  and embedded fibers  to determine fiber density.","As described above, the end use of the fibrous structure can dictate the materials used during the process. For applications requiring electrical conductivity throughout the fibrous structure, each of surface A, adhesive layer  and fibers  can comprise an electrically conductive material. In other applications, it may be desirable to use fibers  as a support platform for another material  as illustrated in . Material  could be electrically conductive or non-conductive material. For example, fibers  could be non-conductive supports for non-conductive material . Deposited material  could be an electrically conductive material that is coupled to electrically conductive surface A via electrically conductive fibers  and adhesive layer . Still further, material  could be a catalyst material required for a chemical reaction. For example, in terms of making an electrode for a magnesium-hydrogen peroxide semi-fuel cell suitable for underwater applications, material  can be an electrochemical catalyst material used to facilitate the reduction of hydrogen peroxide at the semi-fuel cell's cathode. In such an application, material  can be an alloy of palladium and iridium. The palladium and iridium could be deposited by either the method of controlled potential coulometry, or cyclic voltametry.","Processes for the deposition of such an alloy (as material ) on fibers  is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,296,429 and in \u201cElectrode Surface Modification for Cathode Catalysis in Semi-Fuel Cells,\u201d J. M. Cichon et al., Proceedings of the Electrochemical Society, Vol. 98\u201315, p. 32\u2013321, 1998, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.","The advantages of the present invention are numerous. The fibrous structure fabrication process presented herein can be used in a wide variety of electrochemical applications. It will be understood that many additional changes in the details, materials, steps and arrangement of parts, which have been herein described and illustrated in order to explain the nature of the invention, may be made by those skilled in the art within the principle and scope of the invention as expressed in the appended claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["Other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent upon reference to the following description of the preferred embodiments and to the drawings, wherein corresponding reference characters indicate corresponding parts throughout the several views of the drawings and wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 1A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 2"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
