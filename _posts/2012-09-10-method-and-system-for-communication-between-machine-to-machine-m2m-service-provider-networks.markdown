title: Method and system for communication between machine to machine M2M service provider networks
abstract: Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication has been described for communication in a single network in among others publications from the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI). The publications describe a single network with defined entities, a resource structure and protocols. According to the invention, a solution is described for communication between entities residing in different M2M networks. Entities residing in a first M2M network requiring information of an entity in another second M2M network submit a request with a target ID pointing to the entity in the second M2M network. The request is forwarded to the network node of the first network. The network node of the first network checks whether the target ID matches with an announced resource in the network node of the first network. On a match the request is routed towards the network node of the second M2M network according to an address available in a REstful structure comprising the announced resource. The network node of the second network routes the request further towards the second entity. On reception of the request the second entity processes the request and returns a reply via the path created by the previous steps.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present invention relates generally to enablement of a communication network comprising devices that communicate without human intervention. More particularly, the present invention facilitates a method and system for initialising communication in a Machine-to-Machine (M2M) environment in an efficient way.","As network availability in devices spreads, and network access coverage increases, there is an increasing demand to create a network of connected things or devices. Where the first drive of the telecommunications industry was to connect locations to each other, and ask users to travel to one of the connected locations, and the second drive of the industry was creating mobile connections so that people could be connected regardless of locations, a third phase of connectivity is being entered. In this third phase, there is an interconnection of devices.","Whether these devices are mobile, such as actuators in transportation systems, or fixed in locations such as sensors on a utility meter, devices are being connected to each other and to network applications or services.","However, a problem is foreseen in that as the number of devices will increase, the problem of managing these devices will also grow. Furthermore, the manner in which the devices are connected to a network can affect how they are managed and communicate.","As among one of the recognized authorities on standardization of communication technology, the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI), has taken the initiative to develop standards to support industry for enabling ease of connectivity between the devices i.e. sensors and actuators, as well as applications and services.","By means of standards, innovation across industry is facilitated, enabling exposure of data and information as well of provision of services.","ETSI has defined a standard for machine-to-machine (ETSI M2M) communication where devices communicate and exchange information via a defined structure of database-like resources. The standard is described in a.o. the following documents:","TS 102 689\u2014Service Requirements: which provide a high level requirements for an M2M Service Layer","TS 102 690\u2014Functional Architecture. The architecture which entities are required as to deploy device communication and management in an M2M network.","TS 102 921\u2014mIa, dIa and mId interfaces. The document provides the protocol specification for the three reference points mIa, dIa and mId.","The ETSI M2M suite, comprising the standards listed above, provides a Machine-to-Machine (M2M) architecture with a generic set of capabilities for M2M services and provides a framework for developing services independently of the underlying network.","The ETSI M2M suite is generally based on a number of defined physical entities and a number of defined resources. The resources comprise information to be shared or exchanged, and are organised in so called Service Capability Layers (SCLs), according to a REpresentational State Transfer (RESTful) architecture style.","The RESTful architecture style, generally applied by ETSI M2M, represents a tree wherein the SCL maintains a resource structure where the information to be shared or exchanged is stored and updated.","Communication to and from the resources, comprised by the SCLs, is defined by procedures over dedicated interfaces, called \u201creference points\u201d.","The entities forming a network are organised in a pyramid like structure where (multiple) devices (sensors and actuators) form the basis and a Network node, network domain server, comprising a Network Service Capability Layer (NSCL) forms the top of the pyramid.","The device might be a very simple device, such as a contact switch sensor, only able to provide on-off data, or an actuator such as a relay to turn on or off a heating element. On the other extreme a device can be a complex remote sensor with a local application that provides compressed and encrypted strings of data on e.g. received radiation units on request.","ETSI M2M has defined the concepts of an M2M application and an M2M Service Capability Layer (SCL), being processing units comprised by physical entities. The application has to register over a defined reference point with an SCL. The SCL to be registered with, called \u201cthe local SCL\u201d in ETSI M2M terms, is either the SCL locally available in the same entity where the application resides, or if not locally available, in the first higher SCL in the pyramid.","The SCL enables an application to use the M2M communication suite. The ETSI M2M SCL can generally be seen as a database, having a defined record structure, using defined interfaces, the reference points, for communication with other SCLs and Applications, and is arranged to perform functions such as relaying information to other SCLs, store and forward functionality, expiration time handling, policy enforcement, etc.","ETSI M2M had defined (until now) a number of different entities, a Device (D and D\u2032 also known as \u201cD prime\u201d), a Gateway (G) and a Network node (N). The D\u2032 entity comprises an Application only. The D, G and N entities comprise an SCL an may further comprise an Application.","The G entity has been introduced to connect D\u2032 entities in a local area level. The G entity enables M2M communication to other entities in the M2M network by means of its SCL.","Multiple G entities comprising Gateway SCLs (GSCLs) and optionally Gateway Applications (GAs) could be connected to an N entity such that a pyramid-like structure is formed.","In this way a Network Application (NA) comprised by the N entity can communicate with- or control- the connected D- and G- entites.","ETSI M2M indicates that an address of a resource representing Device Application (e.g. with identifier DA) registered with the SCL of an NSCL (e.g. with identifier NSCL) has the identifier:","\u201c<sclBase for NSCL>\/applications\/DA\u201d.","The pyramid-like topological structure of the entity which hosts DA is not represented in this identifier. The sequence is independent from underlaying physical networks.","Device applications are generally understood as applications that in case of a sensor, retrieve the data of the sensor and store (or \u201cupdate\u201d in M2M terms) the data into the resource of the one or more SCLs where the application has been registered to. In case of an actuator, the application may e.g. read the resource of the SCL where the application has been registered with, or reacts on a notification message, and controls the actuator according to the value indicated in the resource read or notification received respectively.","Gateway- and Network applications are understood as applications that process data received from Device Applications and submit requests to Device Applications to be executed.","There is a substantial demand to connect numerous devices which may connect via fixed and cellular data networks as well as wireless network interface such as WiFi (IEEE 802.11).","However not all devices can be expected to reside in a single network, operated by a single M2M provider, just as in the ETSI M2M standards listed above is presented.","A problem is raised in how devices can initialise and establish communication when different M2M networks are maintained by different M2M service providers, having no D entities connected via the same G or N entities.","As an example of the problem stated, a solution is required for a situation where an entity in a first M2M Service provider network has to retrieve information that is stored in a resource residing in one or more entities of a second M2M Service Provider network.","It is an object of the present invention to provide a method and system to enable communication between Machine-to-Machine (M2M) devices, applications or services that do not belong to the same network M2M network.","A solution is presented below for allowing devices attached to a specific M2M Service Provider network to utilize service and communicate to devices from other M2M networks belonging to one or more other M2M Service Providers.","The invention is explained in an example according to a REpresentational State Transfer (RESTful) architecture style, applied by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI), for M2M communication.","The solution to the problem is discussed as a method where a first entity, being an application or an entity, residing in a first network needs to communicate, e.g. retrieve or exchange information, with a second entity, residing a second, different network.","Both networks are M2M networks, having a topologically pyramid-like structure with a single network node on top of the network. Each of the M2M networks, comprise the network node and one or more entities and applications which are communicatively connected to eachother according to the topologically pyramid-like structure.","The entities that support the communication, comprise resources for exchanging information, are arranged in a tree-like structure.","The explanation of the solution is based on the rules:","All communication between both networks has to pass the network nodes of the M2M networks, each having a link to the other network node.","Each resource has a determined location in the tree-like structure, and a determined meaning in the entity, thereby enabling addressing.","Further as a condition which took already place before the solution is applied, registration within the M2M networks was performed.","The applications and entities within each network have to register to each other in an upward direction in the pyramid-like structure until the network node on the top has received registrations of the applications and entities risiding directly (one step) below under the network node. The remaining applications and entities in the M2M network that are not registered with the network node are registered with their superior entity.","When the first entity or application transmits a request addressed for the second entity in the direction of a first network node of the first network, this first network node receives the request comprising an identifier identifying the addressed second entity.","The first network node checks its resources for a matching reference, where this reference is stored in a resource of the first network node, with the identified addressed of the second entity, from the request.","When the first network node has found a match, the first network node retrieves the network node of a second network indicated as the network node from which the request to the resource comprising the matched reference was received.","The first network node forwards the request to the retrieved second network node which subsequently forwards the request to the second entity.","The second entity receiving the request, processes the request and responds to the first entity via a path created by the previous steps.","The first network node in the first M2M network as defined above with the pyramid-like topology, having resources for exchanging information, arranged in a tree-like structure, receives a request from an application or entity in a first network where the request comprises an identifier identifying an addressed second entity of a second network wherein the second entity is not registered to the first network node.","The first network node checks its resources for a matching reference, where the reference is comprised by the first network node's resources, with the identified addressed second entity.","On a match, the first network node subsequently routes the request to a network node of the second network indicated as the network node from which the request to the resource comprising the matched reference was received.","The first network node routes the request according to routing information stored in the resource of the first network node, representing a registration from the second network node.","The term \u201cresource\u201d should generally be understood as one or more memory locations in an SCL, enabled for being read and updated according to the setting of attributes, defining which entity may read or update.","The term \u201cupdate\u201d should generally be understood as storing one or more values into a resource.","The elucidation for the method claims does also apply for the corresponding embodiment of the listed methods to the system entities as claimed.","The method, node and system presented has the advantage of re-using the concept of announcement for spreading the knowledge of remote resources.","These and other embodiments according to the present invention are now illustrated in more detail with reference to the enclosed drawings.","Without restrictions to the scope of the invention, in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, the invention is presented against the background and within the scope of the current published standards suite of the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI), regarding Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication, referred here as ETSI M2M.","However, the present invention may be applied in any context of a device-to-device, or M2M communication deploying a RESTfull style architecture, deployed in networks having a pyramid like topology.
