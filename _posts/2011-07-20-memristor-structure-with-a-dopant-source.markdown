{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This invention has been made with government support. The government has certain rights in the invention.","The continuous trend in the development of electronic devices has been to minimize the sizes of the devices and to improve functionalities of the devices. While the current generation of commercial microelectronics are based on sub-micron design rules, significant research and development efforts are directed towards exploring devices on the nano-scale, with the dimensions of the devices often measured in nanometers or tens of nanometers. In addition to the significant reduction of individual device size and much higher packing density as compared to microscale devices, nanoscale devices may also provide new functionalities due to physical phenomena on the nanoscale that are not observed on the micron scale.","For instance, electronic switching in nanoscale devices using titanium oxide as the switching material has recently been reported. The resistive switching behavior of such a device has been linked to the memristor circuit element theory originally predicted in 1971 by L. O. Chua. The discovery of the memristive behavior in the nanoscale switch has generated significant interest, and there are substantial on-going research efforts to further develop such nanoscale switches and to implement them in various applications. One of the many important potential applications is to use such a switching device as a memory unit to store digital data.","Memristor switch devices, which are often formed of nanoscale metal\/metal oxide\/metal layers, employ an \u201celectroforming\u201d process to enable resistive switching. The electroforming process involves a one-time application of a relatively high voltage or current that produces a significant change of electronic conductivity through the metal oxide layer. The electrical switching arises from the coupled motion of electrons and ions within the oxide material. For example, during the electroforming process, oxygen vacancies may be created and drift towards the cathode, forming localized conducting channels in the oxide. Simultaneously, O ions drift towards the anode where they evolve Ogas and cause physical deformation of the junction. The gas eruption often results in physical deformation of the oxide (e.g. bubbles) near the locations where the conducting channels form and delamination between the oxide and the electrode. The conducting channels formed through the electroforming process often have a wide variance of properties depending on how the electroforming process occurred. This variance of properties has relatively limited the adoption of metal oxide switches in computing devices.","In addition, in order to be competitive with CMOS FLASH memories, the emerging resistive switches need to have a switching endurance that exceeds at least millions of switching cycles. Reliable switching channels inside the device may significantly improve the endurance of these switches.","Reference is now made in detail to specific examples of the disclosed memristor including a dopant source and specific examples of ways for creating the disclosed memristor including a dopant source. When applicable, alternative examples are also briefly described.","As used herein, the singular forms \u201ca,\u201d \u201can,\u201d and \u201cthe\u201d include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.","As used in this specification and the appended claims, \u201capproximately\u201d and \u201cabout\u201d mean a \u00b110% variance caused by, for example, variations in manufacturing processes.","In the following detailed description, reference is made to the drawings accompanying this disclosure, which illustrate specific examples in which this disclosure may be practiced. The components of the examples can be positioned in a number of different orientations and any directional terminology used in relation to the orientation of the components is used for purposes of illustration and is in no way limiting. Directional terminology includes words such as \u201ctop,\u201d \u201cbottom,\u201d \u201cfront,\u201d \u201cback,\u201d \u201cleading,\u201d \u201ctrailing,\u201d etc.","It is to be understood that other examples in which this disclosure may be practiced exist, and structural or logical changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present disclosure. Therefore, the following detailed description is not to be taken in a limiting sense. Instead, the scope of the present disclosure is defined by the appended claims.","Memristors are nano-scale devices that may be used as a component in a wide range of electronic circuits, such as memories, switches, and logic circuits and functions. When used as a basis for memories, the memristor may be used to store a bit of information, 1 or 0. When used as a logic circuit, the memristor may be employed as bits in a logic circuit that resembles a Field Programmable Gate Array, or may be the basis for a wired-logic Programmable Logic Array.","When used as a switch, the memristor may either be a closed or open switch in a cross-point memory. Throughout the last few years, researchers have made great progress improving the switching efficiency of these memristors. For example, tantalum oxide based memristors have demonstrated superior endurance over other nanoscale devices capable of electronic switching. In lab settings, tantalum oxide (TaO) based memristors have demonstrated 10 billion switching cycles whereas other memristors, such as tungsten oxide (WO) or titanium oxide (TiO) based memristors, require a sophisticated feedback mechanism for avoiding over-driving the devices or an additional step of refreshing the devices with stronger voltage pulses, in order to obtain an endurance in the range of 10 million switching cycles.","However, over time, both tantalum oxide based memristors and other similar oxide, nitride or sulfide based memristors encounter performance issues due to a loss of dopant in the switching region. A loss of dopant in the switching region, as further described below, may result in the memristor switching region becoming less resistive in the OFF state. Accordingly, this decrease in resistivity may result in the degradation of the ON\/OFF resistance ratio of the memristor and hence, the degradation of the memristor's performance.","A new memristor structure is disclosed, including a dopant source incorporated into the switching electrode in the memristor, such that a dopant can be supplied from the switching electrode to the dopant depleted memristor switching region, restoring the balance of dopant to metal. Restoration of the dopant content in a memristor's switching region can restore the memristor's endurance and performance, measured by the memristor's ON\/OFF resistance ratio. Additionally, formation of this new memristor structure is compatible with current fabrication processes.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 1A","b":["100","110","120","140","130"],"i":"a "},"In some examples, the switching function of the memristor may be achieved in the switching layer . In general, the switching layer  may be a weak ionic conductor that is semiconducting and\/or insulating without dopants. These materials can be doped by native dopants, such as oxygen vacancies or impurity dopants (e.g. intentionally introducing different metal ions into the switching layer ). The resulting doped materials may be electrically conductive because the dopants may be electrically charged and mobile under electric fields. Accordingly, the concentration profile of the dopants inside these materials (or the switching layer ) can be reconfigured by electric fields, resulting in changes to the resistance of the device under electric fields, namely electrical switching.","In some examples, the switching layer  may include a transition metal oxide, such as tantalum oxide, yttrium oxide, hafnium oxide, zirconium oxide or other like oxides, or may include a metal oxide, such as aluminum oxide, calcium oxide, magnesium oxide or other like oxides. In one example, the switching layer  may include the oxide form of the metal of the first electrode . In alternate examples, the switching layer  may be formed of ternary oxides, quaternary oxides, or other complex oxides, such as strontium titanate oxide (STO) or praseodymium calcium manganese oxide (PCMO). In yet other examples, the switching layer  may include nitrides or sulfides.","An annealing process or other thermal forming process, such as heating by exposure to a high temperature environment, exposure to electrical resistance heating or other suitable processes, may be employed to form one or more switching channels , as these processes may cause localized atomic modification in the switching layer . In some examples, the conductivity of the switching channels  may be adjusted by applying different biases across the first electrode  and the second electrode . In other examples, the switching layers  may be singularly configurable.","In some examples, the memristor's switching layer  may consist of a single-layer, a bi-layer, or a multi-layer structure. In some examples, the switching layer  may have a bi-layer structure, including a thin insulating oxide layer and a thick, heavily reduced oxide layer. In one example, the insulating oxide layer is approximately 3 nm to 6 nm thick, and the reduced oxide layer is approximately 10 nm to 200 nm thick. In these examples, also known as forming-free memristors, no process for forming switching channels  is needed, since the oxide layer is so thin that there is no need to apply a high voltage or heat to form switching channels . The voltage applied during the normal operation of the switch is sufficient for forming a switching channel . In yet other examples, the switching layer is not a localized feature inside the memristor but is instead, a uniform feature inside the memristor. In these examples, the entire switching layer  can be viewed as a single uniform channel capable of switching.","In one example, the memristor may be switched OFF and ON when oxygen, other dopants or metal atoms move in the electric field, resulting in the reconfiguration of the switching channel  in the switching layer . Particularly, when the atoms move such that the formed switching channel  reaches from the first electrode  to the second electrode , the memristor is in the ON state and has relatively low resistance to the voltage supplied between the first electrode  and the second electrode . Likewise, when the atoms move such that the formed switching channel  has a gap known as the switching region  between the first electrode  and the second electrode , the memristor is in the OFF state and has a relatively high resistance to the voltage supplied between the first electrode  and the second electrode . In some examples, more than one switching channel  may be formed in the switching layer  upon heating.","The switching layer  may be between the first electrode  and the second electrode . In some examples, the first electrode  and the second electrode  may include any conventional electrode material. Examples of conventional electrode materials may include, but are not limited to, aluminum (Al), copper (Cu), gold (Au), molybdenum (Mo), niobium (Nb), palladium (Pd), platinum (Pt), ruthenium (Ru), ruthenium oxide (RuO), silver (Ag), tantalum (Ta), tantalum nitride (TaN), titanium nitride (TiN), tungsten (W) or tungsten nitride (WN).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIG. 1B","FIG. 1A"],"b":["100","100","100","140","110","130","150","140","130"],"i":["b ","a ","b"]},"Next,  is a cross-sectional view of an example memristor with an oxygen source in the OFF state, in accordance with the examples disclosed herein, and  is a cross-sectional view of an example memristor with an oxygen source in the ON state, also in accordance with the examples disclosed herein. Since both  depict example oxide based memristors (or in other words, wherein the switching layer  includes an oxide), the dopant source used, as further described below, is an oxygen source.","In general, memristors with a dopant source and may contain similar components as memristors without a dopant source and , as described above. The memristor with a dopant source is able to achieve an OFF state and an ON state in the same manner as the memristor without a dopant source. However, instead of a second electrode , the memristor with a dopant source includes a conductive alloy , which may have desirable dopant solubility and may serve as a dopant source to the switching layer .","Accordingly, in the OFF state , the example memristor with a dopant source generally includes an electrode , a switching layer  including a switching channel  and a switching region , and a conductive alloy . In some examples, the switching layer  may range from approximately 1 nm to 100 nm in thickness, the electrode  and the conductive alloy  may each be 100 nm or larger in thickness, and the switching region  may be 1 nm or smaller in thickness.","Like memristors without a dopant source and , in some examples, the electrode  may include any conventional electrode material (shown in  as M1), such as aluminum (Al), copper (Cu), gold (Au), molybdenum (Mo), niobium (Nb), palladium (Pd), platinum (Pt), ruthenium (Ru), ruthenium oxide (RuO), silver (Ag), tantalum (Ta), tantalum nitride (TaN), titanium nitride (TiN), tungsten (W) or tungsten nitride (WN).","As discussed previously, one of the challenges in designing durable memristors that are capable of effective switching behavior is the degradation of the ON\/OFF switching ratio over time due to decreasing dopant content in the switching layer  and more specifically impacted, the switching region . The decrease in dopant content in the switching region  may cause the switching region  to become more metallic, which may result in the OFF state becoming less resistive over time. Accordingly, the resistance ratio between the ON state and the OFF state of the memristor may decrease over switching cycles, which may result in the memristor having a shorter working life.","In order to reverse this trend, dopant  may be supplied to the switching region  through the conductive alloy , which may include an electrode material (M2) and a dopant source material (M3) further including dopant . In some examples, the electrode material (M2) of the conductive alloy  may include any conventional electrode material, as described above, and may allow the conductive alloy  to be conductive.","In some examples wherein the memristor is an oxide based device (or when the switching layer  includes an oxide), the dopant source material (M3) in the conductive alloy  may store oxygen  for supply to the switching region . In this example, during the fabrication process, oxygen  may be dispersed into the dopant source material (M3) in the conductive alloy  for storage. Oxygen  may then move from the dopant source material (M3) to the switching region  or to the switching layer , generally, via thermodynamic and kinetic factors. In one example, the oxygen  may be transferred to the switching region  by chemical diffusion, caused by a difference in the oxygen chemical potential between the switching region  and the conductive alloy . As discussed previously, this movement of oxygen  into the switching region  may restore oxygen content in the switching region , thereby restoring the resistance ratio between the ON state and the OFF state of the memristor and restoring the performance of the memristor.","In some examples, the dopant source material (M3) may have three characteristics. In the example wherein the memristor is an oxide based device, the first characteristic is that the free energy of formation of the oxide of the dopant source material (M3O) may be more negative than the free energy of formation of the oxide of the electrode material in the conductive alloy  (M2O) but less negative than the free energy of formation of the switching oxide (M1O) in the switching layer . Alternatively, the first characteristic is met when the free energies are negative for both of the following two reactions:\n\n3O11O3\n\n2O33O2,\n\nwherein \u201cx\u201d, \u201cy\u201d, and \u201cz\u201d represent any positive real number, M1 is the material of the electrode , M2 is the electrode material of the conductive alloy , and M3 is the dopant source material in the conductive alloy . Additionally, M1O, M2O, and M3O, are, respectively, the switching oxide in the switching layer , the oxide of the electrode material (M2) of the conductive alloy , and the oxide of the dopant source material (M3).\n","The presence of this first characteristic indicates that the oxide of dopant source material (M3O) is more stable than the oxide of the electrode material of the conductive alloy  (M2O), but less stable than the oxide in the switching layer  (M1O). Accordingly, oxygen  may only be transferred from the conductive alloy  to the switching region  and may not be transferred from the switching region  to the conductive alloy . Additionally, oxygen  may be preferentially drawn to the dopant source material (M3) instead of to the electrode material (M2) of the conductive alloy .","The second characteristic that the dopant source material (M3) may have is that oxygen  may be soluble in the dopant source material (M3). The presence of this second characteristic allows the dopant source material (M3) to store oxygen  such that the stored oxygen  may be tapped to replenish the diminishing oxygen in the switching region .","The third characteristic that the dopant source material (M3) may have is that the dopant source material (M3) may be soluble in the electrode material (M2) of the conductive alloy , examples of which are as described previously. This third characteristic allows the dopant source material (M3) to form a continuous single phase solid solution with or to have appreciable solubility in the electrode material (M2) of the conductive alloy . The ability of the dopant source material (M3) to form a continuous solid solution with or to have appreciable solubility in the electrode material (M2) of the conductive alloy  allows the distribution of oxygen  in the conductive alloy  to be uniform. If a single phase solid solution cannot be formed, the resulting conductive alloy  may be in two phases, which may prevent the oxygen  from diffusing into the local switching region .","It should be understood that although the foregoing memristors have been described and explained largely with reference to memristors including oxide based switching layers , the invention is not so limited. As described above, in some examples, the switching layer  may include a sulfide or a nitride instead of an oxide. In such examples, the memristor may function in substantially the same manner as the memristor including an oxide based switching layer . Additionally, the method for determining the appropriate materials for each memristor component may be substantially the same no matter whether the switching layer  is oxide, nitride, or sulfide based. The only difference is that the dopant source material (M3) may store nitrogen when a nitride based switching layer is used and may store sulfur when a sulfide based switching layer  is used. Accordingly, the methods for determining suitable materials for each memristor component may be adjusted to reflect use of nitrogen or sulfur as the dopant instead of oxygen. For example, if the switching layer  includes nitride, determination of a suitable dopant source material may depend on comparisons of the free energy of formation for various nitrides.","An Ellingham diagram of an example memristor, wherein the electrode  includes tantalum (Ta or M1), the switching layer  includes tantalum oxide (TaOor M1O), and the conductive alloy  includes the electrode material platinum (Pt or M2), the dopant source material cobalt (Co or M3), and oxygen , may be used to explain the desired characteristics for the dopant source material (M3).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 3","sub":["x ","x","y ","y","z ","z","x ","x","y ","y","z ","z"],"b":["310","330","320","1","360","340","350"]},"In Ellingham diagrams, a more negative free energy of formation indicates the formation of a stronger bonded compound that may be more stable and may require more energy to break. As seen in , TaO(M1O)  is more stable than PtO(M2O)  or CoO(M3O) . Accordingly, in the memristor including Ta (M1) in the electrode  and switching layer , and Pt (M2), Co (M3), and oxygen in the conductive alloy , oxygen  may be released from the dopant source material, Co (M3), to the switching region  because the resulting formed oxide, TaO(M1O), may be more stable.","In other words, first, Co may be a suitable dopant source material (M3) because the following reaction has a negative free energy: x CoO+Ta\u2192TaO+x Co. The above reaction has a negative free energy because the free energy of formation of the oxide form of Co (M3), the dopant source material, is much less negative than the free energy of formation of TaO(M1O), the switching oxide.","Second, Co may be a suitable dopant source material (M3) because oxygen may be soluble in Co. Additionally, from , because the change of free energy of formation for CoO(M3O) is more negative than for PtO(M2O), any oxygen in the conductive alloy  may be stored with Co (M3) as opposed to Pt (M2). As discussed previously, this arrangement may be present because of the stronger bond that can be formed between oxygen and Co (M3). Finally, third, Co may be capable of forming a continuous solid solution with the electrode material of the conductive alloy , Pt or M2, allowing for the uniform distribution of oxygen  in the conductive alloy .","In other examples, other materials may be suitable dopant source materials. In some examples, the material for the switching oxide (M1O) may be determined first. Next, the materials of the conductive alloy  may be chosen.","In some examples, the electrode material (M2) of the conductive alloy  may be more noble than the material (M1) of the electrode  or the dopant source material (M3). Accordingly, the free energy of formation of M2O may be less negative than the free energy of formations of M1O or M3O. Additionally, in this example, the dopant source material (M3) may be less noble than the electrode material (M2) of the conductive alloy  but more noble that the material (M1) of the electrode .","In some examples, TaOmay be used as the switching oxide (M1O). In these examples, the electrode material (M2) of the conductive alloy  may include any conductive material, such as Ag, Au, Pd, Pt, Co, Cu, Mo or Ni. Next, in these examples, as described above, the dopant source material (M3) may be selected based on characteristics of the chosen conductive materials (M1 and M2). Some examples of compositions of the conductive alloy  may include silver for M2 and palladium for M3, gold for M2 and copper for M3, palladium for M2 and cobalt for M3, palladium for M2 and copper for M3, platinum for M2 and copper for M3, copper for M2 and nickel for M3, or molybdenum for M2 and chromium for M3.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","410","420"]},"The endurance was measured by using fixed negative and positive voltage pulses alternatively without a feedback loop. The resistance value of the device was interrogated by a small voltage sweep that does not perturb the device state after a certain number of switching pulses. As seen in the graph , as the memristor undergoes cycles, the resistance of the OFF state  decreases, lowering the effectiveness of the memristor and limiting its useful life. As discussed previously, the decreasing resistance of the OFF state  may be due to a loss of oxygen in the switching layer and eventually, may result in a degradation of the memristor's performance due to a decrease in the resistance ratio between the ON state and the OFF state.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":"FIG. 5A","b":["500","510","520","500","510"],"i":["a","a"]},"On the other hand, , on coordinates of resistance (ohm) and cycles, is a schematic graph depicting the trend of a memristor's change in resistance over multiple ON-OFF cycles when an oxygen source is used. In this example graph , the upper trend line  depicts the resistance of the memristor in the OFF state, while the lower trend line  depicts the resistance of the memristor in the ON state. As seen in the example graph , if oxygen  is supplied to the switching region , the resistance of the OFF state remains substantially constant  and the performance of the memristor does not degrade over switching cycles due to a loss of oxygen in the switching region  or the switching layer . Accordingly, when an oxygen source is provided to the memristor, the performance of the memristor may remain constant for a longer period of time than a memristor without an oxygen source.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 5"],"b":["600","600","600"]},"First, the conductive alloy  may be formed . As discussed previously, the conductive alloy  includes a conventional electrode material (M2), a dopant source material (M3), and dopant . In some examples, dopant  can be dispersed into the dopant source material (M3) using a co-sputtering process. In this process two different sputtering targets may be used to simultaneously deposit two materials on the substrate (e.g. silicon wafer) at different deposition rates, depending on the final composition required. In one example of co-sputtering, the conductive alloy  may be formed by providing a conventional electrode material (M2) and a dopant source material (M3) as the two sputtering targets, in an environment including dopant . The presence of dopant  in the co-sputtering process may result in dopant  being provided to and stored in the dopant source material (M3). As discussed previously, the dopant  is more likely to be stored in the dopant source material (M3) rather than the conventional electrode material (M2), given the greater stability of the bond formed between dopant  and the dopant source material (M3). In other examples, dopant  may be dispersed in the dopant source material (M3) using thermal oxidation, reactive sputtering in an oxygen environment, chemical vapor deposition or other suitable processes. In yet other processes, the dopant source material (M3) including dopant  may be a naturally available or a commercially available compound.","Second, the switching layer  may be formed  on the conductive alloy . In one example, the switching layer  is an electronically semiconducting or nominally insulating and weak ionic conductor. The deposition of the switching layer  on the conductive alloy  may be achieved through sputtering, atomic layer deposition, chemical vapor deposition, evaporation, ion beam assisted deposition, anodization or other suitable processes.","Third, the electrode  may be formed  on the switching layer . The electrode  may be provided through any suitable formation process, such as chemical vapor deposition, sputtering, etching, lithography or other suitable processes. In some examples, more than one electrode may be provided. The deposition of the electrode  on the switching layer  may be achieved through sputtering, atomic layer deposition, chemical vapor deposition, thermal evaporation, electron beam evaporation, ion beam assisted deposition or other suitable processes. If more than one electrode is provided, the depositions of the additional electrodes on each other may be achieved through substantially the same processes.","In some examples, a switching channel  may be formed. In one example, the switching channel  is formed by heating the switching layer .","Heating can be accomplished using many different processes, including thermal annealing or running an electrical current through the memristor. In other examples, wherein a forming-free memristor with built-in conductance channels is used, no heating may be required as the switching channels  are built in and as discussed previously, the application of the first voltage, which may be approximately the same as the operating voltage, to the virgin state of the memristor may be sufficient for forming a switching channel .","While in the example described above, the conductive alloy  may be formed first, in other examples, the electrode  may be formed first. In such examples, the electrode  may be formed first, the switching layer  may be formed on the electrode second, and the conductive alloy  may be formed on the switching layer  third.
