The cause of scleroderma is unknown. However, the genetic predisposition is important. Abnormalities involve autoimmunity and alteration of endothelial cell and fibroblast function. Indeed, systemic sclerosis is probably the most severe of the auto-immune diseases with 50% mortality within 5 years of diagnosis.","Scleroderma is a disease of the connective tissue characterized by fibrosis of the skin and internal organs, leading to organ failure and death. Scleroderma has a spectrum of manifestations and a variety of therapeutic implications. It comprises localized scleroderma, systemic sclerosis, scleroderma-like disorders, and sine scleroderma. Whilst localized scleroderma is a rare dermatologic disease associated with fibrosis and manifestations limited to skin, systemic sclerosis is a multi-system disease with variable risk for internal organ involvement and variation in the extent of skin disease. Systemic sclerosis can be diffuse or limited. Limited systemic sclerosis is also called CREST (calcinosis, Raynaud's esophageal dysfunction, sclerodactyly, telangiectasiae). Systemic sclerosis comprises: scleroderma lung disease, scleroderma renal crisis, cardiac manifestations, muscular weakness including fatigue or limited CREST, gastrointestinal dysmotility and spasm, and abnormalities in the central, peripheral and autonomic nervous system. With regard to the nervous system abnormalities, carpal tunnel syndrome followed by trigeminal neuralgia are the most common. Scleroderma-like disorders are believed to be related to industrial environment exposure. In sine disease, there is internal organ involvement without skin changes.","The major manifestations of scleroderma and in particular of systemic sclerosis are inappropriate excessive collagen synthesis and deposition, endothelial dysfunction, spasm, collapse and obliteration by fibrosis. In terms of diagnosis, an important clinical parameter is skin thickening proximal to the metacarpophalangeal joints. Raynaud's phenomenon is a frequent, almost universal component of scleroderma. It is diagnosed by color changes of the skin upon cold exposure. Ischemia and skin thickening are symptoms of Raynaud's disease.","Several underlying biological processes are implicated in the initiation, severity and progression of the disease and include vascular dysfunction, endothelial cell activation and damage, leukocyte accumulation, auto-antibody production and crucially, an uncontrolled fibrotic response which may lead to death. Fibroblasts have a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of this disease. Primary fibroblasts obtained from patients with scleroderma exhibit many of the characteristic properties of the disease seen in vivo, notably increased extracellular matrix synthesis and deposition, notably of collagen and fibronectin, and altered growth factor and cytokine production such as of TGF\u03b2 and CTGF (\u201cIncreased collagen synthesis by scleroderma skin fibroblasts in vitro\u201d 54, p. 880-89 LeRoy (1974)).","There is no curative treatment of scleroderma. Innovative but high-risk therapy proposed autologous stem cell transplantation. In particular, there are currently no treatments for scleroderma targeting the fibrotic process.","Identification of the genes associated with disease risk and scleroderma progression may lead to the development of effective strategies for intervention at various stages of the disease.","Although there is presently no cure for scleroderma, several agents or treatments are presently being used to treat scleroderma symptoms. Such anti-scleroderma agents, which may be used as combination therapy according to the invention, are summarized e.g. by Leighton C. (61(3) p. 419-27 (2001)) or Wigley and Sule (10(1) p. 3148 (2001)), which are fully incorporated by reference herein.","A recent publication of B. A. Hocevar et al. (Vol. 18 No. 5 p. 1345-56 (1999)) has suggested that TGF-\u03b2-mediated gene induction would involve activation of JNK, since JNK has been shown to modulate promoters containing both AP-1 (a transcription factor, formed from a heterodimer of the products of the proto-oncogenes fos and jun and CRE sites through its phosphorylation and activation of c-Jun and ATF-2 which is a c-Jun transcription factor participating in the transcriptional activation of c-Jun gene.","c-Jun is a protein that is forming homodimers and heterodimers (with e.g. c-Fos) to produce the transactivating complex AP-1 which is required for the activation of many genes (e.g. matrix metalloproteinases) involved in the inflammatory response. The JNKs (c-Jun N-terminal Kinases) were discovered when it was found that several different stimuli such as UV light and TNF-\u03b1 stimulated phosphorylation of c-Jun on specific serine residues in the N-terminus of the protein. The JNKs are also involved in relaying stress-type extramolecular signals, the ERK (extracellular regulated kinases) pathway is primarily responsible for transducing mitogenic\/differentiation signals to the cell nucleus.","JNK inhibitors are disclosed in various patent applications. For instance, EP 1110957 describing benzazole derivatives in particular for the treatment or prevention of disorders associated with the abnormal expression or activity of JNK2 and\/or 3, including autoimmune diseases such as Multiple Sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis or asthma.","Recently, Anania F. A. et al. (30(8), p. 846-57 (2001)) mentioned that JNK activation appears to be critical in the signaling cascade of oxidative metabolites of chronic alcoholic related liver injury and collagen gene activation that leads to liver fibrosis before cirrhosis.","WO 9855110, Dalhousie University teaches the use of compounds such as 1-(5-oxohexyl)-3,7-dimethylxanthine (pentoxifylline) or functional derivatives thereof to reduce the effect of PDGF-induced c-Jun gene expression in order to cure fibrosis diseases in which PDGF (Platelet Derived Growth Factor) is involved and acts as a stimulant.","The use of other compounds such as [5-chloro-2(3H)benzoxazolone](chlorzoxazone) and oxazolamine as pharmacological activators of the intermediate-conductance Ca-activated K channel are described to be therapeutically beneficial in cystic fibrosis and vascular diseases (278(3, Pt. 1), C570-C581 (English) 2000).","The present invention is based on the finding that benzazole derivatives of formula (I)-being inhibitors of JNK (c-Jun Kinases)\u2014are suitable for the treatment and\/or prevention of scleroderma and its therapeutic applications.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0016"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"19.98mm","wi":"56.56mm","file":"US07776854-20100817-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"Hence, the present invention aims at providing a method for treating patients suffering from scleroderma.

Such pharmaceutical compositions and unit dosage forms thereof may comprise ingredients in conventional proportions, with or without additional active compounds or principles, and such unit dosage forms may contain any suitable effective amount of the active ingredient commensurate with the intended daily dosage range to be employed.","When employed as pharmaceuticals, the benzazole derivatives of this invention are typically administered in the form of a pharmaceutical composition. Such compositions can be prepared in a manner well known in the pharmaceutical art and comprise at least one active compound. Generally, the compounds of this invention are administered in a pharmaceutically effective amount. The amount of the compound actually administered will typically be determined by a physician, in the light of the relevant circumstances, including the condition to be treated, the chosen route of administration, the actual compound administered, the age, weight, and response of the individual patient, the severity of the patient's symptoms, and the like.","The pharmaceutical compositions of these inventions can be administered by a variety of routes including oral, rectal, transdermal, subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, intrathecal, intraperitoneal and intranasal. Depending on the intended route of delivery, the compounds are preferably formulated as either injectable, topical or oral compositions. The compositions for oral administration may take the form of bulk liquid solutions or suspensions, or bulk powders. More commonly, however, the compositions are presented in unit dosage forms to facilitate accurate dosing. The term \u201cunit dosage forms\u201d refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages for human subjects and other mammals, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active material calculated to produce the is desired therapeutic effect, in association with a suitable pharmaceutical excipient. Typical unit dosage forms include prefilled, premeasured ampoules or syringes of the liquid compositions or pills, tablets, capsules or the like in the case of solid compositions. In such compositions, the benzazole compound is usually a minor component (from about 0.1 to about 50% by weight or preferably from about 1 to about 40% by weight) with the remainder being various vehicles or carriers and processing aids helpful for forming the desired dosing form.","Liquid forms suitable for oral administration may include a suitable aqueous or nonaqueous vehicle with buffers, suspending and dispensing agents, colorants, flavors and the like. Solid forms may include, for example, any of the following ingredients, or compounds of a similar nature: a binder such as microcrystalline cellulose, gum tragacanth or gelatine; an excipient such as starch or lactose, a disintegrating agent such as alginic acid, Primogel, or corn starch; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate; a glidant such as colloidal silicon dioxide; a sweetening agent such as sucrose or saccharin; or a flavoring agent such as peppermint, methyl salicylate, or orange flavoring.","Injectable compositions are typically based upon injectable sterile saline or phosphate-buffered saline or other injectable carriers known in the art. As above mentioned, the benzazole derivatives of formula I in such compositions is typically a minor component, frequently ranging between 0.05 to 10% by weight with the remainder being the injectable carrier and the like.","The above described components for orally administered or injectable compositions are merely representative.
