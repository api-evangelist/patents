Example: power play start at 4:10 it is charged with penalty at 4:29; Team \u201cA\u201d is charged 0 for 0:19 of composite time.","When Team \u201cA\u201d is on the power play and its opponent is charged with additional minor penalty, the two player time accrued is doubled. Example: Team \u201cB\u201d is charged with minor penalties at 4:10, and 5:40. Should Team \u201cA\u201d fail to score during this sequence, it is charged 0 for 3:00 or one-man time, 0 for 0:30 of two player time; and 0 for 4:00 of composite time.","When Team \u201cA\u201d has a two player advantage and scores a goal in 0:30, it is charged 1 for 1:00 of composite time, but 1 for 0:30 of two player time.","When Team \u201cA\u201d is on the power play and its opponent is charged with an additional minor penalty while already two players down, the third penalty time does not commence until either;","A. Team \u201cA\u201d scores a two player advantage goal; Example: Team \u201cB\u201d is charged with minor penalties at 4:10, and 4:19, when Team \u201cB\u201d is charged with a third minor penalty at 4:51 and Team \u201cA\u201d scores at 5:01, the third minor penalty time will commence at 5:01, or","B. The first penalty expires without a goal being scored by Team \u201cA\u201d. Example: Under the circumstances described above, when the first penalty to Team \u201cB\u201d expired at 6:10, it is at 6:10 that the penalty time will commence to expire on the third penalty charged to Team \u201cB\u201d, thus, Team \u201cA\u201d remains on a two player advantage until the second penalty expires at 6:19. Had Team \u201cA\u201d fail to score at all during this sequence, the third penalty would have expired at 8:10. The power play time charged to Team \u201cA\u201d would be the following: 0 for 2:00 of one-player, 0 for 2:00 of two player time, 0 for 6:00 composite time.","When Team \u201cA\u201d has a five-minute major power play and fails to score it is charged 0 for 5:00 of major-time, and 0 for 5:00 of composite time. When Team \u201cA\u201d has a five-minute major power play and scores one goal it is charged 1 for 5:00 of major-time, and 1 for 5:00 of composite time.","When Team \u201cA\u201d has a five-minute major power play and Team \u201cB\u201d is charged with an additional penalty of any type, all time accrued by Team \u201cA\u201d is charged as two player time until there is no longer a two player advantage. Ex: Team \u201cB\u201d is charged with a major penalty at 5:00. At 6:30 Team \u201cB\u201d is charged with an additional minor penalty. Should Team \u201cA\u201d fail to score during this sequence the power play time accrued by Team \u201cA\u201d would be as follows: 0 for 3:00 of major time, 0 for 2:00 of two player time and 0 for 7:00 composite time. All power play time\/penalty-killing time is charged to the goaltender who was playing goal for the defending team at that segment of the game. When a goaltending change is made the penalty-killing time is charged to the replacement goaltender thereby creating the \u201cHot-Seat\u201d compilation. The method used is the same formulation which is used for the Teams' penalty-killing ranking; two player time, major time and composite time are compiled for this category as well.","In the event that a game is played in its entirety without a power play occurring for a team\/teams, no new data shall be added to the applicable category\/team for that particular game.","There exists one additional goaltender characteristic, namely the \u201cEarned Goal Average\u201d Category. This statistic is also a derivative of power play time; in the equation given below, it will be seen, however, that the power play time and power play goals are extracted from other goaltender' statistics, i.e. total minutes played and total goals against a goaltender.","The formula given calculates even-strength goals divided by even-strength time, multiplied by sixty, (which is the length of the game), and the results are the E.G.A. statistics. For example, a very good E.G.A. would be an average of 1.50 even-strengths goals per game. A very poor average would be 4.50 even-strength goals per game. All goaltender's statistics are a by-product of teams composite statistics.","The formula for the E.G.A. reads then as follows:\n\n((4)\u2212(4)\/(4\u22124)\/(60))\n\nwherein\n\nR equals total goals against goaltender\n\nS equals power play goals against goaltender\n\nQ equals total minutes played, and\n\nT equals power play time faced\n","In use the present invention is used to provide an apparatus and method for obtaining selected performance statistics, for example, of one or more teams engaged in competitive hockey scores, by extensive manipulation of time frame statistics, from a game box score, generally provided by newspapers, as shown in the attached illustrated game box score for the Edmonton Oilers vs. the Winnipeg Jets on Apr. 1, 1990 in Appendix II herein.","For clarity and illustration, the aforementioned box score is broken down in the attached chart of Appendix III herein, and presented in chronological time frame order, showing the various power plays and performance opportunities during the entire sixty minutes of the three twenty minute periods of the hockey game of Apr. 1, 1990.","At the end of the chronological chart of the Apr. 1, 1990 hockey game, there is shown a further chart of the breakdown of the accrued time for each power play, and by categories, such as one man time, two man time and major time.","Finally, at the end of the chronological chart of the game, there is shown the composite power play time and the power play goals scored for each respective team.","The particular chart of Apr. 1, 1990, in Appendix III herein, shows that on that date Winnipeg scored 1 power play goal over 20 minutes and 40 seconds accrued time, but Edmonton scored 2 power play goals in a much shorter time of 14 minutes and 39 seconds.","Therefore, the statistics generated by the present invention show that Edmonton performed better, because Edmonton only took an average of 7 minutes and 20 seconds for each power play goal scored in the game, whereas Winnipeg took an average of 20 minutes and 40 seconds for its single power play goal.","Thus, Edmonton is shown to be three times more efficient than Winnipeg in scoring power play goals where Edmonton has the power play advantage when one or more of the opposing Winnipeg players were serving penalty time on the penalty bench, and therefore putting Winnipeg at a disadvantage.","Likewise, the statistics shown in Appendix III herein and generated by the present invention also show Winnipeg's weakness, in its apparent inability to take advantage of the time when Edmonton was short of at least one player during a penalty time, as well as Winnipeg's inability to score a power play goal over an extended period of time, until twenty minutes had elapsed.","Basis for the Intermediate Formulae in Another Preferred Embodiment According to the Invention:","The aforementioned formulae are illustrative of one embodiment of the present invention. For example, the number \u201c60.6\u201d in the formulae includes the sum of 60 plus 0.6, which yields 60.6, to compensate for precision of certain calculators and computers for what is in actuality a factor of \u201c60\u201d. In other calculators and\/or calculators 60.5 could be used as a means for compensating for inaccuracies and precision of such calculators, for example. However, if precision is not an issue with respect to accuracy, and the calculator and\/or computer is substantially 100 percent precise and substantially 100 percent accurate, then a factor of 60 is used.","Typical Hockey Game","Furthermore, in a further preferred embodiment, the user may start with a typical ice hockey game as follows:","1) Game clock 0:00\u20131:24: A goal was scored by Team #2 at 1:24. No players were serving penalty time when the goal was scored.","FORMULA #10, EARNED GOAL AVERAGE: ((R)\u2212(S)\/(Q)\u2212(T)*(60))","Team #1:","R (total goals against) 1, minus S, (power play goals against) zero for a sum of 1. Divide by Q minus T (Q being total minutes played by a goaltender) 1, (T being total power play time faced by a goaltender) 0 minutes for a total of 1. The 1 goal allowed minus the 0 power play goal divided by 1 minute equals 1.00 parts of an earned goal per minute of even strength time. Multiply times 60, the standard amount of time in a hockey game. The total of 60.00 is the current amount of even strength goals allowed per every 60 minutes of even strength time faced by Team #1 goaltender identified as #31 in this game.","2) 1:24\u20132:23: A 2 minute penalty was assessed to Team #1, giving Team #2 a power play advantage beginning at 2:23.","3) 2:23\u20135:06: A goal was scored by Team #2 at 5:06 but not within the allotted 2 minute power play time, thus Team #2 is charged zero power play goals for 2 minutes of 1 player and composite power play time.","Team #1 is credited with zero power against for 2 minutes of penalty time against in 1 player and composite penalty efficiency.","FORMULA #1, COMPOSITE POWER PLAY:\n\n(()+(2)*(60)+()+(2*)\/()\/(60)*(60.6))\n\nTeam #2:\n","Add D, (accrued number of minutes, in which a team has a one player advantage) D being 1 minutes, to two times G (accrued number of minutes in which a team has a has a two player advantage) G being 0 times 2, added to 2 equals 2. Multiply this sum 8 by 60, thereby transposing all player advantage minutes into 120 seconds. Add the sum of 120 seconds to E, accrued number of seconds in which a team has a one player advantage) E being 0 seconds, total 120 seconds, then add again to two times H (accrued number of seconds in which a team has a two player advantage) 0 seconds times two equals 0 seconds, total is 120 seconds. Divide 120 seconds by B (total power play goals scored by a team) B being 1, the sum is 594. When B equals zero no average can be acquired and all time accrues. When B equals 1 divide again by 60 thereby transposing the seconds into minutes. The sum is 9.9. Whereby the 2. represents whole total minutes and the fraction represents the integer, 0.9. The integer is multiplied by 60.6, the integer calculation producing the whole number 0. The integer being located the right of the whole number 2 would display in the following manner: 2:00 being TEAM #2 power play efficiency at this time of the game.","FORMULA #2, COMPOSITE PENALTY EFFICIENCY:\n\n(()+(2)*(60)+()+(2)\/()\/(60)*(60.6))\n\nTeam #2:\n","Add P, (accrued number of minutes, in which a team has one player serving penalty time) P being 2 minutes, to two times S (accrued number of minutes in which a team has two players serving penalty time) S being 0 times 0, added to 2 equals 2. Multiply this sum 2 by 60, thereby transposing all penalty minutes into 120 seconds. Add the sum of 120 seconds to Q, accrued number of seconds in which a team has one player serving penalty time) Q being 0 seconds, total 120. Add to two times T (accrued number of seconds in which a team has two players serving penalty time) T being 0 seconds times two equals 0 seconds the total is 120 seconds. Divide 120 seconds by N (total power play goals scored against a team) N being 0. When N equals 0 no average can be acquired and all penalty time accrues. When N equals 1 divide by 60 thereby transposing the seconds into minutes. The sum is 2.00 whereby the 2 represents whole total minutes and the fraction represents the integer, 0.00. The integer is multiplied by 60.6, the integer calculation producing the whole number 50.

These are the tape holding means, such as a tape holder , so that its center axis or axle is positioned in parallel with the second axis of the timing chart .","The tape holder , is, in turn, adapted for carrying at least the already mentioned tape reels \u2032 to \u2033\u2033. The latter carry corresponding tapes \u2032 to \u2032\u2033, which are differently identifiable, respectively, such as by separate colors.","Also provided are tape unrolling means, wherein a representative tape  (embodying, for this example, one of the tapes \u2032 to \u2033\u2033), moves in translation, so as to unwind that tape  from a representative reel . The representative tape , in turn, is driven by reel coupling means, such a as toothed wheel  in engagement with the representative tape . The tape dispensing or translatory moving wheel may be, for example, located on the same shaft as one clutch\/brake, i.e. on shaft .","The tape dispensing or moving means, as has already been outlined, is preferably implemented as a toothed wheel or gear wheel  having ridges , in contact with corresponding ridges \u2032 of a selected (representative) tape . The gear wheel  therefore has ridges, or teeth, designed to mesh with other ridges on the tape ; it is, in turn driven by an endless chain or belt , which is in operative contact with a pulley  of an electric motor , having a shaft \u2032.","Upstream of the tape dispensing wheel  there are provided second tape guiding means, such as tape guides in the form of brackets , so that the tape  is guided along its path along the floor of the carriage  without curling upwardly.","Further downstream there is provided an exit slot  in the floor of the carriage, so that the tape  can pass therethrough in an orderly manner.","The exit slot  is bordered upstream by a wedge , permitting the tape  to slope downwardly. Further downstream, and beyond the exit slot  there are provided tape restraining means, such as an elastomeric pressure pad , whose task it is to prevent the tape  from passing through the exit slot  in an upwardly direction.

The plunger\/shaft , in its energized mode, is encircled by a cylindrical housing  rigid with the solenoid , followed by a first abutment disk , which has an end friction surface  facing away from the solenoid .","The first abutment disk  is followed, in turn, by a brake\/clutch disk , which also has a splined bore, so that it can only slide on the splined shaft portion . Each lateral side of the brake\/clutch disk  has a friction clutch surface, and the brake\/clutch disk  is followed by a second abutment disk , which generally corresponds to the first abutment disk , but which has a smooth bore, so as to be rotatable on the shaft portion . An end surface thereof, facing away from the solenoid, is then followed, in turn, by a timing-belt pulley , locked, when the clutch is engaged, with the second abutment disk , which has, in turn, in that mode, a drivable shaft .","When the solenoid  is energized, the brake\/clutch disk  is forced to be in contact with the timing belt pulley , and it is therefore engaged, so as to drive the output shaft ; when, however, the solenoid  is de-energized, the brake\/clutch disk  is forced against the friction surface of the first abutment disk , and the pulley  is free-wheeling; as shown in , a clutch\/brake is used in two places. One location is to couple power from the gear motor  to the drive shaft \u2032, and the other location is to couple power from the same gear motor  to the shaft  coupled to the tape dispensing wheel . In an alternate embodiment the two abutment disks can be omitted, provided that suitable replacement friction surfaces are provided on the components adjoining the brake\/clutch disk , an end surface of the solenoid , and an end surface of the timing belt pulley facing the solenoid. The gear motor  is coupled to the clutch\/brakes ,  via timing belts , as can be seen from . The operation of the tape dispensing unit  requires that either the drive wheels  and  are powered, while the tape dispensing wheel  is stationary (i.e. Offset mode), or that the drive wheels  and  are powered in synchronism with the tape dispensing wheel  (i.e. Length mode). Since this action is under micro-controller control (see ), an electronically controllable clutch is operationally required to selectively engage the tape dispensing wheel . A clutch, however, is not operationally required on the drive wheel shaft, since the drive wheels are energized in either mode.","Consideration of the insidious effects of inertia, however, dictate either an elaborate speed control to slow the motor , when approaching a destination, or the introduction of an electronically controlled brake, large enough to quickly dissipate the considerable rotation inertia.","A third and better solution, i.e. the one adopted here, uses identical clutch\/brakes as interfaces between the gear motor drive and both the shaft  driving the drive wheels, and the shaft driving the tape dispensing wheel.","An almost instantaneous stop is required when the destination is reached to limit overshoot to less that one half a unit timing step. This is achieved on both axles by first of all selecting a relatively slow speed of motion and tape dispensing for the tape dispenser.","The speed is limited to 25 mm\/sec or less by a judicious choice of gear reduction in the gear motor . Thus the linear inertia of the tape dispenser is minimal, even though its weight is substantial. By using lightweight drive wheels, the inertia of the drive wheel\/drive wheel shaft is kept low. The inertia of the motor armature and gear train, along with the timing belts and pulleys, however, is substantial. If clutches can be used to isolate these elements from the shafts driven by them in a small instant of time\u2014a few milliseconds\u2014the high inertia components can slowly coast to a stop.","The inertial energy is dissipated in component friction, while having no effect on the driven shaft or shafts.","But if the clutch can also serve as a brake, which is applied to the attached shaft at the same moment as it isolates the shaft from the drive, the low inertial energy of the shaft and its attachments is very quickly dissipated in even a small brake element. This is the operational nature of the clutch\/brakes herein described.","A low inertia brake\/clutch disk  is forced through an abutment disk  against the side of the timing belt pulley  driving the output shaft , when the solenoid is energized. When de-energized, the afore-mentioned restraining spring , which is integral with, or is connected to the plunger, shuttles the same brake\/clutch disk  back a small distance to force it against a stationary friction surface of the abutment disk , where inertial energy is converted to heat by virtue of kinetic friction, thus dissipating the inertial energy.","Turning now to , that Fig. will be seen to show a block diagram of a digital planimeter. A stylus  is its input sensor, followed by a piezo- or magnetic pick-up , which is in turn followed by a pulse shaper . The latter three items, instead of filling a longitudinal shell or chassis, can alternately be combined to form a stationary transducer , which is mounted on the carriage , as shown in , and which is formed with recesses , into which can be plugged the plugs , shown in . A separate output assembly , as can again be seen from , includes a BCD counter , a grounded reset button or switch , one free end of which is connected to a reset lead , which, in turn, feeds the counter . Upon the reset lead  being grounded, the counter  is reset to a count zero.","The counter  is followed by a BCD  segment converter and driver , itself fed by the counter . The output of the counter  feeds the previously mentioned miniature display . The outward appearance of the digital planimeter is shown in . The physical shape of the output assembly \u2032, i.e. a truncated length measurement means, is shown in , comprising substantially a longitudinal cylinder, which at its input end is fitted with two prongs , designed to be plugged into the slots  of the stationary transducer assembly .","The output assembly \u2032, when plugged into the transducer assembly , then constitutes a fixed length measurement means . The output assembly  will then be seen to constitute conversion means for changing a previously mobile length measurement means to stationary length measuring means. The aforedescribed length measurement means will pick up only \u201cbumps\u201d with its stylus , i.e. the ridges of the tape .","Such a design of length measurement means, i.e. of a digital planimeter, has the advantage particularly noteworthy in this application, that it can generally advance in a forward direction without incurring any change in the length measurement detected. This is illustrated in . Here a distance \u201cd\u201d is measured via paths A, B, C and D. Only path D, which has a reverse position and velocity component would provide a misleading indication.","In operation, the mounting and alignment frame  is placed on the timing chart  so that its two attachment pegs  are inserted into the appropriate holes  in the timing chart . Next the Starting Point, or first travel frame  is slid on the rail  of the mounting and alignment frame , and shifted to the desired location on the timing chart . A second travel frame  is then slid between the rails  of the first travel frame  so as to be moved upwardly.

The rink is surrounded by sideboards which reach as high as 8-feet, Fifteen feet from each end of the rink centered by the rink width are goalposts standing 4-feet high, 6-feet wide and 3-feet deep. The post and attached crossbars are draped with nylon mesh in such a manner as to assure the puck coming to rest on the inside of the net. The red line, two inches wide, between the goal posts on the ice extended completely across the rink, shall be known as the \u201cGoal Line\u201d. A semi-circle outside the goalnet consisting of approximately 25-square feet extending from the left goalpost to the right goalpost shall be known as the goaltenders crease . . sup.1",".sup.1 adopted in 1991","On-Ice Officials","A hockey game is governed by three on-ice officials, a referee and two linesmen. The referees duty is to call player penalties, direct instructions to both team coaches and to have an uncontested influence on the game clock and penalty clock. The referee shall have general supervision of the game. The linesman duty is to stop play whenever there is an offsides play, an icing, or to call a bench minor penalty. The linesman shall drop the puck for every face-off except those that begin a period and those which follow a goal.","Off-Ice Officials","Each rink shall provide two goal judges, who are seated behind each goal net to indicate when a goal is scored by illuminating a red light which is situated behind each goal net. Each rink shall provide a timekeeper and scorekeeper who operate the game clock\/penalty clock and record each goal scored or penalty assessed respectively.","Time of Match","The time allowed for a game shall be three twenty-minute periods of actual play, with a rest intermission between each period. If the game remains tied at the conclusion of three periods, the results of the game for each team is recorded as a tie. A five-minute overtime period shall be played in the event that a game is tied after three 20-minute periods . . sup.2",".sup.2 adopted in 1979","Division of Ice Surface","The ice surface is divided into three zones with blue lines at 70-feet from each end of the rink diagonally that shall be the \u201cAttacking\u201d and \u201cDefending\u201d zones and a red line at center ice which has 30-feet of playing surface at either side. This is the \u201cCenter Ice\u201d zone. The surface is marked by face-off circles at dead center-ice, two in each defending\/attacking zone at the left and right equally from the goalmouth and two in each 30-foot zone separated by the red-line. All face-off spots (where the puck is dropped) are to be 20-feet from the sideboards that surround the rink.","There are a total of nine face-off spots.","Players\/Penalty Bench","Each team shall have a separate players bench in which the reserve players await their turn to participate in the game. Each team is permitted 18 skaters and 2 goaltenders. The roster is submitted to an official scorer prior to the start of a game. Each rink must be provided with benches or seats to be known as the \u201cPenalty Bench\u201d. Separate penalty benches must be provided for each team. The purpose of the penalty bench is for players guilty of committing a foul during the course of the game to be restricted to these benches until their penalty time has expired. The penalty benches shall be separated by the timekeepers\/scorers bench.","Timing Devices","Each rink must be provided with a siren or horn or other suitable sound device, for use by the timekeeper. The device is used to signal the end of each period and\/or to signal when a goal is scored. A timing device is used to operate the game clock and penalty clocks. The game\/penalty clocks run without interruption unless otherwise signaled by an on-ice official. The clocks resume running time upon any face-off that resumes play.","The Skaters","A starting line-up consists of one right-wing, one left-wing one center, two defensemen and one goaltender. Any skater may play any position except goaltender during any game.","Change of Players","A coach may change any combination of players except the goaltender \u201con the fly\u201d (during play) or at any whistle. The home team coach will have the benefit of making the last player change if so desired. A team may change their goaltender during any play stoppage and may replace him with an additional skater at any time during the course of the game.","Player Equipment","The mandatory player equipment is ice skates, gloves, shoulder pads, knee pads, elbow pads, helmets and a stick. The goaltender may use similar equipment, and additionally may use a catching glove and a blocker for his hands and enlarged goaltenders pads for his leg area covering the top knee area to around his skates at both sides, and not to exceed 10 inches in width. The goaltender may also wear equipment to shield the neck and upper torso area and may use a somewhat enlarged stick at the shaft to the blades tip.","Puck","The puck is the object that the players will attempt to deposit in the opponents goal net. It is one inch thick and three inches in diameter. It shall weigh between five and a half ounces and six ounces. The home team shall provide the pucks for each game, which are kept frozen in ice near the timekeepers bench.","Penalties","Penalties shall be served in actual playing time and be divided into the following categories and time assessed:","A) Minor Penalty, 2-minutes","B) Bench Minor Penalty, 2-minutes","C) Double-Minor Penalty, 4-minutes","D) Major Penalty, 5-minutes","E) Misconduct Penalty, 10-minutes","F) Match Penalty, Remaining Game Time","G) Penalty Shot","A double major penalty may be assessed against a player that displays conduct that exceeds an intent to injure . . sup.3",".sup.3 adopted in 1991","When a penalty is being served and team \u201cA\u201d has a manpower advantage, team \u201cA\u201d is on the \u201cpower play\u201d and team \u201cB\u201d is \u201cshort-handed\/penalty killing\u201d.
