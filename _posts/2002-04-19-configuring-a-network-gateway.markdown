{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This invention relates generally to configuring a network gateway and, more particularly, to a system that obtains the identity of devices connected to the gateway and generates configuration information for the gateway based on the identity of the devices.","An apparatus may contain an embedded controller or agent software to monitor and control its operation. Any type of apparatus may have an embedded controller or agent including, but not limited to, home appliances, office equipment, medical devices, and industrial tools. Other examples include robots, blood analyzers, multifunction copiers, and air conditioners.","Embedded controllers, also referred to as \u201cembedded devices\u201d, are often connected to an internal network, such as a local area network (LAN), wireless IEEE (Institute of Electrical & Electronics Engineers) 802.11, or HomePlug powerline, with an interface to the Internet. One type of interface to the Internet is a network gateway (or simply \u201cgateway\u201d).","A gateway is a software system (which may be installed on a stand-alone device) for interfacing devices near the gateway to remote, centralized services. A gateway acts as the interface between proximity local area protocols and wide area protocols, such as TCP\/IP (Transmission Control Protocol\/Internet Protocol) on the Internet. A gateway also manages its client devices, aggregates their data, and performs other related tasks.","Ideally, a gateway should not require manual configuration. In practice, however, a gateway is general purpose and may encounter many different kinds of devices. Similarly, devices on the local network may change configurations. This flexibility means that a gateway cannot be pre-configured to handle all possible devices. The management of gateways and their devices becomes the responsibility of a central server.","In general, in one aspect, the invention is directed to a gateway that is in communication with a device. The gateway obtains data relating to the device, transmits the data to a server, and receives configuration information from the server. The configuration information includes customized information relating to the device that is generated based on the data. This aspect of the invention may also include one or more of the following features.","The data may be identification information for the device. The identification information may identify at least one of a type of the device, an instance of the device, a version of the device, and a manufacturer of the device. The data may be obtained by communicating with the device using a discovery protocol and\/or by reading a file. The file may reside on the gateway. The data may be transmitted to the server as an extensible Markup Language document using HyperText Transfer Protocol.","The gateway may format the data as a self-describing computer language document prior to transmission. The gateway may configure\/reconfigure itself based on the configuration information. The gateway may transmit at least some of the configuration information to the device.","The configuration information may be generated dynamically based on the data. The configuration information may include at least one of (i) instructions to process, collect and\/or publish information received from the device, (ii) instructions to generate a graphical user interface to display information relating to the device; (iii) instructions defining a language for presenting information relating to the device, and (iv) a list of files to download. The gateway may download at least one of the files from the list.","The gateway may be in communication with plural devices. In this case, the gateway may obtain data relating to each of the plural devices, transmit the data to a server, and receive configuration information from the server. The configuration information may be customized information relating to each of the plural devices that is generated based on the data.","The gateway may determine if communication with the device has been lost and, in this case, it may report a loss of communication to the server. The gateway may determine if predetermined configuration information can be obtained from the device and, in this case, it may receive the predetermined configuration information from the device. The obtaining, transmitting and receiving processes noted above may be performed if the predetermined configuration information cannot be received from the device. The gateway may configure itself, using the configuration information, to monitor the device, aggregate data from plural monitored devices, and report the aggregated data to the server.","In general, in another aspect, the invention is an apparatus, such as a server, that is in communication with the gateway. The apparatus receives data from the gateway; generates configuration information relating to the device based on the data, and transmits the configuration information to the gateway. This aspect of the invention may also include one or more of the following features.","The data may include at least one of identification information for the device and identification information for the gateway. The identification information may identify at least one of a type of the device, an instance of the device, a version of the device, and a manufacturer of the device. The configuration information may be generated dynamically by selecting from a plurality of configurations based on the data. The configuration information may be an amalgamation of data retrieved from one or more sources by the apparatus. The configuration information may include at least one of (i) instructions to process, collect and\/or publish information received from the device, (ii) instructions to generate a graphical user interface to display information relating to the device; (iii) instructions defining a language for presenting information relating to the device, and (iv) a list of files to download. The configuration information may be generated by retrieving data from one or more sources and inserting the data into a predefined template.","The apparatus may generate a graphical user interface to enable selection of the device when configuring the gateway. The configuration information may be transmitted to the gateway as an extensible Markup Language document using HyperText Transfer Protocol. The configuration information may include a list of files to download. The apparatus may download at least one of the files from the list to the gateway.","The data received by the apparatus may include identification information that identifies the device. The apparatus may generate the configuration information by obtaining the configuration information based on a hierarchy of the identification information. Searching according to the hierarchy may include searching first for configuration information relating to an instance of the device and then based on more general information relating to the device than the instance until appropriate configuration information is obtained.","The apparatus may obtain capabilities of the device from a database and generate the configuration information based on the capabilities of the device. The apparatus may download the capabilities from a server that maintains a database of device capabilities. The device capabilities may be defined by one or more SNMP MIBs (Simple Network Management Protocol Management Information Bytes). The capabilities of the device may be obtained based on the identification information received from the gateway. The identification information may include at least one of a type of the device and a version of the device.","In general, in another aspect, the invention is directed to an apparatus, such as a server, that receives identification information for a device, searches a database of SNMP MIBs based on the identification information to obtain SNMP MIBs that correspond to the device, the SNMP MIBs defining one or more capabilities of the device, and outputs SNMP MIBs that correspond to the device. This aspect of the invention may include one or more of the following features.","The apparatus may search the database based on a hierarchy of the identification information. Searching based on the hierarchy may include searching first for SNMP MIBs relating to an instance of the device and then searching for SNMP MIBs based on more general information relating to the device than the instance until appropriate SNMP MIBs are found.","In general, in another aspect, the invention is directed to a system that includes a device, a gateway that is in communication with the device, and a server that is in communication with the gateway. The gateway includes circuitry to obtain data relating to the device, to transmit the data to a server, and to receive configuration information from the server that is generated based on the data. The server includes circuitry to receive the data from the gateway, to generate the configuration information based on the data, and to transmit the configuration information to the gateway. This aspect of the invention may also include one or more of the following features.","The system may include an apparatus having circuitry to receive identification information for the device from the server, search a database of SNMP MIBs based on the identification information to obtain SNMP MIBs that correspond to the device, the SNMP MIBs defining one or more capabilities of the device, and output, to the server, SNMP MIBs that correspond to the device. The circuitry for each of the foregoing may be at least one of programmable logic, logic gates, a processor, and a memory.","Other features and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the following description, including the claims and drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","10","14","17","14","17","14","14"]},"Devices  to  are connected to an internal network , which may be a wired or wireless network, serial data line, or power line(s) (e.g., such as a home network configured using AC (Alternating Current) power lines as communications media). A gateway  provides an interface between each of devices  to  on internal network  and an external network .","Gateway  communicates with each device  to  via internal network  using one or more protocols, such as SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol), Modbus, HomePlug, UP&P (Universal Plug and Play), or one or more of many proprietary protocols. Gateway  manages devices  to , aggregates their data, and performs other tasks relating to the devices. A process for configuring gateway , and one or more of devices  to  through gateway , is described below with respect to .","A router or modem  couples internal network  to external network , such as the Internet\/World Wide Web (Web). External network  runs TCP\/IP or some other suitable protocol. Network connections throughout internal network  and external network  may be via Ethernet, telephone line, wireless, or other transmission media.","External network  contains a server , which may be a computer or any other processing device.","Embedded Controller","Embedded controller  runs software , which includes web client application  and device operating software . Web client application  includes a TCP\/IP protocol stack that allows embedded controller  to communicate over external network . Device operating software  provides an interface between Web client application  and a database . Through device operating software , embedded controller  retrieves data stored in database  and stores data in database .","Database  is stored in a memory  on device  or internal to embedded controller . Database  stores configuration information for device , including, but not limited to, operational parameters and configuration files, and identification information for the device.","The operational parameters constitute settings and\/or control instructions for device , which are implemented by embedded controller . The types of operational parameters that are stored in database  depend on the nature of device . For example, if device  is a heating\/cooling system, the operational parameters may include temperature levels, humidity levels, airflow controls, vent\/duct open\/close controls, and fan motor speed settings. A configuration file may contain one or more such operational parameters (and other information) for an instance of device .","What is meant by \u201cinstance\u201d is the specific identity of device  as distinguished from other identical devices. The identification information stored in database  may identify the instance of device . This identification information may include, but is not limited to, data identifying the type of the device, the version of the device (e.g., an updated model), the manufacturer of the device, the model name of the device, the model number of the device, the serial number of the device, and a universal unique identifier (UUID) for the device.","Although embedded controller  is described herein as providing device  with significant \u201cintelligence\u201d, it is noted that the processes described herein work equally with less \u201cintelligent\u201d devices. For example, device  may be a relatively \u201csimple\u201d system that is capable of providing status information to gateway , but not of accepting commands from a remote device, such as gateway . For example, a simple photocopier may be able to provide its copy count to gateway , but little else. Likewise, device  may also be capable of two-way communication, but not to a great extent. For example, a home thermostat may be capable of providing a temperature reading to gateway  and of receiving a new temperature setting from gateway .","Server","Server  is a computer that runs HTTP. Server  includes a controller , such as a microprocessor or other processing device, for executing instructions to perform the functions described below. To avoid confusion in terminology, the following reads as though those functions are performed by server , even though software in controller  of server  performs the functions.","Server  executes Web server software  to communicate over external network . Web server software  also may host a Web page for device . The Web page (not shown) may be displayed on the computer of a user who may select a device and input configuration information to configure the gateway to manage the device. This configuration information is transmitted to Web server software  over external network . Web server software  stores the configuration information in database . Database  is stored in a memory , which is inside of, or external to, server . Database  may also store variables that are monitored during the operation of device . Configuration parameters for a device can be stored in database  individually or as part of a configuration file for an instance of a device.","Web server software  stores and retrieves data in database  using application logic . Application logic  is software for accessing database  using, for example, Java servlets and a JDBC (Java Data Base Connectivity) database","Network Gateway","Gateway  is a computer that runs SNMP or any other supported protocol to communicate with devices  to  on internal network  and HTTP to communicate with server  on external network . Gateway  includes a controller , such as a microprocessor, and a storage medium , which stores executable instructions  to perform the configuration (and other) functions described below (see internal architecture view ).","Storage medium  may also include one or more files that include information identifying devices  to  on internal network , which are managed by gateway . The information in the file(s) may include identification information, such as a type of the device, a version of the device, an instance of the device, and a manufacturer of the device. Other types of identification information, such as that noted above, may also be included in the file(s) in storage medium .","Gateway  runs an operating system , such as WindowsNT\u00ae or Linux, and a Web sever application , which enable gateway  to host one or more Web pages. The Web pages (not shown) may be for each of devices  to . Web pages hosted by the gateway may be in lieu of, or in addition to, any Web pages hosted by server . The Web pages may be used to monitor and control the devices managed by the gateway. In addition, gateway  (or server ) may host a Web page for the gateway itself. This Web page may be used to reconfigure the gateway manually. For example, software may be downloaded to the gateway to handle different types of devices.","Alternatively, and in accordance with this embodiment, gateway  may reconfigure itself, and one or more of devices  to , automatically (i.e., without user intervention).  shows a process  for configuring gateway  (and devices  to ).","Configuration information  for gateway  specifies data variables to collect from its managed devices, expressions, alarm conditions, data to log, notifications such as electronic mail or pager numbers to alert people to a condition, and processes for reporting such information to a centralized server . In this embodiment, the configuration information may include one or more computer files with instructions on how to monitor a device and calculate alarm conditions based on data received from the device. For example, an expression may be \u201cTank+Tank\u201d, which adds device variables called Tank and Tank to find a total tank level in a device. An alarm may be defined as a condition such as \u201cTank>280\u201d, the occurrence of which may require gateway  to notify server .","Configuration information for gateway  may define data variables within the gateway. These definitions include the device driver(s)  for the gateway to use to communicate with the device, the data type associated with the variables, and the sampling rate associated with a device. A device driver  is a software program residing in gateway  for managing an associated device. A device driver in gateway  obtains device variables and acquires data for each such variable. Drivers usually acquire data by sending a request over a network and receiving a reply. Drivers may also receive asynchronous messages or read hardware registers in the devices directly.","Gateway  includes a software engine for processing information acquired from devices  to  in the manner described above. For example, the engine can determine expressions and alarm conditions, and communicate information to a centralized server in a variety of ways. There may be a separate driver\/engine for each customer (manufacturer) or device managed by the gateway. The configuration of each such driver\/engine may be different for each customer and\/or type of device.","Configuration Process",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["50","20","50"]},"Gateway  may include an SNMP driver. When gateway  starts, the SNMP driver finds four devices connected to the gateway: a copier, a printer, a UPS (Uninteruptible Power Supply), and a network router . Gateway  sends data identifying these four devices to server . This data may include the manufacturer, model number, and individual serial numbers of the four devices.","Server  responds to the data with a list of configuration files for network gateway  to obtain. The configuration files relate to the devices discovered using the SNMP driver. Gateway  downloads each of the files in the list from the server or some other source that is accessible to gateway , thereby configuring gateway .","The resulting configuration causes the gateway to perform the following functions for the devices. For the copier, the configuration causes gateway  to read its copy count and status and to report the copy count each day to a third party, such as the copier manufacturer or service center. If the status indicates a fault for more than one hour, the gateway is to report this alarm condition to the third party. For the printer, the configuration causes gateway  to read its paper usage and toner level and to report this information to a third party, which may or may not be the same as the third party associated with the copier. For the UPS, the configuration causes gateway  to read the battery health and discharge cycles and to report this information to a third party, which may or may not be the same as the foregoing third parties. For the router, the configuration causes gateway  to ignore the router, since the router is not supported.","Thus, in above example, gateway  has three device configurations loaded. Each configuration may be independent of the others. Each configuration may contain one or more rules\/instructions for gathering, processing, publishing and\/or reporting data related to a device. For example, Web server  running on gateway  may provide three Web pages that publish the data for each device in its own format. One Web page may look like the LCD (liquid crystal display) on the copier, another Web page may provide statistics and history for the UPS, and so on.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["25","14","20","24"]},"Controller  in gateway  executes software (instructions ) to perform its portion of process , as do server  and embedded controller . Gateway  discovers () devices that gateway  is managing on internal network . SNMP may be used to perform the device discovery; however, any suitable protocol may be used. Gateway  obtains () data relating to one or more of devices  to  on internal network . The data includes at least some of the identification information noted above, such as a type of a device, an instance of the device, and\/or a manufacturer of the device.","The identification information for a device may be obtained by communicating with the device through a discovery protocol. For example, gateway  may issue () a request for the identification information. The embedded controller  may receive the request and transmit () the requested information to the gateway. Alternatively, gateway  may read () one of its (or other's) files in order to determine the identification information for devices on internal network . As another alternative, gateway  may read registers on the devices themselves.","In addition to identification information, gateway  may determine, using the discovery protocol, if pre-existing communication with a device has been lost. If so, gateway  may report this loss to server . Server  is thus able to determine if any devices are \u201cmissing\u201d. Gateway  may also determine if predetermined configuration information (e.g., rules on what parameters to monitor) is stored on the device. If so, gateway  may obtain the configuration information directly from the device, without going through server  as described below, unless that configuration information needs to be changed, updated or checked. The following, however, assumes that the configuration information is obtained from server .","Gateway  transmits () the identification information for a device  to server . The device may be a newly-discovered device or gateway  may simply query for new configuration information periodically. Gateway  generates an extensible Markup Language (XML) document that contains the identification information. XML is a self-describing computer language in the sense that fields in the XML code identify variables and their values in the XML code. The data may be formatted as an XML document using an XML template. Gateway  transmits the resulting XML document to server  using an HTTP POST command. The reply to the HTTP POST command contains individual configuration parameters (or the like) and\/or a list of configuration files to obtain from the server or any other source on the network that is accessible to the gateway. HTTP GET commands may be used to obtain each of the configuration files.","Server  receives () the XML document from gateway  and parses the XML code to obtain the device identification information. Server  dynamically generates () configuration information for the gateway by selecting from a plurality of configurations based on the data. More specifically, server  identifies () the device based on the identification information in the XML document, selects () configuration information appropriate for the identified device, retrieves the configuration information associated with the device from one or more sources\u2014remote and\/or local, and combines () the configuration information to create a customized configuration for the gateway to use with the device.","Server  may also obtain capabilities of a device, defined, e.g., by SNMP MIBs (Management Information Bytes), from a database in which the capabilities are correlated to the identification information (e.g., a type of the device (e.g., copier) and a version of the device). The database may be stored in a server (either server  or a different server), and SNMP MIBs downloaded from there. The configuration information may be generated with knowledge of these capabilities. For example, if one of the capabilities of a device is to print documents, the configuration information may specify that total paper usage in the device is to be monitored.","The configuration information may specify data variables for the gateway to collect from a device, expressions, alarm conditions for the gateway to identify in the device, data from the device for the gateway to log, notifications to alert others to a condition in the device, and processes for reporting this information to a centralized server. The configuration information may also include instructions to process information received from a device, to generate a graphical user interface to display information relating to the device; and to define a language for presenting information relating to the device.","The configuration information may include a list of files for gateway  to retrieve from various sources. Server  may generate this list from a set of available files. These files may contain device configuration information and may be provided to gateway  in response to a request from gateway .","Thus, the resulting configuration information may constitute an amalgamation of data associated with the device and retrieved by the server from various sources. This is different from other types of gateway configuration protocols, such as OSGI (Open Services Gateway Initiative), which only specifies a method of downloading bundles that provide predefined services.","As noted above, the configuration information is based on the type of the device and may also be based on the instance of that device or the type\/instance of gateway . Server  may have access to different configuration information for a device type\/instance. For example, when configurations are translated into different languages (e.g., French, English, Spanish, etc.), each language version may be stored at server  and returned to the gateway based on the gateway's location.","Server  may generate () the configuration information using a template. That is, server  may retrieve (e.g., from memory or a remote location), a template specific to a device type and augment the template dynamically with configuration parameters specific to the device. For example, each customer may choose its own settings that indicate an alarm condition in a device. When generating the configuration information, server  may retrieve this customer data from a database and insert it into the appropriate portions of the template.","Server  may generate the configuration information based on a hierarchy of the identification information. That is, server  may find the best \u201cfit\u201d configuration information for a device by searching first for configuration information that corresponds to an exact instance of the device. If the appropriate configuration information, or a portion thereof, is not found, server  may search next for configuration information that corresponds to a model of the device. If the appropriate configuration information, or a portion thereof, is not found, server  may search next for more general configuration information, such as configuration information that corresponds to a manufacturer of the device. For example, the search order for configuration information for a copier might be Model X13 at floor , then model X13, then multi-function copier, then copier. In this manner, server  is able to generate the most appropriate configuration information for a device.","As noted above, a server (not shown) other than server  may contain a database of SNMP MIBs that define the capabilities of one or more devices. In response to a request, e.g., from server , which identifies the devices connected to gateway  (e.g., the request may include the identification information sent from gateway ), this other server may find the best \u201cfit\u201d capabilities in the manner described above. That is, the other server may search through the SNMP MIBs according to the hierarchy of the identification information (e.g., first search according to device instance for SNMP MIBs that correspond to the device instance and then search more generally until appropriate SNMP MIBs are found) and output the appropriate SNMP MIBs to server . Server  may then use these SNMP MIBs defining the capabilities of the device to generate its configuration information.","Once server  generates the configuration information, server  creates () an extensible Markup Language (XML) document that contains the configuration information, including, e.g., a list of files for gateway  to download. The configuration information may be formatted as an XML document using an XML template. Server  transmits () the resulting XML document to gateway  via a reply to the gateway's initial HTTP POST command.","Gateway  receives () the XML document, parses the XML document to obtain the configuration information, and obtains (using, e.g., an HTTP GET command) any files in the list (e.g., device drivers) needed to support the configuration defined by the received configuration information. The files may be obtained from memory and\/or a remote source, such as server . The files may be per-device rules, Web resources, or the like.","Gateway  configures () itself using the configuration information, including any additional files that gateway  retrieves. For example, if the configuration information specifies that gateway  should instruct server  upon detecting an alarm condition in device , gateway  reconfigures itself to detect the alarm condition and make the appropriate report to server . More specifically, gateway  configures itself to obtain the information from the device necessary to detect the alarm condition, to calculate the alarm condition, and to perform the necessary reporting function.","As another example, gateway  may configure itself, using the configuration information, to monitor specific parameters of device  (e.g., total paper usage or copy count of a photocopier). Assuming that gateway  is monitoring similar parameters in devices  through , gateway  may aggregate the monitored information from devices  through  (or some subset thereof), and report the aggregated data to server  or other remote device.","Gateway  may also reconfigure one or more of devices  to  using the new configuration information. For example, gateway  may transmit () at least some of the configuration information to a device . Which configuration information is to be transmitted (e.g., device operational parameters) may be identified in the configuration information itself and\/or pre-programmed into gateway . The embedded controller  in device  receives () the configuration information and reconfigures () the device accordingly.","Thus, another difference between the operation of gateway  and OSGI (mentioned above) is that OSGI gateways request bundles and a server fulfills that request. An OSGI Gateway decides which bundles it needs, based on other software modules or a user's actions. Gateway  reports its devices to a server so that the server can manage what the gateway will do with those devices. With server , it is therefore possible to personalize or customize operations based on customer, location, service group, etc.","Architecture","Process  is not limited to use with the hardware\/software configuration of ; it may find applicability in any computing or processing environment. Each portion of process  may be implemented in hardware (e.g., an ASIC {Application-Specific Integrated Circuit} and\/or an FPGA {Field Programmable Gate Array}), software, or a combination of hardware and software running on one or more of embedded device , gateway , and server .","Each portion of process  may be implemented using one or more computer programs executing on one or more programmable computers that each includes a processor, a storage medium readable by the processor (including volatile and non-volatile memory and\/or storage elements), at least one input device, and one or more output devices.","Each such program may be implemented in a high level procedural or object-oriented programming language to communicate with a computer system. Also, the programs can be implemented in assembly or machine language. The language may be a compiled or an interpreted language.","Each computer program may be stored on a storage medium or device (e.g., CD-ROM, hard disk, or magnetic diskette) that is readable by a general or special purpose programmable computer or other machine for configuring and operating the computer when the storage medium or device is read by the computer to perform process .","Each portion of process  may also be implemented as a machine-readable storage medium, configured with a computer program, where, upon execution, instructions in the computer program cause the computer or other machine to operate in accordance with process .","The invention is not limited to use with the protocols and standards described above. For example, Web server  may use Java servlets, ASP (Active Server Pages), ISAPI (Internet Server Application Programming Interface), and\/or NET interfaces to effect communications. The commands sent by embedded controller , server , and gateway  are not limited to HTTP GET and POST commands. Any commands and\/or requests for requesting and receiving data may be used.","The data transferred between embedded controller , gateway , and server  is not limited to the configuration information described above. The configuration information may include, for example, a schedule of actions to be performed by gateway , which is based on information pertaining the owner of a device . For example, owner preferences may be stored in database . The instance-specific data may be used by server  to correlate the owner of the device to the appropriate preferences. These preferences then may be transmitted to gateway  to control the operation of device .","The documents and commands described above are not limited to XML format. Any computer language or other machine-readable format may be used for the commands. The documents may be in any format. In addition, the invention is not limited to use with the Web, Web servers, networks and the like. The servers and embedded controllers described herein may be the same type of general-purpose computer appropriately programmed, or different devices.","Embedded controller , gateway , and server  are depicted as different devices in . However, their functionality may be included on one device, two devices, or more than three devices.","Other embodiments not described herein are also within the scope of the following claims."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
