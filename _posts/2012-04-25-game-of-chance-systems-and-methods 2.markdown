No. 11\/468,809 entitled \u201cSecondary Game\u201d filed on Aug. 31, 2006, which is hereby incorporated herein by reference. This application is a continuation-in-part of co-pending U.S. application Ser. No. 12\/759,757 entitled \u201cGame of Chance Systems and Methods\u201d filed on Apr. 14, 2010, which is hereby incorporated herein by reference. This application claims priority to U.S. provisional application 61\/478,996 entitled \u201cGame of Chance Systems and Methods\u201d filed on Apr. 26, 2011, which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.","Games of chance have enjoyed widespread popularity. Traditional systems for playing these games suffer some drawbacks. Computer implemented systems may alleviate some of these drawbacks.","In various embodiments, computer systems may allow competition or other interaction between players.","VR Gaming\u2014Generally","In various embodiments, a player may play a second game while he's waiting during a first game. For example, a player who is playing a game of poker with other live players may have to wait while the other players are deciding their move. During this wait time, the player could play another game. The other game could even be based on aspects of the first game. For example, a second game that a player plays while he waits for a first game to continue could be based on cards that have been dealt during the first game. For example, the two cards dealt to a player in a game of Texas Hold 'em poker could serve as the starting hand for a game of blackjack that the player plays while he waits for the action to continue in a game.","In various embodiments, a player may play in a first game via a network connection. The player may be playing in a game over the Internet, while sitting at a game terminal, while sitting at a gaming device, or while using a mobile gaming device. Software within the player's personal computer, betting terminal, or other device may track cards or other outcomes that have occurred in a first game. The computer, betting terminal, etc., may allow the player to use those outcomes to serve as the basis for a second game. The betting terminal, for example, may allow the player to make an additional bet and\/or to initiate an additional game which is based off the initial game in which the player has been participating. The player may make decisions in the additional game, such as decisions of whether to hit or stand in a game of blackjack, or such as decisions of how many cards to draw in a game of video poker. The device of the player (e.g., the betting terminal; e.g., the mobile gaming device) may then determine a final outcome of the game, such as by dealing additional cards to the player. The device of the player may then determine a payout for the player. The player may then be paid, e.g., through the crediting of a player account.","In various embodiments, a player may be sitting at the same table as other players in a live game, e.g., in a game of blackjack. While the player waits for another player's decision, the player may begin playing a second game, e.g., using a mobile gaming device. The second game may be based off cards or other outcomes or indicia that the player, dealer, or other players have received in the game. For example, the player may have his player tracking card inserted into a slot corresponding to the player's position at the table. The casino may track cards that have been dealt to the player, e.g., via a card reader built into an automatic shuffler or dealer used at the table. The casino may thereby determine what cards have been dealt to the player. Such cards may then serve as a basis for an additional game the player may play, e.g., on his mobile gaming device.","VR Gaming Characters","In various embodiments, one or more players may participate in a game over a network. In various embodiments, two or more players may participate in a game over a network. The game may be a live game. One or more of such players may play from or using a player device, such as a kiosk, betting terminal, mobile gaming device, slot machine, video poker machine, or other device. In various embodiments, players may not be physically proximate to one another. Rather, players may be physically spread out, such as throughout a casino, throughout a city, or even throughout the world. Nevertheless, players may view images or representations of one another. By viewing representations of other players, a player may feel a greater sense of camaraderie with the other players in the game.","In various embodiments, a representation of a player may include a simulated character, an avatar and\/or computer generated imagery (CGI). A player may customize the character representing him. The player may customize the character to have a particular look (e.g., hair color; e.g., height; e.g., girth), to have particular expressions (e.g., smiling; e.g., frowning; e.g., looking angry); to have a particular voice (e.g., a raspy voice; e.g., a smooth voice); and\/or to have any other characteristics.","In various embodiments, a player may customize or select the actions that his character representation performs. A player may customize the manner in which his character rolls dice, the manner in which his character deals cards, the manner in which his player moves chips into the pot, the manner in which his character collects money from the pot, the manner in which the character thinks or contemplates (e.g., the player holds his head between his hands), the manner in which a character indicates a decision (e.g., in a game of blackjack, a character might indicate a \u201chit\u201d decision by either thumping the table hard twice or by lightly tapping the table twice), the manner in which a character walks (e.g., the manner in which a player gets up and walks away from a table), or any other mannerisms or actions of a character.","In various embodiments, a player may select characteristics, actions, or other mannerisms of a character through navigating a set of one or more menus. For example, a player may select a default expression for his character from among the following list: happy; sad; angry; grumpy; bored; excited; crazy. Similarly, the player may select a particular manner in which his character will take some action. For example, a player may select from among the following list for how his character might roll the dice: (a) throw the dice as hard as he can; (b) shake the dice then roll them; (c) roll them gently along the surface of the table; (d) turn around and throw the dice over the back of his head; (e) throw the dice from the side of his hand; (f) throw the dice over his fingers; (g) throw the dice one at a time.","In various embodiments, a first player in a game may view the character representations of other players in his game. The player may view the other players via a monitor or display screen for example. If a player is at a terminal with multiple monitors, the player may view a character representation of each other player in the game, one other player per monitor, for example.","In various embodiments, games with multiple players may include craps, poker, blackjack, roulette, and other games.","\u201cTrading Desk\u201d Gaming Kiosk","In various embodiments, an automatic card dealer may deal cards to a player. The dealt cards may be read (utilizing various technologies) by the dealing device. A terminal or kiosk may receive information about the cards from the dealing device so that the terminal may display information about the cards on a screen. The dealing device and\/or the terminal may also pipe information about the cards to other terminals or to other devices. This may allow other players besides the player at the immediate terminal to use information about the cards to participate in the game. In some embodiments, other players may participate (e.g., play; e.g., bet on) in the same game as the player immediately at the terminal plays in. In some embodiments, cards dealt by the dealing device may be used by a player at a first terminal for a first game, and by a player at a second terminal for a second game.","In various embodiments, a terminal may show a display of a floor plan (or other physical space), such as a casino floor plan. The floor plan may show the locations of certain games, such as the locations of certain slot machines or such as the locations of certain table games. In some embodiments, a player at the terminal may select a game from the display (e.g., from the display of the floor plan). A card dealer from the selected game may read cards dealt at the game and may transmit information about such cards to the terminal. The player at the terminal may then participate in the live game and\/or may participate in a separate game which is based on the live game.","In various embodiments, the terminal may have various input devices, such as input buttons. In various embodiments, input buttons may allow the player to make standard decisions in games. A terminal may have buttons (e.g., dedicated buttons) for making a decision to \u201chit\u201d or for making a decision to \u201cstand\u201d in a game of blackjack. A terminal may have a button to \u201cdraw\u201d a button to \u201chold\u201d and\/or a button to \u201cdiscard\u201d, where such buttons may be utilized in a game of video poker.","In various embodiments, a first player at a first terminal may have the ability and\/or the option to link with a second player at a second terminal. The first player and the second player may compete against one another, such as by playing different positions in the same game. For example, the first player and the second player may play a game of Texas Hold'em poker against one another. In some embodiments, the first player and the second player may link together to cooperate. For example, the first and second players may both wish to participate in a game of blackjack with a minimum $50 bet. However, both the first and second players may wish to bet a maximum of $25 each. Thus, the first and second players may pool their bets so as to participate in the game of blackjack. In various embodiments, a first player may link to a second player so as to \u201cpiggyback\u201d off the decisions made by the second player. The first player may, for example, participate in games played by the second player. The first player may copy all the decisions made by the second player in the game. Thus, the first player may benefit from the skill of the second player. For example, the second player may be an experienced blackjack player, while the first player may be a novice. In various embodiments, the first player may get advice from the second player. The second player may provide advice over a text channel and\/or over a voice channel, for example. Game outcomes achieved by the first player may be automatically displayed at the terminal of the second player. For example, the first player's initial hand of blackjack may be automatically displayed for the second player to see at the second player's terminal. The second player may thereby have the opportunity to provide advice to the first player.","In various embodiments, a first player may peruse a display which shows information about potential other players to whom the first player might link up. For example, a display may provide a list of other players. The display may show geographically the locations of second players. The list may show whether or not a second player is available for linking up to the first player (e.g., whether the second player is willing to link up; e.g., whether the second player is not already involved in a sufficient number of games to occupy him). The display may show any other pertinent information about other players. For example, the display may show demographic information about other players. The first player may choose other players to whom to link up based on desired demographic characteristics.","In various embodiments, a terminal may include an input device which converts player motions into game commands. The input device may detect the motion of the device as a whole, including forward and backward motions, twisting or turning motions, up and down motions, accelerations and decelerations, and any other motions. The input device may contain accelerometers, gyroscopes, and\/or other devices for detecting motion.","In various embodiments, an input device that converts motion into commands may be connected to the terminal via a cord. The cord may bring power to the input device. The cord may also transmit signals from the input device to the terminal. In some embodiments, the input device may not be physically attached to the terminal. The input device may be battery powered, powered through motion, or powered in some other fashion. The input device may communicate with the terminal via wireless signals, such as via Wi-Fi or via infrared communication.","Motions of the input device may be translated into various game commands or into other commands. For example, motions may be translated into amounts to bet, into decisions to be made in a game, or into any other commands.","In various embodiments, a device at the terminal may track the motion of a player's eye. For example, a camera may be pointed at the eye level of a typical player (e.g., at the eye level of a person of average height). Image processing algorithms may determine whether the pupil of the eye is looking straight into the camera, to the left, to the right, up, down, etc. Such image processing algorithms may recognize the degree to which the pupil is centered or off-centered. It may thereby be determined what the player is focusing on at any given moment in time. As will be appreciated, other methods of tracking a player's eye motion may also be employed.","Relative Bet","In various embodiments, a first player may make a bet that a second player will fare better than does a third player. A second player may fare better than a third player by winning more games, winning more money, winning more high paying outcomes, or by exceeding any performance metric of the third player. Thus, in various embodiments, a first player may bet that a performance metric or statistic describing a second player will exceed a performance metric or statistic describing the third player. In various embodiments, a first player may bet that a performance metric or statistic applied to a second player will exceed the same performance metric or statistic applied to the third player. In various embodiments, the second player and the first player may be one and the same. Thus, for example, a first player may bet that he will perform better than another player. A first player may bet that he will perform worse than a second player.","A bet that a second player will fare better than a first player may pertain to some time period. For example, a first player may bet that a second player will win more than does a third player over a period from 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm in the afternoon. A bet that a second player will fare better than a third player may apply to sessions or to trips. For example, a first player may bet that a second player will fare better during his trip to Las Vegas than does a third player during her trip to Las Vegas.","In various embodiments, a performance metric may apply to different players over different time periods. For example, a first player may bet that a second player will win more money from 3:00 pm to 4:00 pm than does a second player from 5:00 pm to 6:00 pm. As another example, a first player may bet that a second player will win more money from 3:00 pm to 4:00 pm than does a second player from 3:00 pm to 5:00 pm.","In various embodiments, the performance of a second player relative to a third player may be compared even if the second and third players play different games. For example, the second player may play slot machines while the third player plays blackjack at a live table game. Though the two players play different games, the winnings of the two players, for example, may still be compared.","A performance metric may measure any one or more of the following: (a) an amount won; (b) an amount wagered; (c) net winnings; (d) gross winnings; (e) a number of payouts over a predetermined amount that have been won; (f) a number of a particular outcome that has been achieved; (g) a number of bonus rounds that have been achieved; (h) a number of times any winning outcome has been achieved; (i) a largest streak of winning outcomes; (j) a level of skill employed; and any other measure.","A bet on the relative performance of two players may be received by a casino. The bet may be received at a casino desk, casino cage, slot machine, gaming device, mobile gaming device, kiosk, over the Internet, or in any other fashion. The first player placing the bet may identify a second player and a third player. The first player may identify a performance metric. The first player may identify which of the second or the third player he wants to bet on to have the superior or highest performance metric. The first player may select a time period as well. The first player may identify games or types of games that will be relevant for the performance metric. The first player may select any other parameters of the bet.","In various embodiments, only certain games, or only certain events are counted in determining how a player performed. For example, a performance metric may describe the net winnings achieved by a player at table games. Thus, if the player plays both table games and slot machine games during the time period of the bet, the games at the slot machines may not count towards determining the performance metric.","Ultimate Gaming Championship","In various embodiments, players may compete in a gaming tournament. The winner may be determined based on some performance metric applied to all players in the tournament. Thus, for example, if the performance metric is a total amount won, then the winning player may be determined based on which player in the tournament has won the most during the time period of the tournament. In various embodiments, a computer player or simulated player may participate in a tournament. Thus, it may be possible for only a single living human to participate in a tournament.","In various embodiments, players may compete in a tournament over a given time period, with all players competing during the same time period. In some embodiments, players may compete during different time periods. For example, a first player may compete from 4:00 pm to 6:00 pm while a second player competes from 7:00 pm to 9:00 pm. The performances of the two players may still be compared against one another.","In some embodiments, each player in a tournament has a fixed amount of money to bet. For example, each player has $2000 to bet. Players may be free to bet the money in any manner they wish. For example, a player may be free to make 2000 $1 bets, or to make 20 $100 bets. The fixed amount of money may be \u201ctoy money\u201d or \u201cplay money\u201d. For example, the money may not be actual U.S. currency and may be useable only for play in a tournament. In this case, players may be able to use what feels like a large amount of money without they themselves, or the casino, having to outlay a large amount of actual U.S. currency. In some embodiments, a player is responsible for using his own money to play in a tournament. For example, a player bets $2000 of his own money in order to complete a tournament.","In various embodiments, the winner of a tournament may be the player who wins the most money. In various embodiments, the winner of a tournament may be the player who wins the most times. In various embodiments the winner of a tournament may determined based on any one or more of the following: (a) the player with the highest gross winnings; (b) the player with the highest net winnings; (c) the player with the most payouts over a certain amount; (d) the player who has reached the most bonus rounds; (e) the player who has won the most payouts over a predetermine amount; (f) the player who has the highest credit balance, e.g., at the end of the tournament period; (g) the player who has won the most per unit time; or any other criteria or metrics.","In order to be eligible to win a tournament and\/or to win a prize in a tournament, a player may have to comply with certain rules or criteria. Any one or more of the following rules may apply to tournament play: (a) a player must play a minimum number of games; (b) a player must play no more than a maximum number of games (in some embodiments, the player may play more than the maximum number of games, but the extra games don't count); (c) a player must play a certain type of game (e.g., poker; e.g., blackjack; e.g., video poker; e.g., Wheel of Fortune); (d) a player must bet a minimum aggregate amount; (e) the player must bet no more than a maximum aggregate amount; (f) each bet made by a player must be a certain minimum amount (e.g., $1); (g) each bet made by a player must be no more than a maximum amount; (h) a player must play at a particular table; (i) the player must play at a particular gaming device; (j) the player must use a particular mobile gaming device; (k) the player must use a particular betting terminal; (l) the player must use only mobile gaming device, though the player may be free to use more than one during the tournament period; or any other rules. In various embodiments, if a player plays a game or takes some other action that is not in accordance with tournament rules, the game or action may not count towards the tournament.","In various embodiments, a player may join a tournament. For example, the player may provide his name, provide an indication of a desire to participate in the tournament, provide a registration fee, acknowledge that he has read or understands tournament rules, and\/or take any other actions to get involved in the tournament. When a tournament begins, the player may provide his identity to a gaming device that he is using. For example, a player may keep a tracking card inserted into a gaming device that he is using. In this way, the gaming device may track the play of the player and allow such play to be counted towards the tournament results. In some embodiments, a player may use a mobile gaming device to compete in a tournament. The mobile gaming device may be specifically assigned to that player. In some embodiments, the player may wear a wristband or other device which communicates with the mobile gaming device and which identifies the player to the mobile gaming device. The player's play at the mobile gaming device may thereby be tracked. Thus, the player's play at the mobile gaming device may count towards the results of the tournament.","In various embodiments, a player may compete in a tournament through bets made on other players. For example, a secondary player may make a bet on a game being played by a primary player. The secondary player may bet, for example, that a primary player will win a live game in which the primary player is playing. The results of the bet of the secondary player may count towards the results of the tournament.","In various embodiments, performance metrics for one or more players in a tournament may be available for viewing by other people, such as by other players in a tournament. In some embodiments, for example, performance metrics for the five tournament leaders may be publicly displayed or made available to other tournament participants. Leaders may be listed by name, alias, or other identifier. Leaders' performance metrics may be posted. For example, the leaders' gross winnings may be listed. With information about other participants made available, tournament participants may be able to plan or change their own methods of play accordingly. For example, a player who is well behind the leaders may decide to increase his bet size, while a person who is in the lead may decide to reduce his bet size so as to minimize risk. In various embodiments, a player in a tournament may view his own standings in the tournament. For example, a player may view where he currently ranks among all players, or how far he is from the leader (e.g., according to the relevant performance metric).","In various embodiments, a casino server or other device may track the progress of all players engaged in tournament play. The casino server may periodically determine performance metrics for all the players in the tournament. The casino server may use the performance metrics to sort the players and thereby to rank them. The casino server may make the rankings available for display. The rankings may be available for display at a slot machine, video poker machine, gaming device, gaming terminal, mobile gaming device, kiosk, or at any device, such as any device connected via a network to the casino server. Thus, for example, a player at a slot machine may select an option to view the current tournament rankings or standings for players participating in the same tournament in which he is participating.","Paper Display\/Epaper","In various embodiments, a paper display may be used as, or in conjunction with, a mobile gaming device. A paper display may include a display that has one or more of the following properties: (a) it is extremely thin (e.g., thinner than 1 or 2 millimeters); (b) it is flexible (e.g., it can be bent, wrapped, or folded); and (c) it is light weight. A mobile gaming device may include an electronic paper display manufactured or developed by E Ink Corporation.","Event Footage","Various events at a casino may occur too quickly for a player to perceive, or too quickly for a player to fully enjoy. For example, when dice are thrown in a game of craps, the dice may be spinning many times per second. The tumbling of the dice and the bouncing of the dice may occur too quickly for a player to perceive every bounce and rebound. Thus, in various embodiments, a player may wish to view the events, such as the rolling of dice, at a slower pace.","In various embodiments, cameras or other imaging devices may capture footage of events. The cameras may include high speed cameras. Such cameras may capture hundreds, thousands, or tens of thousands of frames per second, for example. Footage captured from events at a casino may be made available to players for viewing. The footage may be played back at a different speed from that at which the event occurred. For example, an event that unfolded over a 1-second period may be replayed so that the event appears to unfold over a period of 20 seconds.","In some embodiments, a player may not watch an original event, but may instead watch a replay, such as slow motion replay of the event. In this way, a player may experience more suspense and excitement as he anticipates the final resolution of the event.","Events that may be captured and replayed include the rolling of dice, the spinning of a roulette wheel, the dealing of cards, the spin of slot machine reels, the spin of bonus wheels on gaming devices (e.g., the spin of a Wheel of Fortune), or any other events.","In various embodiments, special cameras or other imaging devices may be focused on places where events of interest are to occur. For example, a high-speed camera may be built into a craps table to capture the rolling of dice. A high-speed camera may be built into a roulette table to capture the spinning of a roulette wheel. In various embodiments, a camera may capture game events as well as other events throughout a casino. For example, a camera may capture footage of people walking through a casino in order to look for security problems. The same camera may also capture the action at a game. Footage taken by the camera may be used to replay action from the game.","In various embodiments, cameras in a casino could photograph people. The photos could later be sold to the people or provided as a guest service.","In various embodiments, a picture which includes a first person (e.g., the subject of the picture) may incidentally include a second person (e.g., an incidental passer-by). Regulations, privacy concerns, or other concerns or issues may make it desirable to remove the image of the second person from the photo before the photo is sold or otherwise provided to the first person (or to some other person). Thus, in various embodiments, a photo may be taken of one or more people. It may then be determined which people are meant to be in the photo and which are not. The people who are not meant to be in the photo may then be removed. In place of the people removed from the photo, background footage of that same area may be inserted (e.g., background footage that had previously been captured). In some embodiments, incidental passers-by who appear in a photo may be grayed out or blurred, but not completely eliminated. The blurring process may prevent such people from being easily identified. In various embodiments, if an incidental passer-by appears in a photograph, the passer-by's consent may be obtained before the photograph can be distributed, e.g., to the main subject of the photo.","In various embodiments, a person may wear or carry an item which identifies that person as someone who wants or is willing to have his picture taken. A person might wear a bracelet or another special item of clothing. A mobile gaming device or other portable device might signal to an overhead camera that a person wants a photo taken. In various embodiments, a gaming device may include a camera. The camera may photograph a person when his player tracking card is in the gaming device, or when the gaming device senses the presence of a mobile gaming device. If the player is to get his photo taken, the player may have some indication on record associated with his account that he wants photos to be taken.","In various embodiments, a camera may be placed so as to photograph a particular area. A person may be directed to stand or sit in that area so as to be photographed. For example, a person may wish to be photographed while rolling dice. The person may be directed to stand in a particular area while rolling the dice. An area may be designated through markings on the floor. For example, a circle may be marked on the floor. A person may stand in the circle in order to have his photo taken.","In various embodiments, a person may control a camera with a mobile gaming device or with motion control device. For example, a person may stand near a ceiling-mounted camera. The person may signal the camera by clicking three times on a button on the motion control device. Then, the person might move the device left or right in order to direct the camera to turn left or right. When the camera is pointing at the person, the person may move the motion control device up and down in order to direct the camera to take a picture.","In various embodiments, a camera may include an antenna array or other detector which can detect the direction from which a signal is coming. A person at a casino may carry a mobile gaming device. The mobile gaming device may emit a signal which can be detected by a ceiling mounted camera, or by another camera, for example. The camera may lock onto the signal and then point towards the source of the signal. The mobile gaming device may then direct the camera to take a picture. The camera may wirelessly transmit the picture to the mobile gaming device.","Reconstructing an Event with Graphics","In various embodiments, an event may occur out of sight of an interested party. The event may have occurred in a different location from where the interested party is located. The event may have occurred at a time before the interested party arrived at the location of the event. The event may have been missed by the interested party because the interested party was looking away or not paying attention. According to various embodiments, one or more details of an event are recorded. Details may be recorded using a recording device, such as a camera, microphone, scanner, or any other device. In a game, for example, a card shuffler may incorporate scanners to scan in card images of cards that are dealt. The details may then be stored in a server or in some other computer or computing device. The details may be stored in a networked environment and made available to one or more other computing devices connected to the network. The details may later be accessed by one or more other computing devices.","In various embodiments, recorded details of an event may be used to reconstruct the event. Recorded details may first be interpreted. For example, image processing algorithms may determine the rank and suit of a card that has been dealt based upon a captured image of the card. Details of an event may be interpreted by the server storing such details, or by any other computing device.","After details of an event have been interpreted, representations of the event may be constructed. For example, a cartoon representation of an event may be generated based on recorded details of the event. For example, a representation of a card may be generated by a computer.","Representations of events may then be presented to people. Representations may be presented in the form of video, audio, tactile sensations, or in any other form. In various embodiments, representations of games which have been played may be presented to people who were remote from such games or who did not see the games when they happened. People may include secondary players, or players who bet on the outcomes of games without directly participating in the games themselves.","In various embodiments, details of an event are not interpreted. Rather, details of events are presented just as they were recorded. For example, a video of an event may be presented.","Showing Information to a Player at a Table","In various embodiments, players at a gaming table may be sitting shoulder to shoulder with other players and may generally have little space to put cash, gaming chips, food, drinks, or other items. Further, players may have limited space to view desired information, such as information about other players, information about game statistics, or information unrelated to a game. According to various embodiments, a terminal with a plurality of screens allows a player to view a number of information feeds and many different types of information. A desk area at the terminal allows the player space to put personal items or gaming items. Various buttons allow the player to call up information on demand. A player may also, in various embodiments, participate in games at the terminal. Thus, the terminal may serve to alleviate space constraints present with traditional gaming tables.","Using a terminal, a first player may call up information about a second player. The first player may call up information indicating how many times the second player has won or lost in a given period of time. The first player may call up information indicating what strategies the second player has used. The first player may call up information indicating an amount that has been won or lost by the second player. The first player may call up any other information about the second player. The first player may view multiple different items of information, such as different statistics about a second player, or such as a given statistic about many different other players (e.g., amounts won by each of 10 other players).","The terminal may also include various input devices, such as keyboards, computer mice, telephone pads, cameras, microphones, and other input devices. The player may use the input devices to indicate his desire to see information about other players, information about any games that he is currently playing, or any other information.","Playing People at Different Places in Casino, being Able to See them All, Server Based Gaming","In various embodiments, people participating in a mutual event may be unable to congregate in the same physical location. For example, people may have physical frailties that inhibit easy movement from one place to another. In a casino, for example, players may wish to play in the same poker game, but may be unable or unwilling to all move to the same area of a casino. Thus, in various embodiments, each of a plurality of players may go to his or her own terminal. The terminal may include a number of display screens. Each display screen may display an image of another player participating in the same poker game. Each terminal may include a camera. The camera may capture an image of the player at the terminal. Images captured by the camera may be transmitted to a central server. The server may, in turn, transmit the images from the camera to the terminals of other players. The terminals of other players may receive the images and such images may be posted on one of the display screens at a terminal. Accordingly, a player may sit at a terminal and play games against other players at other terminals. The player may see each of the other players on one of the display screens his own terminal. In various embodiments, players may also have audio links to one another. Each player terminal may include a microphone. Words spoken into the microphone may be captured, sent to the central server, and forwarded to the other terminals. The other terminals may broadcast the spoken words to the players at those terminals. Accordingly, a first player may say something like \u201cbet\u201d or \u201craise\u201d after which other players may hear the spoken word at another terminal. Thus, in various embodiments, players may engage in a game traditionally played in person, but remotely from other players. The terminal may still allow a player to clearly see and hear all the other players.","Playing Multiple Games at Once","In various embodiments, a terminal with multiples screens (e.g., with 6 screens) may allow a player to engage in the play of multiple games at once. Traditionally, a player at a gaming device, such as a slot machine, may have limited space on a display screen with which to view the action in a game. A terminal according to various embodiments provides numerous display screens. The display screens may be spread out in semi-circular fashion in front of the player. Thus, the player may have plenty of viewing space on which to view the action in multiple games at once.","You Don't Play from Same Deck as Other Players at Live Games. But You Play Against Dealer's Cards","In various embodiments, an apparatus combines information from a live game played at a table with additional information to allow for game play by another player who is not at the table. An information capturing device sits in proximity to a table. For example, a camera films the play at a table. Details of game play are captured by the information capturing device. The details are transmitted to a central server. The details may then be interpreted to determine salient game information, such as what cards have been dealt or what a dealer's hand is. Additional information may then be generated. This additional information may include new cards, dice rolls, indicia, or other game outcomes or results. The additional information may be used in conjunction with information from the live game in order to create a new game or game experience for the player at the terminal. A computer processor of the terminal generates cards for a player. The processor uses random number generators, for example, to select cards to deal to the player. Whether the player has won or lost is then determined based on the additional information generated and based on the salient game information from the live game. For example, the player may receive a blackjack hand that is generated by the processor of his terminal. The player's hand may then be compared to the dealer's hand from the live blackjack game. The comparison may be performed by the processor of the terminal using standard rules of blackjack.","Guide to Interpreting the Present Application","The following sections I-X provide a guide to interpreting the present application.","The term \u201cdetermining\u201d and grammatical variants thereof (e.g., to determine a price, determining a value, determine an object which meets a certain criterion) is used in an extremely broad sense. The term \u201cdetermining\u201d encompasses a wide variety of actions and therefore \u201cdetermining\u201d can include calculating, computing, processing, deriving, investigating, looking up (e.g., looking up in a table, a database or another data structure), ascertaining and the like. Also, \u201cdetermining\u201d can include receiving (e.g., receiving information), accessing (e.g., accessing data in a memory) and the like. Also, \u201cdetermining\u201d can include resolving, selecting, choosing, establishing, and the like.","The term \u201cdetermining\u201d does not imply certainty or absolute precision, and therefore \u201cdetermining\u201d can include estimating, extrapolating, predicting, guessing and the like.","The term \u201cdetermining\u201d does not imply that mathematical processing must be performed, and does not imply that numerical methods must be used, and does not imply that an algorithm or process is used.","The term \u201cdetermining\u201d does not imply that any particular device must be used. For example, a computer need not necessarily perform the determining.","Where a limitation of a first claim would cover one of a feature as well as more than one of a feature (e.g., a limitation such as \u201cat least one widget\u201d covers one widget as well as more than one widget), and where in a second claim that depends on the first claim, the second claim uses a definite article \u201cthe\u201d to refer to the limitation (e.g., \u201cthe widget\u201d), this does not imply that the first claim covers only one of the feature, and this does not imply that the second claim covers only one of the feature (e.g., \u201cthe widget\u201d can cover both one widget and more than one widget).","When an ordinal number (such as \u201cfirst\u201d, \u201csecond\u201d, \u201cthird\u201d and so on) is used as an adjective before a term, that ordinal number is used (unless expressly specified otherwise) merely to indicate a particular feature, such as to distinguish that particular feature from another feature that is described by the same term or by a similar term. For example, a \u201cfirst widget\u201d may be so named merely to distinguish it from, e.g., a \u201csecond widget\u201d. Thus, the mere usage of the ordinal numbers \u201cfirst\u201d and \u201csecond\u201d before the term \u201cwidget\u201d does not indicate any other relationship between the two widgets, and likewise does not indicate any other characteristics of either or both widgets. For example, the mere usage of the ordinal numbers \u201cfirst\u201d and \u201csecond\u201d before the term \u201cwidget\u201d (1) does not indicate that either widget comes before or after any other in order or location; (2) does not indicate that either widget occurs or acts before or after any other in time; and (3) does not indicate that either widget ranks above or below any other, as in importance or quality. In addition, the mere usage of ordinal numbers does not define a numerical limit to the features identified with the ordinal numbers. For example, the mere usage of the ordinal numbers \u201cfirst\u201d and \u201csecond\u201d before the term \u201cwidget\u201d does not indicate that there must be no more than two widgets.","When a single device, article or other product is described herein, more than one device\/article (whether or not they cooperate) may alternatively be used in place of the single device\/article that is described. Accordingly, the functionality that is described as being possessed by a device may alternatively be possessed by more than one device\/article (whether or not they cooperate).","Similarly, where more than one device, article or other product is described herein (whether or not they cooperate), a single device\/article may alternatively be used in place of the more than one device or article that is described. For example, a plurality of computer-based devices may be substituted with a single computer-based device. Accordingly, the various functionality that is described as being possessed by more than one device or article may alternatively be possessed by a single device\/article.","The functionality and\/or the features of a single device that is described may be alternatively embodied by one or more other devices which are described but are not explicitly described as having such functionality\/features. Thus, other embodiments need not include the described device itself, but rather can include the one or more other devices which would, in those other embodiments, have such functionality\/features.","The term \u201cproduct\u201d means any machine, manufacture and\/or composition of matter, unless expressly specified otherwise.","The term \u201cprocess\u201d means any process, algorithm, method or the like, unless expressly specified otherwise.","Each process (whether called a method, algorithm or otherwise) inherently includes one or more steps, and therefore all references to a \u201cstep\u201d or \u201csteps\u201d of a process have an inherent antecedent basis in the mere recitation of the term \u2018process\u2019 or a like term. Accordingly, any reference in a claim to a \u2018step\u2019 or \u2018steps\u2019 of a process has sufficient antecedent basis.","The term \u201cinvention\u201d and the like mean \u201cthe one or more inventions disclosed in this application\u201d, unless expressly specified otherwise.","The terms \u201can embodiment\u201d, \u201cembodiment\u201d, \u201cembodiments\u201d, \u201cthe embodiment\u201d, \u201cthe embodiments\u201d, \u201cone or more embodiments\u201d, \u201csome embodiments\u201d, \u201ccertain embodiments\u201d, \u201cone embodiment\u201d, \u201canother embodiment\u201d and the like mean \u201cone or more (but not all) embodiments of the disclosed invention(s)\u201d, unless expressly specified otherwise.","The term \u201cvariation\u201d of an invention means an embodiment of the invention, unless expressly specified otherwise.","A reference to \u201canother embodiment\u201d in describing an embodiment does not imply that the referenced embodiment is mutually exclusive with another embodiment (e.g., an embodiment described before the referenced embodiment), unless expressly specified otherwise.","The terms \u201cincluding\u201d, \u201ccomprising\u201d and variations thereof mean \u201cincluding but not limited to\u201d, unless expressly specified otherwise.","The terms \u201ca\u201d, \u201can\u201d and \u201cthe\u201d mean \u201cone or more\u201d, unless expressly specified otherwise.","The term \u201cplurality\u201d means \u201ctwo or more\u201d, unless expressly specified otherwise.","The term \u201cherein\u201d means \u201cin the present application, including anything which may be incorporated by reference\u201d, unless expressly specified otherwise.","The phrase \u201cat least one of\u201d, when such phrase modifies a plurality of things (such as an enumerated list of things) means any combination of one or more of those things, unless expressly specified otherwise. For example, the phrase \u201cat least one of a widget, a car and a wheel\u201d means either (i) a widget, (ii) a car, (iii) a wheel, (iv) a widget and a car, (v) a widget and a wheel, (vi) a car and a wheel, or (vii) a widget, a car and a wheel. The phrase \u201cat least one of\u201d, when such phrase modifies a plurality of things does not mean \u201cone of each of\u201d the plurality of things.","Numerical terms such as \u201cone\u201d, \u201ctwo\u201d, etc. when used as cardinal numbers to indicate quantity of something (e.g., one widget, two widgets), mean the quantity indicated by that numerical term, but do not mean at least the quantity indicated by that numerical term. For example, the phrase \u201cone widget\u201d does not mean \u201cat least one widget\u201d, and therefore the phrase \u201cone widget\u201d does not cover, e.g., two widgets.","The phrase \u201cbased on\u201d does not mean \u201cbased only on\u201d, unless expressly specified otherwise. In other words, the phrase \u201cbased on\u201d describes both \u201cbased only on\u201d and \u201cbased at least on\u201d. The phrase \u201cbased at least on\u201d is equivalent to the phrase \u201cbased at least in part on\u201d.","The term \u201crepresent\u201d and like terms are not exclusive, unless expressly specified otherwise. For example, the term \u201crepresents\u201d do not mean \u201crepresents only\u201d, unless expressly specified otherwise. In other words, the phrase \u201cthe data represents a credit card number\u201d describes both \u201cthe data represents only a credit card number\u201d and \u201cthe data represents a credit card number and the data also represents something else\u201d.","The term \u201cwhereby\u201d is used herein only to precede a clause or other set of words that express only the intended result, objective or consequence of something that is previously and explicitly recited. Thus, when the term \u201cwhereby\u201d is used in a claim, the clause or other words that the term \u201cwhereby\u201d modifies do not establish specific further limitations of the claim or otherwise restricts the meaning or scope of the claim.","The term \u201ce.g.\u201d and like terms mean \u201cfor example\u201d, and thus does not limit the term or phrase it explains. For example, in the sentence \u201cthe computer sends data (e.g., instructions, a data structure) over the Internet\u201d, the term \u201ce.g.\u201d explains that \u201cinstructions\u201d are an example of \u201cdata\u201d that the computer may send over the Internet, and also explains that \u201ca data structure\u201d is an example of \u201cdata\u201d that the computer may send over the Internet. However, both \u201cinstructions\u201d and \u201ca data structure\u201d are merely examples of \u201cdata\u201d, and other things besides \u201cinstructions\u201d and \u201ca data structure\u201d can be \u201cdata\u201d.","The term \u201crespective\u201d and like terms mean \u201ctaken individually\u201d. Thus if two or more things have \u201crespective\u201d characteristics, then each such thing has its own characteristic, and these characteristics can be different from each other but need not be. For example, the phrase \u201ceach of two machines has a respective function\u201d means that the first such machine has a function and the second such machine has a function as well. The function of the first machine may or may not be the same as the function of the second machine.","The term \u201ci.e.\u201d and like terms mean \u201cthat is\u201d, and thus limits the term or phrase it explains. For example, in the sentence \u201cthe computer sends data (i.e., instructions) over the Internet\u201d, the term \u201ci.e.\u201d explains that \u201cinstructions\u201d are the \u201cdata\u201d that the computer sends over the Internet.","Any given numerical range shall include whole and fractions of numbers within the range. For example, the range \u201c1 to 10\u201d shall be interpreted to specifically include whole numbers between 1 and 10 (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, . . . 9) and non-whole numbers (e.g., 1.1, 1.2, . . . 1.9).","Where two or more terms or phrases are synonymous (e.g., because of an explicit statement that the terms or phrases are synonymous), instances of one such term\/phrase does not mean instances of another such term\/phrase must have a different meaning. For example, where a statement renders the meaning of \u201cincluding\u201d to be synonymous with \u201cincluding but not limited to\u201d, the mere usage of the phrase \u201cincluding but not limited to\u201d does not mean that the term \u201cincluding\u201d means something other than \u201cincluding but not limited to\u201d.","Neither the Title (set forth at the beginning of the first page of the present application) nor the Abstract (set forth at the end of the present application) is to be taken as limiting in any way as the scope of the disclosed invention(s). An Abstract has been included in this application merely because an Abstract of not more than 150 words is required under 37 C.F.R. \u00a71.72(b).","The title of the present application and headings of sections provided in the present application are for convenience only, and are not to be taken as limiting the disclosure in any way.","Numerous embodiments are described in the present application, and are presented for illustrative purposes only. The described embodiments are not, and are not intended to be, limiting in any sense. The presently disclosed invention(s) are widely applicable to numerous embodiments, as is readily apparent from the disclosure. One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the disclosed invention(s) may be practiced with various modifications and alterations, such as structural, logical, software, and electrical modifications. Although particular features of the disclosed invention(s) may be described with reference to one or more particular embodiments and\/or drawings, it should be understood that such features are not limited to usage in the one or more particular embodiments or drawings with reference to which they are described, unless expressly specified otherwise.","No embodiment of method steps or product elements described in the present application constitutes the invention claimed herein, or is essential to the invention claimed herein, or is coextensive with the invention claimed herein, except where it is either expressly stated to be so in this specification or expressly recited in a claim.","The preambles of the claims that follow recite purposes, benefits and possible uses of the claimed invention only and do not limit the claimed invention.","The present disclosure is not a literal description of all embodiments of the invention(s). Also, the present disclosure is not a listing of features of the invention(s) which must be present in all embodiments.","Devices that are described as in communication with each other need not be in continuous communication with each other, unless expressly specified otherwise. On the contrary, such devices need only transmit to each other as necessary or desirable, and may actually refrain from exchanging data most of the time. For example, a machine in communication with another machine via the Internet may not transmit data to the other machine for long period of time (e.g. weeks at a time). In addition, devices that are in communication with each other may communicate directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries.","A description of an embodiment with several components or features does not imply that all or even any of such components\/features are required. On the contrary, a variety of optional components are described to illustrate the wide variety of possible embodiments of the present invention(s). Unless otherwise specified explicitly, no component\/feature is essential or required.","Although process steps, algorithms or the like may be described or claimed in a particular sequential order, such processes may be configured to work in different orders. In other words, any sequence or order of steps that may be explicitly described or claimed does not necessarily indicate a requirement that the steps be performed in that order. The steps of processes described herein may be performed in any order possible. Further, some steps may be performed simultaneously despite being described or implied as occurring non-simultaneously (e.g., because one step is described after the other step). Moreover, the illustration of a process by its depiction in a drawing does not imply that the illustrated process is exclusive of other variations and modifications thereto, does not imply that the illustrated process or any of its steps are necessary to the invention(s), and does not imply that the illustrated process is preferred.","Although a process may be described as including a plurality of steps, that does not imply that all or any of the steps are preferred, essential or required. Various other embodiments within the scope of the described invention(s) include other processes that omit some or all of the described steps. Unless otherwise specified explicitly, no step is essential or required.","Although a process may be described singly or without reference to other products or methods, in an embodiment the process may interact with other products or methods. For example, such interaction may include linking one business model to another business model. Such interaction may be provided to enhance the flexibility or desirability of the process.","Although a product may be described as including a plurality of components, aspects, qualities, characteristics and\/or features, that does not indicate that any or all of the plurality are preferred, essential or required. Various other embodiments within the scope of the described invention(s) include other products that omit some or all of the described plurality.","An enumerated list of items (which may or may not be numbered) does not imply that any or all of the items are mutually exclusive, unless expressly specified otherwise. Likewise, an enumerated list of items (which may or may not be numbered) does not imply that any or all of the items are comprehensive of any category, unless expressly specified otherwise. For example, the enumerated list \u201ca computer, a laptop, a PDA\u201d does not imply that any or all of the three items of that list are mutually exclusive and does not imply that any or all of the three items of that list are comprehensive of any category.","An enumerated list of items (which may or may not be numbered) does not imply that any or all of the items are equivalent to each other or readily substituted for each other.","All embodiments are illustrative, and do not imply that the invention or any embodiments were made or performed, as the case may be.","It will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that the various processes described herein may be implemented by, e.g., appropriately programmed general purpose computers, special purpose computers and computing devices. Typically a processor (e.g., one or more microprocessors, one or more microcontrollers, one or more digital signal processors) will receive instructions (e.g., from a memory or like device), and execute those instructions, thereby performing one or more processes defined by those instructions. Instructions may be embodied in, e.g., one or more computer programs, one or more scripts.","A \u201cprocessor\u201d means one or more microprocessors, central processing units (CPUs), computing devices, microcontrollers, digital signal processors, or like devices or any combination thereof, regardless of the architecture (e.g., chip-level multiprocessing\/multi-core, RISC, CISC, Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipeline Stages, pipelining configuration, simultaneous multithreading).","Thus a description of a process is likewise a description of an apparatus for performing the process. The apparatus that performs the process can include, e.g., a processor and those input devices and output devices that are appropriate to perform the process.","Further, programs that implement such methods (as well as other types of data) may be stored and transmitted using a variety of media (e.g., computer readable media) in a number of manners. In some embodiments, hard-wired circuitry or custom hardware may be used in place of, or in combination with, some or all of the software instructions that can implement the processes of various embodiments. Thus, various combinations of hardware and software may be used instead of software only.","The term \u201ccomputer-readable medium\u201d refers to any medium, a plurality of the same, or a combination of different media, that participate in providing data (e.g., instructions, data structures) which may be read by a computer, a processor or a like device. Such a medium may take many forms, including but not limited to, non-volatile media, volatile media, and transmission media. Non-volatile media include, for example, optical or magnetic disks and other persistent memory. Volatile media include dynamic random access memory (DRAM), which typically constitutes the main memory. Transmission media include coaxial cables, copper wire and fiber optics, including the wires that comprise a system bus coupled to the processor. Transmission media may include or convey acoustic waves, light waves and electromagnetic emissions, such as those generated during radio frequency (RF) and infrared (IR) data communications. Common forms of computer-readable media include, for example, a floppy disk, a flexible disk, hard disk, magnetic tape, any other magnetic medium, a CD-ROM, DVD, any other optical medium, punch cards, paper tape, any other physical medium with patterns of holes, a RAM, a PROM, an EPROM, a FLASH-EEPROM, any other memory chip or cartridge, a carrier wave as described hereinafter, or any other medium from which a computer can read.","Various forms of computer readable media may be involved in carrying data (e.g. sequences of instructions) to a processor. For example, data may be (i) delivered from RAM to a processor; (ii) carried over a wireless transmission medium; (iii) formatted and\/or transmitted according to numerous formats, standards or protocols, such as Ethernet (or IEEE 802.3), SAP, ATP, Bluetooth\u25a1, and TCP\/IP, TDMA, CDMA, and 3G; and\/or (iv) encrypted to ensure privacy or prevent fraud in any of a variety of ways well known in the art.","Thus a description of a process is likewise a description of a computer-readable medium storing a program for performing the process. The computer-readable medium can store (in any appropriate format) those program elements which are appropriate to perform the method.","Just as the description of various steps in a process does not indicate that all the described steps are required, embodiments of an apparatus include a computer\/computing device operable to perform some (but not necessarily all) of the described process.","Likewise, just as the description of various steps in a process does not indicate that all the described steps are required, embodiments of a computer-readable medium storing a program or data structure include a computer-readable medium storing a program that, when executed, can cause a processor to perform some (but not necessarily all) of the described process.","Where databases are described, it will be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that (i) alternative database structures to those described may be readily employed, and (ii) other memory structures besides databases may be readily employed. Any illustrations or descriptions of any sample databases presented herein are illustrative arrangements for stored representations of information. Any number of other arrangements may be employed besides those suggested by, e.g., tables illustrated in drawings or elsewhere. Similarly, any illustrated entries of the databases represent exemplary information only; one of ordinary skill in the art will understand that the number and content of the entries can be different from those described herein. Further, despite any depiction of the databases as tables, other formats (including relational databases, object-based models and\/or distributed databases) could be used to store and manipulate the data types described herein. Likewise, object methods or behaviors of a database can be used to implement various processes, such as the described herein. In addition, the databases may, in a known manner, be stored locally or remotely from a device which accesses data in such a database.","Various embodiments can be configured to work in a network environment including a computer that is in communication (e.g., via a communications network) with one or more devices. The computer may communicate with the devices directly or indirectly, via any wired or wireless medium (e.g. the Internet, LAN, WAN or Ethernet, Token Ring, a telephone line, a cable line, a radio channel, an optical communications line, commercial on-line service providers, bulletin board systems, a satellite communications link, a combination of any of the above). Each of the devices may themselves comprise computers or other computing devices, such as those based on the Intel\u00ae Pentium\u00ae or Centrino\u2122 processor, that are adapted to communicate with the computer. Any number and type of devices may be in communication with the computer.","In an embodiment, a server computer or centralized authority may not be necessary or desirable. For example, the present invention may, in an embodiment, be practiced on one or more devices without a central authority. In such an embodiment, any functions described herein as performed by the server computer or data described as stored on the server computer may instead be performed by or stored on one or more such devices.","Where a process is described, in an embodiment the process may operate without any user intervention. In another embodiment, the process includes some human intervention (e.g., a step is performed by or with the assistance of a human).","The present disclosure provides, to one of ordinary skill in the art, an enabling description of several embodiments and\/or inventions. Some of these embodiments and\/or inventions may not be claimed in the present application, but may nevertheless be claimed in one or more continuing applications that claim the benefit of priority of the present application.","Applicants intend to file additional applications to pursue patents for subject matter that has been disclosed and enabled but not claimed in the present application.","In a claim, a limitation of the claim which includes the phrase \u201cmeans for\u201d or the phrase \u201cstep for\u201d means that 35 U.S.C. \u00a7112, paragraph 6, applies to that limitation.","In a claim, a limitation of the claim which does not include the phrase \u201cmeans for\u201d or the phrase \u201cstep for\u201d means that 35 U.S.C. \u00a7112, paragraph 6 does not apply to that limitation, regardless of whether that limitation recites a function without recitation of structure, material or acts for performing that function. For example, in a claim, the mere use of the phrase \u201cstep of\u201d or the phrase \u201csteps of\u201d in referring to one or more steps of the claim or of another claim does not mean that 35 U.S.C. \u00a7112, paragraph 6, applies to that step(s).","With respect to a means or a step for performing a specified function in accordance with 35 U.S.C. \u00a7112, paragraph 6, the corresponding structure, material or acts described in the specification, and equivalents thereof, may perform additional functions as well as the specified function.","Computers, processors, computing devices and like products are structures that can perform a wide variety of functions. Such products can be operable to perform a specified function by executing one or more programs, such as a program stored in a memory device of that product or in a memory device which that product accesses. Unless expressly specified otherwise, such a program need not be based on any particular algorithm, such as any particular algorithm that might be disclosed in the present application.

The gaming system may randomly determine an order of cards, using e.g., pseudo random algorithms. The gaming system may then deal cards to one or more players by sequentially dealing the cards to one or more players and\/or to a house or dealer. Depending on the game, players may make one or more bets. Bets may be keyed in using any of a number of possible interfaces, such as buttons, touch screens, computer mice, trackballs, and so on. Depending on the game, players may make one or more decisions in a game, including decisions concerning whether to be dealt another card, whether to fold, whether to split their hands, or whether to make any other appropriate decision. Players may make decisions using any number of interfaces, such as using computer mice, buttons, touch screens, trackballs, or any other interfaces.","In various embodiments, a computer system reshuffles cards after each game, or after a small number of games. The reshuffling may be performed electronically, and so may occur near instantaneously. This may save time over a shuffling process that would be performed with a physical deck of cards.","Reshuffling a deck of cards after each game may ensure that odds in each game remain constant or relatively constant. For example, if cards are reshuffled after every game, then counting strategies used in blackjack or other card games may be rendered less effective or completely ineffective.","In various embodiments, cards numbered 1 through 6, or equivalently labeled, for example are used to play a game of craps or to play another dice game. For example, in a game of craps, a \u201croll\u201d is simulated with the deal of two cards. As will be appreciated, each roll of the dice is considered to be an independent, random event. However, with a deck of cards used to conduct a game of dice, one could in principle make a prediction as to the next deal based on previous cards dealt. This is because each card dealt alters the composition of the remaining deck by depleting the deck of one card, now known.","A computerized system according to various embodiments may allow games using cards to more closely simulate games using dice. The computerized system may do this, in some embodiments, by frequently reshuffling electronic decks, so that new cards dealt are independent of prior cards dealt, just as new rolls of dice would be independent of prior rolls of dice.","Infinite Deck of Cards","A computerized system may also simulate an infinite deck or a very large deck of cards. An infinite deck or very large deck may be impractical with respect to a physical deck of cards. To simulate an infinite deck of cards, a computer system may deal a randomly chosen card when required. However, after each card is dealt, the computer may make no change to its selection process, e.g., the computer may make no assumptions that a deck of remaining cards has been depleted. Thus, the computer may, on the next card, deal the exact same card that it had previously dealt. As will be appreciated, there may be other ways of simulating an infinite deck. When an infinite deck is used, the odds of certain cards being dealt do not depend on what cards have previously been dealt. Thus, an infinite deck may be used to closely simulate a game of dice.","Magnification","A computer system for playing card games according to various embodiments, features a zoom or magnification option. A player can press a button to increase the size of cards displayed on his screen. The player may further touch particular cards on a touch screen, or otherwise indicate such cards. The cards that a player has indicated may expand in terms of their display size on a display screen, so that they are more easily visible to a player. The player may also reduce the size of cards or other items displayed, e.g., so as to increase his field of the game. For example, where a player is playing against multiple opponents, the player may shrink the view of an individual opponent's cards so as to be able to see all opponents' cards at once on the same display screen.","In various embodiments, a game may be played at a physical gaming table. The table may include a felt tabletop with markings, chip racks, seats, positions for players and positions for dealers. However, some players at the table may be visually challenged and unable to see cards, bets, or other items at the table. According to some embodiments, a camera or other imaging device may capture an image of the table. The image may be displayed on a monitor or other display screen proximate to the player. The player may be able to change the magnification of the image by zooming in or zooming out. Thus, a visually impaired player may still be able to follow the action at a table my referring to a display screen where he can magnify an image of the display screen.","Simultaneity","In various embodiments, a computer system is designed to allow simultaneous actions or decisions by players in a game. In some embodiments, players compete against one another in a card game using the rules of blackjack, for example. Players bet and raise each other by putting money into a pot. The winning player is the player who has a hand with the point total closest to 21 without exceeding 21. In some embodiments, games can be played with different maximum point totals, e.g., with 22 as a maximum point total. In some embodiments, in such a game, a first player may derive an advantage by delaying a decision to hit or stand until he has seen whether or not another player has chosen to hit or stand. Thus, to prevent any one player from deriving an advantage, game rules may dictate that all players in game should make a particular decision (e.g., a hit\/stand decision) simultaneously, or at least without knowledge of other players' hit stand decisions.","In various embodiments, a computer system may receive decisions from multiple players in a game. As the computer system receives each decision, the computer system may store the decision in a computer memory. The computer may track how many player decisions have been received. When all player decisions have been received, the computer system may reveal all decisions to all players, such as by showing the words \u201chit\u201d or \u201cstand\u201d on a diagram representing player positions at a virtual table and\/or by showing the actual cards.","In various embodiments, each player in a game may be prompted to make a decision in turn with the decision not being made known or only partially known to other players. For example, a player may make a hit decision, with the resulting card being shown only to that player. Alternatively, the player may make the hit decision, with the resulting card being shown only to that player but with other players receiving an indication of the decision. In either case, another player may then be prompted to make a hit decision, either having no or only limited knowledge of the pervious hit decision (i.e., when an indication of the decision was at least provided). At some later time, such as at the end of the game, for example, all cards may then be made visible to all players.","In a similar fashion, in various embodiments a computer system may allow simultaneous bets to be placed. For example, all players in a game may simultaneously make the decision to bet or not and when all player decisions have been received, reveal all decisions\/bet amounts to all players. Thereafter, a player(s) that entered a lesser amount than another may be prompted to fold or enter an additional bet such that all players have entered an equal amount, for example. In this way, no one player can gain an advantage by watching others bet before making his decision to bet.","People Don't Touch Cards","In traditional games of blackjack, it may not be desirable to allow players to touch cards. When players touch cards, there is a risk that the players will mark the cards or even replace the cards with card that are more to their benefit. In traditional games of blackjack, cards are dealt face up, so there is no particular need for a player to touch a card, because the player can see everything he needs to know about the card without touching it. However, if cards were dealt face down, a player may be unable to see the card without touching it.","Computer systems according to various embodiments allow certain cards to be visible only to an individual player, and not his opponents, while still making it unnecessary for a player to touch his cards. A computer system according to various embodiments allows players to play blackjack against one another, for example. Each player is dealt at least one card which he is privileged to know, but which no other player knows. The system allows players to play at remote devices, terminals, computers, mobile gaming devices, or other interfaces. Since the players are separate from one another, cards can be displayed on a first player's terminal without risk that the cards would be visible to other players. A given player's terminal may display some of the cards belonging to other players, but not all cards belonging to other players. For example, in a game of blackjack, each player may begin with a hand in which one card is private (visible only to that player) and in which one card is public (visible to all players) and\/or may receive a hit that is kept private (visible only to that player) or public (visible to all players). At some later time, such as at the end of the game, for example, all cards may then be made visible to all players.","Interface screens used with the computer system may thus display cards for players to see privately, without the necessity of players touching cards.","In some embodiments, a physical table, such as a blackjack table, may include display screens. However, the screens may be viewable from only a very narrow viewing range, e.g., due to barriers placed along the sides of the display screen.","Such screens may also allow players to privately view cards without the necessity of having them touch cards.","In various embodiments, any device that includes a display (e.g., a mobile gaming device; e.g., a slot machine; e.g., a personal computer) may display some or all cards dealt in a game. For example, a mobile gaming device may display not only the cards dealt to a particular player, but may also display cards dealt to all other players. For instance, in the early phases of a game, a player may be able to see only the cards in his own hand. However, at the end of a game, a central server may transmit to all player devices an indication of all cards that had been dealt to all players in the game. Each player device may then display the cards of every player in the game. In this way, a player may be able to verify for himself why he won or why he lost, since he may be able to compare the value of his hand with the value of the other players' hands.","Table without Walls","A traditional craps table has one or more walls or barriers. The dice can be thrown against the wall to ensure the randomness of the throw. The wall further prevents the dice from escaping the confines of the table surface. In various embodiments, a game of craps, or another dice game is played at a table without walls and\/or without confinement of any kind. Cards are used at the table in place of dice. Cards are dealt from a deck consisting of only cards numbered 1 through 6. Since the cards are not thrown like dice, confinement for cards may be unnecessary. Therefore, various embodiments may include a table for craps without walls. The table may include standard felt markings, such as areas for a pass line bet, a come bet, a don't pass bet, odds bets, and other standard areas. However, the table may lack walls.","Mobile Gaming","In various embodiments, players may play blackjack versus one another using a mobile gaming devices. Players may each carry a handheld gaming device (i.e., mobile gaming device). Each mobile gaming device may be in communication with a central server. A player may use his mobile gaming device to enter decisions in a game. Decisions may include indications of amounts to bet, indications of whether to hit or stand, etc. A mobile gaming device may have buttons corresponding to one or more possible decisions. For example, there may be a \u201chit\u201d button, \u201cstand\u201d button, a \u201cdouble down\u201d button, and other buttons appropriate to blackjack. The mobile gaming device may transmit the decisions made by players to the central server. The central server may shuffle cards using an electronic shuffling algorithm. The central server may use other algorithms for determining what cards should be dealt to what players. The central server may then transmit to each mobile gaming device an indication of cards that have been dealt. At the end of the game, the central server may reference a set of game rules (e.g., game rules that are stored in computer memory), in order to determine a game winner. The central server may then provide an indication to each participating player of the game winner. The central server may also reveal hidden cards for one or more players, and transmit an indication of such cards to other players.","The central server may maintain an account associated with a player. The account may comprise one or more records stored in a database. The records may be stored in computer memory. A player account may include information, such as a name of a player, an address of a player, any other identifying information about a player, and\/or any other information about a player. The account may further include information about a monetary balance, a balance of casino credits, or any other balance of value. Thus, the account may store a record of how much money belongs to a player. In various embodiments, when a player indicates a bet or wager, such as at a mobile gaming device, the server may deduct the amount of the bet or wager from the player's account. In various embodiments, when the player wins money, the money won may be added back to the player's account.","In various embodiments, a player device, such as a mobile gaming device, personal computer, standalone slot machine, or other device, may prompt a player to take an action in a game. For example, a mobile gaming device may display text prompting the player to either hit or stand in a game of blackjack. A player device may prompt a player to make a bet. For example, a player device may prompt a player to decide whether to bet the pass-line or the don't-pass-line in a game of craps. As another example, a player device may prompt a player to decide how much to bet in a game. A central server may initiate prompt messages, and transmit such messages to a player device, at which time the player devices may display the prompts. In some embodiments, a player device may initiate prompts, e.g., when logic stored within the device determines that a prompt must be shown to encourage a player to take action and move a game along.","In various embodiments, a player may play craps or another dice game using a mobile gaming device. The mobile gaming device may present cards to a player in place of dice. The cards may be numbered 1-6. On a given roll, the central server may determine two cards from a randomly shuffled deck of cards. The central server may then transmit an indication of such cards to the mobile gaming device of the player. The player may indicate bets through the mobile gaming device. The player may press a button on the mobile gaming device indicating a desire to make a new roll (e.g., in the event that a game has not ended).","Motion Control","In various embodiments, a mobile gaming device may include one or more motion sensors. For example, the mobile gaming device may include an accelerometer or gyroscope. The mobile gaming device may include one or more location or positioning devices, such as a Global Positioning System sensor. Logic contained within the mobile gaming device or within the server may differentiate position sensor readings in order to detect motion.","A player may move the mobile gaming device in order to indicate decision in a game. Sensors within the mobile gaming device may pick up the motion of the mobile gaming device. Logic within the mobile gaming device or within the central server may interpret the motions as commands to be used in a game. The motions may be interpreted as commands to make a bet, to bet a certain amount, to raise, to fold, to call, to check, to hit, to stand, to double down, to bet the pass-line, to bet don't pass, or to make any other type of bet in any game, or to take any other action in any game.","Blackjack Motion Control","In various embodiments, a player may use a mobile gaming device to play in a game of blackjack. In various embodiments, the player may compete against other players. In traditional games of blackjack, a player might indicate a decision with a tapping motion. For example, in traditional games of blackjack the player may tap the table twice in order to indicate a decision to hit. In various embodiments, a player using a mobile gaming device to play blackjack may shake the mobile gaming device twice in an up-and-down motion.","Card Dice Motion Control","In various embodiments, a player may make a motion with a mobile gaming device as if he is rolling the dice. For example, the player may shake the mobile gaming device from side to side as if he is cradling dice in his hands and rolling them around in his hands. Then, the player may make a large sweeping motion with the mobile gaming device as if actually rolling dice onto a table. The mobile gaming device may deal one or more cards (e.g., from a deck of cards numbered 1-6) upon detecting the player's sweeping motion.","Terminal Motion Control","In various embodiments, a wristband, bracelet, or other device may be used to interact with a betting terminal. The terminal may include a terminal with multiple displays (e.g., with six displays), with speed dial functions, with keyboards, or with any other devices. The wristband may include motion or position sensors, such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, tilt sensors, sensors for a positioning system (e.g., for GPS) or any other motion or position sensors. A player may thereby make wrist motions, or other bodily motions, which can be translated into commands. For example, the wristband may include a processor which interprets readings from the various sensors in the wristband. The processor may determine intended commands based on the motions of the wristband. The processor may then direct the commands be wirelessly transmitted to the terminal. Commands may include commands to bet a certain amount, to begin a new game, to select a particular pay line, to cash out, to hold a particular card, to hit in blackjack, to double down in blackjack, to look at a pay table, or to take any other action. In various embodiments, a wristband may be used to issue various other commands or to perform other functions. In various embodiments, any article worn or handled by the player may be used to sense motions. The article may convey information about motions detected to the terminal or to some intermediary device which relays information to the terminal. The article may also interpret motions that have been detected and determine an intended command. The article may then transmit information about the command to the terminal.","Internet","In various embodiments, players may participate in games over a network. Thus, in various embodiments, a computer system may include a central server in communication over a network with one or more player devices. Player devices may include mobile gaming device, personal computers, slot machines, or other devices. The network may be a wireless network or a wired network. The network may be the Internet. In various embodiments, players may participate in games via personal computers while communicating over the Internet with the central server. As with mobile gaming devices, the central server may receive commands and instructions from player devices, may determine cards dealt, may calculate winners and losers, and may credit and debit player accounts as appropriate.","Standalone Slot Machine.","In various embodiments, a player may participate in a game, such as a game of blackjack or a game of dice using cards in place of dice, at a standalone gaming device. A standalone gaming device may include a fixed device, such as a slot machine, video poker machine, video keno machine, bingo machine, or other device. The gaming device may be networked to other gaming devices. For example, a number of gaming devices may be linked to the same central server. Thus, as with mobile gaming device and personal computers, a central server may facilitate gaming competition among players at different standalone devices.","In some embodiments, a player may play a game of blackjack according to various embodiments by himself at a standalone gaming device. The gaming device may simulate \u201cvirtual players\u201d who are in competition with the player. Thus, the real, or human player may play against e.g., six virtual players in a game of blackjack. Each of the real and virtual players may make bets and make decisions in the game. The winner may be determined based on which of the players is closest to 21 without having folded and without having exceeded 21. If it is the real player who has won, then the amount in the pot may be credited to the real player's account, paid out in cash to the player, or otherwise provided to the player. If it is a virtual player who has won, then the house may keep any money from the pot.","A player may play dice games at a standalone device. The standalone device may deal cards that are numbered 1-6, so as to simulate rolls of dice. The player may win or lose according the rules of the applicable dice game, e.g., craps.","Deck Sorting Device","In various embodiments, a deck with only cards 1-6 may be formed from another deck, such as from a standard 52 card deck or such as from a plurality of such decks. The card deck may be formed using a card sorter. According to some embodiments, in operation, the card sorter may receive a deck containing the cards 1-6 as well as other cards, (e.g., 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K). The card sorter may form two decks from this. The first deck may include cards numbered 1-6, and the second deck may contain all other cards. The two decks may be separated, such as into two different stacks or heaps of cards.","A card sorter may include an optical reader or scanner for reading card faces. The card sorter may further include a processor and memory. The processor and memory may be formed from semiconductors or from any other materials. The processor may be a standard Intel processor, or any other processor.","Non-Computer Embodiments","In various embodiments, where applicable, embodiments described herein may also be practiced without a computer system. For example, players may play blackjack against one another using physical cards and physical chips for betting. Players may also play craps or other dice games using a physical deck of cards, where such cards have been numbered 1-6.","In general, like reference numerals in different figures do not necessarily refer to the same item. Reference numerals below, until otherwise specified, refer only to .","Architecture of a System According to Various Embodiments","Referring to , there is shown a block diagram of interactive gaming system A according to various embodiments. System A comprises controller A and a plurality of gaming devices or machines G.sub.1, G.sub.2, G.sub.3, . . . G.sub.N (collectively referred to herein as \u201cgaming machines A\u201d).

Each of the gaming machines A are provided with an enabling means such as a push button, joy stick, video-game pad arm or \u201ctouch screen\u201d to activate and thus play the wagering game.","Referring to , programmable interface circuitry A may be programmed to effect data communication between gaming machines A and controller A when machines A and controller A are arranged in different configurations. In various embodiments, controller A is located in one particular location and each gaming machine A is located at an internet location. In another embodiment, controller A and gaming machines A are located in the same physical location, e.g. within the same casino. When each gaming machine A is located at an internet location, each gaming machine A generally comprises the player's personal computer and the appropriate software. In various embodiments, the player downloads software made available on the internet by servers A. The software enables the player to communicate with controller A and to play the wagering game and the desired theme game.","When system A is configured such that gaming machines A are located at remote sites that are linked to the internet, the display screen of each player's personal computer is programmed to initially display the interior of a casino. The player can scroll using the keyboard or mouse to \u201cmove about the casino\u201d. In one embodiment, the player's personal computer and software are configured to provide \u201csounds\u201d of a typical casino environment. The \u201ccasino\u201d displayed on the display screen includes a plurality of groups or banks of slot machines. Each group of slot machines is associated with a particular theme game. Indicia are provided to identify which group of slot machines is associated with a particular theme game. Each slot machine is associated with an icon representing a chair or stool. When the player decides to play a slot machine that is associated with a particular theme game, he or she uses a computer mouse to \u201cclick\u201d on the \u201cchair icon\u201d in front of a slot machine that is part of the bank of gaming machine associated with the desired theme game.

Thus, it is to be understood that system A can have any one of a variety of configurations, as described above, and that interface circuitry A can be configured by CPU A to handle data transfer between controller A and gaming machines A in a manner that is compatible with any of the particular configurations discussed above. It is also to be understood that controller A, as described above, is just one example of a suitable controller and that other suitable controller architecture can also be used.","Gaming system A, according to various embodiments, can be played by one or more players. Some of the theme games are configured so that a plurality of players playing at a particular bank of gaming machines can play as a group. If a group of players are playing gaming system A, the group of players are referred to as a \u201cGroup\u201d. In some embodiments, games may be configured in manner such that the players play against each other instead as a group. In various embodiments, the system allows all players to communicate with one another via e-mail while simultaneously playing the wagering games.","Remote Participation in a Live Casino Game","Various embodiments pertain to the playing of casino table type games such as roulette, dice and cards, from remote locations while viewing actual games being played at a casino or similar location.","One of the games played in a casino is roulette. This game is played at a table around which a number of players sit or stand and bet by placing chips on a betting grid of numbers in blocks, intersections of blocks, black and red plays and odd and even number selections. A wheel is spun and a ball falls into a numbered pocket as the wheel stops thereby determining the winner of the game who is paid off at various odds depending upon the type of bet placed. Such a game is played at casinos throughout the world. There is usually a considerable amount of interest and excitement around the table as the game is played.","The game of roulette is also played via the Internet. Here there is a computer generated simulation of the roulette table betting grid and spinning wheel. This type of game originates from any location capable of housing the computer and having the necessary telecommunication connections. The player can play the game for fun only or make wagers over the Internet such as by establishing and using a credit card account. The Internet and other telecommunication media may permit playing roulette from any location in the world having the necessary equipment.","A similar situation exists with other casino table games such as blackjack, dice and baccarat. In each of these games players place bets on a table and there is player interaction as the game is played as well as reaction in the crowd watching.","In various embodiments, a player establishes an information link with a casino from an interface station including a video monitor and keypad. In response to the player's entry of financial account information, the casino establishes an information line with the player's financial institution. The casino assigns the player to a gaming table at which a \u201clive\u201d game is occurring, transmitting all images of game play and instructions to the player. The player transmits bet and game play information to the casino. Because of the open line between the casino and player's financial institution, bets are checked, winnings paid, and losses debited.","Various embodiments include a system and method for playing a roulette game in an interactive manner at a site remote from the actual casino table while still having a view of and experiencing the live casino action where the game is being played. In accordance with various embodiments a camera follows a game that is being played at a roulette table in a casino. A microphone can also pick up the sound of the players at the table and the game play.","In some embodiments, terminals are provided at various locations in the casino remote from the table. The terminals are connected to a distribution device that provides the necessary communication between the players at the remote terminals and the game being played at the casino table.","A remote terminal accepts cash or credit cards to set up an account for the player. The remote terminal displays a picture (video) of the actual casino table where the game is being played. The remote terminal also contains its own computer (microprocessor) that has various functions. Among these are the generation and display of an electronic representation of the table betting grid, this display also having a touch type keypad in some embodiments. The player at the terminal uses the keypad and electronically places a bet on the computer representation of the table betting grid under the casino (house) roulette rules in the normal manner. He also uses the touchpad to select the amount of the bet to be placed. The remote terminal microprocessor is programmed with the required information of odds to pay off when the player makes a winning bet.","At the casino table the croupier conducts the game in the normal manner. At a given time, normally just before or when the ball is placed in the spinning wheel, no more bets are accepted. This is signaled to the computers at the remote terminals which locks out the players at these terminals from placing any more bets. The players at the remote terminals can watch the actual game play at the casino table and the reactions of the players. When the ball drops in the wheel pocket and the game at the casino is finished, the player sees the winning number result. The result also is also made available electronically at the remote terminals.","In various embodiments, the remote terminal microprocessor maintains the terminal player account balance information. Upon the result of the game winning number being transmitted to the remote terminal, the terminal microprocessor make a calculation against the bet made. If the bet was a loss, then the amount of the bet is subtracted from the player's account. If the bet was a win, the amount of the win is calculated at the usual casino odds, or at some other odds as set, and the appropriate amount of the win is credited to the player's account.","Various embodiments pertain to players who are not at the casino and, effectively, can be located anywhere in the world. Here, the game being played at the casino is followed by the camera and the picture of the game play and results are transmitted via telecommunications to remote locations. The transmission mode can be the Internet, satellite or other wired or wireless communication system, to players who play the roulette games using devices such as personal computers or modalities such as a TV set connected to the Internet with control boxes such as offered by WEBTV or AOLTV. The devices can be either of stationary type or of the portable type which can communicate by wireless. A program can be installed in or downloaded to the remote player's device that has the features of the previously described casino remote terminal, such as betting odds calculation, generation and display of a betting grid, placing a bet on the grid, etc.","In the remote player embodiments, the game being played at the casino may be viewed and the game play sounds heard by the player at the remote location. The player maintains an account preferably at his own device that can have access to a central computer such as at a bank or credit card company in communication with the player's device. The player follows the table game by viewing the transmission from the camera. When a game is completed at the casino the result is transmitted and the player's computer makes the necessary win and loss calculations based upon the result of the game and this is entered in the player's account at his device.","In some embodiments, a player who is not at the casino table experiences the actual table play and crowd response and is able to make wagers without having to be physically present at the game table in the casino. The results of a bet are computed at the location of the player and the player is presented with a running total of his account so he can see the results of his wager and monitor the amount wagered.","Various embodiments pertain to games played at a table such as blackjack, dice, baccarat and similar games.","Various embodiments may allow players to play roulette and other casino table type games at remote locations while following an actual game that is being played at a casino table and using the results of the casino game to determine betting results.","Various embodiments provide a system and method for playing roulette and other casino table type games in which a player at a terminal or other device remote from a game played at a casino game table follows the game at the casino table, in which the player uses a computer located at the terminal or device to place bets, and in which computations are made of the winnings and losses as the actual game is played.","Various embodiments provide a method and system for viewing a roulette or other table game played at a casino from a remote location from which bets are made and wins and losses are adjusted against an account balance of the remote player.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0258","num":"0257"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["10","12","11","11","11","13"],"i":"a "},"Shown located above the table is a video camera B, such as a video camera that is of the full color type. The camera B can be hidden, as are many cameras in a casino used for surveillance purposes, or can be a stand alone visible type if, for example, the presence of the remote play feature is to be advertised. The camera field of view may be limited to the hands of the players as they place bets on the table and may not show the faces of the players. This may be done to maintain privacy. A microphone B is also placed adjacent the table to pick up the \u201ccrowd noise\u201d of the players. The microphone can be directional to pick up the sound of the spinning wheel and ball.","The output cable B of the camera B and the output cable B of the microphone B are shown. These are connected to a distribution device B at a suitable location that includes the type of broadcast facility that is to be used for the system. For example, if the game is to be used only with remote terminals at the casino, then there would be a type of a closed circuit TV system. If the camera and audio output is to be broadcast over the Internet, then there would be a suitable transmitter such as by \u201cstreaming video\u201d and \u201cstreaming audio\u201d. If broadcast is to be by satellite then there would be communication such as by digital transmission.","Also associated with the table B is a control box B. This is to be used to indicate specific events of a game during its play, such as start of a game and the close of betting for a game, that is, betting status signals. The control box B can be actuated in a suitable manner, such as manually actuated by the croupier, voice actuated and actuated at a remote location such as by an operator at a central location that monitors play at a table. In some embodiments, the control box B can be associated with physical devices such as, for example, a tray T in which the game ball B is placed and which has a micro switch or other type of sensor. Placing the ball in the tray triggers a signal that indicates the start of betting for a new game and removing the ball from the tray to place it in the wheel triggers a signal that the betting for the game is terminated. The close of betting also can be indicated by a motion detector or the video camera each for sensing start of spinning of the wheel and opening of betting for a new game by sensing the wheel stopping its rotation. These betting status signals are transmitted via the distribution device B to the remote terminals.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0262","num":"0261"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["40","40","39","40","42","10","14","46"]},"Terminal B also includes a computer module B which has a microprocessor and a memory. The computer module preferably is of the type that makes the terminal B self-contained. That is, it has an application program that can generate various displays, perform the necessary computation for the odds of playing a game, and for keeping a running account of the wins and losses of the player. The terminal computer module B receives the betting result and betting status data type signals produced at the table B.","Remote terminal B also includes a display B which basically comprises three sections. The display B is controlled by the terminal computer module B and a connecting communication line B between the two is shown. The display B essentially is an electronic table having features that corresponds to the actual casino table.","The display B has a section Bthat displays a computer module B generated simulation of the table betting grid. This section also can display other information such as the odds for various bets and bet combinations. The latter type of information can be displayed continuously or only on demand.","The second section Bof the display B is a touch type screen that has a numeric keypad B with the usual 0-9 numbers, a touch type Enter key B and a display window B that displays data that has been entered. As part of a menu on the touch screen Bis a set of keys for the selection of the type of bet, that is, straight number, combination of numbers, red\/black and odd\/even. The third section Bdisplays the account balance of the player. All of the sections of the display B are generated and controlled by the terminal computer module B.","The terminal B audio module B also interacts with the computer module B. The audio module can be used to provide information to help the player place his bets. For example, it can give messages to the effect that a new game is starting, direct a player to place a bet on grid number(s), and indicate that betting is closed. Instead of the audio messages, the messages can be displayed on any one of the sections of display B and there can be a combination of audio and visual messages.","A bill acceptor B is also part of the terminal B. Here the player inserts bills of currency to build up credits in his\/her account. The bill acceptor accepts currency of the type used at the casino or other type and of one or more denominations. As the player inserts one or more bills into the acceptor to open his account, the value is displayed in the display section B. The acceptor B also can be replaced by a credit card reader or one can be provided in addition to the acceptor.","The remote terminal B also has an internal printer B. When the player completes play at the terminal, he can request a printout of his account which is provided by the printer B. This can be presented to a cashier at the casino to be redeemed for cash or chips when there is a positive balance. If the player is playing via a credit card, he can request from the terminal that winnings in his account as stored in the computer module B be electronically credited to his credit card account at a credit card company or bank. A player can obtain cash from a credit card, such as from an ATM machine.","In the operation of a remote terminal B for a new player, the player inserts bills into the acceptor B or uses a credit card. This opens the terminal and the amount of the account is displayed on section B. The player then selects a preferred bet amount, that is, the base amount of a bet such as would correspond to a chip. For example, if a player opens an account for $100 and a preferred bet amount of $5, he would have the equivalent of 20 $5 chips if actually playing at the casino table. A stack or stacks of electronic chips of the proper amount and values can be displayed such as on the electronic betting grid section B. The value of a chip can be any amount, for example, even as small as 25 cents. The small betting amounts usually are not permitted at the casino table which often has a minimum bet of $5 or $10. The remote terminals expand the customer base and the amount that the casino owner or game operator can make during game play.","The player views the play in process at the casino table on the video display B and can play along with the play at the casino. The video display B preferably is left on at all times to attempt to induce play at a terminal.","The player is advised that a new game is to start and to place his bet. The start of a new game message, either audio or visual, is triggered from the control box B associated with the casino table. For example, as the ball B is placed in the tray Bat the casino table or the spinning of the wheel stops, the distribution device at the casino broadcasts this to the remote terminals. The player enters his bet via the touch screen B. That is, the player selects whether it is a straight number, combination or other type of bet. Different types of bets can be made, like playing at the casino table. At the time of placing a bet the player can consult the betting grid in display section B. Instead of a touch type screen section Bto designate the number(s) or other type of bet, numbers can be selected by a computer mouse point and click arrangement on the electronic grid table B. This is of use particularly where the terminal is a PC or other device that is off the casino physical site. In a PC or similar device, a part of the display screen can be used for the video display and another part for the computer generated functions, such as the betting grid. In a device using an AOLTV or WEBTV converter box or similar device the display screen of a television screen would be similarly divided.","The type of bet selected is displayed in window B. The player enters the number or grid intersection numbers if the bet is a combination. This is also displayed in window B. The number, intersection, red\/black or odd\/even bet also is displayed on the electronic betting grid section B. The player then enters the amount of the bet which also is displayed in window B. The amount of the bet also can be displayed on the betting grid section Bsuch as by showing the stacking of the electronic chip or chips of the selected amount at the proper location of the grid. The chips that are bet are removed from the player's purchased stack of electronic chips.","The complete bet is displayed in window B. If it is acceptable, the player touching the Enter key B. If not acceptable, the bet is cancelled by touching a key on the keypad B, such as the star key, or a special Cancel key provided in section B. At this time the bet data is entered in the memory of the terminal computer module B. If a mouse is used, there would be a point and click at an Enter or cancel box displayed on the screen.","The player can place additional bets for the game until a signal originating from the control box B at the casino game table, such as by removing the ball B from the tray Bor the start of the wheel spinning, indicates that the betting is closed for the present game. The computer B at the remote terminal is locked out from accepting any more bets. This can be indicated to the player at the remote terminal by one or both of an audio and computer generated visible message. During the time allotted for making bets the player at the terminal can watch the action of the players and the bets placed at the casino table B.","The game is played at the casino table B and the players at both the casino and at the remote terminals watch the wheel spinning and the ball dropping. The sounds at the table also are broadcast to the players at the remote terminals. The game result, that is, the winning number of the pocket into which the ball dropped and its color, is sent from the casino distribution device B to the individual remote terminals. The computer module B at a remote terminal B uses the game result and the bet(s) placed information to compute whether there was a loss or a win. If a loss, the computer subtracts the amount of the bet from the player's account. If there was a win, the remote terminal computer module B computes the amount of the win in accordance with the odds of the type and the amount of the bet. That is, each of straight number and number combination have different odds and red\/black and odd\/even have the same odds but different from the number type bets. The computer B has a program that provides for this calculation. The calculated win amount is then credited to the player's account. The account amount is displayed in the display section B","As can be seen, a player at a location remote from the actual casino table can follow an actual game and can experience much of the actual casino player reaction and sounds. This makes the remote player's participation in playing much more realistic and interesting.","The foregoing description is based on a standard casino setting, such as found in Nevada and New Jersey U.S.A. It also applies to private casinos. That is, a religious or veterans organization holds a gambling night. The roulette table and camera would be brought to the location of the organization as well as remote terminals and communication apparatus. The remote terminals can be placed throughout the location for those who like to play alone or to handle any overflow.","Various embodiments are described relative to a roulette table but have application to other casino table play type games. For example, there can be a dice table at the casino which has the camera and microphone described above. Here, the remote terminal would have a video display of the casino dice table and a computer generated representation of the table. The player at the remote terminal places a bet and plays along with the player at the casino. Here also, appropriate betting status signals are sent to the remote terminals to designate the opening and closing of betting, placing additional bets and results of the game. As before, a program in the remote terminal computer module calculates the winning based on house or other odds and credits this to the remote terminal player's account. Losses are subtracted.","The remote terminal video display of actual game content is also applicable to card games such as blackjack, poker and baccarat.","A separate remote terminal can be provided for each type of game or a single universal terminal can be provided for two or more of the table games.","Specific features of the various embodiments are shown in one or more of the drawings for convenience only, as each feature may be combined with other features in accordance with various embodiments.

Web site C offers Internet gaming similar to that offered in-house at casino C, but without using the physical devices available in-house. For example, web site C might offer on-line versions of slot machine game C or blackjack game C. The credits used by the player in Internet gaming can come from any desired source. For example, the player can input a credit card number to web site C, which then issues the player a number of credits in exchange for a charge to the player's credit card. Or the player can use credits associated with the player's account. Systems for transferring credits from a player's account to a gaming device are described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/134,285, filed Aug. 14, 1998, and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/694,065, filed Nov. 19, 2000, which are hereby incorporated by reference. A person skilled in the art will recognize how the systems can be modified to transfer credits to a web site offering Internet gaming.","To use web site C, a user connects to web site C from a computer, such as computer system C, across network C. Computer system C conventionally includes computer C, monitor C, keyboard C, and mouse C. A person skilled in the art will recognize that although computer system C is shown as a desktop personal computer, other types of computers are contemplated in various embodiments. For example, computer system C can also be an Internet appliance, with monitor C, keyboard C, and mouse C integrated into the housing of computer C. Computer system C can also take other forms: for example, a personal digital assistant (PDA) or other handheld device, or even a cellular telephone. Optional equipment not shown as part of computer system C in  are other input\/output devices, such as a printer. Also not shown in  are the conventional internal components of computer system C: e.g., a central processing unit, memory, file system, etc. Similarly, network C can be any variety of network, such as a local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), wireless network, or global network (such as the Internet), among others. Network C can also be any combination of the above networks used to connect computer system C and web site C.","Although  shows web site C as being stored on server C within casino C, a person skilled in the art will recognize that web site C can be stored on other servers. Similarly, web site C can be accessible through server C or can be totally separate, so that connecting to web site C does not require a path through server C. For example,  shows an alternative embodiment. In , web site C is hosted by server C, which is separate from casino C. Server C can be owned by casino C, but physically separate from server C. In this embodiment, where server C and server C are separate devices, typically server C does not store any player tracking information, which is preferably stored on server C. Server C can also be located in a different environment, outside casino C. Or server C can be a third party server, operated by a third party instead of casino C (but perhaps with direction from casino C). A person skilled in the art will recognize other possible variations.","Even if casino C does not own or operate server C, casino C will want to be able to track the player's activity on web site C. To enable this tracking, server C can report the player's activities to casino C. Connection C enables server C to report a player's activities to casino C. A person skilled in the art will recognize that connection C does not have to be a direct physical connection. Instead, server C can connect to casino C via network C.","Although  show web site C as providing the on-line equivalent of gaming in-house at the casino, web site C can provide other forms of entertainment to players. For example, rather than playing for money, web site C can offer players a play-for-fun site. In this configuration, when players use web site C, they are not risking their own money. Nevertheless, casino C might want to track the player's activities, to reward the player for loyalty. For example, the player might earn points that are redeemable at the casino. Thus, even though the casino does not directly profit from the player's activities, there is an indirect profit motive, as the player will eventually visit the casino to redeem the points accrued, and hopefully spend money gambling at the casino. In addition, if the casino offers multiple web sites to players, some of the web sites can be configured for on-line gaming, and others can be configured for play-for-fun.","Returning to , as the player plays in-house at casino C, playing for example slot machine C or blackjack table C, information about the player's activity is tracked. Similarly, as the player plays on-line at web site C, playing for example slot machine game C or blackjack game C, information about the player's activity is tracked. In some embodiments, the combined data is stored offsite in a secure server (as shown in  below). In a second embodiment the combined data is stored in server C. Regardless of where the data is stored, the combined data gives the casino more information about the player that it might otherwise have had.","Although  only show a single casino, a person skilled in the art will recognize that various embodiments may include multiple casino properties. For example, a single web site can track on-line gaming activity for players registered with more than one casino property. In addition, a single casino can have more than one web site (hosted on one or more servers, all of which can be distinct from server C), with player tracking data being reported to server C. A person skilled in the art will recognize other possible variations.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0291","num":"0290"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 4A","FIG. 5"],"b":["140","120","120","205","210","215","210"]},"ASP server C is responsible for managing secure communications between server C and secure server C. In a preferred embodiment, server C sends eXtensible Markup Language (XML) requests to ASP server C, which is the only device permitted to access secure server C behind firewall C. But a person skilled in the art will recognize that server C can communicate with ASP server C other than by using XML. By having secure server C communicate with ASP server C rather than secure server C, sensitive data can be kept secure on secure server C but still accessible from outside firewall C if the request is transmitted in the correct manner. ASP server C can then communicate with secure server C to obtain the response to the requests, which can be securely transmitted back to server C, preferably using XML. Server C can then transform the XML response into HyperText Markup Language (HTML) using an eXtensible Stylesheet Language (XSL) Transformation (XSLT). The resulting HTML can then be displayed to the player on computer system C.","Communication between server C and ASP server C may be encrypted. Any encryption scheme can be used: the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption protocol used on the Internet is a standard that can be applied to encrypt the communication. Similarly, communication between ASP server C and secure server C is preferably encrypted.","As an example of how the communications scheme of  can be used, consider the situation in which the player wants to update his personal information. (In this example, encrypted communications are not described, but a person skilled in the art will recognize how to introduce encrypted communications into the example.) Since personal information is sensitive (the player would not want it publicly available), the data would be stored on secure server C, behind firewall C. So, using server C the player can request to view his player data. (It is assumed at this point that the player has identified himself to the system.) The browser request made of server C is translated into an XML request of ASP server C, which is forwarded to secure server C. Secure server C responds with the personal information, which is formed into XML and forwarded to server C. Server C uses XSLT to transform the XML data into an HTML page, which can then be presented to the user. Using a form, the player can update his personal data. XML form data can then be posted to ASP server C, which can update the database on secure server C. ASP server C sends an XML confirmation message back to server C, which again uses XSLT to transform the XML confirmation message into HTML, which can be presented to the user.","Registering a Player","In some embodiments, before a player can receive a benefit according to , the player may be required to register with the casino. The most traditional way for a player to register with the system is to have the player come in to the casino to register. A casino employee enters player data (either from a form prepared by the player or live as the player provides the data) into a computer and gives the player a player card. Then, when the player uses the player card at any gaming device, the system can track the player's activity. The player card can also have a number imprinted on it that is unique to that player card: the player can then use that number to identify himself for on-line gaming.","Instead of having players come to the casino in person to register an account, there are other ways in which players can be registered with the system. For example, the player can fill out an electronic form, over the Internet. The player can then be mailed the player card, and\/or can be issued electronically an identification number that can be used for on-line gaming.","Other ways can also be used to register the player. For example, software exists that allow the Internet Protocol (IP) address of a computer to be located geographically. Using such software, a player can be located without having to type any information. When the player first sets up his account, the system can determine the player's location based on his IP address. But IP addresses identify computers, not persons: it is not possible to determine who is using the computer from the IP address. Further, if IP addresses are dynamically assigned, they do not even uniquely identify a computer.","Instead of assigning the player an identification number, an existing ID for the player can be used. For example, each state assigns persons in the state a unique driver's license number. The combination of the issuing state and the ID number can uniquely identify a player. The player can input this information to the system, and the system can forward the information to a third party database. The third party database can then return information about the player. The combination of issuing state and ID number can be used both to obtain information about a player for registration purposes (in setting up the player's account) and for identification purposes (for using the account).","In various embodiments, a combination of methods is used to register a player. First, the IP address of the computer is checked to determine the player's location. Then the player is prompted for his ID number and issuing agency. The ID number and issuing agency are forwarded to the third party database, both to verify the player's location as determined by IP address and to obtain player demographic information. If the player's location is verified, the account is registered using the player's IP address, ID number, and issuing agency. But if the player's location is not verified, then the player is requested to telephone the casino or come in personally, and have a casino employee register the player's account.","Setting Player Preferences","Various embodiments provide a gaming machine that may be customized according to one or more player preferences. A player may view and modify player preferences stored in a player preference account as preference account information. The preference account information may include but is not limited to loyalty point account information, loyalty point account settings, promotional opportunities, preferred games, preferred game features for the preferred games, preferred gaming machine settings, preferred bonus games, preferred service options and preferred progressive games. The preference account information may be stored in a plurality of preference accounts on a preference account server. Using a preference account interface which may be compatible with a web-browser, a player may be able to view and modify preference account information stored on the preference account server from a number of remote devices such as a gaming machine, a home computer, a hotel room video interface and a casino kiosk.","Collusion Detection","It will be appreciated that the game of poker is a mixed game, combining elements of both chance and skill or strategy. It is known for two or more players in a poker game to co-ordinate their respective playing strategies in order to gain an advantage over the remaining players in the game, thereby destroying the fairness of the game.","Some embodiments will be described with particular reference to a system for detecting and controlling collusion in a game of poker. However, this application is not to be construed as limiting, in various embodiments.","Referring to , a system for detecting and controlling collusion in a game of poker is indicted generally by reference numeral (D). The system (D) includes a gaming server (D) and a number of portals (D, D) in the form of websites on the World Wide Web of the Internet. In this embodiment, each one of the portal websites is an online casino website hosted on a corresponding casino web server (not shown). For convenience, various embodiments will be described with particular reference to only two such online casino websites (D, D). Each one of the casino websites (D, D) is accessible by one or more would-be poker players (not shown). Each would-be poker player accesses a casino website by means of a corresponding Internet-enabled computer workstation having a display (D) and an associated pointing device (D), such as a mouse, a touchpad and\/or any other device. In this embodiment, casino website (D) is shown as having one computer workstation (D) logically connected thereto, whereas casino website (D) is shown as being logically connected to two such computer workstations. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that such online casino websites (D, D) can be logically connected to any number of computer workstations (D) simultaneously, which number is physically limited only by considerations of processing power and Internet access bandwidth.","The system (D) includes, further an administration facility (D) in the form of an application web server, which is communicable with the gaming server (D) along a communication channel (D). The detailed operation of the application web server (D) will be outlined in the description that follows. The system (D) also includes a collusion detection server (D) that is communicable with the gaming server (D) along the communication channel (D).","The gaming server (D), the online casino web servers (not shown) corresponding to the online casino websites (D, D), the computer workstations (D), the application web server (D) and the collusion detection server (D) are capable of communicating with each other by means of an open communication channel that is, in this embodiment, the Internet. Although the Internet is a single packet-switched communication network, it is represented in , for convenience, as separate logical communication channels (D, D, D, D, D and D).","The application web server (D) maintains a clearing account facility (D) that has a clearing account corresponding to each one of the casino websites (D, D). Analogously, each online casino web server (D, D) includes a corresponding credit account facility (D, D) with a credit account corresponding to each player who participates in the game of poker through one of the computer workstations (D). In the illustrated embodiment, the credit account facility (D) therefore has one player account associated with it, while credit account facility (D) has two associated player credit accounts.","The gaming server (D) operates under control of a stored program capable of enabling a predetermined maximum number, say 8, of players to participate in an instance of the game of poker. When the number of players reaches this predetermined maximum number, the stored program causes a further instance of the game to be initiated, the new instance also being capable of accommodating a further 8 players. In addition, the stored program initiates different instances of the game for each one of a number of different levels of play that are, in this embodiment, $1\/$2, $2\/$4, $5\/$10, $10\/$20, $20\/$40, fixed limit games over $20\/$40, and pot limit games. In this manner the gaming server is capable, under stored program control, of spawning as many separate instances of the game as required in order to accommodate the requirement of a pool of players who desire to play the game at different levels of play, in groups of a maximum of 8. Each instance of the game spawned in this manner is treated as totally independent of the other instances.","The online casino websites (D, D) enable a player desiring to join the game to request, by means of one of the computer workstations (D), participation in the game and, once admitted to a particular instance of the game, to place a wager on a turn of that instance. Each participating player is presented with an identical graphical user interface (GUI) on the display (D) of his respective computer workstation (D) by the stored program in the gaming server (D). The GUI presents to the player a suitable display of a poker game (not shown) with appropriate icons that enable the player to make his own desired game play decisions and to monitor the progress of the game by viewing the game play decisions of the other participating players in the same instance of the game.","As shown in , the stored program also provides a wagering means (D) operable by any participating player to place a wager on a turn of the game, as well as a discrimination means (D) capable of determining whether any wager placed by any one of the participating players on the turn of the instance of the game of poker is successful or unsuccessful. The stored program in the gaming server (D) also maintains a dynamic register (D) of all players admitted to, and actively participating in, all the spawned instances of the poker from time to time, together with data representative of a corresponding portal (D, D) through which each participating player accessed the game. The dynamic register (D) also contains data representative of an instance of the game in which the player is participating. The application web server (D) also settles the wagers of the participating players after completion of every turn of all instances of the game.","In use, a player wishing to participate in the game of poker uses a computer workstation (D) to access an online casino website (D, D) of his choice. The player is presented with an icon (not shown) on the GUI on his computer workstation (D), which the user can activate in order to request participation in the poker game at a desired level of play. The user's request for participation is passed by the online casino website (D, D) to the gaming server (D), which may adjudicate and process the request in the following manner: 1. if all existing instances of the poker game at the desired level of play are currently being played by 8 players, the existing instances of the game are all fully occupied and the would-be player cannot be admitted. The user is notified of the situation and is prompted to join a waiting list of would-be players; 2. if any one of the existing instances of the poker game at the desired level of play does have a vacancy, the would-be player is removed from the waiting list and admitted to that instance of the game and an appropriate GUI is presented to the newly-admitted player to allow him to play the game and to place wagers thereon; 3. the register of active participating players is updated to include the details of the newly-admitted player, together with data representative of the online casino website (Dor D) from which the player was admitted to the game, as well as the particular instance of the game to which he has been admitted; 4. when the waiting list of would-be players at any particular level of play has grown sufficiently large, say 4 or 5, the gaming server spawns a new instance of the game at that level of play to accommodate the would-be players in the waiting list, and the list is flushed; and 5. the register of active participating players is updated to include the details of all the newly-admitted players in the newly-spawned instance of the game, together with data representative of an online casino website (Dor D) from which the players were admitted to the game, as well as the particular instance of the game to which the players have been admitted.","Any player is able to leave the instance of the poker game in which he is participating at any time upon completion of a turn of that instance of the game. When a participating player leaves an instance of the poker game, the player's departure results in the following actions: 1. the GUI corresponding to the poker game on the computer workstation is replaced by one allowing the player to select another casino game to play; 2. the departing player's details are removed from the register of active participating players; and 3. the remaining instances of the game are analyzed in order to collapse any sparsely populated instances of the game and to consolidate the participating players in these instances into a single more densely-populated instance of the game.","The participating players in any instance of the game utilize the wagering means (D) to place wagers from time to time on a turn of the poker game and to effect playing decisions required during the progress of the turn, as described above. Once the turn of the game has been completed, the discrimination means (D) determines which of the players is the winner of the turn and the application web server (D) settles the wagers placed by the participating players on that turn of the instance of the game, as follows: 1. the gaming server (D) notifies an online casino website (D, D) associated with each player who has made a wager on the turn of the game. Each online casino website (D, D) then debits the individual credit account of its associated player by an amount equivalent to the magnitude of that player's wager; 2. the clearing account of an online casino website (D, D) associated with each player who has made a wager on the turn of the game is then debited by an amount equivalent to the magnitude of that player's corresponding wager; 3. the clearing account of an online casino website (D, D) associated with the player who has made the successful wager on the turn of the game is credited by an amount equivalent to the total of all the wagers inclusive of the successful wager; and 4. the gaming server (D) also notifies the online casino website (D, D) associated with the successful player and that online casino website credits the individual credit account of the successful player by an amount equivalent to the total of all the wagers inclusive of the successful wager.","It is anticipated that the wagers placed by the participating players in the game will be made with credit purchased by such players prior to their participation in the game. For this purpose each online casino (D, D) includes credit-dispensing means (not shown) capable of dispensing credit to any player who wishes to participate in the poker game. The player may purchase credit by means of conventional credit or debit card payment facilities that are well known in the art and that will not be described here in detail. Whenever a player purchases credit from the credit dispensing means, the corresponding online casino (D, D) credits that player's credit account with an amount equivalent to the quantity of credit purchased by the player.","In various embodiments, the application server (D) withholds a portion of the total of all the wagers on each turn of the game as a rake for the benefit of the operator of the gaming server (D) and the online casino websites (D, D). A portion of the rake is credited to the clearing account of each of the online casinos (D, D) as a function of the proportion of players participating in the turn of the instance of the game through that particular casino website. In this variation of the embodiment, the clearing account of the casino (Dor D) associated with the player who has made a successful wager on the turn of the game is credited with an amount equivalent to the total of all the wagers inclusive of the successful wager, less the amount of the rake. Analogously, the credit account of the player who has made the successful wager is credited by an amount equivalent to the total of all the wagers, inclusive of the successful wager, less the rake.","The collusion detection server (D) maintains a recording means in the form of a collusion detection database (D), the function of which will be described in greater detail below. The collusion detection server (D) operates under control of a stored program capable of logging the playing history of each player who participates in an instance of the game of poker at some time. The playing history includes an amount wagered on each turn of the game in which the player has participated, as well as a corresponding outcome of the wager. The outcome of the wager is taken to be a profit made on the wager, if successful, and an amount of the wager that is forfeited by the player if the wager is unsuccessful. In this particular embodiment, the outcome of the successful wager is thus the total of all the wagers by the participating players in the turn of the instance of the game of poker, less the amount wagered by the winning player, less the amount of the rake. The logged information is recorded in the collusion detection database (D).","As shown in , the stored program in the collusion detection server (D) provides a ranking facility (D) that is operable to derive from the logged playing history of each player, a corresponding primary statistic. A player's primary statistic is re-calculated by the ranking facility (D) each time the player's playing history is updated with the outcome of a further turn of the game in which the player has participated. The derived primary statistic is stored in the collusion detection database (D). In some implementations, a statistic related to a player's win\/loss ratio over a plurality of games played by the player may be calculated. Such information may be determined based on the number of games played, the number of games won, the amount of money won, and so on.","The stored program in the collusion detection server (D) also provides a monitoring means (D) for continuously monitoring the primary statistic of any player in the collusion detection database (D). The monitoring means (D) generates an output in the form of a flag when the primary statistic of any player changes by more than a predetermined threshold. Such a change indicates a change in that player's pattern of play and this may serve as an indicator of possible collusion by that player that is worthy of further investigation. In order to minimize the possibility of generating spurious flags, the ranking facility (D) derives the primary statistic for a player once a playing history exceeding 300 turns of the game has been logged in the collusion detection server (D). It is anticipated that a particular player's win\/loss ratio will differ according to a level at which the game is played, the player being more cautious when playing the game at a high level. For this reason, the ranking facility (D) computes a primary statistic for each player for each level at which the game may be played. In this instance, the levels of play are: games up to $1\/$2, games from $2\/$4 to $5\/$10, games from $10\/$20 to $20\/$40, fixed limit games over $20\/$40, Pot Limit games, and No Limit games. Thus a primary statistic for a particular level of play will only be derived by the ranking facility (D) when a playing history of 300 or some other desired threshold turns of the game has been logged for that particular level of play.","The stored program in the collusion detection server (D) also provides a control facility (D) that acts on the flag generated by the monitoring means (D) by suspending the corresponding player from further participation in the game of poker.","The ranking facility (D) also computes a number of secondary statistics relating to each player. When the primary statistic has a positive value, indicating a winning player, a first secondary statistic is a breakdown of that player's winnings from the other players in the instance of the game. If an inordinate percentage of that player's winnings is derived from one or more other players, the monitoring means (D) generates a flag. Such a skewed pattern of winnings is a further indicator of possible collusion by the winning player.","A further secondary statistic, which is computed when the primary statistic for a player is negative, indicating a losing player, is a breakdown of that player's losses to the other players in the instance of the game. If an inordinate percentage of that player's losses are made to one or more other players, the monitoring means (D) generates a flag.","A still further secondary statistic is computed as: raises with\/without a Raising Hand=R\/RH where: R=total number of raises; and RH=number of raising hands.","Each game play decision by a player to raise a prior wager is analyzed by an analysis facility (D) connected to the gaming server (D). The analysis facility (D) evaluates whether the game play decision was optimal in the light of the cards in the players hand. A ratio close to 1 indicates that the player is raising correctly. A ratio significantly greater than 1 means that the player is raising too often with hands that are not adjudged to be raising hands. This indicates that the player is a poor player, or a colluder, and a flag is raised by the monitoring means (D).","As a yet further statistic, a player's losses arising from all raises are broken down and analyzed. An inordinately high proportion of losses to one or more other participating players causes the monitoring means (D) to raise a flag.","It is anticipated that the two previous secondary statistics can be advantageously employed to quickly analyze a new participating player. With a logged playing history of only 20 or 30 turns of the game, these secondary statistics will be accurate enough to enable the monitoring means (D) to raise a flag, when required.","Sports Betting","Various embodiments provide a system and method for conducting sports and event betting. According to one aspect, the ease of using a network (e.g., the Internet, cellular, and\/or other type of network) is combined with sports and event betting at a land-based casino. Thus, sport and other types of event betting are improved, as betting is more convenient to the bettor.","According to one embodiment, a bettor may sign onto a website (e.g., through the Internet and\/or other type of network) to place a bet on any sports or other event including professional and college football, soccer, baseball, basketball, auto racing, and ice hockey, as well as cricket, rugby, and various sports tournaments including the NCAA Men's and Women's Basketball Championships and World Cup Soccer. Other events upon which a bet may be placed include any type of event, such as, for example, choosing the winner of a reality television show (e.g., the Survivor reality show), when the first person lands on Mars, or the winner of the next United States Presidential election.","According to one embodiment, a website (e.g., made available through the Internet or other type of network) includes a listing of all the possible bets that may be made. According to another embodiment, the bettor may then select the wagers to be made on-line and register the wagers to be made with the casino. One advantage of this is especially apparent for complicated or multiple selection events that may involve multiple selections of events to occur. For instance, a bet involving the entire NCAA Men's Basketball Championship Tournament which has 63 games and 64 teams is a complicated bet that may require multiple event selections. In another example, choosing a fantasy league team (e.g. for the National Football League (NFL)) may have as many as 30 team members or positions and as many as 60 choices for each position, further complicating the wagering process. However, such traditional wagers were limited to being placed in the gaming establishment by the bettor. According to one aspect, the bettor is permitted to arrange the bet outside of the gaming establishment, and to make payment for the bet in a legal manner.","According to various embodiments, a bettor may propose a bet for the website operator to consider. According to various embodiments, a registration number is issued by the website operator if the bet is accepted. According to various embodiments, the bettor then proceeds to the land-based casino running the website and pays for the registered bet. According to various embodiments, by permitting the bettor to make the actual payment for the wager at the land-based casino, legal issues with Internet betting in the United States are reduced or eliminated. This method is believed to provide convenience to the bettor because the bettor can determine and place their bet(s) prior to going to the casino. Further, such a method may provide additional foot traffic for the casinos to enhance play of their other games, as bettors are required to travel to the casino to make payment.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0329","num":"0328"},"figref":"FIG. 17","b":["200","230","202"]},"At block E, the bettor reviews the available bets on the website. According to some embodiments, the website may list all or some of the possible bets that may be made. The possible bets that may be shown may be determined according to the bettor's account or betting profile (e.g., possible football bets will not be shown to a bettor not interested in football). Available bets may also be shown based on the historical betting behavior of the bettor.","Odds shown for a possible bet may be set or may be variable depending upon when the bet is registered or when the bet is paid for. For example, a bet on the winner of the Major League Baseball World Series may have 6:1 odds after the regular season and before the baseball playoffs start, 1:1 odds just before the World Series starts, and 1:4 odds after the third game of the Series. For this example, the odds of the registered bet may be determined at the time the bet is registered or at the time the bet is paid for. If the odds for a registered bet are determined at the time the bet is registered, the land-based casino may require payment for the registered bet within a specified time period (e.g. one minute, one hour, one day, one week, one month, etc.) and this specified time period may shorten as the sports or other event approaches.","At block E, the bettor determines the bet(s) to make and at block E, the bettor registers the bet(s). For instance, the bets may be registered on a website (e.g., through a communication network including the Internet, cellular network, etc.). The bettor may make a bet listed on the website. Alternatively or in addition to the offered bets that are listed, the player may propose a bet not on the website. For instance, in the case where a bet is not listed on the website, the bettor may state the specific event that is being bet on and the bettor or the website operator may determine the odds to be given to the bettor for the bet.","When the website operator accepts the bet, the website may provide a registration, transaction, or confirmation number to the bettor for the bet(s) at block E. The bettor then proceeds to the land-based casino at block E for payment. For instance, the bettor may proceed to a cashier, a kiosk, or other means available for paying for the bet(s) at the casino or other legal gambling jurisdiction. At block E, the bettor provides the bet registration number to the casino, the casino confirms the registration number at block E. At block E, the bettor pays the casino for the bet(s), and the bettor may obtain a betting slip showing the bet(s) placed and the odds on the bet(s).","At block E, the event is held that determines the outcome of the bet and the casino determines if the bettor is a winner at block E. If the bettor is a winner, the casino then pays out the winnings to the bettor at block E. To receive the winnings, a bettor may be required to return to the casino.","At block E, it is possible that the bettor may need to make more picks on the same bet. For example, a bettor may need to make more picks for second and other additional rounds of a multiple round tournament based upon the previous round's results. Such a tournament may include, for example, the FIFA World Cup in soccer or the NCAA Men's Basketball Championship. In such a tournament, it is possible that a bettor may need to make all picks for all rounds before placing the bet.","When paying for a registered bet, a bettor may pay, for instance, using money, loyalty points, combination thereof, or any other payment method. In particular, a bettor may pay using money by debit card, credit card, check, cash or from an account credit either with the gaming operator or an affiliated organization. Alternatively or in addition to other payment methods, a bettor may pay using loyalty points from an account held either by the gaming operator or by an affiliated organization. Loyalty points may be obtained from any type of organization but are generally associated with loyalty programs such as frequent flier programs for airlines, frequent stay programs for hotels or frequent visitor programs for casinos. The bettor may pay in person (e.g., by using a cashier) or by other methods within the casino including telephone, handheld device, or kiosk. Payment may be in any form that is legal in the particular jurisdiction.","The computer system or game operator may automatically determine when a bettor is a winner. Such a result may be automatically authenticated and verified by the computer system. In this instance, the computer system may then notify the bettor that he or she has won and what the winnings are. Notification of winning to a bettor may occur by mail, e-mail, computer web or network, telephone, television, pager, fax, kiosk or any other method.","After a winner is authenticated and verified, the computer system may then notify all bettors of the win. Additionally, the computer system may display the winning bet, the bettor's identity or the payout.","A bettor may also be able to replay or review past bets using an audio-enabled or video-enabled device. For instance, a kiosk, telephone having a display, television, computer or handheld device may be used to view past bets. By accessing a selected bet in the computer system, a game player may be able to see the event outcome, the bet odds, and the payout.","In one embodiment, a computer system may be used to operate most acts of the betting operation, including taking, registering, and paying out bets. For instance, computer system(s) used to perform betting functions according to one embodiment may include single or multiple computer systems, one or more of which may include a supercomputer, a minicomputer, a mainframe computer, or a personal computer. A computer system used to run\u2014the betting operation may also include any combination of computer system types that cooperate to accomplish system-level tasks. Multiple computer systems may also be used to run one or more betting operations. The computer system also may include input or output devices, displays, or storage units to facilitate the betting operation. It should be appreciated that any computer system or systems may be used, and various embodiments are not limited to any number, type, or configuration of computer systems.","A computer system (e.g., system E) that executes the betting operation according to various embodiments may include, for example, one or more component systems (e.g., systems E, E, and\/or E as shown in ). One system component (e.g., payment system E) may handle payment by bettors. Another system component (e.g., sports betting system E) may handle taking and registering bets for one or more events, including sporting event. Yet another system (e.g., payout system E) may handle making payouts to players. Such a betting system may also be connected (e.g., by direct line or network) to other computer systems including systems for handling casino or hotel loyalty programs, reservations, in-room television viewing, gambling floor kiosks, or other systems. Connections to other computer systems may be performed using one or more of the system components described below.","A payment component (e.g., system E) may include one or more of a number of well-known systems. For example, a bettor may be able to pay for a bet through a casino cashier, kiosk or other means that is connected to the payment computer system through an interface. In the computer, data may be stored in a database that is stored in the memory of a computer system. As used herein, a \u201cdata structure\u201d is an arrangement of data defined by computer-readable signals. These signals may be read by a computer system, stored on a medium associated with a computer system (e.g., in a memory, on a disk, etc.) and may be transmitted to one or more other computer systems over a communications medium such as, for example, a network.

In a preferred embodiment, a user establishes communication with an online casino to request a game session. The user requests a game to play on the online casino from a list of available games such as blackjack, roulette, craps, etc. Once the user completes the selection of the game, the online casino receives the request and initiates the game session. For each game, there is a certain number and type of estimated random events that will be required to play the game session to completion, or end the game session at the discretion of the user. Each random event represents an action that would occur at a real casino, such as drawing a card or rolling dice. The online casino is equipped with a random number generator which pre-generates an estimated number of random events and places the random events into a random events sequence. The random events sequence is coded into an encrypted sequence and then transmitted to the user who stores the encrypted sequence until a game verification stage. For the step of encoding, the random events sequence may also be converted into a digital digest and transmitted to the user, or first encrypted and then converted into a digital digest and transmitted to the user.","At this stage in the game session, the user cannot interpret the pre-generated encrypted random events sequence the user receives from the online casino, and the online casino does not have to be concerned about the user being able to unfairly forecast the sequence of random events in the future. The user then commences playing the specified game by requesting random events from the online casino. The online casino receives these requests from the user and responds by sending the user the next number drawn sequentially from the pre-generated random events sequence. Events from the random sequence are consumed by the online casino during the game session. The user records all random events received from the online casino. Once the number of random events in the pre-generated sequence have been exhausted or the user indicates an intent to terminate the game session, the online casino communicates a \u201cGame is Over\u201d to the user and the game ends.","The online casino then sends the user an encryption key for game verification to prove the integrity of the game. The encryption key allows the user to decode the encrypted random events sequence that was previously transmitted to the user at the beginning of the game session. The user decodes the encrypted random events sequence and the decoded random events sequence is compared to the record the user kept of the random events sequence sent by the online casino. If the sequences are identical, then the random events sequence was not altered or tampered with by the online casino during the game session. If the random event sequence recorded by the user and the random events sequence presented by the online casino are different, the verification fails. The user then communicates the failure to the online casino and an appropriate action is taken.","The game session may also be played with more than one user. The online casino may send the same encrypted sequence, which is pre-generated, to each participant allowing them to recompile their individual random events sequences into the original pre-generated random events sequences and compare it with the random events sequences sent by the online casino for verification purposes.","Various embodiments will now be described with reference to , which in general disclose a method for ensuring the authenticity and integrity of online games, and more specifically a method of authenticating a pre-generated random events sequence in an online casino game.","Referring to , in a preferred embodiment, a user establishes communication with an online casino F to request a game session which is the equivalent of one game in an actual casino. The user possesses the necessary computer, client game software and any other basic materials and hardware needed to establish communication with the online casino. The online casino may be a single computer acting as a game server or several computers where databases and processors are in different locations. The user requests a game to play on the online casino during the game session by selecting from a list of available games. A list of typical games to play during the game session may include one of the following games: blackjack, roulette, craps, baccarat, slot machine, lottery, sports betting and poker. It is understood that various embodiments are not limited to these games and may include games not included in the above list.","Once the user completes the selection of the game and communicates the game selected to the online casino, the online casino receives the request and initiates the game session F. For each game, there is a certain number and type of estimated random events that will be required to play the game session to completion, or end the game session at the discretion of the user. Each random event represents an action that would occur at a real casino, such as drawing a card or rolling dice. For example, in the game of blackjack, the type of random events which occur during the game is the action of drawing cards. The number of random events in one game session will typically not exceed 10,000 events. Events from the random sequence are consumed by the online casino during the game session. The online casino is equipped with a random number generator which pre-generates the random events F.","The online casino generates an estimated number of random events and places the random events into a random events sequence F which is a set of random events generated for the game session. The random events sequence is coded into an encrypted sequence F and then transmitted to the user F who stores the encrypted sequence until a game verification stage. The method used to encrypt the random events sequence may be any well known encryption method used in the art. As shown in , respectively, for the step of encoding, the random events sequence may also be converted into a digital digest and transmitted to the user, or first encrypted and then converted into a digital digest and transmitted to the user, as described below.","Referring again to , at this stage in the game session, the user cannot interpret the pre-generated encrypted sequence and the online casino does not have to be concerned about the user unfairly predicting the sequence of random events in the future. The user then commences playing the specified game F by requesting random events from the online casino. The online casino receives these requests from the user and responds by sending the user the next number drawn sequentially from the pre-generated random events sequence. The user records all random events F received from the online casino. It is understood that the user may record the random events manually, as a function of the client game software or other well know methods for recording. Once the number of random events in the pre-generated sequence have been exhausted or the user indicates an intent to terminate the game session, the online casino communicates a \u201cGame is Over\u201d to the user and the game ends F.","The online casino then sends the user an encryption key F for game verification to prove the integrity of the game. The encryption key allows the user to decode the encrypted random events sequence that was transmitted to the user at the beginning of the game session. The user decodes the encrypted random events sequence F and the decoded random events sequence is compared to the record F the user kept of the random events sequence sent by the online casino at the commencement of the game session. It is understood that the user may compare the record the random events manually, as a function of the client game software or other well know methods for recording. If the sequences are identical, then the game was fair F and the random events sequence was not altered or tampered with during the game session. If the verification fails, the user communicates the failure to the online casino and an appropriate action is taken.","As shown in , the online casino may also encode the pre-generated random events sequence using a digital digest at the encoding step. The online casino converts the random events sequence into the digital digest F before transmitting the digital digest to the user F. The specified game is played F. The user records the random events F during the game session. Once the game ends F, the online casino sends the user an undigested random events sequence F. The user then verifies the authenticity of the random events sequence F sent by the online casino by converting the undigested random events sequence into the digital digest, and comparing this digital digest with the digital digest sent by the casino at the commencement of the game. For the verification to succeed, the two digital digests should be identical. Once the random events sequence sent by the online casino is thus verified, the user proceeds with verifying the random events sequence F sent by the online casino during the game session by comparing the verified undigested random events sequence sent by the casino at the end of the game with the random events sequences kept by the user. For the verification to succeed, the two random events sequences must be identical. Similarly, the comparison can be carried out by the user manually or by the client software. If the sequences are identical, then the game was fair F and the random events sequence was not altered or tampered with during the game session. If the verification fails, the user communicates the failure to the online casino and an appropriate action is taken.","Referring to , the online casino may also encode the pre-generated random events sequence by first encrypting and then converting the encoded sequence into a digital digest to complete the encoding step. The online casino encrypts the random events sequence and then converts it into the digital digest F before transmitting it to the user F. The specified game is played F. The user records the random events F during the game session. Once the game ends F, the online casino transmits to the user an undigested random events sequence in its encrypted form. The online casino also transmits to the user an encryption key F. The user first authenticates the encrypted random events sequence by converting it into a digital digest, and then comparing it to the digital digest F sent at the commencement of the game session. The random events sequence is then decoded F and compared to the record the user kept of the random events sequence sent by the online casino F. The user may carry out the comparison manually or by the client game software. For the verification to succeed, the sequences must be identical. If the sequences are identical, then the game was fair F and the random events sequence was not altered or tampered with during the game session. If the verification fails, the user communicates the failure to the online casino and an appropriate action is taken.","Using the above method, the user may be confident that the random events sequence was generated without fraudulent action or knowledge of the online casino since the encrypted sequence was pre-generated and sent to the user prior to beginning of the game session, eliminating any chance for the online casino to modify the sequence of events, and thus the game, in response to the user's actions or steps during the game session.","Referring to , the game session may be played with more than one user F. The online casino may send the same encrypted sequence, which is pre-generated, to each participant (i.e. the encrypted sequence represents the same deck of cards). Each user must have access to the sequence of random events received by other users during the game session. At the end of the game session, the users then collectively compare the sequence of random events received to the sequence of random events that the online casino transmitted at the beginning of the game session to ensure that the sequence was not altered.","Although embodiments for ensuring the authenticity and integrity of online games are described above, it is to be understood that the features described may be used with any electronic game or technology requiring authentication of a random events sequence. Thus, the features and embodiments described above are not to be construed as limiting.","Teams","Various embodiments relate to a computerized system that facilitates team play of card gaming. The computerized system includes at least a first computer for use by a first participant associated with a first team; a second computer for use by a second participant associated with a second team; a third computer for use by a third participant associated with the first team; and a fourth computer for use by a fourth participant associated with the second team. A computer network links the first and second computers to each other for allowing the first and second participants to compete against each other for team points in a first set of card gaming. Likewise, the computer network also links the third and fourth computers to each other for allowing the third and fourth participants to compete against each other for team points in a second set of card gaming. A central server computer coupled to the computer network coordinates the first, second, third and fourth computers, and tallies together team points earned by participants of each team to compute an overall team score for each team. Preferably, the central server computer also computes the team points earned individually by each of the first, second, third, and fourth participants. The aforementioned computer network may be in the form of a local area network, assuming that the aforementioned computers are located relatively close to each other, as within a casino. Alternatively, the aforementioned computer network may be the internet in the case wherein one or more of such computers are located remotely from the others.","The following are hereby incorporated by reference herein:\n\n","Reference numerals below, until otherwise specified, refer only to .","In various embodiments, a distributed gaming system enables participants to engage in gaming activities from remote and\/or mobile locations. The possible gaming activities include gambling, such as that provided by casinos. Gambling activities may include any casino-type gambling activities including, but not limited to, slot machines, video poker, table games (e.g., craps, roulette, blackjack, pai gow poker, Caribbean stud poker, baccarat, etc), the wheel of fortune game, keno, sports betting, horse racing, dog racing, jai alai, and other gambling activities. The gaming activities can also include wagering on any type of event. Events can include, for example, sporting events, such as horse or auto racing, and athletic competitions such as football, basketball, baseball, golf, etc. Events can also include such things that do not normally involve wagering. Such events may include, without limitation, political elections, entertainment industry awards, and box office performance of movies. Gaming can also include non-wagering games and events. Gaming can also include lotteries or lottery-type activities such as state and interstate lotteries. These can include all forms of number-selection lotteries, \u201cscratch-off\u201d lotteries, and other lottery contests. The gaming system may be implemented over a communications network such as a cellular network or a private wireless and\/or wireline network. Examples of the latter include WiFi and WiMax networks. In some embodiments, the gaming system communications network is entirely independent of the Internet. In some embodiments, the gaming system operation makes minimal use of the Internet, such that only information for which there are no security issues is transmitted via the Internet and\/or such that information may be encrypted. In various embodiments, the communications network enables players to participate in gaming from remote locations (e.g., outside of the gaming area of a casino). Also, the system may enable players to be mobile during participation in the gaming activities. In various embodiments, the system has a location verification or determination feature, which is operable to permit or disallow gaming from the remote location depending upon whether or not the location meets one or more criteria. The criterion may be, for example, whether the location is within a pre-defined area in which gaming is permitted by law.","As shown in , for example, gaming system  may include at least one user . The system may include additional users such that there is at least a first user  and a second user . Multiple users may access a first gaming system , while other multiple users access a second gaming system (not shown) in communication with first gaming system . Users  and  may access system  by way of a gaming communication device . Gaming communication device  may comprise any suitable device for transmitting and receiving electronic communications. Examples of such devices include, without limitation, mobile phones, personal data assistants (PDAs), computers, mini-computers, etc. Gaming communication devices  transmit and receive gaming information to and from communications network . Gaming information is also transmitted between network  and a computer , such as a server, which may reside within the domain of a gaming service provider . The location of computer  may be flexible, however, and computer  may reside adjacent to or remote from the domain of gaming service provider . Various embodiments may not include a gaming service provider. The computer  and\/or gaming service provider  may reside within, adjacent to, or remote from a gaming provider (not shown in ). The gaming service provider may be an actual controller of games, such as a casino. As an example, a gaming service provider may be located on the grounds of a casino and the computer  may be physically within the geographic boundaries of the gaming service provider. As discussed, however, other possibilities exist for remote location of the computer  and the gaming service provider . Computer  may function as a gaming server. Additional computers (not expressly shown) may function as database management computers and redundant servers, for example.","In various embodiments, software resides on both the gaming communication device  and the computer . Software resident on gaming communication device  may be operable to present information corresponding to gaming activities (including gambling and non-gambling activities discussed herein) to the user. The information may include, without limitation, graphical representations of objects associated with the activities, and presentation of options related to the activities and selectable by the user. The gaming communication device software may also be operable to receive data from the computer and data input by the user. Software resident on the computer may be able to exchange data with the gaming communication device, access additional computers and data storage devices, and perform all of the functions described herein as well as functions common to known electronic gaming systems.","Gaming information transmitted across network  may include any information, in any format, which is necessary or desirable in the operation of the gaming experience in which the user participates. The information may be transmitted in whole, or in combination, in any format including digital or analog, text or voice, and according to any known or future transport technologies, which may include, for example, wireline or wireless technologies. Wireless technologies may include, for example, licensed or license-exempt technologies. Some specific technologies which may be used include, without limitation, Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM), General Packet Radio Service (GPRS), WiFi (802.11x), WiMax (802.16x), Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), Digital Subscriber Line (DSL), Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN), or cable modem technologies. These are examples only and one of ordinary skill will understand that other types of communication techniques are also contemplated. Further, it will be understood that additional components may be used in the communication of information between the users and the gaming server. Such additional components may include, without limitation, lines, trunks, antennas, switches, cables, transmitters, receivers, computers, routers, servers, fiber optical transmission equipment, repeaters, amplifiers, etc.","In some embodiments, the communication of gaming information takes place without involvement of the Internet. However, in some embodiments, a portion of the gaming information may be transmitted over the Internet. Also, some or all of the gaming information may be transmitted partially over an Internet communications path. In some embodiments, some information is transmitted entirely or partially over the Internet, but the information is either not gaming information or is gaming information that does not need to be maintained secretly. For instance, data that causes a graphical representation of a table game on the user's gaming communication device might be transmitted at least partially over the Internet, while wagering information transmitted by the user might be transmitted entirely over a non-Internet communications network.","According to some embodiments, as shown in  for example, the communications network comprises a cellular network . Cellular network  comprises a plurality of base stations , each of which has a corresponding coverage area . Base station technology is generally known and the base stations may be of any type found in a typical cellular network. The base stations may have coverage areas that overlap. Further, the coverage areas may be sectorized or non-sectorized. The network also includes mobile stations , which function as the gaming communication devices used by users to access the gaming system and participate in the activities available on the gaming system. Users are connected to the network of base stations via transmission and reception of radio signals. The communications network also includes at least one voice\/data switch, which may be connected to the wireless portion of the network via a dedicated, secure landline. The communications network may also include a gaming service provider, which is likewise connected to the voice\/data switch via a dedicated, secure landline. The voice\/data switch may be connected to the wireless network of base stations via a mobile switching center (MSC), for example and the landline may be provided between the voice\/data switch and the MSC.","Users access the gaming system by way of mobile stations which are in communication with, and thus part of, the communications network. The mobile station may be any electronic communication device that is operable in connection with the network as described. For example, in this particular embodiment, the mobile station may comprise a cellular telephone.","In various embodiments, in the case of a cellular network for example, the gaming system is enabled through the use of a private label carrier network. Each base station is programmed by the cellular carrier to send and receive private secure voice and\/or data transmissions to and from mobile station handsets. The handsets may be pre-programmed with both gaming software and the carrier's authentication software. The base stations communicate via private T1 lines to a switch. A gaming service provider leases a private T1 or T3 line, which routes the calls back to gaming servers controlled by the gaming service provider. Encryption can be installed on the telephones if required by a gaming regulation authority, such as a gaming commission.","The cellular network may be a private, closed system. Mobile stations communicate with base stations and base stations are connected to a centralized switch located within a gaming jurisdiction. At the switch, voice calls are transported either locally or via long distance. Specific service provider gaming traffic is transported from the central switch to a gaming server at a host location, which can be a casino or other location.","As subscribers launch their specific gaming application, the handset will only talk to certain base stations with cells or sectors that have been engineered to be wholly within the gaming jurisdiction. For example, if a base station is close enough to pick up or send a signal across state lines, it will not be able to communicate with the device. When a customer uses the device for gaming, the system may prohibit, if desired, the making or receiving voice calls. Moreover, voice can be eliminated entirely if required. Further, the devices may not be allowed to \u201cconnect\u201d to the Internet. This ensures a high level of certainty that bets\/wagers originate and terminate within the boundaries of the gaming jurisdiction and the \u201cprivate\u201d wireless system cannot be circumvented or bypassed. Although in some embodiments some data and\/or voice traffic may be communicated at least partially over the Internet, the communication path may not include the Internet in other embodiments. Alternatively, in some embodiments, certain non-gaming information may be transported over a path which includes the Internet, while other information relating to the gaming activities of the system is transported on a path that does not include the Internet.","As shown in , a gaming communication device  is in communication with a gaming service provider over a network . The gaming service provider preferably has one or more servers, on which are resident various gaming and other applications. As shown in , some example gaming applications include horse racing and other sports, financial exchange, casino and\/or virtual casino, entertainment and other events exchange, and news and real time entertainment. Each of these applications may be embodied in one or more software modules. The applications may be combined in any possible combination. Additionally, it should be understood that these applications are not exhaustive and that other applications may exist to provide an environment to the user that is associated with any of the described or potential activities.","In another embodiment, as shown in , for example, the communications network comprises a private wireless network. The private wireless network may include, for example, an 802.11x (WiFi) network technology to cover \u201cGame Spots\u201d or \u201cEntertainment Spots.\u201d In , various WiFi networks are indicated as networks . Networks  may use other communications protocols to provide a private wireless network including, but not limited to, 802.16x (WiMax) technology. Further, networks  may be interconnected. Also, a gaming system may comprise a combination of networks as depicted in . For example, there is shown a combination of private wireless networks , a cellular network comprising a multi-channel access unit or sectorized base station , and a satellite network comprising one or more satellites .","With respect to the private wireless network, because the technology may cover small areas and provide very high-speed throughput, the private wireless network is particularly well-suited for gaming commission needs of location and identity verification for the gaming service provider products. The gaming spots enabled by networks  may include a current casino area , new areas such as swimming pools, lakes or other recreational areas , guest rooms and restaurants such as might be found in casino  or hotels  and , residential areas , and other remote gaming areas . The configuration of the overall gaming system depicted in  is intended only as an example and may be modified to suit various embodiments.","In some embodiments, the system architecture for the gaming system includes:\n\n","Each of the \u201cGame Spots\u201d or \u201cEntertainment Spots\u201d is preferably connected via the MWAN\/MAN back to central and redundant game servers. For accessing the private wireless networks , the gaming communication devices may be WiFi- or WiMax-enabled PDAs or mini-laptops, and do not have to be managed by a third-party partner.","In various embodiments, the gaming system includes a location verification feature, which is operable to permit or disable gaming from a remote location depending upon whether or not the location meets one or more criteria. A criterion may be, for example, whether the location is within a pre-defined area in which gaming is permitted by law. As another example, a criterion may be whether the location is in a no-gaming zone, such as a school. The location verification technology used in the system may include, without limitation, \u201cnetwork-based\u201d and\/or \u201csatellite-based\u201d technology. Network-based technology may include such technologies as multilateration, triangulation and geo-fencing, for example. Satellite-based technologies may include global positioning satellite (GPS) technology, for example.","As previously discussed, the cellular approach preferably includes the use of at least one cellular, mobile, voice and data network. For gaming in certain jurisdictions, such as Nevada for example, the technology may involve triangulation, global positioning satellite (GPS) technology, and\/or geo-fencing to avoid the potential for bets or wagers to be made outside Nevada state lines. In some embodiments, the network would not cover all of a particular jurisdiction, such as Nevada. For instance, the network would not cover areas in which cellular coverage for a particular base station straddled the state line or other boundary of the jurisdiction. This is done in order to permit the use of location verification to insure against the chance of bets originating or terminating outside of the state. Triangulation may be used as a method for preventing gaming from unapproved locations. Triangulation may be accomplished, for example, by comparing the signal strength from a single mobile station received at multiple base stations, each having GPS coordinates. This technology may be used to pinpoint the location of a mobile station. The location can then be compared to a map or other resource to determine whether the user of the mobile station is in an unapproved area, such as a school. Alternatively, GPS technology may be used for these purposes.","As shown in , the gaming system includes a plurality of gaming communication devices , , and . Device  is located outside the gaming jurisdiction . Devices  and  are both located inside gaming jurisdiction . However only device  is located within geo-fence , which is established by the coverage areas of a plurality of base station . Thus, geo-fencing may be used to enable gaming via device  but disable gaming via devices  and . Even though some gaming communication devices that are within the gaming jurisdiction , such as device , are not permitted access to the gaming system, the geo-fence  ensures that no gaming communication devices outside jurisdiction , such as device , are permitted access.","Geo-fencing may not specify location. Rather, it may ensure that a mobile station is within certain boundaries. For instance, geo-fencing may be used to ensure that a mobile station beyond state lines does not access the gaming system. Triangulation on the other hand may specify a pinpoint, or near-pinpoint, location. For example, as shown in , device  is triangulated between three of the base stations  to determine the location of device . Triangulation may be used to identify whether a device, such as a mobile station, is located in a specific spot where gambling is unauthorized (such as, for example, a school). Preferably, the location determination technology utilized in conjunction with various embodiments meets the Federal Communication Commission's (FCC's) Phase 2 E911 requirements. Geological Institute Survey (GIS) mapping may also be utilized to compare identified coordinates of a gaming communication device with GIS map features or elements to determine whether a device is in an area not authorized for gaming. It should be noted that any type of location verification may be used such as triangulation, geo-fencing, global positioning satellite (GPS) technology, or any other type of location determining technology, which can be used to ensure, or provide an acceptable level of confidence, that the user is within an approved gaming area.","In various embodiments, location verification is accomplished using channel address checking or location verification using some other identifying number or piece of information indicative of which network or portion of a network is being accessed by the gaming communication device. Assuming the usage of an identifying number for this purpose, then according to one method of location checking, as an example, a participant accesses the gaming system via a mobile telephone. The identifying number of the mobile telephone, or of the network component being accessed by the mobile telephone, identifies the caller's connection to the mobile network. The number is indicative of the fact that the caller is in a defined area and is on a certain mobile network. A server application may be resident on the mobile telephone to communicate this information via the network to the gaming service provider. In a some embodiments, the identifying number or information is passed from a first network provider to a second network provider. For example, a caller's home network may be that provided by the second provider, but the caller is roaming on a network (and in a jurisdiction) provided by the first provider. The first provider passes the identifying information through to the second provider to enable the second provider to determine whether the caller is in a defined area that does or does not allow the relevant gaming activity. In various embodiments, the gaming service provider either maintains, or has access to, a database that maps the various possible worldwide mobile network identifying numbers to geographic areas. Various embodiments contemplate using any number or proxy that indicates a network, portion of a network, or network component, which is being connected with a mobile telephone. The identifying number may indicate one or more of a base station or group of base stations, a line, a channel, a trunk, a switch, a router, a repeater, etc.","In various embodiments, when the user connects his mobile telephone to the gaming server, the gaming server draws the network identifying information and communicates that information to the gaming service provider. The software resident on the gaming communication device may incorporate functionality that will, upon login or access by the user, determine the user's location (based at least in part on the identifying information) and send a message to the gaming service provider. The identifying number or information used to determine location may be country-specific, state-specific, town-specific, or specific to some other definable boundaries.","In connection with any of the location determination methods, the gaming system may periodically update the location determination information. This may be done, for example, during a gaming session, at pre-defined time intervals to ensure that movement of the gaming communication device to an unauthorized area is detected during play, and not just upon login or initial access.","Thus, depending on the location determination technology being used, the decision whether to permit or prohibit a gaming activity may be made at the gaming communication device, at the gaming server, or at any of the components of the telecommunication network being used to transmit information between the gaming communication device and the gaming server (such as at a base station, for example).","An aspect of the private wireless network related to preventing gaming in unauthorized areas is the placement of sensors, such as Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) sensors on the gaming communication devices. The sensors trigger alarms if users take the devices outside the approved gaming areas. Further, the devices may be \u201ctethered\u201d to immovable objects. Users might simply log in to such devices using their ID and password.","In various embodiments, a gaming system may include the ability to determine the location of the gaming communication device within a larger property, such as a casino complex. This may allow certain functionalities of the device to be enabled or disabled based upon the location of the device within the property. For example, government regulations may prohibit using the device to gamble from the guest rooms of a casino complex. Therefore, particular embodiments may include the ability to determine the location of the device within the property and then disable the gambling functionality of the device from a guest room, or other area where gambling is prohibited.  illustrates an example of a wireless gaming system in which the location of a gaming communication device  may be determined in accordance various embodiments.","As shown in , a wireless gaming system comprises a wireless network that at least partially covers casino complex  in which one or more gaming communication devices  may be used to participate in a variety of gaming activities. The wireless network may comprise at least three signal detection devices , although various embodiments may include fewer or greater than three signal detection devices. As shown in , the wireless network comprises four signal detection devices , each located at one corner of casino complex . In various embodiments, these signal detection devices may comprise wireless access points, wireless routers, wireless base stations, satellites, or any other suitable signal detection device. Furthermore, although signal detection devices  are illustrated as being located on the boundaries of casino complex , signal detection devices may be located anywhere inside or outside of casino complex , provided the signal detection devices are operable to receive signals originating from a gaming communication device  inside casino complex . In various embodiments, signal detection devices  may also be used to transmit, as well as receive, signals to gaming communication device .","In various embodiments, casino complex  may be divided into one or more zones , which represent different areas of the casino complex, such as the lobby, guest rooms, restaurants, shops, entertainment venues, and pool areas. For example, as shown in , zone may correspond to the casino lobby, zone may correspond to guest rooms, zone may correspond to restaurants, and zone may correspond to the gaming floor of the casino. Each zone  may be further divided into one or more sub-zones , each specifying a particular location within zone . Sub-zones  may be arranged in a grid formation, each sub-zone  having a uniform size. In some embodiments, each sub-zone may comprise 9 square feet (i.e., 3 feet by 3 feet). In some embodiments, each sub-zone may comprise 100 square feet (i.e., 10 feet by 10 feet). The choice of the size of an area covered by a sub-zone may depend on administrator preferences, technical limitations of the wireless network, and governmental regulations, as well as other considerations.","Particular embodiments may use this mapping of casino complex  into a plurality of zones  and sub-zones  to determine the location of gaming communication device  within the complex. These embodiments may utilize the signal received by signal detection devices  from gaming communication device  to determine the location of the device.","In various embodiments, the location of gaming communication device  may be determined based upon the strength of the signal received by each signal detection device  from device . In various embodiments, this may be accomplished using a Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) value or any other suitable indication of signal strength. Generally, the closer a sub-zone is to a signal detection device, the stronger the signal the signal detection device will receive from a gaming communication device located in that sub-zone. Therefore, given a plurality of signal strength readings taken from different points in the casino complex (i.e., signal detection devices ), these different signal strength readings may be used to determine the location of the device.","With this in mind, each sub-zone  of casino complex  may be associated with a reference set of signal strengths received by the signal detection devices from a device located in that particular sub-zone. Typically, these values are generated, and periodically recalibrated, by taking a reference reading from a gaming communication device located that sub-zone. After each sub-zone is associated with a reference set of signal strengths, these reference signal strengths may be compared with the signal strengths received by the signal detection devices from a gaming communication device. Since each sub-zone has a unique set of signal strengths, this comparison may be used to identify the particular zone in which the gaming communication device is located.","In various embodiments, the location of gaming communication device  may be determined based upon an elapsed time between the transmission of the signal from device  and the receipt of the signal by each signal detection device . In various embodiments, this elapsed time may be determined based on a Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA), or any other suitable technology. As before in the case of signal strengths, each sub-zone  may be associated with a predetermined, or reference, set of elapsed times from transmission to receipt of a signal from a gaming communication device. This set of elapsed times will be different for each sub-zone of the casino complex, as the time it takes a signal to reach each signal detection device will depend on the proximity of the sub-zone to each base station. By comparing the time from transmission to receipt of a signal received by the signal detection devices from a gaming communication device, the sub-zone in which the device is located may be determined.","Once the location of the gaming communication device has been determined, particular embodiments may then enable and\/or disable particular functions of the device based on this determination. For example, as mentioned previously, particular embodiments may disable the gaming communication device's gambling functionality from a user's guest room, while still allowing the user to use other device functions, such as purchasing merchandise or services, or buying tickets to an entertainment event. Once the user leaves his or her guest room, the gambling functionality of the gaming communication device may be enabled. Similarly, particular embodiments may prevent the gaming communication device from being used to make financial transactions from the casino floor. Once the user leaves the casino floor, such functionality may be enabled. Similarly, other functionalities of the gaming communication device may be enabled or disabled based upon the location of the device within the property in accordance with various embodiments.","In various embodiments, the various functionalities of the gaming communication device may be enabled or disabled based upon the zone  in which the device is located. In such embodiments, each zone  of the casino complex may be associated with a set of allowed activities. For example, the \u201clobby\u201d zone of the casino complex may have all activities allowed, while the \u201cguest room\u201d zone of the property may have all activities allowed except gambling. Based upon the gaming communication device's location, the functionality of the gaming communication device may be limited to the set of allowed activities for the zone in which the device is located. As the gaming communication device travels from zone to zone, the location of the device may be re-determined, and the functionality of the device may be updated to reflect the set of allowed activities for the zone in which the device is now located.","Various embodiments may also use the location determination to send location-specific information to the gaming communication device. For example, a reminder that an entertainment event to which the user has tickets is about to begin may be sent to the user's device if the device (and therefore the user) is located in a different part of the casino complex.","In another embodiment, a user may be alerted that the user's favorite dealer is on the casino floor if the user is located in his or her guest room.","In various embodiments, the location of the gaming communication device may be used to deliver goods and services purchased or ordered by the user of the device. For example, in various embodiments, the user may purchase food and beverages using the device. The location of the device may then be used to deliver the food and beverages to the user, even if the user relocates to another sub-zone after placing his or her order.","The determination of the gaming communication device's location may also be used to provide the user with directions to another part of the casino complex. For example, a user that is located on the casino floor that wishes to go to a specific restaurant within the complex may be given direction based upon his or her location. These directions may then be updated as the user progresses towards his or her desired location. In the event the user gets off-course, the location determination, which may be updated during the user's travel, may be used to alert the user that he\/she has gotten off-course and then plot a new course to the desired destination.","It should be understood that the foregoing descriptions encompass but some of the implementation technologies that may be used, according to various embodiments. Other technologies may be used and are contemplated, according to various embodiments. Various embodiments may be performed using any suitable technology, either a technology currently existing or a technology which has yet to be developed.","User Profiles","According to various embodiments, the wireless gaming system can incorporate a user profile element. One or more user profiles may be created, maintained, and modified, for example, on one or more of the servers of the gaming system. Generally, the user profiles include information relating to respective users. The information may be maintained in one or more databases. The information may be accessible to the gaming server and\/or to one or more mobile devices. The devices which may access the information may, according to certain embodiments, include gaming devices or gaming management devices. Gaming management devices may include wireless devices used by casino staff to provide gaming services or gaming management services.","Various embodiments include software and\/or hardware to enable the provision, modification, and maintenance of one or more user profiles. Thus, one or more user profiles may each comprise a set of data maintained in a data storage device. The data set(s) for each respective user profile may reflect any of a number of parameters or pieces of information, which relate to the particular user(s) corresponding to the profile(s). Although not intended to be exhaustive, such information may include, for example, gaming activity preferences, such as preferred game and\/or game configuration, preferred screen configuration, betting preferences, gaming location preferences, dining and other service preferences, and so forth. The information may also include user identity information, such as name, home address, hotel name and room number, telephone numbers, social security numbers, user codes, and electronic files of fingerprint, voice, photograph, retina scan, or other biometric information. User profile information may also include information relating to the user, but not determined by the user or the user's activities. Such information may include any information associated with, or made part of, a profile. For example, an entity such as a casino, may include as part of a profile certain rules governing the distribution of promotions or offers to the user. User profile information can include any codes, account numbers, credit information, approvals, interfaces, applications, or any other information which may be associated with a user. Thus, user profile information may include any information that is particular to a given user. For example, profile information may include the location(s) at which a particular user has played, skill levels, success levels, types of games played, and betting styles, and trends of information relating to the user's activities.","In various embodiments, user profile information may include concierge or other service information that is associated with a user. Concierge services may include restaurant services, entertainment services, hotel services, money management services, or other appropriate services that may be offered to the user of a gaming device. For example, restaurant services may include, without limitation, services that allow the user to order drinks, order food, make reservations, or perform other restaurant related activities. As another example, entertainment services may include, without limitation, services that allow the user to purchase show tickets, arrange appointments or services, virtually shop, arrange transportation, or perform other entertainment related activities. Hotel services may include, for example, services that allow the user to check in, check out, make spa appointments, check messages, leave messages, review a hotel bill, or perform other guest-related activities. Money management services may include, for example, services that allow the user to transfer funds, pay bills, or perform other money management activities.","The gaming system may be configured to establish a new profile for any user who is using a gaming device for the first time. Alternatively, a new profile may be established for a prior user who has not played for a predetermined time period. The gaming system may set up the profile, monitor user activities, adjust the profile, and adjust information (such as graphics) displayed to the user. The gaming system may be configured to use the profile information to alter the presentation of gaming information to the user. For example, if a prior user has returned to the gaming system, the system may consult the profile for the user and determine that in the prior session of gaming the user lost money on craps but won money on blackjack. Based on this information, the system may adjust the default gaming screen and present a blackjack table for the user. As a further example, the profile information may indicate that the majority of the user's prior blackjack time was spent on $25 minimum tables. The system may, accordingly, make a further adjustment to the gaming environment and make the blackjack table being presented a $25 table. In this sense, the gaming system enables personalized wireless gaming based on one or more criteria maintained in a user profile.","The user profiles may be established, maintained, and periodically updated as necessary to enable a gaming provider to provide an enhanced, current, and\/or customized gaming experience. Updates may be undertaken based on any suitable trigger, such as the occurrence of an event, the occurrence of a user activity, or the passage of a certain predetermined time period. Any or all of the profile information may be updated.","Alerts","In some embodiments, the gaming system may be configured to initiate one or more alerts to one or more users based on any number of criteria. For instance, an alert may be based on the location of a user. The system may also be configured to keep track of other non-location dependent parameters. The initiation of an alert may depend on a time parameter. Gaming alerts can also be based on this and\/or other information maintained in a user profile. Alerts can be prioritized for presentation and the content and display of the alerts may be customized by the user or another entity. As a related concept, the system may be configured to provide directions and\/or maps. Another related concept involves enabling a user to view a certain activity or area remotely. The alert may be generated in response to the existence of data within a user profile. Additionally, the content and presentation of the alert may be determined based on information in the user profile. Thus, when the alerts occur and what the alerts indicate may be customized or tailored according to user preferences (or any other information maintained about the user (e.g., in a user profile).","In some embodiments, an alert may be presented or displayed to the user in a format determined, at least in part, by any of the parameters described or contemplated herein. For example, if the user is located outdoors, the display may be automatically brightened in order to allow the user to more easily view the alert. The alert may be presented in any one or a combination of textual, visual, oral, or other information exchange formats. Alerts presented to users on the screen of a gaming communication device, for example, may be configured in any desirable manner. Preferably, the information is displayed in a way as to most effectively utilize the screen real estate to convey the alert message. Thus, different alerts of differing types, or having differing priorities, can be displayed differently on the gaming device. For example, a more important alert can be displayed as a popup while secondary alerts scroll at the bottom of the screen. The player can register for alerts and determine his own particular alert configuration preferences.","According to some embodiments, directional information may be provided to one or more users. The directional information may be associated with an alert. The directional information may be based on any of the parameters described herein (e.g., profiles, alerts, locations, changes in play or other activities, etc). Directions may be given to activities, locations, seats, tables, recreational spots, restaurants, change cages, information booths, casinos, hotels, sports venues, theaters, etc. For example directions may be given to a particular table or gaming area, a casino other than the one where the user is presently located or where another user is located, a restaurant that is specified in a user profile, a sports book area of a casino, a hotel room, etc.","The directions can be presented orally, textually, and\/or graphically (e.g., as map with zoom capabilities). An example of how directions would be provided involves a user profile indicating that the user likes to play high-limit blackjack on Saturday nights, but that the user does not have a particular casino preference. If the user enters any casino for which the system is operable, the system provides the user with an alert inviting the player to the high-limit blackjack tables and directional information in the form of a visual route. Another example involves a user leaving a sports book in a casino and the user has indicated that he wants to play craps. The device gives walking directions to the craps tables. Another example involves a user that has a preferred list of dinner restaurants. At a predetermined time (e.g., 8:00 pm), the system presents the user with the list, lets the user make a selection and a reservation. The system then provides the user with verbal directions from the user's current location to the selected restaurant. The system may also be configured to provide ancillary information based, at least in part, on the alert, the profile, or the directional information being provided. For example, the system may notify a user that the user will need a cab, or will need to take the tram, or will need a jacket and tie, or will need an umbrella, etc. depending on where the user is going and the route he is taking.","According to various embodiments, the system enables a user to view a certain activity or area remotely. For example, cameras (or other viewing devices) may be disposed throughout a casino property (or other relevant area). At kiosks, or on the wireless gaming devices, users can \u201cpeek\u201d into one or more selected areas to see the activity in the selected area(s). For example, from the pool, a user can tell if the craps tables have changed limits or are filling up with people. From the craps table, a user can see if the restaurant or bar is becoming crowded.","According to various embodiments, the operation of the alerts module and the alerts methods are integrated with various techniques for managing user profile information. An example of this aspect is that the system may be configured to recognize that a user has certain preferred dealers or stickmen when playing certain casino games. When those dealers or stickmen are on duty, and if the user is located in a certain area, or within a certain distance, an alert may be sent inviting the user to participate in the gaming activity at the particular table where the dealer or stickman is on duty.","Thus, when user profile information indicates that a one or more predetermined criteria are met, the system may send an alert to the corresponding user or to another user. For example, the system may \u201clearn\u201d that a player is a fan of certain sports teams. The system monitors information about upcoming events that involve those teams and, at a predetermined time, checks to see if the user has placed a bet on the event(s). If not, the system invites the user to visit a sports book to make a bet. As another example, the system knows a user prefers $10 minimum tables and alerts the user to the opening of a seat at such a table. As another example, the alerts can be triggered by information which is not directly related to or associated with the particular user (e.g., non-user specific information). For instance an alert might be triggered by a certain time or the occurrence of a certain event (e.g., the odds given on a certain sports event changing by a certain predetermined amount).","Service Applications","According to various embodiments, gaming services may be provided as an application add-on to a pre-existing communication or data service. Thus, gaming service applications may be made available to customers of a pre-existing communication or data service. For example, customers of a particular wireless telephone or data service may be offered any one or combination of the various gaming service applications discussed herein as an additional feature that is bundled with the telephone or data service. Although this document may refer to the communication service bundled with offered gaming service applications as including pre-existing communication services, it is recognized that the gaming services applications may be offered and accepted as part of a package with newly-activated communications service plan. In still other embodiments, the gaming service may be established first and the communication service may be added later.","The gaming service applications bundled with, or otherwise offered in conjunction with communication services, may be customized to meet the needs of the customers, service providers, or both. For example, a service provider may elect to make certain gaming service applications available to only a subset of the service providers' customers. Accordingly, not all customers associated with a service provider may be offered gaming services. As an another example of customized gaming service applications, a communication service may offer customers a number of gaming service plans which may provide different levels of service. For example, certain services such as advertisement services and\/or promotional services may be free to customers of the communications service. Such levels of service may be customer-selected, service provider-selected, or both.","Customers may be billed separately for add-on gaming services, or in conjunction with the invoice the customer already receives for the pre-existing communications service. For instance, in certain embodiments, gaming services may be billed as an add-on in the same way that Caller ID services, call waiting services, and call messaging services result in fees that are in addition to the basic fees associated with communication services.","Peer-to-Peer Wireless Gaming","According to various embodiments, gaming services enable peer-to-peer wireless gaming. Specifically, the system may enable multiple players to participate in the same gaming activity at the same time from dispersed locations. This may be particularly desirable in the case of certain games such as, but without limitation, horse racing, poker, and blackjack. The system may also enable a single player to participate in multiple positions with respect to a particular game. For example, a user may be permitted to play multiple hands of blackjack. Particular aspects include such features as providing assistance to a user in finding a particular activity. For example, a first player may want to play poker at a six-person table. The gaming system may be used to identify such a poker table that has a position available for the first user's participation. Additionally or alternatively, a first player might want to play poker at the same table as a second player, and the system may be configured to assist the first player in finding a game in which the second player is already participating.","Location determination techniques may be incorporated to enable peer-to-peer gaming or related services. For example, a \u201cbuddy network\u201d may be established to track members of a selected group. For example, a group of friends might all be in a gambling jurisdiction but be located at various dispersed places within that jurisdiction. The gaming system allows the establishment of a private buddy network of peers for this group of friends. The system enables one or more members of the group to track one or more other members of the group. In various embodiments, the system may also allow messages from and to one or more group members. For example, the system also allows members to invite other members to participate in certain wireless gaming activities. Additionally or alternatively, the system may allow members of the group to bet on the performance of another member of the group who is participating in a virtual or actual game.","Location determination techniques may also be incorporate to establish an \u201calert system.\u201d The alert system may be used to invite certain types of players to participate in a gaming activity. Criteria may then be used to identify users of gaming devices that meet the criteria. For example, a gaming participant may wish to initiate a gaming activity with other users of gaming devices that qualify as \u201chigh rollers\u201d or \u201chigh stakes gamers.\u201d As other examples, a celebrity user may wish to initiate a gaming activity with other celebrities, or a senior citizen may wish to initiate a gaming activity with other senior citizens. In each instance, the user may identify criteria that may then be used to identify other gaming participants that meet these criteria for the initiation of a peer-to-peer gaming event.","It should be understood that the foregoing descriptions encompass but some of the implementation technologies that may be used, according to various embodiments. Other technologies may be used and are contemplated, according to various embodiments. Various embodiments may be performed using any suitable technology, either a technology currently existing or a technology which has yet to be developed.","Gaming and Wireless System","Various embodiments include a gaming system including hand-held personal gaming devices.

The gaming system further includes a payment transaction server for validating payment and establishing entitlement of a player to play a game via the portable gaming device as provided by the game server.","In various embodiments, the gaming system includes one or more stationary gaming machines or other devices capable of printing tickets having a value associated therewith. The portable gaming device includes a ticket reader for reading ticket information for use by the payment transaction server in verifying the associated value for permitting the player to play the game.","In one or more embodiments, the portable gaming devices communicate with other devices (such as the game server) via a wireless communication channel. Appropriate relays and transceivers are provided for permitting the wireless communication.","In one or more embodiments, the portable gaming device includes a plurality of interfaces for changing the configuration of the gaming device or interacting with one or more transaction servers. In some embodiments, a login interface is provided for receiving login information regarding a user of the device. In various embodiments, the number of interfaces or other functions or features displayed or permitted to be accessed are configured depending upon the user of the device. In the event a gaming representative identifies himself, interfaces permitting access to a variety of control functions may be provided. In the event a player identifies themselves, such control functions may not be accessible, but instead only consumer-related functions may be accessible such as game play.","In one or more embodiments the gaming system includes one or more transaction servers, such as a food transaction server. Using an interface of the portable gaming device a player or other user may request services from the food transaction server. For example, a player may request food, drink, a restaurant reservation or other service.","One or more embodiments comprise a method of playing a game via a portable gaming device associated with a gaming network. In some embodiments, a player obtains a portable gaming device, such as by checking out the device from the hostess station of a restaurant or the front desk of a hotel\/casino. The player provides value to the gaming operator, such as a credit card or cash deposit. This value is associated with the server and matched with a ticket number, player tracking number or other identifier.","The game device is configured for player play using the login interface. The act of logging in may be performed by the player or the gaming operator. The player next establishes entitlement to obtain services, such as the playing of a game, by showing the existence of value. In some embodiments, the player scans his ticket using the ticket reader of the device. The scanned information is transmitted to the payment transaction server for verifying entitlement of the player to play a game or obtain other services. In the event the entitlement is verified, then the player is permitted to engage in the play of a game or request service.","In the event a player wishes to play a game, the player indicates such by selecting a particular game using a game play interface. Upon receipt of such an instruction, the game server generates game data and transmits it to the personal gaming device. The transmitted data may comprise sound and video data for use by the personal gaming device in presenting the game. The player is allowed to participate in the game by providing input to the game server through the personal gaming device. The game server determines if the outcome of the game is a winning or losing outcome. If the outcome is a winning outcome, an award may be given. This award may be cash value which is associated with the player's account at the payment transaction server. If the outcome is a losing outcome, then a bet or wager placed by the player may be lost, and that amount deducted from the player's account at the transaction server.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0459","num":"0478"},"figref":"FIG. 29"},"As illustrated, the gaming system B includes a plurality of gaming machines B, B, B, B, B, B, B, B, B, B.

In the event the player elects to replace any card, that instruction is transmitted to the game server B which then randomly generates or selects replacement cards. The replacement card data is transmitted to the PGD B and images of the replacement cards are displayed.","In the event the hand of five cards (including any replacement cards) is determined by the game server B to comprise a predetermined winning hand, then the player may be paid a winning amount. If not, then the player loses his bet or ante. This step comprises step B of the method, that of determining the outcome of the game.","If the outcome is a winning outcome, then the player may be paid a winning by crediting the player's account through the EZ pay server B. In that event, the player's credits value as displayed is updated to reflect the player's winnings.","A player may then elect to play the game again, play a different game, or select one or more other services offered. In some embodiments, a \u201creturn to main menu\u201d button or the like may be displayed to the player at all times, permitting the player to return to a display including the various interfaces B.","In some embodiments, when the player has completed use of the PGD B, the player returns the PGD B to the gaming operator. For example, the player may return the PGD B to a cashier cage or a game service operator. In various embodiments, the game service operator or other party then issues the player a ticket for any credit or value which remains in the player's account. The PGD B may then be deactivated so that it readied for use by another player. In some embodiments, the PGD B may be deactivated by turning its power off. In some embodiments, a \u201clogout\u201d interface or option may be provided which causes the PGD B to return to a default state seeking the login of a player or user.","The PGD B may be used by a game service operator. Several examples of a method of such use are detailed below in conjunction with .","When a game service representative contacts a game player seeking a game service in the game playing area B (see ), the game service representative uses an appropriate game service interface on the display screen of the PGD B, as described with reference to , to provide the game service requested by the game player. For example, when a game player requests an EZ pay ticket validation, the game service representative brings the EZ pay ticket validation interface onto the display screen of the PGD B using menus available on the display screen B. Then, the game service representative scans the EZ pay ticket using a ticket reader connected to the PGD B to obtain unique ticket information. Next, the PGD B sends an EZ pay ticket validation request using the wire-less communication interface to the EZ pay server B.","In various embodiments, the ticket validation request is composed of one or more information packets compatible with the wire-less communication standard being employed. Using a wireless link B, the one or more information packets containing the ticket validation request are sent to the transceiver B connected to the EZ pay server. The transceiver B is designed to receive and send messages from the one or more PGDs B in the game playing area B in a communication format used by the PGDs. Depending on the location of the PGD B in the game playing area B, the communication path for the information packets to and from the PGD B may be through one or more wire-less communication relays including B and B. For example, when the PGD B is located near gaming machine B, the communication path for a message from the PGD B to the EZ pay server B may be from the PGD B to the relay B, from the relay B to the relay B, from the relay B to the transceiver B and from the transceiver B to the EZ pay server B. As the location of the PGD B changes in the game playing area B, the communication path between the PGD B and the EZ pay server B may change.","After receiving an EZ pay ticket validation reply from the EZ pay server B, the EZ pay ticket may be validated using an appropriate display screen on the PGD B. After cashing out the ticket, the game service representative may send a confirmation of the transaction to the EZ pay server B using the PGD B.

The receipt may be generated from a portable printer carried by the game server representative that may be connected to the PGD B in some manner or the receipt may be generated from a printer B at a fixed location, etc.","After providing a number of game services comprising a number of game service transactions to different game players in the game playing area B using the PGD B, a game service representative may log-off of the PGD B and return it to location for secure storage. For example, at the end of a shift, the game service representative may check the PGD B at some of the locations, the device is unassigned to the particular game service representative and then may be assigned to another game service representative. However, before the PGD B is assigned to another game service representative, the transaction history stored on the PGD B may be reconciled with a separate transaction history stored on a transaction server such as the EZ pay server B.","The assigning and unassigning of the PGD B to a game service representative and the transaction reconciliation are performed for security and auditing purposes. Another security measure which may be used on the PGD B is a fixed connection time between the PGD B and a transaction server. For example, after the PGD B has been assigned to a game service representative and the game service representative has logged on the PGD B, the PGD B may establish a connection with one or more transaction servers including the EZ pay server B, a server B, a server B, or a server B. The connection between a transaction server and the PGD B allows the PGD B to send information to the transaction server and receive information from the transaction server. The length of this connection may be fixed such that after a certain amount of time the connection between the PGD B and the transaction server is automatically terminated. To reconnect to the transaction server, the login and registration process must be repeated on the PGD B.","A transaction server may provide one or more game service transactions. However, the PGD B may connect with multiple transaction servers to obtain different game service transactions. For example, server B may be a prize transaction server allowing prize service transactions and server B may be a food transaction server allowing food service transactions. When a game service representative receives a prize service request from a game player, the PGD B may be used to contact the prize transaction server B using a wire-less communication link between the PGD B and a transceiver B connected to the prize transaction server B. Similarly, when a game service representative receives a food service request from a game player, the PGD B may be used to contact the food transaction server B using a wire-less communication link between the PGD B and a transceiver B connected to the food transaction server B.","The different transaction servers including the servers B, B, B, B may be on separate networks or linked in some manner. For example, server B is connected to network B, server B is connected to network B, server B is connected to network B, and server B is connected to network B. In this embodiment, a network link B exists between network B and network B. Thus, server B may communicate with server B via the network link B. A communication link between different servers may allow the servers to share game service transaction information and allow different communication paths between the PGDs and the transaction servers. Likewise, a network link B exists between network B and network B, permitting the game server to communicate with the EZ pay server B.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0529","num":"0548"},"figref":"FIG. 33","b":["500","24","505","510","24","102","515"]},"In a step B, the transaction information obtained in step B is validated as required. For example, when a player attempts to cash out an award ticket, the information from the award is validated to ensure the ticket is both genuine (e.g. the ticket may be counterfeit) and has not already been validated. The validation process may require a number of transfers of information packets between the PGD B and the transaction server. The details of the validation process for an award ticket validation are described with reference to . When the transaction information is valid, in a step B, a game service transaction is provided. For example, a room reservation may be made for a player requesting an accommodation service. A confirmation of the game service transaction may be sent to the transaction server for transaction reconciliation in a step B. In one or more embodiments, the method may include the step of generating a receipt regarding the game service transaction.","In a step B, after providing the service, a game player may request another game service. When a game player requests an additional game service, the game service representative returns to step B and selects an appropriate interface for the game service. When a game player does not request an additional service and it is not the end of a shift, in a step B, the game service representative returns to step B and contacts a new game player. In a step B, when a shift has ended, the game service representative logs out of the PGD B and checks the device at a secure location so that the PGD may be assigned to a different game service representative. In step B, before the PGD B is assigned to a different game service representative, a transaction history reconciliation is performed to ensure that the transaction history stored on the PGD is consistent with the transactions previously confirmed with a transaction server during the game service representative's shift. The transaction history on the PGD B may be stored on a removable memory storage device on the PGD. Thus, the memory may be removed from the device for transaction reconciliation and replaced with a new memory. Thus, the device with the new memory may be assigned to a new game service representative while the transaction history from the previous game service representative assigned to the device is reconciled.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0532","num":"0551"},"figref":["FIG. 34","FIG. 29"],"b":["600","24","605","34","36","34","36","610","615"]},"In a step B, the CVT B,B sends back a reply with context information to the server. As an example, the context information may be the time and place when the ticket was issued. The information from the CVT to the server may be sent as one or more data packets according to a communication standard shared by the CVT and server. In a step B, after receiving the validation reply from the CVT, the server marks the pay request pending and sends a pay order to the PGD B. While the pay request is pending, the server will not allow another ticket with the same information as the ticket with the pay request pending to be validated.","In a step B, the game service representative may choose to accept or reject the pay order form the server. When the game service representative accepts the pay order from the server, in a step B, the PGD B sends a reply to the transaction server confirming that the transaction has been performed. The transaction server marks the request paid which prevents another ticket with identical information from being validated. In a step B, the server sends a confirmation to the CVT which allows the CVT to mark the request from pending to paid. When the game service representative rejects the pay order from the server, in a step B, the PGD B sends a reply to the server to mark the pay request from pending to unpaid. When the ticket is marked unpaid, it may be validated by another PGD B or other validation device. In a step B, the server sends the reply to the CVT to mark the pay request from pending to unpaid which allows the ticket to be validated.","In one or more embodiments, a ticket may be used to provide credit\/value for establishing entitlement to a service or a good, such as the right to play a game or obtain food. The PGD B may include a card reader B. In such an arrangement, a user of the PGD B may use a credit card or other magnetic stripe type card for providing credit\/value. In various embodiments, the PGD B may include one or more other types of devices for obtaining\/receiving information, such as a smart card reader. In such arrangements, the PGD B device may read information from the credit card, smart card or other device. These cards may comprise the well known credit or debit cards. This information may be used to provide the credit\/value. In the example of a credit card, the user's account information may be read from the card and transmitted from the PGD B to the controller B. Credit card\/credit validation information may be associated with a credit card server (not shown). This credit card server may be associated with a bank or other entity remote from the casino or place of use of the PGD B and the controller B. A communication link may be provided between the controller B and remote server for sending credit card information there over.","In some embodiments, when a player utilizes a smart card or credit card the amount of associated credit or value may be transmitted to the EZ Pay server B, and then the credited amount may be treated in exactly the same manner as if the credit\/value had been provided by a ticket. When a player wishes to cash out, the EZ Pay server B has a record of the original amount credited and the amounts of any awards, losses or payments, and may then issue the player a ticket representing the user's total credit.","In accordance with various embodiments, a gaming system is provided which includes one or more portable gaming devices. The portable gaming devices permit a player to play one or more games at a variety of locations, such as a hotel room, restaurant or other location. These locations may be remote from traditional gaming areas where free-standing, generally stationary gaming machines are located.","In one or more embodiments, a player may use the portable gaming device to not only play games, but obtain other products and services. In addition, in one or more embodiments, the portable gaming device may be used by game service representatives to perform a variety of functions and provide a variety of services to a player.","It should be understood that the foregoing descriptions encompass but some of the implementation technologies that may be used, according to various embodiments. Other technologies may be used and are contemplated, according to various embodiments. Various embodiments may be performed using any suitable technology, either a technology currently existing or a technology which has yet to be developed.","Wireless Interactive System","According to various embodiments, a wireless interactive gaming system includes one or more wireless gaming devices, a receiver, and a central processor. The wireless interactive gaming system may also include a terminal which is in communication with the central processor.","In a gaming environment that employs a wireless interactive gaming system, a player may receive a wireless gaming device from a game official who represents a gaming establishment or the \u201chouse\u201d. The wireless gaming device is capable of receiving wager information as commands entered by the player and transmitting the received wager information along with identification information to the receiver by wireless transmission.","The wireless interactive gaming system may support a number of wireless gaming devices within one gaming establishment. In some embodiments, the range for the wireless transmission from a wireless gaming device may be up to 100 feet.

The wireless gaming device may include any number, e.g. from 5 to 20, of buttons in a keypad-type arrangement. Buttons may be marked with the digits 0 through 9 and may also include a \u201c$\u201d (dollar sign) key and an \u201center\u201d key, so that the player may easily input wager information. In various embodiments, the wireless gaming device includes at least eight player selection buttons (e.g., digits) and at least five special function buttons, (e.g., to request the player's balance). In various embodiments, the player can input some or all of the wager information into the wireless gaming device by swiping a smart card, which contains a microprocessor chip or a magnetic stripe with encoded information, through a smart card reader on the wireless gaming device.","In various embodiments, the wireless gaming device may include an identifier. The identifier may be, e.g., a series of alphanumeric characters, a bar code, or a magnetic stripe affixed to the device. In various embodiments, the identifier may be a digital code stored in a secure memory, e.g., an electronically erasable programmable read only memory (EEPROM). The identifier may thus be readable directly by the game official if it is a series of alphanumeric characters, or it may be read automatically by a bar code reader or a magnetic stripe reader. In various embodiments, the identifier may be programmed in EEPROM or read from EEPROM through an RS-232 port, which may be directly connected to encoder and decoder circuitry in a terminal.","A wireless gaming device may store an encryption key. The encryption key may be used to encrypt information that is transmitted to the receiver from the device. Encryption of the information transmitted to the receiver may limit tampering with the wireless gaming device and may prevent unauthorized or counterfeit devices from being used with the system.","In various embodiments, the encryption key may be stored in the EEPROM. The EEPROM may have the advantage of being a memory device which is difficult to access if the appropriate encoding circuitry is not available. Thus, it is contemplated that the encoding circuitry that downloads the encryption key into the device may be securely held by the game official.","Alternately, the encryption key stored in the EEPROM may be updated and changed for each player who receives a wireless gaming device by directly connecting the device to encoding and decoding circuitry in the terminal through a port at the time the wireless gaming device is delivered to the player. Moreover, other digital information related to the game being played may be downloaded from the terminal to the EEPROM through a direct connection with the wireless gaming device.","In various embodiments, a microprocessor controls the operation of a wireless gaming device. The microprocessor receives digital wager information entered by the player using buttons or keys of the wireless gaming device. The microprocessor stores an identification code associated with the wireless gaming device that is a digital equivalent of the identifier of the wireless gaming device. The microprocessor also executes software applications for encrypting the identification code and the player's wager information for transmission to the receiver. The software contains an algorithm that encrypts a data packet including the identification code and wager information using the encryption key.","In various embodiments, a wireless gaming device has a unique address, i.e. identification code, for communications with the receiver and stores a player identification that is programmed into the device by the central processor. The wireless gaming device may include a wager amount register, which is maintained and updated using the keys on the device. The value stored in the wager amount register may be included in transmissions from the device to the central processor. The value of the wager amount register may default to a predetermined value, e.g. $1, when the device is initialized, and can be further adjusted by the player. The wireless gaming device may also include an account balance register, which is maintained in the device and is updated by the central processor periodically. The value of the account balance register should default to $0 when the device is initialized.","The wireless gaming device may include player function keys. The player function keys may be used to accomplish the following functions:\n\n","The firmware of the wireless gaming device may only allow for one press of buttons or keys every 100 ms. In various embodiments, key presses are not queued; thus, when a key press message is queued to be sent, no other player input is accepted until the queued message has been sent.","The wireless gaming device may include a transmitter. The transmitter may receive encrypted digital information from the microprocessor and convert it to a signal for wireless transmission to the receiver. The transmitter transmits signals wirelessly, e.g., using radio frequency signals or infrared signals. Communications between the receiver and the wireless gaming device may be asynchronous at 2400 bits per second.","The wireless gaming device may include an identifying circuit that drives the transmitter to periodically send an identification signal to the receiver. The use of the identifying circuit permits the receiver and the central processor to be assured that the wireless gaming device is still active, functioning and present in the gaming establishment. Thus, if the wireless gaming device were removed from the gaming establishment, the receiver and central processor would no longer receive and detect the periodic identification signal sent by the identifying circuit and the transmitter, and the game official may be alerted that the wireless gaming device has been removed from the gaming establishment.","The wireless gaming device may contain a real-time clock that permits the microprocessor to monitor the current time and date. The clock may consist of a timing circuit. The microprocessor can use the time and date information obtained from clock to perform calculations and other functions based on the current time and date.","The wireless gaming device may also include a tag, such as an electronic or magnetic component, which activates an alarm when passed through a sensing apparatus located at the entrance and\/or exit of the gaming establishment. Activation of the alarm by passing the wireless gaming device with the tag through the sensing apparatus notifies the game official of an attempted removal of the wireless gaming device from the gaming establishment.","The wireless gaming device may be powered by a battery source contained within the device. A portable power source such as battery source permits extended cordless operation of the wireless gaming device throughout a gaming environment. The battery source may be part of a removable, rechargeable battery pack that allows the device to be recharged when it is not in use.","In some embodiments, the wireless gaming device displays information such as game information on a device display, such as a liquid crystal display (LCD) with a back-light. The LCD can be used to display the values stored in the wager amount register and in the account balance register. The wireless gaming device may include a display receiver which receives digital information transmitted from the receiver or from the central processor.","The device may also include a bicolor light emitting diode (LED) and\/or multiple differently colored LEDs. The bicolor LED is capable of displaying at least two colors, e.g., red and green. The green light may flash each time the wireless gaming device sends a transmission to the receiver, for a period of time to ensure that it is visible to the player. The red light may illuminate when a key is pressed on the wireless gaming device, and remain lit until the transmission is received by the receiver; no additional key entry will be enabled when the red light is lit. The wireless gaming device may also include additional light emitting diodes, for example to indicate when the account balance register is being updated and the balance information is being displayed on the LCD.","The receiver is capable of receiving signals transmitted from the transmitter in the wireless gaming device. The receiver contains a decoder, which converts the received signals, e.g., into digital information. This digital information contains at least the identification code of the wireless gaming device and the player's wager information. The receiver sends the digital information obtained by the decoder to the central processor. Communications between the central processor and the receiver may be by an RS-232 electrical interface data serial communications link, with communications being asynchronous at either 9600 or 19,200 bytes per second, in various embodiments.","The receiver may receive signals from many wireless devices either simultaneously or in rapid succession, e.g., using multiplexing techniques, so that many players can place wagers using their wireless gaming devices during a short time interval. The receiver differentiates signals received from the various devices by the identification codes which are present in the signals received by the receiver.","The central processor receives the identification code of a wireless gaming device and the player's wager information from the receiver. The central processor also decrypts this information using the encryption key. The central processor is capable of receiving data from multiple wireless gaming devices in an apparently simultaneous manner.","In various embodiments, an account for the player is stored in a database of the central processor. The database stores the monetary value of the balance of the account associated with the identifier of the wireless gaming device.","The central processor manages the player's account in the database based on signals received from the player's wireless gaming device as the player places wagers and when prizes are awarded during play of the game. The central processor subtracts money from the player's account balance when the player places a wager. The player's account balance may be automatically increased by the central processor when the player wins a game on which he has placed a wager.","The central processor also stores and is capable of executing software applications containing algorithms to calculate players' account balances, wagers, and winnings. The central processor should be able to execute all of the algorithms which define the actions performed on the players' accounts during the progress of the game, as wagers are entered, as winnings paid out, and when funds are added to the players' accounts.","Algorithms in the software in the central processor may also calculate odds and payouts for certain games, such as lottery-type games, during play of the game. The odds and payouts at a particular point in time may depend on the characteristics of the game being conducted by the central processor, and may change as the game progresses. These algorithms may be executed by the central processor to provide exact calculations of the odds of specific game events occurring and the associated prizes for a player's correctly predicting the occurrence of one of those events. The algorithms may be executed continuously, so that real-time odds and payout can be calculated as the game progresses.","The central processor may perform various actions on players' accounts, resulting in various impacts on the accounts. For example, if the player wins a game, his account is credited for the payout based on his wager. If the player places a wager using the wireless gaming device, his account is debited by the amount of the wager. If the game official receives additional funds from the player, the balance of the player's account is credited by the amount of the funds. If the game official closes the player's account and disburses funds to him, the balance of the player's account is debited by the amount disbursed.","The central processor may be located in the gaming establishment that houses the receiver. In various embodiments, the central processor may be located remotely from the receiver, communicating with the receiver via electronic digital telephone communication or wireless transmission, such as a serial communication link. Additionally, the central processor may perform a multitude of functions for various receivers in a variety of gaming environments.","In some embodiments, communication among the central processor, the receiver, and the wireless gaming device involves a polling scheme. Polling enables many wireless gaming devices to communicate with a receiver without interference between them. Such a polling scheme may include the transmission of digital signals in the form of strings of hexadecimal characters. Preferably, all communications between the central processor, the receiver and the wireless gaming device are encrypted.","In such a polling scheme, hexadecimal characters may be reserved for specific control protocols. For example, an attention character is a header character used to begin all transmissions from the central processor to the receiver, and serves to delineate messages and synchronize the receipt of messages in the receiver. The same function is implied when the attention character follows in response to a message transmission. An acknowledgement character is another header character which provides acknowledgement to the transmitting device that the previous message's data has been received and verified. The acknowledgement character can also function as an attention character to begin a subsequent message. An end of message character is used to indicate the end of a transmission. Also, a complement next byte character allows for use of reserved protocol characters within a normal transmission message by avoiding a false control signal when a message data byte matches one of the control characters. When a message byte that needs to be sent matches one of the protocol control characters, the complement next byte character is sent, followed by the one's complement of the matching message byte.","Verification of received data may be accomplished using a single byte checksum of the message information. This checksum may be the one's complement of the sum of the original message data, not including the header character. If the checksum results in a value equal to one of the protocol control characters, it will be treated in accordance with the function of the complement next byte character.","In the polling scheme described above, there are three different modes of communication over the link between the central processor and the receiver. First, the central processor may send messages intended for the receiver. Second, the central processor may send messages intended for the wireless gaming device. Third, the wireless gaming device may send messages intended for the central processor. In various embodiments, messages sent by the central processor may be in the form of a character string formatted with a header character, followed by the identification code of the intended device, the command or message, an end of message character, and a checksum character. Messages received by the receiver or the wireless gaming device may be acknowledged by transmission of an acknowledgement character, but the central processor need not acknowledge messages sent from the wireless gaming devices. Messages sent by the central processor to be received by the wireless gaming device may be broadcast to all of the wireless gaming devices. A device address may be reserved as a broadcast address for all of the wireless gaming devices, and all devices will receive messages sent to this address; in this case, no acknowledgement need be returned from any of the wireless gaming devices.","Each command or message may begin with a command code to signal how the information contained in the message is to be used. Command codes for messages sent by the central processor to the receiver and the wireless gaming device include the following:","1. Send a device address list to the receiver;","2. Send account balance information to the addressed device;","3. Send command to disable the addressed device;","4. Send command to enable the addressed device.","In various embodiments, messages sent between the receiver and the wireless gaming device may be in the form of a character string formatted with a header character, followed by the identification code of the intended device, the current wager amount, the request, command or data, an end of message character, and a checksum character. Command codes for requests, commands and data sent between the receiver and the wireless gaming device include the following:","1. Read user identification;","2. Read device address;","3. Read balance register;","4. Read wager amount register;","5. Provide device status;","6. Write user identification;","7. Write device address;","8. Write balance register;","9. Write wager amount;","10. Perform self test.","These command codes may be used to program the device addresses and user identification information into the wireless gaming devices, as well as to initialize the device to the default state, i.e., the player's account balance of $0. The account balance register and the user identification may each comprise two characters, the least significant byte and the most significant byte, allowing for the use a greater range of numbers for these values.","Various embodiments include methods by which the central processor communicates with a wireless gaming device. The central processor transmits a string of hexadecimal characters, including, e.g., a header character, followed by the device's identification code, followed by a request, command or data, followed by an end of message character, followed by a checksum character. After the central processor transmits the character string, the wireless gaming device receives the string, recognizes its identification code, and executes any instructions in the string. When the central processor sends an instruction to all wireless gaming devices simultaneously, all currently active devices receive and execute the instruction. The wireless gaming device does not send an acknowledgement message to the central processor, although the receiver may receive a transmission from the wireless gaming device that the instruction was received properly. The central processor also communicates with the receiver in a similar manner, except that the receiver may send an acknowledgement message to the central processor which includes the acknowledgement control protocol character.","Similarly, the wireless gaming device communicates with the receiver and the central processor using, e.g., hexadecimal character strings. The receiver regularly and periodically polls the active wireless gaming device for information requests or wagering requests. If the player has entered a request into the wireless gaming device since the last time the wireless gaming device was polled, then the player's request will be transmitted to the receiver.","Various embodiments include methods by which the wireless gaming device receives and relays player requests to the central processor. First, the player enters a request into the wireless gaming device using buttons or keys. The player then presses a button labeled, e.g., \u201center\u201d or \u201csend,\u201d instructing the wireless gaming device to send the request the next time the receiver polls the wireless gaming device. When this button has been pressed, the red light of the bicolor LED is illuminated, thereby informing the player that the request is waiting to be sent. The request is converted into a hexadecimal character string, including, e.g., a header character, an identification code (or, alternatively, a separate identification string reserved for a specific player), the current wager amount, the player's request (e.g., to change the wager amount or to send a balance update), an end of message character, and a checksum character. The next time the receiver polls the device, the transmitter of the device transmits the character string to the receiver. When the wireless gaming device is polled by the receiver, the green light of the bicolor LED flashes, informing the player that the request has been transmitted. The receiver receives the request string, and transmits the string to the central processor. The central processor then acts on the player's request.","Using the terminal, the game official may process wagering transactions and distribute wireless gaming devices. In various embodiments, the terminal may include a bar code reader and\/or a magnetic stripe reader for rapid entry of the identifier of a wireless gaming device prior to delivering the wireless gaming device to the player. Reading devices provide information in the form of digital data to the terminal. The terminal includes a keyboard by which the game official can manually enter data to be sent to the central processor. Using either reading device, the keyboard, or a combination of these, the game official communicates with the central processor to establish a player's account, increase the balance of the account when the player tenders funds to the game official, and decrease the balance of the account when the player seeks to collect the cash value of his account balance.","The player establishes a balance of the account associated with his wireless gaming device, identified by an identifier, when he receives the wireless gaming device from the game official. The player may increase the monetary value of the balance of the account by paying additional funds, in the form of cash or credit, to the game official, who accesses the account stored in the central processor through the terminal to increase the balance of the account.","The wireless gaming device is returned to the game official after the player has played one or more games. The readers may be used to read the identifier for closing out the player's account stored in the database of the central processor. The terminal includes a terminal display which notifies the game official of the balance of the player's account, so that the player may be paid the cash value of the remaining balance of his account.","In some embodiments, an account status display device is located in the gaming establishment to display players' account information. In various embodiments, the display device may be, e.g., a liquid crystal display or a cathode ray tube display. The display device is controlled by the central processor, which sends information to the display device for display to the players.","A player may look at the display device to confirm that wagers transmitted from the wireless gaming device were received by the receiver and sent to the central processor, to determine the monetary balance of the player's account, and to verify that the player's winnings have been credited to his account. The display device displays key information necessary for a player to participate in a game. The information displayed for each player may include the account number, the player's account balance, the player's last wager, and the player's last prize award or win.","The display device is divided into specific areas, e.g., a display area, each area showing the account information for one player. The size of the display area may be determined by the size of the display device and the number of players who possess wireless display devices. It is contemplated that only active accounts will be displayed on the display device. If additional display devices are required to display the information concerning a large number of accounts, the central processor may be configured to drive multiple similar display devices.","The display device may also be used to display the odds and payouts for game wagers. Alternately, a separate display device driven by the central processor may be used to display the odds and payout information. Further, the odds and payouts may be displayed on the device display .","Procedures for using the wireless interactive gaming system, according to some embodiments, are now described. In some embodiments, a player tenders money in the form of cash or credit, e.g., $100, to a game official in the gaming establishment to establish an account. The game official chooses a wireless gaming device and uses, e.g., the bar code reader on the terminal to enter the identifier of the wireless gaming device into the terminal. The game official also inputs the amount of money tendered, i.e. $100, into the terminal via keyboard. The game official hands the wireless gaming device to the player and tells the player that his account is, e.g., Account No. 12. Alternately, the player may identify his account number directly from the identifier on the wireless gaming device. The information entered by the game official into the terminal is sent to the central processor, which establishes an account record for the player in the database.","For this example, the central processor may be conducting a racing game in which players choose a winning racing element on which to place a wager for the next racing game to be displayed in the gaming establishment. To place a wager, the player presses buttons on the wireless gaming device.","In some embodiments, the player first presses the button that corresponds to the number assigned to the racing element that he chooses, e.g., \u201c3\u201d, and then the wager amount, e.g., \u201c$\u201d and \u201c5\u201d, for a $5 wager. The player then presses the \u201center\u201d key to transmit his wager to the central processor.","In an alternate embodiment, the game may be simplified so that all wagers are placed for a fixed amount, e.g., $1, by pressing a single button on the wireless gaming device. By pressing the button that corresponds to the number assigned to the chosen racing element, e.g., \u201c3\u201d, the player places a $1 bet on racing element number 3. The player can then place a larger wager on racing element number 3, by pressing the \u201c3\u201d button the number of times corresponding to the number of $1 bets he desires to make, e.g., by pressing \u201c3\u201d five times to wager $5 on racing element number 3.","Each time the player enters a wager, the wireless gaming device forms a data packet containing the player's wager information and the identification code of the wireless gaming device. The data packet is encrypted and transmitted by the transmitter via wireless communication.","The decoder in the receiver receives the encrypted data packet transmitted by the transmitter. The encrypted data packet is sent to the central processor, where it is decrypted. The central processor uses the information it has obtained to update the player's account in the database by subtracting the wagered amount from the player's account balance and registers the player's wager on the game.","After the game has been played, the central processor awards prizes to winning players based on the wagers they have made and the odds associated with the winning outcome of the game. If the player in possession of the wireless gaming device is a winner, the central computer updates the player's account in the database by adding the monetary amount of the prize to the player's account balance. Otherwise, the player's account remains unchanged.","When the player has finished playing games in the gaming establishment, he returns the wireless gaming device to the game official. The game official again inputs the identifier of the wireless gaming device into the terminal, e.g., by using the bar code reader of the terminal. The terminal accesses the player's account information stored in the database of the central processor to obtain the player's remaining account balance. The terminal display displays the player's remaining account balance to the game official, who then tenders the monetary value of that amount to the player. The account is closed, and the transaction is recorded in the central processor.","It should be understood that the foregoing descriptions encompass but some of the implementation technologies that may be used, according to various embodiments. Other technologies may be used and are contemplated, according to various embodiments. Various embodiments may be performed using any suitable technology, either a technology currently existing or a technology which has yet to be developed.","Hand-Held Wireless Game Player","Various embodiments include a hand-held wireless game player for playing a game of chance. The hand-held wireless game player may be generally characterized as including: 1) a wire-less communication interface; 2) a display screen; 3) one or more input mechanisms; and 4) a microprocessor configured i) to present the game of chance on the display screen using operating instructions received via the wireless communication interface from a master gaming controller located on a gaming machine and ii) to send information from input signals generated from the one or more input mechanisms to the master gaming controller via the wire-less communication interface. The wireless game player may be played in a plurality of venue locations physically separate from the location of the gaming machine where the plurality of venue locations are selected from the group consisting of a keno parlor, a bingo parlor, a restaurant, a sports book, a bar, a hotel, a pool area and a casino floor area.

Also, instead of mounting the video display below the reels , , , the display may be mounted above the reels with the mirror  still oriented at approximately a forty-five degree angle relative to both the video display and the display area .","Referring back to , the slot machine  is operable to play a basic slot game with the three mechanical spinning reels , , and a bonus game triggered by a start-bonus outcome in the basic game. The number of mechanical reels may vary, for example, to include one or more additional reels. The mechanical reels may be mounted to a horizontal axis to spin vertically as shown or may, alternatively, be mounted to a vertical axis to spin horizontally. Also, instead of each column of symbols being associated with a single reel, each individual symbol may associated with a single reel such that a symbol array of nine symbols is associated with nine distinct reels. Each of five pay lines , , , , extends through one symbol on each of the three mechanical reels. The number of pay lines may be more or less than five and may have various configurations.","Generally, game play is initiated by inserting a number of coins or playing a number of credits, causing a central processing unit to activate a number of pay lines corresponding to the number of coins or credits played. As shown in , the superimposed video image  may depict instructional information prompting the player to insert coins or play credits. The player selects the number of pay lines (e.g., between one and five) to play by pressing a \u201cSelect Lines\u201d key on a button panel . The player then chooses the number of coins or credits to bet on the selected pay lines by pressing a \u201cBet Per Line\u201d key on the button panel . As shown in , the superimposed video image  may depict the activated pay lines and the number of wagered credits per pay line.","After activation of the pay lines, the reels , , may be set in motion by touching a \u201cSpin Reels\u201d key on the button panel  or, if the player wishes to bet the maximum amount per line, by using a \u201cMax Bet Spin\u201d key on the button panel . Alternatively, other mechanisms such as, for example, a lever may be used to set the reels in motion. The central processing unit uses a random number generator to select a game outcome (e.g., \u201cbasic\u201d game outcome) corresponding to a particular set of reel \u201cstop positions.\u201d The central processing unit then causes each of the mechanical reels to stop at the appropriate stop position. Symbols are printed on the reels to graphically illustrate the reel stop positions and indicate whether the stop positions of the reels represent a winning game outcome.","Winning basic game outcomes (e.g., symbol combinations resulting in payment of coins or credits) are identifiable to the player by a pay table. As shown in , the superimposed video image  may depict the pay table in response to a command by the player (e.g., by pressing a \u201cPay Table\u201d key on the button panel ). A winning basic game outcome occurs when the symbols appearing on the reels , , along an active pay line correspond to one of the winning combinations on the pay table. A winning combination, for example, could be three matching symbols along an active pay line. If the displayed symbols stop in a winning combination, the game credits the player an amount corresponding to the award in the pay table for that combination multiplied by the amount of credits bet on the winning pay line. As shown in , the superimposed video image  may highlight the winning combination(s) (e.g., \u201c7,\u201d \u201c7,\u201d \u201c7\u201d) and its associated pay line (e.g., pay line ) and depict the award for that winning combination. The video image  may further include special effects such as flashing the winning pay line(s) and\/or the award and providing explosions. The winning pay line(s) may flash, be accompanied by exploding flashes, and display a portion of the pay table. The player may collect the amount of accumulated credits by pressing a \u201cCollect\u201d key on the button panel . In one implementation, the winning combinations start from the first reel (left to right) and span adjacent reels. In an alternative implementation, the winning combinations start from either the first reel (left to right) or the third reel (right to left) and span adjacent reels","Pay Table","A game may have a pay table that defines all possible outcomes of one play of the game that can result in awarding a prize to a player.","In various embodiments, each line of the pay table defines the number of coins required to be played, the criteria that defines a win, the odds of the win criteria resulting from one play of the game and the number of coins returned by the gaming device to the player when a win is registered. In addition, a pay line may include the ability to accept a progressive prize value from the system. In various progressive gaming systems and methods this allows the game's pay line to be linked to a system controlled progressive prize.","A pay table may include a list of payouts on a slot machine or a video poker machine. The table may show for each combination of symbols and the number of coins bet, how main coins the bettor will win.","On older machines and some newer reel machines, the pay table may be listed on the face of the machine, usually above and below the area containing the wheels.","Each machine may have a table that lists the number of credits the player will receive if the symbols listed on the pay table line up on the pay line of the machine. The pay table details where the symbols must be for the bettor to be paid. In general, the symbols must be centered directly under the pay line on the machine. Video slot machines generally will only display the pay line for lines that are winners.","Some machines offer symbols that are \u2018wild\u2019 and will pay if they are visible in any position, even if they are not on the pay line. These wild symbols may also count for any other symbol on the pay table.","Most video machines display the pay table when the player presses a \u201cpay table\u201d button or touches \u201cpay table\u201d on the screen; some have the pay table listed on the cabinet as well.","Progressive","Games of chance may be described as either progressive or non-progressive. In non-progressive games, such as traditional pull-tab, participants play for a chance to win a predetermined prize, i.e., one of the winning cards. Progressive games, in contrast, involve a jackpot or prize that grows during the play of the game. Many state numbers lotteries, for instance, fall into the progressive category because the prize increases over time as more players participate. During the operation of a progressive game, a portion of each player's purchase is dedicated to the prize. Thus, the prize grows until the winning numbers are selected and the game ends. Some slot machines also offer a progressive jackpot.","In various progressive gaming systems and methods a portion of each wager is used to fund an increment to the current prize value, fund the starting value of the next prize after a win occurs, and other uses. Commonly the portion used, usually known as contributions, is determined by control data related to percentages and the coin denomination.","For example, assume a prize starts at $1,000,000 with a contribution rate of 3.5% to fund the next prize's starting value of $1,000,000 and a 2.5% contribution rate to the growth of the current prize's value. Also assume it is linked to gaming devices requiring a $2.00 wager. This means each wager contributes $0.07 (2.00*0.035=0.07) to the next prize's starting value and $0.05 (2.00*0.025=0.05) to the increment of the current prize value. With these contribution percentages there must be about 14,285,715 handle pulls, or games played, between wins for the prize's $1,000,000 starting amount to be funded. (1,000,000\/0.07=14,285,714.29). In essence the total wager amount made over the theoretical life cycle of one prize award would be $28,571,430.00 (14,285,715*2.00=28,571,430.00).","During this theoretical time period the prize value would increase by $714,285 (0.05*14,285,714.29=714,285.7145) to make the average prize value worth $1,714,285 for each theoretical win. Also assume that a marketing study has determined that to sustain player interest the prize should be won on average about once every month. This means there should be about 14,285,715 handle pulls, or games played, over a thirty day time span. If each gaming device were able to average about 5 games played each minute for 10 hours a day it would produce 3000 games played per day. If the prize were to be won every thirty days and each gaming device generates 90,000 handle pulls a month (5 games*60 minute\/hour*10 hours*30 days=90,000), there would have to be at least 159 gaming devices attached to the prize (14,285,715\/90,000=158.73 . . . ).","Linked Machines","Often machines are linked together in a way that allows a group of machines to offer a particularly large prize, or \u201cjackpot\u201d. Each slot machine in the group contributes a small amount to this progressive jackpot, which is awarded to a player who gets (for example) a royal flush on a video poker machine, or a specific combination of symbols on a regular or 9 line slot machine. The amount paid for the progressive jackpot is usually far higher than any single slot machine could pay on its own.","In some cases multiple machines are linked across multiple casinos. In these cases, the machines may be owned by the machine maker who is responsible for paying the jackpot. The casinos lease the machines rather than owning them outright. Megabucks, including Megabucks Nevada and penny Megabucks, is an example of linked machines across multiple casinos.","Central Computer, Network, and Accounting","Various embodiments include networked gaming devices. Interconnecting a plurality of gaming devices such as slot machines via a computer network to a central computer may provide advantages. Some advantages of networked gaming devices may include the ability to extract accounting data from the individual gaming devices as well as providing player tracking. Various network systems allow the central host computer to monitor the usage and payout, collectively known as audit data, of the individual gaming devices. This audit data includes data related to the number of coins or tokens inserted into the device, the number of times the device has been played, the amount paid in raises, the number and the type of jackpots paid by the machine, the number of door openings, etc. The host computer can then compile an accounting report based on the audit data from each of the individual gaming devices. This report can then be used by management, for example, to assess the profitability of the individual gaming devices.","In some areas, regulations may encourage or require a relatively detailed accounting of each video gaming machine's activity to assure that the machine operates within regulated standards. Meters are often provided to track money input into and money dispensed from the machines. Because money may sometimes be inserted to a machine but not wagered, for example where a player inserts a certain amount of cash or credit but cashes out before betting the entire amount, the simple ratio of money in to money out does not necessarily accurately reflect the machine's operational activities. Accordingly, it may be helpful to also track the amount of money wagered and the amount of money or credits won by the player.","In larger facilities such as casinos, a central computer may monitor such information for a plurality of embedded system single player gaming machines through a \u201clocation controller.\u201d Each video gaming machine serially communicates with the location controller to provide appropriate information to the central computer. If the central computer detects an irregularity regarding a particular game, it instructs the location controller to deactivate the game. An exemplary system including a location controller and embedded system circuitry at a video gaming machine for providing information to the location controller is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,429,361 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,470,079, the entire disclosure of each of these patents being hereby incorporated herein by reference for all purposes.","Reference numerals below, until otherwise specified, refer only to .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0639","num":"0667"},"figref":["FIG. 41","FIG. 41"],"b":["10","10","12","20","22","24","10","26","30","32","34","12","26","40","42","44"]},"The first network  of gaming units  may be provided in a first casino or facility, and the second network  of gaming units  may be provided in a second casino or facility located in a separate geographic location than the first facility.

The system according to various embodiments allows a casino in which the system is installed to run promotions or bonuses on any properly equipped gaming machines while simultaneously gathering player tracking and accounting data from all machines. The system provides the capability for the casino to select which of the plurality of machines are used in any given promotion. The system further allows any number of different promotions to operate simultaneously.","The system includes a plurality of gaming devices or machines connected to an associated floor controller over a network. The system includes one or more of said floor controllers. The floor controllers are interconnected by a high-speed network, such as an Ethernet network, to a database where accounting and player tracking data is stored. The system can also include pit terminals and\/or fill and jackpot processing terminals. Each promotion involves sending a reconfiguration command from the floor controller to a gaming device that has been selected to be part of a given promotion over the associated network. Upon receipt of the reconfiguration command, the gaming device reconfigures its payout schedule in accordance with the received reconfiguration command. In some embodiments, this reconfiguration includes activating a bonus payout schedule. A partial list of the promotions according may include, without limitation: a multiple jackpot wherein the gaming device reconfigures its payout to be a multiple of its default payout schedule; a bonus jackpot wherein the gaming device reconfigures its payout schedule to payout an additional bonus amount when certain conditions are met; and a progressive jackpot wherein two or more gaming devices are combined in a progressive jackpot having a progressive jackpot payout schedule. In addition to these, many other promotions are possible by the above-described system for controlling and monitoring a plurality of gaming devices.","The system may support player tracking, in some embodiments, by recording machine transactions including time of play, machine number, duration of play, coins in, coins out, hand paid jackpots and games played. The player tracking is conducted over the same network as the accounting data is extracted. This allows the provision of bonusing to certain individual players as well as during certain times. Various embodiments include a system which monitors and reports how many coins are played by each player. The system, according to various embodiments, includes the ability to record how long each player spends at each machine and the number of coins won, games played, and hand jackpots won by each player. All this information is stored on the database, which can be later analyzed for future targeted direct mailing campaigns. The player tracking according to various embodiments also allows the casino to schedule buses and other groups and measure their profitability. The system also allows for cashless play as well as advanced accounting and security features.","Bonus Game","Various embodiments include the concept of a \u201csecondary\u201d or \u201cbonus\u201d game that may be played in conjunction with a \u201cbasic\u201d game. The bonus game may comprise any type of game, either similar to or completely different from the basic game, which is entered upon the occurrence of a selected event or outcome of the basic game.","Various embodiments comprise methods of playing games, gaming devices and table games utilizing a primary game, e.g., rotatable reels, and at least one discernible indicia of a secondary game, possibly comprising a payout indicator. The secondary game may be separate from the primary game either physically or temporally.","According to various embodiments, a bonus payout indicator is clearly visible to a player and is operable when primary reels of a primary game slot machine stop on certain predetermined indicia. According to some embodiments, a secondary payout indicator is in the form of a rotatable bonus wheel which can be caused to spin automatically or in response to some action by a player, e.g., the player pushing a button, when the primary game indicates one of a predetermined plurality of indicia. The wheel is caused to gradually reduce speed and when the wheel stops, a pointer indicates the payout to be awarded to the player.","Various embodiments further comprise a discernible multiplier which provides the ability to change either the payout from the primary gaming unit or the secondary payout indicator, or both. Various embodiments contemplate providing a payout from the primary gaming unit, a payout indicated by the secondary indicator only, a payout from the primary gaming unit or the secondary indicator as changed by the multiplier, or a separate, plurality of payouts from the primary gaming unit and the secondary indicator either with or without modification by a multiplier.","According to various embodiments, the mechanical bonus payout indicator is electronically operated and is linked to a random number generator which determines where the secondary indicator actually stops.","According to various embodiments, when the primary unit stops on one of a predetermined plurality of winning indicia sets, a second event actuator is placed in an active state. According to various embodiments, a person, such as the player, must actuate the actuator in order to operate the bonus indicator.","According to various embodiments, the bonus actuator requires operator intervention so that a player must involve a casino attendant who can activate the bonus indicator.","According to another various embodiments, the bonus indicator is connected to a drive mechanism which gradually reduces the rate of spin of the bonus wheel before the bonus wheel stops.","Various embodiments comprise gaming devices having electronic means for displaying indicia of rotatable reels such as a video screen and\/or means for displaying indicia of a secondary payout indicator, such as a video screen. Various embodiments comprise methods for playing a game of chance. One method comprises the steps of displaying a first randomly selected combination of indicia, said displayed indicia selected from the group consisting of slot reels, indicia of at least one reel, indicia of at least one playing card, and combinations thereof; generating at least one signal corresponding to at least one select display of first indicia; providing at least one discernible indicia of a mechanical bonus indicator, said bonus indicator indicia indicating at least one of a plurality of possible payouts, wherein said bonus indicator indicia providing means is operatively connected to said first, standard gaming unit and actuatable in response to said signal. According to various embodiments, the discernable indicia of a mechanical bonus indicator gradually reduces the rate of movement of the mechanical bonus indicator for some period of time prior to actually providing the discernable indicia of a payout. According to another embodiment, a multiplier is provided to multiply at least one payout by a multiple which is most preferably indicated to a player. The multiple can preferably sequentially change as discernable indicia change. For example, a plurality of multiples can be synchronized with a plurality of discernable indicia on the mechanical bonus indicator such that the multiple changes as the payout indicated changes.","Various embodiments include a method of conducting a game of chance comprising the steps of providing a player with an opportunity to place a wager; displaying a randomly selected combination of indicia, said displayed indicia selected from the group consisting of reels, indicia of at least one and preferably a plurality of reels, indicia of at least one and preferably a plurality of playing cards, and combination thereof; generating at least one signal corresponding to at least one select display of said indicia; providing at least one discernible indicia of a mechanical bonus indicator, said bonus indicator indicia indicating at least one of a plurality of possible bonuses, wherein said bonus indicator indicia is in the form of a wheel or reel and is actuatable in response to said signal.","A bonus game may include another gaming machine or a random selection device which is enabled by a bonus qualifying signal from an underlying or primary gaming machine. A wide variety of bonus games, features, and devices are known some of which are set forth next.","The WHEEL OF GOLD\u2122 and WHEEL OF FORTUNE\u2122 slot casino games incorporate a single play bonusing feature. A rotating wheel is activated by the player depressing a bonus spin button when certain indicia appears on the reels of the slot game and is used to award bonus payouts in a spin of the wheel. A separate multiplier may be used to multiply the bonus payouts. After the bonus spin, play resumes in the underlying gaming machine.","In various embodiments, a bonus game involving multiple plays is presented for an underlying gaming machine such as a slot machine. Here a Bernoulli trial procedure is used to allow a player to repeatedly play a high odds bonus game (such as another slot game) and receive awards until a losing combination occurs (i.e., winning until losing). The hit rate in the bonus game is greater than 50% (possibly higher than 70%) which may result in a much lower hit rate in the underlying game. This hit rate difference causes the player to endure the low hit rate of the underlying slot game in order to qualify for the high hit rate of the bonus game. The length of the bonus game is longer when the hit rate for the bonus game is higher. This bonus feature allows a player to win each bonus game and collect winnings until the player receives a losing combination (i.e., losing until winning).","One slot machine main game is interconnected with a slot machine secondary game. The player has the option of pushing a button which debits his credit meter by the appropriate amount to play the secondary game such as another slot game. Hence, the player gambles an amount in order to play the bonus game.","Various embodiments include an electronic gaming apparatus and method therefore wherein each play in the bonus is the result of successive underlying game play. Included are an electronic primary gaming device such as a poker or a slot machine and an electronic secondary gaming device based on bingo. When a winning combination such as three queens appears in the primary game, a space in the bingo matrix is turned over to reveal a bingo symbol. Play continues on the primary game until a winning sequence occurs in the bingo game. The right to play the bingo secondary game does not occur unless the player inserts three or more coins into the primary game. Play continues until the game achieves a bingo in which case the player receives a prize.","Various embodiments include a slot machine having a jackpot feature whereby the prize value is transferred between separate jackpot displays as successive games are played. Some of the reel symbols are overprinted with a number and when that number lands on the payline, it is used to climb a ladder. The ladder enables the player to obtain one or all of the prizes in the upper portion of the slot machine. For example, if the overlaid number lands the player on a first playing level, then the player receives all three prizes. If the overlaid number lands the player on a second level, then the player can select which one of the three prizes to receive. If the player lands on a third level, then it becomes a game of skill to select which of the three prizes he selects. Finally, if the player lands on a fourth level, then the prize is randomly selected. The prize may also be randomly doubled.","Various embodiments include a plurality of slot machines interconnected to an electronic controller which displays a separate race game. Each time a particular predetermined combination of indicia appears in the display of a particular slot machine, a signal is generated from the slot machine which advances the racing element through a particular predetermined distance. If the player's horse reaches the finish line before a timer display times out, then the slot player wins an additional prize. The players are not racing against each other, but against a clock.","Various embodiments include a gaming machine including a processor operable in a basic mode and a bonus mode for controlling game play. In the basic mode, the processor operates to select a basic game outcome from among a plurality of possible basic game outcomes. The possible basic game outcomes include a start-bonus outcome the occurrence of which causes the processor to shift operation from the basic mode to the bonus mode.

In some a player may play a game through a web page (e.g., an html page, a page using AJAX, etc.). As with a conventional gaming device, Internet games may be accessed using an identification code or name to identify the specific player and retrieve that player's credit total or play history.","Bonus gaming may include employing a secondary game that will execute if the player achieves a predefined outcome associated with the base game. In many cases, the bonus game is a singular event in that the play changes to the bonus game when a certain base game outcome is achieved and the bonus game is then played to completion. For example, when the reels of a slot machine stop on certain predetermined indicia, a bonus game may be initiated by pressing a button and bonus indicator actuated to display a randomly determined bonus award. In various embodiments, the bonus game is a more sequential event in that progress through the bonus game is determined by continued play in the base game.","In some bonus game embodiments, the possible primary game outcomes include a special symbol combination that causes a computer processor to generate a bonus game resource exercisable in the bonus game. For example, one or more bonus game resources can be used to override the end-bonus outcome and thereby allow the play of the bonus game to continue.","Various embodiments allow the player to have further interaction in the bonus game by providing a touch screen where the player can select objects by touching the screen positions. Various values are then revealed to the player until an end-bonus outcome is encountered.","In various embodiments, bonus gaming may be conducted through a plurality of networked, or linked, gaming devices such that the secondary gaming activity might involve a plurality of players wagering on base games at separate gaming devices. Various bonus games may allow a player to compete with a plurality of other players for a secondary prize. In various embodiments, a bonus game may include one or more contestants in a race. In one embodiment, each player wagering at a primary gaming unit may be represented by a particular contestant in the race. The contestant representing a particular player advances in the race according to the represented player's gaming activity at the primary gaming unit. The race ends upon a contestant finishing or upon the expiration of a predetermined amount of time, whichever comes first.","Various embodiments include a system of linked gaming devices wherein the generation of certain symbols at each gaming device is used to build up a pooled bonus value. A bonus award is then awarded to the player that causes the accumulated bonus value to meet or exceed a predetermined value.","Various gaming systems may include progressive systems in which the bonus award amount increments as base games are played on individual or linked gaming devices. In various progressive systems, a game controller is connected to a plurality of machines. A win is generated approximately every one half minute (every eight handle pulls), adding to the progressive bonus pool. Accordingly, the value of the progressive bonus rapidly increments.","Various gaming systems and methods for providing a bonus game allow players to compete directly against another player or for the players to act in collaboration with one another to win a prize.","Virtual Reel","A game apparatus having a plurality of reels mounted for rotation about an axis and which can be set into motion by the pulling of a lever.

However, to free up the CPU for other tasks, the local microcontroller performs low-level reel driver operations related to the rotation of the reel. The low-level reel driver operations may, for example, include sampling a state of the reel in real time, performing calculations, and responding with control changes.","Fixed Pool Games","A fixed pool game may include a game in which a specified amount of money or prizes (the prizes having calculable monetary equivalents) are distributed into a set of individually purchasable and winnable units, where each individual unit has a known cost, and where the set further includes purchasable units having no prize. Thus, the total amount of prizes, the prize distribution (i.e., the number of prizes at each level), and the total return if all individually purchasable units are sold are known at the game's outset.","The individually purchasable units may be generated and distributed as tickets. Two forms of tickets may include pull tab tickets, which may be called pull tabs, and scratch-off tickets, which may be called scratchers. Pull tab tickets may be constructed from paper of various thickness, having two layers. The first layer may have some type of indication of the purchasers' winnings, if any, and the second layer may cover the first. The second layer may be glued to the first layer around three edges, covering the results. The fourth edge may have a small tab, allowing the purchaser to grab hold of it. The tab, upon being pulled, pulls the layers apart and reveals the purchasers' winnings, if any. Scratchers may use an opaque material that covers portions of the ticket, where the covered portions have the predetermined results on them. The purchaser scrapes off the opaque material, revealing any winnings.","The distribution of the total winnings, coupled with the cost of each individually purchasable unit, is determined by those making up the game. The exact mechanics and mathematics of each game pool depends on the goals of the issuer, including the target play audience (how much to charge per purchasable unit or ticket or play), the desired return on investment, and size of the pool, as well as other considerations. The tickets (individually purchasable units) for the entire game are then printed and distributed, and may be organized into decks with different decks sold to different locations. Players, by purchasing a ticket, are buying one individually purchasable unit from the overall ticket or game event pool.","This may be referred to as a fixed-pool lottery, meaning there is a fixed pool of tickets (or results) having a predetermined number of winners and losers, and a purchaser takes a chance on getting a winning result by entering the \u201clottery\u201d, meaning taking the chance they will buy a winning ticket from the pool.","Fixed-pool lottery based games may be displayed in many ways. For example, such games may be displayed as a poker hand, in order to mimic actual poker play.","The player may bet a certain amount to play the game. This corresponds to an individually purchasable unit (note that different betting amounts may participate in different fixed-pool lotteries) for the lottery being used. The game may then get the result of a random drawing from a central server or location having several operating pools. The result may be sent back to the game machine.

Although there are many types of playing cards that are played in many different types of games, the most common type of playing cards consists of 52 cards, divided out into four different suits (namely Spades, Hearts, Diamonds and Clubs) which are printed or indicated on one side or on the face of each card. In the standard deck, each of the four suits of cards consists of 13 cards, numbered either two through ten, or lettered A (Ace), K (King), Q (Queen), or J (Jack), which is also printed or indicated on the face of each card. Each card will thus contain on its face a suit indication along with a number or letter indication. The King, Queen, and Jack usually also include some sort of design on the face of the card, and may be referred to as picture cards.","In some cases, the 52 card standard playing deck also contains a number of extra cards, sometimes referred to as jokers, that may have some use or meaning depending on the particular game being played with the deck. For example, if a card game includes the jokers, then if a player receives a joker in his \u201chand\u201d he may use it as any card in the deck. If the player has the ten, jack, queen and king of Spades, along with a joker, the player would use the joker as an Ace of Spades. The player will then have a Royal Flush (ten through Ace of Spades).","Many different games can be played using a standard deck of playing cards. The game being played with the standard deck of cards may include other items, such as game boards, chips, etc., or the game being played may only need the playing card deck itself. In most of the games played using a standard deck of cards, a value is assigned to each card. The value may differ for different games.","Usually, the card value begins with the number two card as the lowest value and increases as the numbers increase through ten, followed in order of increasing value with the Jack, Queen, King and Ace. In some games the Ace may have a lower value than the two, and in games where a particular card is determined to be wild, or have any value, that card may have the greatest value of all. For example, in card games where deuces, or twos, are wild, the player holding a playing card containing a two can use that two as any other card, such that a nine and a two would be the equivalent of two nines.","Further, the four different suits indicated on the cards may have a particular value depending on the game. Under game rules where one suit, i.e., Spades, has more value than another suit, i.e., Hearts, the seven of Spades may have more value than the seven of Hearts.","It is easy to visualize that using the different card quantity and suit values, many different games can be played. In certain games, it is the combination of cards that one player obtains that determines whether or not that player has defeated the other player or players. Usually, the more difficult the combination is to obtain, the more value the combination has, and the player who obtains the more difficult combination (also taking into account the value of the cards) wins the game.","For instance in the game of Poker, each player may ultimately receive five cards. The player who obtains three cards having similar numbers on their face, i.e., the four of Hearts, four of Diamonds and four of Clubs, will defeat the player having only two cards with the same numerical value, i.e., the King of Spades and the King of Hearts. However, the player with five cards that all contain Clubs, commonly known as a flush, will defeat the player with the same three of a kind described above.","In many instances, a standard deck of playing cards is used to create gaming machines. In these gaming machines players insert coins and play certain card games, such as poker, using an imitation of standard playing cards on a video screen, in an attempt to win back more money than they originally inserted into the machine.","Another form of gambling using playing cards utilizes tables, otherwise known as table games. A table uses a table and a dealer, with the players sitting or standing around the table. The players place their bets on the table and the dealer deals the cards to each player. The number of cards dealt, or whether the cards are dealt face up or face down, will depend on the particular table game being played.","Further, an imitation or depiction of a standard playing card is used in many handheld electronic games, such as poker and blackjack, and in many computer games and Internet games. Using a handheld electronic game or a computer terminal that may or may not be connected to the Internet, a player receives the imitation playing cards and plays a card game either against the computer or against other players. Further, many of these games can be played on the computer in combination with gambling.","Also, there are many game shows that are broadcasted on television that use a deck of playing cards in the game play, in which the cards are usually enlarged or shown on a video screen or monitor for easy viewing. In these television game shows, the participants play the card game for prizes or money, usually against each other, with an individual acting as a host overseeing the action.","Also, there are lottery tickets that players purchase and play by \u201cscratching off\u201d an opaque layer to see if they have won money and prizes. The opaque layer prevents the player from knowing the results of the lottery ticket prior to purchasing and scratching off the layer. In some of these lottery tickets, playing cards are used under the opaque layer and the player may need to match a number of similar cards in order to win the prizes or money.","Rules of Card Games","Rules of Poker","In a basic poker game, which is played with a standard 52-card deck, each player is dealt five cards. All five cards in each player's hand are evaluated as a single hand with the presence of various combinations of the cards such as pairs, three-of-a-kind, straight, etc. Determining which combinations prevail over other combinations is done by reference to a table containing a ranking of the combinations. Rankings in most tables are based on the odds of each combination occurring in the player's hand. Regardless of the number of cards in a player's hand, the values assigned to the cards, and the odds, the method of evaluating all five cards in a player's hand remain the same.","Poker is a popular skill-based card game in which players with fully or partially concealed cards make wagers into a central pot. The pot is awarded to the player or players with the best combination of cards or to the player who makes an uncalled bet. Poker can also refer to video poker, a single-player game seen in casinos much like a slot machine, or to other games that use poker hand rankings.","Poker is played in a multitude of variations, but most follow the same basic pattern of play.","The right to deal each hand typically rotates among the players and is marked by a token called a \u2018dealer\u2019 button or buck. In a casino, a house dealer handles the cards for each hand, but a button (typically a white plastic disk) is rotated clockwise among the players to indicate a nominal dealer to determine the order of betting.","For each hand, one or more players are required to make forced bets to create an initial stake for which the players will contest. The dealer shuffles the cards, he cuts, and the appropriate number of cards are dealt to the players one at a time. Cards may be dealt either face-up or face-down, depending on the variant of poker being played. After the initial deal, the first of what may be several betting rounds begins. Between rounds, the players' hands develop in some way, often by being dealt additional cards or replacing cards previously dealt. At the end of each round, all bets are gathered into the central pot.","At any time during a betting round, if a player makes a bet, opponents are required to fold, call or raise. If one player bets and no opponents choose to match the bet, the hand ends immediately, the bettor is awarded the pot, no cards are required to be shown, and the next hand begins. The ability to win a pot without showing a hand makes bluffing possible. Bluffing is a primary feature of poker, one that distinguishes it from other vying games and from other games that make use of poker hand rankings.","At the end of the last betting round, if more than one player remains, there is a showdown, in which the players reveal their previously hidden cards and evaluate their hands. The player with the best hand according to the poker variant being played wins the pot.","The most popular poker variants are as follows:","Draw Poker","Players each receive five\u2014as in five-card draw\u2014or more cards, all of which are hidden. They can then replace one or more of these cards a certain number of times.","Stud Poker","Players receive cards one at a time, some being displayed to other players at the table. The key difference between stud and \u2018draw\u2019 poker is that players are not allowed to discard or replace any cards.","Community Card Poker","Players combine individually dealt cards with a number of \u201ccommunity cards\u201d dealt face up and shared by all players. Two or four individual cards may be dealt in the most popular variations, Texas hold 'em and Omaha hold 'em, respectively.","Poker Hand Rankings","Straight Flush","A straight flush is a poker hand such as Q J 10 9 8, which contains five cards in sequence, all of the same suit. Two such hands are compared by their high card in the same way as are straights. The low ace rule also applies: 5\u2666 4\u2666 3\u2666 2\u2666 A\u2666 is a 5-high straight flush (also known as a \u201csteel wheel\u201d). An ace-high straight flush such as A K Q J 10 is known as a royal flush, and is the highest ranking standard poker hand (excluding five of a kind).","Examples:\n\n","Four of a kind, or quads, is a poker hand such as 9 9 9\u2666 9\u2665 J\u2665, which contains four cards of one rank, and an unmatched card. It ranks above a full house and below a straight flush. Higher ranking quads defeat lower ranking ones. Between two equal sets of four of a kind (possible in wild card and community card games), the kicker determines the winner.","Examples:\n\n","A full house, also known as a boat or a full boat, is a poker hand such as 3 3 3\u2666 6 6\u2665, which contains three matching cards of one rank, plus two matching cards of another rank. It ranks below a four of a kind and above a flush. Between two full houses, the one with the higher ranking set of three wins. If two have the same set of three (possible in wild card and community card games), the hand with the higher pair wins. Full houses are described by the three of a kind (e.g. Q-Q-Q) and pair (e.g. 9-9), as in \u201cQueens over nines\u201d (also used to describe a two pair), \u201cQueens full of nines\u201d or simply \u201cQueens full\u201d.","Examples:\n\n","A flush is a poker hand such as Q 10 7 6 4, which contains five cards of the same suit, not in rank sequence. It ranks above a straight and below a full house. Two flushes are compared as if they were high card hands. In other words, the highest ranking card of each is compared to determine the winner; if both have the same high card, then the second-highest ranking card is compared, etc. The suits have no value: two flushes with the same five ranks of cards are tied. Flushes are described by the highest card, as in \u201cqueen-high flush\u201d.","Examples:\n\n","A straight is a poker hand such as Q J 10 9\u2665 8\u2665, which contains five cards of sequential rank, of varying suits. It ranks above three of a kind and below a flush. Two straights are ranked by comparing the high card of each. Two straights with the same high card are of equal value, and split any winnings (straights are the most commonly tied hands in poker, especially in community card games). Straights are described by the highest card, as in \u201cqueen-high straight\u201d or \u201cstraight to the queen\u201d.","Examples:\n\n","A hand such as A K Q\u2666 J 10 is an ace-high straight, and ranks above a king-high straight such as K\u2665 Q J\u2665 10\u2665 9\u2666. But the ace may also be played as a 1-spot in a hand such as 5 4\u2666 3\u2666 2 A, called a wheel or five-high straight, which ranks below the six-high straight 6 5 4 3\u2665 2\u2665. The ace may not \u201cwrap around\u201d, or play both high and low in the same hand: 3 2\u2666 A K Q is not a straight, but just ace-high no pair.","Three of a Kind","Three of a kind, also called trips, set or a prile, is a poker hand such as 2\u2666 2 2\u2665 K 6, which contains three cards of the same rank, plus two unmatched cards. It ranks above two pair and below a straight. Higher ranking three of a kind defeat lower ranking three of a kinds. If two hands have the same rank three of a kind (possible in games with wild cards or community cards), the kickers are compared to break the tie.","Examples:\n\n","A poker hand such as J\u2665 J 4 4 9, which contains two cards of the same rank, plus two cards of another rank (that match each other but not the first pair), plus one unmatched card, is called two pair. It ranks above one pair and below three of a kind. Between two hands containing two pair, the higher ranking pair of each is first compared, and the higher pair wins. If both have the same top pair, then the second pair of each is compared. Finally, if both hands have the same two pairs, the kicker determines the winner. Two pair are described by the higher pair (e.g., K\u2665 K) and the lower pair (e.g., 9 9\u2666), as in \u201cKings over nines\u201d, \u201cKings and nines\u201d or simply \u201cKings up\u201d.","Examples:\n\n","One pair is a poker hand such as 4\u2665 4 K 10\u2666 5, which contains two cards of the same rank, plus three unmatched cards. It ranks above any high card hand, but below all other poker hands. Higher ranking pairs defeat lower ranking pairs. If two hands have the same rank of pair, the non-paired cards in each hand (the kickers) are compared to determine the winner.","Examples:","10 10 6 4\u2665 2\u2665 (\u201cpair of tens\u201d) defeats 9\u2665 9 A\u2665 Q\u2666 10\u2666 (\u201cpair of nines\u201d)","10\u2665 10\u2666 J\u26663\u2665 2 (\u201ctens with jack kicker\u201d) defeats 10 10 6 4\u2665 2\u2665 (\u201ctens with six kicker\u201d)","2\u2666 2\u2665 8 5 4 (\u201cdeuces, eight-five-four\u201d) defeats 2 2 8 5\u2665 3\u2665 (\u201cdeuces, eight-five-three\u201d)","High Card","A high-card or no-pair hand is a poker hand such as K\u2665 J 8 7\u2666 3, in which no two cards have the same rank, the five cards are not in sequence, and the five cards are not all the same suit. It can also be referred to as \u201cnothing\u201d or \u201cgarbage,\u201d and many other derogatory terms. It ranks below all other poker hands. Two such hands are ranked by comparing the highest ranking card; if those are equal, then the next highest ranking card; if those are equal, then the third highest ranking card, etc. No-pair hands are described by the one or two highest cards in the hand, such as \u201cking high\u201d or \u201cace-queen high\u201d, or by as many cards as are necessary to break a tie.","Examples:\n\n","The use of joker as a bug creates a slight variation of game play. When a joker is introduced in standard poker games it functions as a fifth ace, or can be used as a flush or straight card (though it can be used as a wild card too). Normally casino draw poker variants use a joker, and thus the best possible hand is five of a kind, as in A\u2665 A\u2666 A A Joker.","Rules of Caribbean Stud","Caribbean Stud\u2122 poker may be played as follows. A player and a dealer are each dealt five cards. If the dealer has a poker hand having a value less than Ace-King combination or better, the player automatically wins. If the dealer has a poker hand having a value of an Ace-King combination or better, then the higher of the player's or the dealer's hand wins. If the player wins, he may receive an additional bonus payment depending on the poker rank of his hand. In the commercial play of the game, a side bet is usually required to allow a chance at a progressive jackpot. In Caribbean Stud\u2122 poker, it is the dealer's hand that must qualify. As the dealer's hand is partially concealed during play (usually only one card, at most) is displayed to the player before player wagering is complete), the player must always be aware that even ranked player hands can lose to a dealer's hand and no bonus will be paid out unless the side bet has been made, and then usually only to hands having a rank of a flush or higher.","Rules of Blackjack","Some versions of Blackjack are now described. Blackjack hands are scored according to the point total of the cards in the hand. The hand with the highest total wins as long as it is 21 or less. If the total is greater than 21, it is a called a \u201cbust.\u201d Numbered cards 2 through 10 have a point value equal to their face value, and face cards (i.e., Jack, Queen and King) are worth 10 points. An Ace is worth 11 points unless it would bust a hand, in which case it is worth 1 point. Players play against the dealer and win by having a higher point total no greater than 21. If the player busts, the player loses, even if the dealer also busts. If the player and dealer have hands with the same point value, this is called a \u201cpush,\u201d and neither party wins the hand.","After the initial bets are placed, the dealer deals the cards, either from one or more, but typically two, hand-held decks of cards, or from a \u201cshoe\u201d containing multiple decks of cards, generally at least four decks of cards, and typically many more. A game in which the deck or decks of cards are hand-held is known as a \u201cpitch\u201d game. \u201cPitch\u201d games are generally not played in casinos. When playing with more than one deck, the decks are shuffled together in order to make it more difficult to remember which cards have been dealt and which have not. The dealer deals two cards to each player and to himself. Typically, one of the dealer's two cards is dealt face-up so that all players can see it, and the other is face down. The face-down card is called the \u201chole card.\u201d In a European variation, the \u201chole card\u201d is dealt after all the players' cards are dealt and their hands have been played. The players' cards are dealt face up from a shoe and face down if it is a \u201cpitch\u201d game.","A two-card hand with a point value of 21 (i.e., an Ace and a face card or a 10) is called a \u201cBlackjack\u201d or a \u201cnatural\u201d and wins automatically. A player with a \u201cnatural\u201d is conventionally paid 3:2 on his bet, although in 2003 some Las Vegas casinos began paying 6:5, typically in games with only a single deck.","Once the first two cards have been dealt to each player and the dealer, the dealer wins automatically if the dealer has a \u201cnatural\u201d and the player does not. If the player has a \u201cnatural\u201d and the dealer does not, the player automatically wins. If the dealer and player both have a \u201cnatural,\u201d neither party wins the hand.","If neither side has a \u201cnatural,\u201d each player completely plays out their hand; when all players have finished, the dealer plays his hand.","The playing of the hand typically involves a combination of four possible actions \u201chitting,\u201d \u201cstanding,\u201d \u201cdoubling down,\u201d or \u201csplitting\u201d his hand. Often another action called \u201csurrendering\u201d is added. To \u201chit\u201d is to take another card. To \u201cstand\u201d is to take no more cards. To \u201cdouble down\u201d is to double the wager, take precisely one more card and then \u201cstand.\u201d When a player has identical value cards, such as a pair of 8s, the player can \u201csplit\u201d by placing an additional wager and playing each card as the first card in two new hands. To \u201csurrender\u201d is to forfeit half the player's bet and give up his hand. \u201cSurrender\u201d is not an option in most casino games of Blackjack. A player's turn ends if he \u201cstands,\u201d \u201cbusts\u201d or \u201cdoubles down.\u201d If the player \u201cbusts,\u201d he loses even if the dealer subsequently busts. This is the house advantage.","After all players have played their hands, the dealer then reveals the dealer's hole card and plays his hand. According to house rules (the prevalent casino rules), the dealer must hit until he has a point total of at least 17, regardless of what the players have. In most casinos, the dealer must also hit on a \u201csoft\u201d 17 (e.g., an Ace and 6). In a casino, the Blackjack table felt is marked to indicate if the dealer hits or stands on a soft 17. If the dealer busts, all remaining players win. Bets are normally paid out at odds of 1:1.","Four of the common rule variations are one card split Aces, early surrender, late surrender and double-down restrictions. In the first variation, one card is dealt on each Ace and the player's turn is over. In the second, the player has the option to surrender before the dealer checks for Blackjack. In the third, the player has the option to surrender after the dealer checks for Blackjack. In the fourth, doubling-down is only permitted for certain card combinations.","Insurance","Insurance is a commonly-offered betting option in which the player can hedge his bet by wagering that the dealer will win the hand. If the dealer's \u201cup card\u201d is an Ace, the player is offered the option of buying Insurance before the dealer checks his \u201chole card.\u201d If the player wishes to take Insurance, the player can bet an amount up to half that of his original bet. The Insurance bet is placed separately on a special portion of the table, which is usually marked with the words \u201cInsurance Pays 2:1.\u201d The player buying Insurance is betting that the dealer's \u201chole card\u201d is one with a value of 10 (i.e., a 10, Jack, Queen or King). Because the dealer's up card is an Ace, the player who buys Insurance is betting that the dealer has a \u201cnatural.\u201d","If the player originally bets $10 and the dealer shows an Ace, the player can buy Insurance by betting up to $5. Suppose the player makes a $5 Insurance bet and the player's hand with the two cards dealt to him totals 19. If the dealer's hole card is revealed to be a 10 after the Insurance betting period is over (the dealer checks for a \u201cnatural\u201d before the players play their hands), the player loses his original $10 bet, but he wins the $5 Insurance bet at odds of 2:1, winning $10 and therefore breaking even. In the same situation, if the dealer's hole card is not one with a value of ten, the player immediately loses his $5 Insurance bet. But if the player chooses to stand on 19, and if the dealer's hand has a total value less than 19, at the end of the dealer's turn, the player wins his original $10 bet, making a net profit of $5. In the same situation, if the dealer's hole card is not one with a value of ten, again the player will immediately lose their $5 Insurance bet, and if the dealer's hand has a total value greater than the player's at the end of both of their turns, for example the player stood on 19 and the dealer ended his turn with 20, the player loses both his original $10 bet and his $5 Insurance bet.","Basic Strategy","Blackjack players can increase their expected winnings by several means, one of which is \u201cbasic strategy.\u201d \u201cBasic strategy\u201d is simply something that exists as a matter of general practice; it has no official sanction. The \u201cbasic strategy\u201d determines when to hit and when to stand, as well as when doubling down or splitting in the best course. Basic strategy is based on the player's point total and the dealer's visible card. Under some conditions (e.g., playing with a single deck according to downtown Las Vegas rules) the house advantage over a player using basic strategy can be as low as 0.16%. Casinos offering options like surrender and double-after-split may be giving the player using basic strategy a statistical advantage and instead rely on players making mistakes to provide a house advantage.","A number of optional rules can benefit a skilled player, for example: if doubling down is permitted on any two-card hand other than a natural; if \u201cdoubling down\u201d is permitted after splitting; if early surrender (forfeiting half the bet against a face or Ace up card before the dealer checks for Blackjack) is permitted; if late surrender is permitted; if re-splitting Aces is permitted (splitting when the player has more than two cards in their hand, and has just been dealt a second ace in their hand); if drawing more than one card against a split Ace is permitted; if five or more cards with a total no more than 21 is an automatic win (referred to as \u201cCharlies\u201d).","Other optional rules can be detrimental to a skilled player. For example: if a \u201cnatural\u201d pays less than 3:2 (e.g., Las Vegas Strip single-deck Blackjack paying out at 6:5 for a \u201cnatural\u201d); if a hand can only be split once (is re-splitting possible for other than aces); if doubling down is restricted to certain totals (e.g., 9 11 or 10 11); if Aces may not be re-split; if the rules are those of \u201cno-peek\u201d (or European) Blackjack, according to which the player loses hands that have been split or \u201cdoubled down\u201d to a dealer who has a \u201cnatural\u2019 (because the dealer does not check for this automatically winning hand until the players had played their hands); if the player loses ties with the dealer, instead of pushing where neither the player or the dealer wins and the player retains their original bet.","Card Counting","Unlike some other casino games, in which one play has no influence on any subsequent play, a hand of Blackjack removes those cards from the deck. As cards are removed from the deck, the probability of each of the remaining cards being dealt is altered (and dealing the same cards becomes impossible). If the remaining cards have an elevated proportion of 10-value cards and Aces, the player is more likely to be dealt a natural, which is to the player's advantage (because the dealer wins even money when the dealer has a natural, while the player wins at odds of 3:2 when the player has a natural). If the remaining cards have an elevated proportion of low-value cards, such as 4s, 5s and 6s, the player is more likely to bust, which is to the dealer's advantage (because if the player busts, the dealer wins even if the dealer later busts).","The house advantage in Blackjack is relatively small at the outset. By keeping track of which cards have been dealt, a player can take advantage of the changing proportions of the remaining cards by betting higher amounts when there is an elevated proportion of 10-value cards and Aces and by better lower amounts when there is an elevated proportion of low-value cards. Over time, the deck will be unfavorable to the player more often than it is favorable, but by adjusting the amounts that he bets, the player can overcome that inherent disadvantage. The player can also use this information to refine basic strategy. For instance, basic strategy calls for hitting on a 16 when the dealer's up card is a 10, but if the player knows that the deck has a disproportionately small number of low-value cards remaining, the odds may be altered in favor of standing on the 16.","There are a number of card-counting schemes, all dependent for their efficacy on the player's ability to remember either a simplified or detailed tally of the cards that have been played. The more detailed the tally, the more accurate it is, but the harder it is to remember. Although card counting is not illegal, casinos will eject or ban successful card counters if they are detected.","Shuffle tracking is a more obscure, and difficult, method of attempting to shift the odds in favor of the player. The player attempts to track groups of cards during the play of a multi-deck shoe, follow them through the shuffle, and then looks for the same group to reappear from the new shoe, playing and betting accordingly.","Tracking the Action at a Table","U.S. Pat. No. 6,579,181 which is hereby incorporated herein by reference, generally describes, \u201ca system for automatically monitoring playing and wagering of a game. In one illustrated embodiment, the system includes a card deck reader that automatically reads a respective symbol from each card in a deck of cards before a first one of the cards is removed from the deck. The symbol identifies a value of the card in terms of rank and suit, and can take the form of a machine-readable symbol, such as a bar code, area or matrix code or stacked code. In another aspect, the system does not decode the read symbol until the respective card is dealt, to ensure security.","\u201cIn another aspect, the system can include a chip tray reader that automatically images the contents of a chip tray. The system periodically determines the number and value of chips in the chip tray from the image, and compares the change in contents of the chip tray to the outcome of game play to verify that the proper amounts have been paid out and collected.","\u201cIn a further aspect, the system can include a table monitor that automatically images the activity or events occurring at a gaming table. The system periodically compares images of the gaming table to identify wagering, as well as the appearance, removal and position of cards and\/or other objects on the gaming table. The table monitoring system can be unobtrusively located in the chip tray.\u201d","U.S. Pat. No. 6,579,181 generally describes \u201ca drop box that automatically verifies an amount and authenticity of a deposit and reconciles the deposit with a change in the contents of the chip tray. The drop box can image different portions of the deposited item, selecting appropriate lighting and resolutions to examine security features in the deposited item.","\u201cIn another aspect, the system can employ some, or all of the components to monitor the gaming habits of players and the performance of employees. The system can detect suspect playing and wagering patterns that may be prohibited. The system can also identify the win\/loss percentage of the players and the dealer, as well as a number of other statistically relevant measures. Such measures can provide a casino or other gaming establishment with enhanced automated security, and automated real-time accounting. The measures can additionally provide a basis for automatically allocating complimentary benefits to the players.\u201d","Various embodiments include an apparatus, method and system which utilizes a card dispensing shoe with scanner and its associated software which enable the card dealer when dealing the game from a card dispensing shoe with scanner preferably placed on a game table where the twenty-one game to be evaluated by the software is being played, to use one or more keyboard(s) and\/or LCD displays coupled to the shoe to identify for the computer program the number of the active players' seats, or active players, including the dealer's position relative thereto and their active play at the game table during each game round dealt from the shoe. These keyboards and LCD displays are also used to enter other data relevant to each seat's, or player's, betting and\/or decision strategies for each hand played. The data is analyzed by a computer software program designed to evaluate the strategy decisions and betting skills of casino twenty-one, or blackjack players playing the game of blackjack during real time. The evaluation software is coupled to a central processing unit (CPU) or host computer that is also coupled to the shoe's keyboard(s) and LCD displays. The dealer using one or more keyboard(s) attached to or carried by the shoe, or a keyboard(s) located near the dealer is able to see and record the exact amount bet by each player for each hand played for the game to be evaluated. The optical scanner coupled to the CPU reads the value of each card dealt to each player's hand(s) and the dealer's hand as each card is dealt to a specific hand, seat or position and converts the game card value of each card dealt from the shoe to the players and the dealer of the game to a card count system value for one or more card count systems programmed into the evaluation software. The CPU also records each players decision(s) to hit a hand, and the dealer's decision to hit or take another card when required by the rules of the game, as the hit card is removed from the shoe. The dealer uses one or more of the keyboards and LCD displays carried by the shoe to record each player's decision(s) to Insure, Surrender, Stand, Double Down, or Split a hand. When the dealer has an Ace or a Ten as an up-card, he\/she may use one or more of the keyboards to prompt the computer system's software, since the dealer's second card, or hole-card, which is dealt face down, has been scanned and the game card value thereof has been imported into the computer systems software, to instantly inform the dealer, by means of one or more of the shoe's LCDs, if his\/her game cards, or hand total, constitutes a two-card \u201c21\u201d or \u201cBlackjack\u201d.","In various embodiments, a card playing system for playing a card game which includes a card

Each deck has a different common identity code. A shuffler is used to shuffle the decks together and the shuffler has a circuit for counting of the cards from a previous hand that are inserted into the shuffler for reshuffling. The shuffler circuit counts each card inserted and reads the common identity code located on each card. The shuffler circuit issues a signal corresponding to the count and the common identity code read. The game control (e.g., the computer) located at each table receives this signal from the shuffler circuit and verifies that no cards have been withdrawn from the hand by a player (or the dealer) or that no new cards have been substituted. If the count is not proper or if a game card lacks an identity code or an identity code is mismatched, an alarm signal is generated indicating that a new deck of cards needs to be used and that the possibility of a breach in the security of the game has occurred.","In yet another embodiment of security, a unique code, such as a bar code, is placed on each card and as each card is dealt by the dealer from a shoe, a detector reads the code and issues a signal to the game control containing at least the value and the suit of each card dealt in the hand. The detector may also read a common identity deck code and issue that as a signal to the game control. The shoe may have an optical scanner for generating an image of each card as it is dealt from the shoe by the dealer in a hand. The game control stores this information in a memory so that a history of each card dealt from the shoe in a hand is recorded.","In yet another embodiment of security, an integrated shuffler\/shoe obtains an optical image of each card dealt from the shoe for a hand and for each card inserted into the shuffler after a hand. These images are delivered to the game control where the images are counted and compared. When an irregular count or comparison occurs, an alarm is raised. The shuffler and shoe are integrated to provide security between the two units.","In another embodiment of security for a live card game, a game bet sensor is located near each of the plurality of player positions for sensing the presence of a game bet. The game bet sensor issues a signal counting the tokens placed. It is entirely possible that game bet sensors at some player positions do not have bets, and therefore, the game control that is receptive of these signals identifies which player positions have players placing game bets. This information is stored in memory and becomes part of the history of the game.","In another embodiment of security, a progressive bet sensor is located at each of the plurality of player positions and senses the presence of a progressive bet. The progressive bet sensor issues a signal that is received by the game control, which records in memory the progressive bets being placed at the respective player position sensed. If a progressive bet is sensed and a game bet is not, the game control issues an alarm signal indicating improper betting. At this point, the game control knows the identity of each player location having placed a game bet and, of those player positions having game bets placed, which player positions also have a progressive bet. This is stored in memory as part of the history of the hand.","In yet another embodiment of security, a card sensor is located near each player position and the dealer position. The card sensor issues a signal for each card received at the card sensor. The game control receives this issued signal and correlates those player positions having placed a game bet with the received cards. In the event a player position without a game bet receives a card or a player position with a game bet receives a card out of sequence, the game control issues an alarm. This information is added to the history of the game in memory, and the history contains the value and suit of each card delivered to each player position having a game bet.","A progressive jackpot display is located at each game table and may display one or more jackpot awards for one or more winning combinations of cards. In various embodiments, the game control at each table has stored in memory the winning combinations necessary to win the progressive jackpots. Since the game control accurately stores the suit and value of each card received at a particular player position, the game control can automatically detect a winning combination and issue an award signal for that player position. The dealer can then verify that that player at that position indeed has the correct combination of cards. The game control continuously updates the central control interconnected to all other game tables so that the central control can then inform all game tables of this win including, if desirable, the name of the winner and the amount won.","The central control communicates continuously with each game control and its associated progressive jackpot display may receive over a communication link all or part of the information stored in each game control.","Various embodiments include a card shoe with a device for automatic recognition and tracking of the value of each gaming card drawn out of the card shoe in a covered way (face down).","Various embodiments include a gaming table with a device for automatic recognition of played or not played boxes (hands), whereby it has to realize multiple bets on each hand and the use of insurance lines. Furthermore, the gaming table may include a device to recognize automatically the number of cards placed in front of each player and the dealer.","Various embodiments include the recognition, tracking, and storage of gaming chips.","In various embodiment, an electronic data processing (EDP) program may process the value of all bets on each box and associated insurance line, control the sequence of delivery of the cards, control the distribution of the gaming cards to each player and the dealer, may calculate and compare the total score of each hand and the dealer's, and may evaluate the players' wins.","Gaming data may then be processed by means of the EDP program and shown simultaneously to the actual game at a special monitor or display. Same data may be recalled later on to monitor the total results whenever requested.","Various embodiments include:\n\n","According to various embodiments, the card recognition means comprises an optical window arranged along a movement path of the card image imprint on the playing card drawn from the card shoe; a pulsed light source for illuminating a portion of the drawn playing card located opposite the optical window; a CCD image converter for the portion of the drawn playing card located opposite the optical window; an optical device for deflecting and transmitting a reflected image of the card value imprint from the drawn playing card to the CCD image converter from that portion of the drawn playing card when the drawn card is exactly in a correct drawn position opposite the optical window; and sensor means for detecting movement of the drawn card and for providing a correct timing for operation of the pulsed light source for transmission of the reflected image to the CCD image converter. The optical device for deflecting and transmitting the reflected image can comprise a minor arranged to deflect the reflected image to the CCD image converter. Alternatively, the optical device for deflecting and transmitting the reflected image comprises a reflecting optical prism having two plane surfaces arranged at right angles to each other, one of which covers the optical window and another of which faces the CCD image converter and comprises a mirror, and the pulsed light source is arranged behind the latter plane surface so as to illuminate the drawn card when the drawn card is positioned over the optical window. Advantageously the sensor means for detecting movement of the drawn card and for providing a correct timing comprises a single sensor, preferably either a pressure sensor or a photoelectric threshold device, for sensing a front edge of the drawn card to determine whether or not the drawn card is being drawn and to activate the CCD image converter and the pulsed light source when a back edge of the drawn card passes the sensor means. Alternatively, the sensor means can include two electro-optical sensors, one of which is located beyond a movement path of the card image imprint on the drawn playing card and another of which is located in a movement path of the card image imprint on a drawn playing card. The latter electro-optical sensor can includes means for activating the pulsed light source by sensing a color trigger when the card value imprint passes over the optical window. In preferred embodiments of the card shoe the pulsed light source comprises a Xenon lamp.","In various embodiments of the gaming apparatus the single detectors of the occupation detector unit each comprise a light sensitive sensor for detection of chips or playing cards arranged on the table cloth over the respective single detector. Each single detector can be an infrared sensitive photodiode, preferably a silicon photodiode. Advantageously the single detectors can be arranged in the occupation detector unit so that the chips or playing cards placed over them on the table cloth are arrange over at least two single detectors.","The gaming apparatus may includes automatic means for discriminating colored markings or regions on the chips and for producing a bet output signal in accordance with the colored markings or regions and the number of chips having identical colored markings or regions.","The gaming bet detector may include automatic means for discriminating between chips of different value in the game of chance and means for producing a bet output signal in accordance with the different values of the chips when the chips are bet by a player. In various embodiments the gaming bet detector includes a radio frequency transmitting and receiving station and the chips are each provided with a transponder responding to the transmitting and receiving station so that the transponder transmits the values of the bet chips back to the transmitting and receiving station.","The connection between the individual units of the gaming apparatus and the computer can be either a wireless connection or a cable connection.","Following the Bets","Various embodiments include a smart card delivery shoe that reads the suit and rank of each card before it is delivered to the various positions where cards are to be dealt in the play of the casino table card game. The cards are then dealt according to the rules of the game to the required card positions. Different games have diverse card distribution positions, different card numbers, and different delivery sequences that the hand identifying system may encompass, in various embodiments. For example, in the most complex of card distribution games of blackjack, cards are usually dealt one at a time in sequence around a table, one card at a time to each player position and then to the dealer position. The one card at a time delivery sequence is again repeated so that each player position and the dealer position have an initial hand of exactly two cards. Complexity in hand development is introduced because players have essentially unlimited control over additional cards until point value in a hand exceeds a count of twenty-one. Players may stand with a count of 2 (two aces) or take a hit with a count of 21 if they are so inclined, so the knowledge of the count of a hand is no assurance of what a player will do. The dealer, on the other hand, is required to follow strict house rules on the play of the game according to the value of the dealer's hand. Small variances such as allowing or disallowing a hit on a \u201csoft\u201d seventeen count (e.g., an Ace and a 6) may exist, but the rules are otherwise very precise so that the house or dealer cannot exercise any strategy.","Other cards games may provide equal numbers of cards in batches. Variants of stud poker played against a dealer, for example, would usually provide hands of five cards, five at a time to each player position and if competing against a dealer, to the dealer position. This card hand distribution is quite simple to track as each sequence of five cards removed from the dealer shoe is a hand.","Other games may require cards to be dealt to players and other cards dealt to a flop or common card area. The system may also be programmable to cover this alternative if it is so desired.","Baccarat is closer to blackjack in card sequence of dealing, but has more rigid rules as to when hits may be taken by the player and the dealer, and each position may take a maximum of one card as a hit. The hand identification system according to various embodiments may be able to address the needs of identifying hands in each of these types of games and especially must be able to identify hands in the most complex situation, the play of blackjack.","In various embodiments, where cameras are used to read cards, the light sensitive system may be any image capture system, digital or analog, that is capable of identifying the suit and rank of a card.","In various embodiments, a first step in the operation is to provide a set of cards to the smart delivery shoe, the cards being those cards that are going to be used in the play of a casino table card game. The set of cards (usually one or more decks) is provided in an already randomized set, being taken out of a shuffler or having been shuffled by hand. A smart delivery shoe is described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/622,321, titled SMART DELIVERY SHOE, which application is hereby incorporated herein in its entirety by reference. Some delivery systems or shoes with reading capability include, but are not limited to those disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,750,743; 5,779,546; 5,605,334; 6,361,044; 6,217,447; 5,941,769; 6,229,536; 6,460,848; 5,722,893; 6,039,650; and 6,126,166, which are hereby incorporated herein by reference. In various embodiments, the cards are read in the smart card delivery shoe, such as one card at a time in sequence. Reading cards by edge markings and special codes (as in U.S. Pat. No. 6,460,848, which are hereby incorporated herein by reference) may require special encoding and marking of the cards. The entire sequence of cards in the set of cards may thus be determined and stored in memory. Memory may be at least in part in the smart delivery shoe, but communication with a central processor is possible. The sequence would then also or solely be stored in the central computer.","In various embodiments, the cards are then dealt out of the smart delivery shoe, the delivery shoe registering how many cards are removed one-at-a-time. This may be accomplished by the above identified U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/622,321 where cards are fed to the dealer removal area one at a time, so only one card can be removed by the dealer. As each card is removed, a signal is created indicating that a specific card (of rank and suit) has been dealt. The computer and system knows only that a first card has been dealt, and it is presumed to go to the first player. The remaining cards are dealt out to players and dealer. In the play of certain games (e.g., stud variants) where specific numbers of cards are known to be dealt to each position, the shoe may be programmed with the number of players at any time, so hands can be correlated even before they have been dealt. If the shoe is playing a stud variant where each player and the dealer gets three cards (Three Card Poker\u2122 game), the system may know in advance of the deal what each player and the dealer will have as a hand. It is also possible that there be a signal available when the dealer has received either his first card (e.g., when cards are dealt in sequence, one-at-a-time) or has received his entire hand. The signal may be used to automatically determine the number of player positions active on the table at any given time. For example, if in a hand of blackjack the dealer receives the sixth card, the system may immediately know that there are five players at the table. The signal can be given manually (pressing a button at the dealer position or on the smart card delivery shoe) or can be provided automatically (a card presence sensor at the dealer's position, where a card can be placed over the sensor to provide a signal). Where an automatic signal is provided by a sensor, some physical protection of the sensor may be provided, such as a shield that would prevent accidental contact with the sensor or blockage of the sensor. An L-shaped cover may be used so a card could be slid under the arm of the L parallel to the table surface and cover the sensor under that branch of the L. The signal can also be given after all cards for the hand have been delivered, again indicating the number of players, For example, when the dealer's two cards are slid under the L-shaped cover to block or contact the sensor, the system may know the total number of cards dealt on the hand (e.g., 10 cards), know that the dealer has 2 cards, determine that players therefore have 8 cards, and know that each player has 2 cards each, thereby absolutely determining that there are four active player positions at the table (10\u22122=8 and then 8\/2=4 players). This automatic determination may serve as an alternative to having dealers input the number of players each hand at a table or having to manually change the indicated number of players at a table each time the number changes.","Once all active positions have been dealt to, the system may now know what cards are initially present in each player's hand, the dealer's hand, and any flop or common hand. The system operation may now be simple when no more cards are provided to play the casino table game. All hands may then be known and all outcomes may be predicted. The complication of additional cards will be addressed with respect to the game of blackjack.","After dealing the initial set of two cards per hand, the system may not immediately know where each remaining card will be dealt. The system may know what cards are dealt, however. It is with this knowledge and a subsequent identification of discarded hands that the hands and cards from the smart delivery shoe can be reconciled or verified. Each hand is already identified by the presence of two specifically known cards. Hands are then played according to the rules of the game, and hands are discarded when play of a hand is exhausted. A hand is exhausted when 1) there is a blackjack, the hand is paid, and the cards are cleared; 2) a hand breaks with a count over twenty-one and the cards are cleared; and\/or a round of the game is played to a conclusion, the dealer's hand completed, all wagers are settled, and the cards are cleared. As is typically done in a casino to enable reconciling of hands manually, cards are picked up in a precise order from the table. The cards are usually cleared from the dealer's right to the dealer's left, and the cards at each position comprise the cards in the order that they were delivered, first card on the bottom, second card over the first card, third card over the second card, etc. maintaining the order or a close approximation of the order (e.g., the first two cards may be reversed) is important as the first two cards form an anchor, focus, basis, fence, end point or set edge for each hand. For example, if the third player position was known to have received the 10 of hearts (10H) and the 9 of spades (9S) for the first two card, and the fourth player was known to receive the 8 of diamonds (8D) and the 3 of clubs (3C) for the first two cards, the edges or anchors of the two hands are 9S\/10H and 8D\/3C. When the hands are swept at the conclusion of the game, the cards are sent to a smart discard rack (e.g., see U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/622,388, which application is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety) and the hand with the 9S\/10H was not already exhausted (e.g., broken or busted) and the swept cards consist of 9S, 10H, 8S, 8D and 3C (as read by the smart discard rack), the software of the processor may automatically know that the final hands in the third and fourth positions were a count of 19 (9S and 10H) for the third hand and 19 (8D and 3C originally plus the 8S hit) for the fourth hand. The analysis by the software specifically identifies the fourth hand as a count of 19 with the specific cards read by the smart discard shoe. The information from reading that now exhausted hand is compared with the original information collected from the smart delivery shoe. The smart delivery shoe information when combined with the smart discard rack information shall confirm the hands in each position, even though cards were not uniformly distributed (e.g., player one takes two hits for a total of four cards, player two takes three hits for a total of five cards, player three takes no hit for a total of two cards, player four takes one hit for a total of three cards, and the dealer takes two hits for a total of four cards).","The dealer's cards may be equally susceptible to analysis in a number of different formats. After the last card has been dealt to the last player, a signal may be easily and imperceptibly generated that the dealer's hand will now become active with possible hits. For example, with the sensor described above for sensing the presence of the first dealer card or the completion of the dealer's hand, the cards would be removed from beneath the L-shaped protective bridge. This type of movement is ordinarily done in blackjack where the dealer has at most a single card exposed and one card buried face down. In this case, the removal of the cards from over the sensor underneath the L-cover to display the hole card is a natural movement and then exposes the sensor. This can provide a signal to the central processor that the dealer's hand will be receiving all additional cards in that round of the game. The system at this point knows the two initial cards in the dealer's hand, knows the values of the next sequence of cards, and knows the rules by which a dealer must play. The system knows what cards the dealer will receive and what the final total of the dealer's hand will be because the dealer has no freedom of decision or movement in the play of the dealer's hand. When the dealer's hand is placed into the smart discard rack, the discard rack already knows the specifics of the dealer's hand even without having to use the first two cards as an anchor or basis for the dealer's hand. The cards may be treated in this manner in some embodiments.","When the hands are swept from the table, dealer's hand then players' hands from right to left (from the dealer's position or vice-versa if that is the manner of house play), the smart discard rack reads the shoes, identifies the anchors for each hand, knows that no hands swept at the conclusion can exceed a count of twenty-one, and the computer identifies the individual hands and reconciles them with the original data from the smart delivery shoe. The system thereby can identify each hand played and provide system assurance that the hand was played fairly and accurately.","If a lack of reconciling by the system occurs, a number of events can occur. A signal can be given directly to the dealer position, to the pit area, or to a security zone and the cards examined to determine the nature and cause of the error and inspect individual cards if necessary. When the hand and card data is being used for various statistical purposes, such as evaluating dealer efficiency, dealer win\/loss events, player efficiency, player win\/loss events, statistical habits of players, unusual play tactics or meaningful play tactics (e.g., indicative of card counting), and the like, the system may file the particular hand in a \u2018dump\u2019 file so that hand is not used in the statistical analysis, this is to assure that maximum benefits of the analysis are not tilted by erroneous or anomalous data.","Various embodiments may include date stamping of each card dealt (actual time and date defining sequence, with concept of specific identification of sequence identifier possibly being unique). The date stamping may also be replaced by specific sequence stamping or marking, such as a specific hand number, at a specific table, at a specific casino, with a specific number of players, etc. The records could indicate variations of indicators in the stored memory of the central computer of Lucky 777 Casino, Aug. 19, 1995, 8:12:17 a.m., Table 3, position 3, hand 7S\/4D\/9S, or simply identify something similar by alphanumeric code as L7C-819-95-3-3-073-7S\/4D\/9S (073 being the 73hand dealt). This date stamping of hands or even cards in memory can be used as an analytical search tool for security and to enhance hand identification.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0835","num":"0891"},"figref":"FIG. 47","b":["4","8","14","12","18","6","10","16"]},"The use of the discard rack acting to reconcile hands returned to the discard rack out-of-order (e.g., blackjack or bust) automatically may be advantageous, in some embodiments. The software as described above can be programmed to recognize hands removed out-of-dealing order on the basis of knowledge of the anchor cards (the first two cards) known to have been dealt to a specific hand. For example, the software will identify that when a blackjack was dealt to position three, that hand will be removed, the feed of the third hand into the smart card discard tray confirms this, and position three will essentially be ignored in future hand resolution. More importantly, when the anchor cards were, for example, 9S\/5C in the second player position and an exhausted hand of 8D\/9S\/5C is placed into the smart discard rack, that hand will be identified as the hand from the second player position. If two identical hands happen to be dealt in the same round of play, the software will merely be alerted (it knows all of the hands) to specifically check the final order of cards placed into the smart discard rack to more carefully position the location of that exhausted hand. This is merely recognition software implementation once the concept is understood.","That the step of removal of cards from the dealer's sensor or other initiated signal identifies that all further cards are going to the dealer may be useful in defining the edges of play between rounds and in identifying the dealer's hand and the end of a round of play. When the dealer's cards are deposited and read in the smart discard rack, the central computer knows that another round of play is to occur and a mark or note may be established that the following sequence will be a new round and the analytical cycle may begin all over again.","The discard rack indicates that a complete hand has been delivered by absence of additional cards in the Discard Rack in-feed tray. When cards are swept from an early exhausted hand (blackjack or a break), they are swept one at a time and inserted into the smart discard rack one at a time. When the smart discard rack in-feed tray is empty, the system understands that a complete hand has been identified, and the system can reconcile that specific hand with the information from the smart delivery shoe. The system can be hooked-up to feed strategy analysis software programs such as the SMI licensed proprietary Bloodhound\u2122 analysis program.","Various embodiments include a casino or card room game modified to include a progressive jackpot component. During the play of a Twenty-One game, for example, in addition to this normal wager, a player will have the option of making an additional wager that becomes part of, and makes the player eligible to win, the progressive jackpot. If the player's Twenty-One hand comprises a particular, predetermined arrangement of cards, the player will win all, or part of, the amount showing on the progressive jackpot. This progressive jackpot feature is also adaptable to any other casino or card room game such as Draw Poker, Stud Poker, Lo-Ball Poker or Caribbean Stud\u2122 Poker. Various embodiments include a gaming table, such as those used for Twenty-One or poker, modified with the addition of a coin acceptor that is electronically connected to a progressive jackpot meter. When player drops a coin into the coin acceptor, a light is activated at the player's location indicating that he is participating in the progressive jackpot component of the game during that hand. At the same time, a signal from the coin acceptor is sent to the progressive meter to increment the amount shown on the progressive meter. At the conclusion of the play of each hand, the coin acceptor is reset for the next hand. When a player wins all or part of the progressive jackpot, the amount showing on the progressive jackpot meter is reduced by the amount won by the player. Any number of gaming tables can be connected to a single progressive jackpot meter.","Card Shufflers","Various embodiments include an automatic card shuffler, including a card mixer for receiving cards to be shuffled in first and second trays. Sensors detect the presence of cards in these trays to automatically initiate a shuffling operation, in which the cards are conveyed from the trays to a card mixer, which randomly interleaves the cards delivered to the mixing mechanism and deposits the interleaved cards in a vertically aligned card compartment.","A carriage supporting an ejector is reciprocated back and forth in a vertical direction by a reversible linear drive while the cards are being mixed, to constantly move the card ejector along the card receiving compartment. The reversible linear drive is preferably activated upon activation of the mixing means and operates simultaneously with, but independently of, the mixing means. When the shuffling operation is terminated, the linear drive is deactivated thereby randomly positioning the card ejector at a vertical location along the card receiving compartment.","A sensor arranged within the card receiving compartment determines if the stack of cards has reached at least a predetermined vertical height. After the card ejector has stopped and, if the sensor in the compartment determines that the stack of cards has reached at least the aforesaid predetermined height, a mechanism including a motor drive, is activated to move the wedge-shaped card ejector into the card receiving compartment for ejecting a group of the cards in the stack, the group selected being determined by the vertical position attained by the wedge-shaped card ejector.","In various embodiments, the card ejector pushes the group of cards engaged by the ejector outwardly through the forward open end of the compartment, said group of cards being displaced from the remaining cards of the stack, but not being completely or fully ejected from the stack.","The card ejector, upon reaching the end of its ejection stroke, detected by a microswitch, is withdrawn from the card compartment and returned to its initial position in readiness for a subsequent shuffling and card selecting operation.","In various embodiments, a technique for randomly selecting the group of cards to be ejected from the card compartment utilizes solid state electronic circuit means, which may comprise either a group of discrete solid state circuits or a microprocessor, either of which techniques preferably employ a high frequency generator for stepping a N-stage counter during the shuffling operation. When the shuffling operation is completed, the stepping of the counter is terminated. The output of the counter is converted to a DC signal, which is compared against another DC signal representative of the vertical location of the card ejector along the card compartment.","In various embodiments, a random selection is made by incrementing the N-stage counter with a high frequency generator. The high frequency generator is disconnected from the N-stage counter upon termination of the shuffling operation. The N-stage counter is then incremented by a very low frequency generator until it reaches its capacity count and resets. The reciprocating movement of the card ejector is terminated after completion of a time interval of random length and extending from the time the high frequency generator is disconnected from the N-stage counter to the time that the counter is advanced to its capacity count and reset by the low frequency generator, triggering the energization of the reciprocating drive, at which time the card ejector carriage coasts to a stop.","In various embodiments, the card ejector partially ejects a group of cards from the stack in the compartment. The partially displaced group of cards is then manually removed from the compartment. In another preferred embodiment, the ejector fully ejects the group of cards from the compartment, the ejected cards being dropped into a chute, which delivers the cards directly to a dealing shoe. The pressure plate of the dealing shoe is initially withdrawn to a position enabling the cards passing through the delivery shoe to enter directly into the dealing shoe, and is thereafter returned to its original position at which it urges the cards towards the output end of the dealing shoe.","Various embodiments include a method and apparatus for automatically shuffling and cutting playing cards and delivering shuffled and cut playing cards to the dispensing shoe without any human intervention whatsoever once the playing cards are delivered to the shuffling apparatus. In addition, the shuffling operation may be performed as soon as the play of each game is completed, if desired, and simultaneously with the start of a new game, thus totally eliminating the need to shuffle all of the playing cards (which may include six or eight decks, for example) at one time. Preferably, the cards played are collected in a \u201cdead box\u201d and are drawn from the dead box when an adequate number of cards have been accumulated for shuffling and cutting using the methods according to various embodiments.","Various embodiments include a computer controlled shuffling and cutting system provided with a housing having at least one transparent wall making the shuffling and card delivery mechanism easily visible to all players and floor management in casino applications. The housing is provided with a reciprocally slidable playing card pusher which, in the first position, is located outside of said housing. A motor-operated transparent door selectively seals and uncovers an opening in the transparent wall to permit the slidably mounted card pusher to be moved from its aforementioned first position to a second position inside the housing whereupon the slidably mounted card pusher is then withdrawn to the first position, whereupon the playing cards have been deposited upon a motorized platform which moves vertically and selectively in the upward and downward directions.","The motor driven transparent door is lifted to the uncovered position responsive to the proper location of the motor driven platform, detected by suitable sensor means, as well as depression of a foot or hand-operated button accessible to the dealer.","The motor driven platform (or \u201celevator\u201d) lifts the stack of playing cards deposited therein upwardly toward a shuffling mechanism responsive to removal of the slidably mounted card pusher and closure of the transparent door whereupon the playing cards are driven by the shuffling mechanism in opposing directions and away from the stack to first and second card holding magazines positioned on opposing sides of the elevator, said shuffling mechanism comprising motor driven rollers rotatable upon a reciprocating mounting device, the reciprocating speed and roller rotating speed being adjustable. Alternatively, however, the reciprocating and rotating speeds may be fixed; if desired, employing motors having fixed output speeds, in place of the stepper motors employed in one preferred embodiment.","Upon completion of a shuffling operation, the platform is lowered and the stacks of cards in each of the aforementioned receiving compartments are sequentially pushed back onto the moving elevator by suitable motor-driven pushing mechanisms. The order of operation of the pushing mechanisms is made random by use of a random numbers generator employed in the operating computer for controlling the system. These operations can be repeated, if desired. Typically, new cards undergo these operations from two to four times.","Guide assemblies guide the movement of cards onto the platform, prevent shuffled cards from being prematurely returned to the elevator platform and align the cards as they fall into the card receiving regions as well as when they are pushed back onto the elevator platform by the motor-driven pushing mechanism.","Upon completion of the plurality of shuffling and cutting operations, the platform is again lowered, causing the shuffled and cut cards to be moved downwardly toward a movable guide plate having an inclined guide surface.","As the motor driven elevator moves downwardly between the guide plates, the stack of cards engages the inclined guide surface of a substantially U-shaped secondary block member causing the stack to be shifted from a horizontal orientation to a diagonal orientation. Substantially simultaneously therewith, a \u201cdrawbridge-like\u201d assembly comprised of a pair of swingable arms pivotally mounted at their lower ends, are swung downwardly about their pivot pin from a vertical orientation to a diagonal orientation and serve as a diagonally aligned guide path. The diagonally aligned stack of cards slides downwardly along the inclined guide surfaces and onto the draw bridge-like arms and are moved downwardly there along by the U-shaped secondary block member, under control of a stepper motor, to move cards toward and ultimately into the dealing shoe.","A primary block, with a paddle, then moves between the cut-away portion of the U-shaped secondary block, thus applying forward pressure to the stack of cards. The secondary block then retracts to the home position. The paddle is substantially rectangular-shaped and is aligned in a diagonal orientation. Upon initial set-up of the system the paddle is positioned above the path of movement of cards into the dealing shoe. The secondary block moves the cut and shuffled cards into the dealing shoe and the paddle is lowered to the path of movement of cards toward the dealing shoe and is moved against the rearward most card in the stack of cards delivered to the dealing shoe. When shuffling and cutting operations are performed subsequent to the initial set-up, the paddle rests against the rearward most card previously delivered to the dealing shoe. The shuffled and cut cards sliding along the guide surfaces of the diagonally aligned arms of the draw bridge-like mechanism come to rest upon the opposite surface of the paddle which serves to isolate the playing cards previously delivered to the dispensing shoe, as well as providing a slight pushing force urging the cards toward the outlet slot of the dispensing shoe thereby enabling the shuffling and delivering operations to be performed simultaneously with the dispensing of playing cards from the dispensing shoe.","After all of the newly shuffled playing cards have been delivered to the rear end of the dispensing shoe, by means of the U-shaped secondary block the paddle which is sandwiched between two groups of playing cards, is lifted to a position above and displaced from the playing cards. A movable paddle mounting assembly is then moved rearwardly by a motor to place the paddle to the rear of the rearmost playing card just delivered to the dispensing shoe; and the paddle is lowered to its home position, whereupon the motor controlling movement of the paddle assembly is then deenergized enabling the rollingly-mounted assembly supporting the paddle to move diagonally downwardly as playing cards are dispensed from the dispensing shoe to provide a force which is sufficient to urge the playing cards forwardly toward the playing card dispensing slot of the dealing shoe. The force acting upon the paddle assembly is the combination of gravity and a force exerted upon the paddle assembly by a constant tension spring assembly. Jogging (i.e., \u201cdither\u201d) means cause the paddle to be jogged or reciprocated in opposing forward and rearward directions at periodic intervals to assure appropriate alignment, stacking and sliding movement of the stack of playing cards toward the card dispensing slot of the dealing shoe.","Upon completion of a game, the cards used in the completed game are typically collected by the dealer and placed in a dead box on the table. The collected cards are later placed within the reciprocally movable card pusher. The dealer has the option of inserting the cards within the reciprocally slidable card pusher into the shuffling mechanism or, alternatively, and preferably, may postpone a shuffling operation until a greater number of cards have been collected upon the reciprocally slidable card pusher. The shuffling and delivery operations may be performed as often or as infrequently as the dealer or casino management may choose. The shuffling and playing card delivery operations are fully automatic and are performed without human intervention as soon as cards are inserted within the machine on the elevator platform. The cards are always within the unobstructed view of the players to enable the players, as well as the dealer, to observe and thereby be assured that the shuffling, cutting and card delivery operations are being performed properly and without jamming and that the equipment is working properly as well. The shuffling and card delivery operations do not conflict or interfere with the dispensing of cards from the dispensing shoe, thereby permitting these operations to be performed substantially simultaneously, thus significantly reducing the amount of time devoted to shuffling and thereby greatly increasing the playing time, as well as providing a highly efficient random shuffling and cutting mechanism.","The system is controlled by a microcomputer programmed to control the operations of the card shuffling and cutting system. The computer controls stepper motors through motor drive circuits, intelligent controllers and an opto-isolator linking the intelligent controllers to the computer. The computer also monitors a plurality of sensors to assure proper operation of each of the mechanisms of the system.","Casino Countermeasures","Some methods of thwarting card counters include using a large number of decks. Shoes containing 6 or 8 decks are common. The more cards there are, the less variation there is in the proportions of the remaining cards and the harder it is to count them. The player's advantage can also be reduced by shuffling the cards more frequently, but this reduces the amount of time that can be devoting to actual play and therefore reduces the casino profits. Some casinos now use shuffling machines, some of which shuffle one set of cards while another is in play, while others continuously shuffle the cards. The distractions of the gaming floor environment and complimentary alcoholic beverages also act to thwart card counters. Some methods of thwarting card counters include using varied payoff structures, such Blackjack payoff of 6:5, which is more disadvantageous to the player than the standard 3:2 Blackjack payoff.","Video Wagering Games","Video wagering games are set up to mimic a table game using adaptations of table games rules and cards.","In one version of video poker the player is allowed to inspect five cards randomly chosen by the computer. These cards are displayed on the video screen and the player chooses which cards, if any, that he or she wishes to hold. If the player wishes to hold all of the cards, i.e., stand, he or she presses a STAND button. If the player wishes to hold only some of the cards, he or she chooses the cards to be held by pressing HOLD keys located directly under each card displayed on the video screen. Pushing a DEAL button after choosing the HOLD cards automatically and simultaneously replaces the unchosen cards with additional cards which are randomly selected from the remainder of the deck. After the STAND button is pushed, or the cards are replaced, the final holding is evaluated by the game machine's computer and the player is awarded either play credits or a coin payout as determined from a payoff table. This payoff table is stored in the machine's computer memory and is also displayed on the machine's screen. Hands with higher poker values are awarded more credits or coins. Very rare poker hands are awarded payoffs of 800-to-1 or higher.","Alternative Technologies","It will be understood that the technologies described herein for making, using, or practicing various embodiments are but a subset of the possible technologies that may be used for the same or similar purposes. The particular technologies described herein are not to be construed as limiting. Rather, various embodiments contemplate alternate technologies for making, using, or practicing various embodiments.","The following patents and patent applications are hereby incorporated by reference herein for all purposes:\n\n","In various embodiments, a secondary player may include a person who places bets on the games of other people (primary players) but does not directly participate in the game himself. The secondary player may thus be remote from the place where a game is actually played. The secondary player may nevertheless view information about the game, such as from a video feed. A secondary player may also play in games of his own using the outcomes generated at the games of primary players.","In various embodiments, a player, such as a secondary player, may engage in gaming activities using a station, workstation, or terminal that has multiple displays. The displays may be monitors. The displays may include liquid crystal displays (LCDs), plasma screens, cathode ray tube displays, or any other displays. The terminal may include various other components. One or more keyboards may include buttons, touch pads, or other devices for receiving inputs from a secondary player. The keyboard may have dedicated keys with certain functions, such as shortcut functions. The terminal may include an audio communication channel, such as a telephone, an internet connection that supports voice, or any other communications channel. The terminal may include one or more touch screens. Touch screens may correspond to display screens.  shows a terminal, according to various embodiments.","Changing Sizes of Windows or Feeds.","In various embodiments, display screens of a terminal may display windows. A window may be a geometrical region of a display screen that shows related information within the region. For example, a window may show information about a particular game, such as a game from a particular primary player or from a particular slot machine. The window may be rectangular or some other shape. The window may be resized, such as to fill an entire display screen or to fill even more than one display screen. A window may also be resized to a relatively small size. Windows may be closed completely. New windows (e.g., windows showing information about a new type of game) may be opened. Windows may be stacked on top of one another. Windows may have various other relationships. Each window may have a different type of information. Each window, for example, may show information from the game of a different primary player. A window may feature games from a particular gaming device. A window may feature games from a particular game table. A window may feature statistics from around the casino (e.g., which are the top performing gaming devices; e.g., who is the fastest dealer; e.g., what is the longest winning streak in a game of roulette). A window may feature sports scores. A window may feature video feeds, such as video of a sporting event, video of a primary player, video of game table, or any other video. A window may feature game simulations, such as simulated reenactments of games.","Customized Window Arrangement.","In various embodiments, a secondary player may have the opportunity to create or open new windows, to resize windows, and to move windows around. The secondary player may also have the opportunity to alter other properties of a window, such as its border color, background color, title bar, or any other properties. A secondary player may thus come to arrive at an arrangement of windows which he finds convenient, comfortable, or otherwise preferable. The secondary player's preferred arrangement of windows, including his preferred windows and\/or preferred information to have in windows may be stored. The preferred arrangement may be stored with a terminal, with the casino server, or with the secondary player (e.g., in a portable flash drive or other medium in the possession of the secondary player). A given secondary player may thus leave a terminal and allow other secondary players to use the terminal, where each of the other secondary players has different preferences for window arrangements. The given secondary player may return to the terminal and have his preferred window arrangement automatically called up onto the display screens of the terminal.","A preferred window arrangement may include a specification of which windows a secondary player wants to view. For example, a secondary player may wish to view a window which shows a video feed from a particular craps table, another window which shows game outcomes form a particular bank of slot machines, another window which shows the secondary player's own credit balance and winnings history, another window which shows the top 50 primary players (in terms of net winnings over the last hour) who are currently playing in the casino, and another window which shows movies. A preferred window arrangement may include a specification of the position windows should take within one or more display screens of a terminal. For example, a first window and second window may go in a first display screen, a third window may take up an entire second display screen, a fourth window may occupy another two display screens, and a fifth, sixth and seventh windows may share another display screen. A preferred window arrangement may also include a specification of the position of windows within particular display screens. For example, a first window may be positioned in the top half of a display screen, a second window may be positioned in the lower left hand quadrant of the display screen, and a third window may be positioned in the lower right hand quadrant of the display screen.","In various embodiments, a terminal may include a button, key, or other input device which allows a secondary player to store his preferred window arrangement. The secondary player may press the button to store the arrangement. The secondary player may further provide a name for the arrangement. Thus, the secondary player may have the ability to store multiple arrangements, each under different names. When the secondary player first sits down at a terminal, the secondary player may present identifying information, such as by presenting a player tracking card (e.g., inserting the player tracking card into a card reader of the terminal). The terminal may then display a message for the secondary player asking if the secondary player would like to load a preferred window arrangement. The secondary player may be shown a list of saved window arrangements. The secondary player may then select one arrangement from the list, and the arrangement may be recreated for the secondary player.","In various embodiments, a secondary player may specify a preferred window arrangement using a device other than a terminal. For example, a secondary player may configure a preferred window arrangement on his home computer. The home computer may display, for example, a simulation of the terminal. The player may then create simulated windows and arrange the simulated windows in a preferred arrangement. The player may store such preferred arrangement with the casino server for example. When the secondary player subsequently visits a terminal (e.g., at a casino), the secondary player may load his preferred window arrangement into a terminal.","The Hardware.","A terminal may include one or more displays. Displays may be mounted on movable arms. For example, each display may be mounted on its own adjustable arm. Thus, the display may be repositioned by a secondary player to suit his viewing preferences. A secondary player may position multiple displays in order to arrive at his preferred arrangement. For example, a secondary player may arrange four displays so that they are stacked vertically, so that they form a horizontal row of displays, or so that they form a two by two grid, for example. In various embodiments, displays may be mounted in fixed relation to one another. For example, six displays may be fixed to a rigid, concave metal structure, so that together they form a \u201cC\u201d shape around a secondary player. A terminal may include one or more keyboards. A keyboard may include the \u201cqwerty\u201d arrangement of keys, or may include some other key arrangement. A keyboard may have keys with specific functions related to gaming. A terminal may include other buttons or input devices. A terminal may include a computer processor, computer memory, a communications port for communicating with a network, an antenna or other transceiver for communicating wirelessly, a card reader (e.g., a magnetic stripe card reader; e.g., an RFID reader), audio output devices (e.g., speakers, e.g., headphones), audio input devices (e.g., microphones, e.g., telephone handsets), a chair or bench, a desk, a radio (e.g., a radio for listening to broadcast sports events), and any other pertinent devices. A terminal may further include components for gaming directly at the terminal. A terminal may include a built-in gaming device or may function as a gaming device. For example, a terminal may include coin and bill acceptors, a random number generator, buttons for placing bets, a coin dispenser, a coin tray, a printer, a ticket-in-ticket-out (TITO) printer, a TITO reader, mechanical reels, and\/or hardware for conducting a bonus game (e.g., a terminal may include a physical wheel for conducting the bonus round of a Wheel-of-Fortune game). A terminal may include software with various functions. Game software may allow a person to play as a primary player, e.g., to play a game directly at the terminal. Some software may also provide an interface for a secondary player to place bets on games played elsewhere, e.g., games played by primary players. Software may further include software for displaying video feeds, such as feeds from sporting events or the games of primary players. Software may further include software for displaying outcomes generated in games played elsewhere. Software may further include software for allowing communication between the terminal and a network, such as the Internet, a cellular phone network, and\/or a telephone network. Software may further include any other software for operating the terminal or associated devices in accordance with various embodiments.","Displays are Stacked. Displays are Movable with Respect to One Another.","In some embodiments, displays are all attached to a single rigid body. The body may include a desk, a stand, or a housing which encloses computer hardware used to operate the terminal. The displays may be attached to the body via jointed or flexible arms. For example, a display may be attached to the body via a metal arm with a joint in it. A person may be able to adjust the position of a display by pulling or pushing on it, thereby flexing or contracting the metal arm holding the display. A display may be mounted on a rotatable joint so that it may be oriented facing up or down, facing to one side or the other, or any combination of the above. In some embodiments, displays may be attached to one another. For example, two square displays may be connected at a side by a hinge. Thus, the displays may be folded to face more towards each other or more away from one another. In various embodiments, displays may be attached to a backboard or other rigid body. Their position may be relatively fixed, but their orientation may be adjustable. In various embodiments, displays may be flexible. Thus, a secondary player may bend a display. For example, a large flexible display may be bent to form a semicircle around a secondary player. In some embodiments, displays may be transparent or translucent. One display may be positioned in front of another display. Thus, the player may be able to see some of both displays in the same field of vision.","Position of Displays can be Saved.","In various embodiments, a player at a terminal may save or record a particular arrangement of displays, keyboards, or other hardware. The arrangement may be stored with the terminal or with the casino server, for example. When a player returns to a terminal after an absence, or if the player comes to a new terminal, the player's stored settings may be recovered. The hardware of the terminal may then be brought into position automatically. For example, arms holding displays may be motorized and under computer control. The motors may thus be operated in such a manner as to bring the displays into the preferred arrangement of the player.","Displays Functioning as One.","In some embodiments, two or more displays may function as a single display. A graphic, window, or other image may begin on one display and continue on another display. A player may be able to move a window from one display screen onto another in a seamless motion. For example, a player may be able to use a mouse to drag a window from one display screen to an adjacent screen. In some embodiments, screens or the supporting structures for screens may include position sensors. For example, the joints on the arms supporting screens may include sensors for detecting the angles in the joints. Based on angles of the joints, software may be used to calculate the positions of the screens. Based on the positions of the displays, it may be determined which displays are near to each other or next to each other, and thus it may be determined how a single image should be displayed on multiple displays. For example, parts of the image that are adjacent to one another should be displayed on adjacent screens.","Special Keyboards.","A terminal may include one or more keyboards, keypads, buttons, or other input devices. Certain keys may have specific functions.","Functions of Keys.","A key may be used to open up a specific line of communication (e.g., to another player, e.g., to a casino representative), to call up a video feed for viewing, to call up information about a game for viewing (e.g., what is the current outcome, e.g., what were the last five outcomes), to call up a broadcast for viewing or listening, or for any other function. In various embodiments, a key may have a function as a preprogrammed or default function. In various embodiments, a key may be configured or programmed to perform a function. For example, a secondary player may configure a key to open up a line of communication with a specific friend of the secondary player.","Lines of Communication.","A key (e.g., a button) may open up a line of communication. The line of communication may be one-way, two-way, or multi-way. The line of communication may take the form of audio, text, video, or any combination of audio, text, and video. A key may open up a line of communication between the secondary player and another person, such as a friend of the secondary player or a casino representative. In some embodiments, a secondary player may configure a key to open a line of communication to a specific person. The secondary player may provide the name of the specific person, an identifier for the specific person (e.g., a player tracking card number) or any other information about the other person. The secondary player may visit a special window where a list of keys or buttons is provided, and the player is given the chance to enter names of people that he wishes to contact with the press of a button. A key or button may have a small display associated with it. On the display may appear the name of the person or the party with whom a line of communication is opened once the button is pressed. For example, once a secondary player has entered the name \u201cJoe Smith\u201d of his friend, the name \u201cJoe Smith\u201d may be displayed on or near a button. This may remind the secondary player that the particular button will open up a line of communication with Joe Smith.","In various embodiments, a key or button may open a line of communication with a casino representative. The secondary player may press such a button to order a drink, order food, request service to the terminal, request payment for jackpot, of for any other purpose. The secondary player may also initiate contact with a casino representative for information unrelated to a specific game. For example, the secondary player may wish to make a reservation a restaurant, may wish to find out when a restaurant closes, may wish to purchase show tickets, or may wish to seek out any other information or perform any other task.","In a one-way line of communication, for example, a secondary player may receive a video feed, audio feed, or may receive information in some other format. Information received may pertain to a game on which the secondary player is betting (e.g., to a slot machine game of a primary player playing in some other part of a casino), to a sports game, to a horse race, to general weather information, to general information about a casino (e.g., to when a swimming pool closes), to general news (e.g., to local news, e.g., to world news), or to any other activity or events. In various embodiments, a secondary player may be the one communicating in a one-way line of communication. The secondary player may, for example, open up a voice line to place an order for a drink. The player's request may be recorded at the other end of the line, and may then be forwarded to a waiter or waitress in whose area the secondary player is located.","In a two-way line of communication, a player (e.g., a secondary player), may communicate with another person (e.g., a friend of the player, e.g., a casino representative). Video and\/or voice from both parties may be transmitted back and forth via a network, such as via a casino intranet via the Internet or such.","In some embodiments, a player (e.g., a secondary player) may be able to open up multiple lines of communication at once. For example, a secondary player may be speaking to his friend Joe via one line of two-way voice communication, to his friend Sam via another line of two-way voice communication, and to his friend Bill via a two-way voice and video line of communication. The secondary player may be able to customize each line of communication on the fly. For example, the secondary player may be able to mute two lines of communication so he can speak to his friend Bill without the other friends on the line hearing him. The secondary player may also be able to change a line of communication from solely audio to audio and video, from video to audio, from two-way to multi-way, or to alter lines of communication in any other fashion. For example, a secondary player may be speaking to three friends, each over different lines of communication. The secondary player may be able to merge the lines of communication so that now the friends can hear and talk to each other rather than just hear and talk to the secondary player.","Keys to Specific Games.","In various embodiments, feeds containing information about games may be available to a secondary player. A feed about a game may include a video feed of a particular game. For example, there may be a video feed of a high limit baccarat game available. A feed about game may include a feed with simulated reenactments of a game. For example, a feed may contain animated slot reels spinning to reveal an actual outcome that occurred at a slot machine. A feed about a game may include summary information. The information may be presented in the form of text, graphic, or video. The summary information may include, for example, an indication of an amount bet, an outcome achieved, an amount won, a number of pay lines played, which pay lines won, whether a bonus round was reached, what decisions were made in a bonus round, what decisions were made in the game at any decision juncture, and any other pertinent information. A feed may include video of a primary player. For example, the secondary player may be able to watch footage of a primary player as he plays a game. A feed may include footage for active games. For example, video footage may alternate originating from several different primary players, depending on who is currently involved in a game, depending on who currently has to make a decision in a game, depending on whether a game is near resolution, and so on.","A key may be configured or programmed to always call up a feed for a particular gaming device. A key may be configured or programmed to always call up a feed for a particular gaming table, to always call up a feed for a particular group of tables (e.g., the feed may show information about the outcomes of every game at the group of tables), to always call up a feed for a group of gaming devices (e.g., the feed may show information about the outcomes of every game occurring at the group of gaming devices), to always call up a feed for a particular area of a casino (e.g., the feed may show information about the outcomes of every game for the particular area of the casino), or to call up a feed for any other group of gaming devices or game tables.","In various embodiments, a secondary player may desire ready access to information about a certain preferred game or games. Thus, a single key or button may be configured to call up, when pressed, information about the preferred game or games.","In various embodiments, when information is called up, it may be displayed on one of the display screen of the terminal. Such information may occupy an entire screen, or it may occupy a portion of a screen, such as window within a screen.","Keys for Latest Updates.","In various embodiments, a key or button may be pressed by a secondary player to call up an update about a game, primary player, gaming device, dealer, or other object, entity, or events in which the secondary player is interested. For example, a secondary player may press a key that will caused to be displayed on a screen the most recent outcomes at a particular blackjack table. As another example, a secondary player may press a key that will cause to be displayed on a screen the most recent outcomes which have occurred across a casino and which have paid more than $200. As another example, a player may press a key that will cause to be displayed the ten most recent rolls of the dice at a craps table. In various embodiments, a secondary player may press a key which causes an update to be provided. The update may appear in a window of one of the display screens of the terminal, for example. The update may disappear after some period of time, e.g., after 30 seconds. In some embodiments, the update may remain until the player again presses the key which brought the update in the first place. The window or screen showing the update may be continuously updated or may be static. Thus, in various embodiments, a secondary player may press a key to get updated information about a table, player, etc. However, the information may represent a small snapshot of the latest information and may not represent a continuous information feed of new information as it happens.","Keyboard has Different Channels.","In various embodiments, a keyboard may have keys, buttons, or special key combinations which correspond to channels. A channel may be a broadcast or one-way line of communication. A channel may present information related to a particular topic, such as related to a particular type of game, to a particular type of player (e.g., high rollers), or to some other subject or topic. A channel may present video feeds, statistics, game commentary, strategy information, or any other information.","Video Poker Channel.","In various embodiments, a video poker channel may exist. The channel may broadcast information about one or more video poker games. The channel may present lists of final outcomes as they occur throughout a casino. For example, the video poker channel may present a scrolling list with outcomes, \u201cAs 3d 4c Ac Js; 9h 9d 3s 3c Ks; As Ks Qh Jd 10c . . . \u201d Such outcomes may be outcomes that have occurred most recently at video poker games in a casino. A channel may include a scrolling list with cards dealt, with payouts won, with decisions made, or with any other items of information. A channel may include video footage. The video footage may switch from one game to another. For example, an announcer may say, \u201cLet us now go to John's game where he has just been dealt three cards to a royal flush . . . \u201d Video footage may then be shown of John's game. At any given moment, there may be a number of games that could be featured on a channel. Some games might be shown in one form or another, such as in the form of a video feed, in the form of a text description, or in any other form, while some games may not be shown. Games that are shown may match one or more criteria. Such criteria may include: (a) a game had a high bet; (b) a game is being played by a skillful player (e.g., by a player who uses optimal strategy more than 80% of the time); (c) a game is being played by a primary player who has won more than a certain amount of money in the last hour; (d) a game has the potential to yield a high paying final outcome (e.g., an intermediate outcome has been dealt with four cards to a royal flush); (e) a game is played by a primary player that is popular (e.g., that has been rated highly in surveys of secondary players); (f) a game has been bet on by more than a predetermined number of secondary players; (g) a game has more than a certain amount of money bet on it by secondary players; and any other criteria.","More specific channels may exist. For example, there may be a channel dedicated to $1 video poker, to multi-hand video poker, to video poker games played in Las Vegas, to video poker games played in the last hour, or to Jacks-or-Better video poker.","A channel may show live information. A channel may also show historical information. For example, a video poker channel may show the best games from the last week, of games played last year.","Sports Book Channel.","A sports book channel may show information about various sporting events, such as baseball games, basketball games, horse races, car races, golf tournaments, or any other sporting events or contests. The information may be presented as a text description of scores. For example, the most recent scores of various games may be scrolled across a screen. A sports book channel may show video feeds of various games, or highlights of various games. A sports book channel may selectively show footage from one game over another for various reasons. Footage of a particular game may be shown if: (a) there is a significant amount of money bet on the game by secondary players (e.g., more than a certain amount of money in aggregate, e.g., more money is bet on the game than on another game which is not shown); (b) there are more than a certain number of secondary players betting on the game; (c) the game is close (e.g., the scores of the opponents in the game are close; e.g., the horses in a race are neck and neck); (d) the game is nearing a resolution, or for any other reason.","Personalized Channel.","In various embodiments, a channel may be a one-way communication of information to a secondary player. The channel may be customized to the particular player, however. Thus, two different secondary players who are watching the Blackjack Channel, for example, may still receive different sets of information. A channel may be customized to show information about a game that a particular secondary player is betting on, to show information about a game that may be considered relevant to a secondary player based on information about the secondary player (e.g., a sports game may be shown to the secondary player if the secondary player's home team is playing), to show to the secondary player information about a game played by primary players with similar demographics to those of the secondary player, to show the secondary player information about a game played near his hometown (e.g., if the secondary player is from Mississippi, a game from a Mississippi casino may be shown), to show the secondary player information about a game in which the secondary player had previously expressed interest (e.g., if a secondary player previously has made bets on the games played at a particular gaming device, then games played at that same gaming device may be shown to the secondary player on his personalized channel.","In various embodiments, a secondary player may be asked what he would like to see or hear on a particular channel. The secondary player might then select particular types of games (e.g., video poker, e.g., Monopoly Slots), particular primary players, particular tables, particular dealers, particular areas in a casino, particular types of strategies (e.g., the secondary player wants a channel to show only primary players using a particular type of strategy, such as basic strategy), particular stages in games (e.g., the secondary player selects that a channel show only bonus rounds for games; e.g., the secondary player selects that a channel should only show games after an intermediate outcome has occurred, such as after the first two cards in blackjack have been dealt), games with certain types of outcomes (e.g., the secondary player selects that a channel should show only outcomes that have a payout of more than $100; e.g., the secondary player selects that a channel should show only outcomes where the ace of spades is present; e.g., the secondary player selects that a channel should only show games where a primary player has three cards to a royal flush), games played by certain teams (e.g., the secondary player may select that a channel only show baseball games from the National League; e.g., the secondary player may select that a channel only show college basketball games), or the secondary player may select or specify any other type of content to be in his personalized channel. The player may select content from a menu (e.g., the player may select a type of game from a menu containing different types of games), the player may specify desired content using text, or the player may specify desired content using any other format. The secondary player may have the opportunity to name the channel. For example, the player might name a channel \u201cBonus Rounds\u201d, \u201cTop Winning Primary Players\u201d, \u201cCraps Games\u201d, \u201cHigh Payout Games\u201d, or any other name.","Specific Table (I Like Blackjack Table X).","In various embodiments, a channel may present games or information from a particular gaming table. For example, a channel may present games from a particular blackjack table. The channel may show video footage of the game. Video footage may be shown from overtop the table. Video footage may be shown which focuses on individual players at the table (e.g., video may focus on the face of one of the primary players). Video footage may be shown which focuses on the dealer. Footage may be shown which focuses on particular hands, particular cards, on chip stacks of various players, or on any other aspect of a table. A channel for a table may feature statistics about the table, including percentages of hands won by players in the last hour, including net winnings of the primary players, including the percentage of blackjacks achieved at the table in the last hour, or any other statistics. A channel for a table may feature statistics about rolls of dice (e.g., at a craps table), about outcomes at a roulette wheel (e.g., a statistic may indicate the percentage of \u201cblack\u201d outcomes that occurred in the last 100 spins of a roulette wheel), or statistics about any other event or events at a gaming table.","Keys to Specific Players.","In some embodiments, a secondary player may press a key or button to receive information about a specific primary player. Pressing such a key or button may allow the secondary player to see a video feed of the primary player's game, to see a video feed of the primary player himself (e.g., a video feed of the primary player's face), to see simulated renditions of the games of the primary player, to see statistics about the primary player (e.g., lifetime net winnings for the primary player), to see recent statistics for the primary player (e.g., net winnings for the primary player in the last hour), and to see any other information related to the primary player. In various embodiments, a key pressed by the secondary player may allow the secondary player to open up a line of communication with a primary player, such as an audio line of communication.","Keys to Specific Gaming Devices.","In some embodiments, a secondary player may press a key to receive information about a specific gaming device.

In various embodiments, pressing a key or button may allow a secondary player to open up a communication channel with a gaming device. For example, the secondary player may be able to engage in audio communication with a primary player at the gaming device.","Keys to a Specific Game Table.","In various embodiments, pressing a key or button may allow a secondary player to receive information about a specific gaming table. For example, the secondary player may receive a video feed from the gaming table, an indication of who the dealer is, an indication of who the primary players are, statistics about what cards were dealt, statistics about what outcomes occurred, statistics about the percentage of time that primary players have won versus the percentage of time that the dealer has won, statistics about what strategy has been used at the table, or any other information about the table. The key may allow a secondary player to open up a line of communication with the table, such as a line of communication with one or more of the primary players at the table, or such as a line of communication with the dealer at the table.","Keys to Specific Sporting Events.","In various embodiments, a button or key may give a secondary player access to information about a particular sporting event. For example, a secondary player may press a key to watch a video feed of a baseball game between the Yankees and the Red Sox. When the sports game goes to commercial, the secondary player may press another button which calls up another sporting event. In various embodiments, a secondary player may select a viewing angle for a sporting event. For example, a sporting event may have multiple cameras capturing the action. The secondary player may be able to press a first button to see a feed from a first camera, a second button to see a feed from a second camera, and so on. For example, in a tennis match, one button may correspond to a view from mid-court, while another button may correspond to a view from the back of one side of the court. In some embodiments, a key may allow a secondary player to switch the commentator for a feed, broadcast, or channel. For example, a secondary player may be viewing a feed from a sporting event. The secondary player may press a key to change the audio from one sports commentator to another commentator. A secondary player may also change the commentator for another type of event. For example, a commentator may comment on the strategy of primary players from a table game of blackjack. A secondary player may decide he doesn't like the commentator and may switch to a new commentator. The switch may occur at the press of a button or key, through a menu selection, or through some other means.","Functional Keys for Video Feeds.","In some embodiments, keys may have specialized functions for controlling video. Various keys may allow a secondary player to zoom in or zoom out. Various keys may allow a player to pan, to tilt, to increase or decrease the viewing angle, to filter out one or more objects in a video feed, to increase or decrease contrast, to increase or decrease brightness. If audio is present, a key may allow a secondary player to filter out certain audio sources (e.g., a secondary player may wish to filter out the voices of certain basketball players to hone in on the voice of his favorite basketball player). Various keys may allow the secondary player to freeze a video, to play the video in slow motion, to play the video backwards, or to play a video in fast forward. Various keys may allow for other manipulation of video or audio.","Programmable Keys. Shortcut Keys.","A button or key may be programmable or configurable to call up any type of information, or to perform any other function. For example, a secondary player may program a button to bring up information about his preferred gaming table, about his preferred primary player, about his preferred outcomes, or about anything else. A secondary player may configure a button to open up a line of communication with a specific other person, with a specific gaming device, with a specific game table, or with any other specific counterparty. A secondary player may configure a button to put in a request. For example, a button may be configured such that if the button is pressed a martini will be ordered for the secondary player.","Keys that Provide Messages or Alerts.","In various embodiments, a button or key may change color, flash, or otherwise draw attention. A secondary player may then press the button or key to open up a line of communication, to call up particular information, to view a particular channel (e.g., a video poker channel) or to perform any other function. The button may flash or draw attention when some event of potential interest, importance, or significance has transpired which might warrant the attention of the secondary player. For example, the button may be configured to call up a bonus round channel on screen. The button may flash when a primary player somewhere in a casino has reached the final round of a bonus round. The secondary player may be motivate to press the button when it flashes so as to watch the final round of the bonus round which is occurring. The secondary player may be welcome to press the button at times when it is not flashing as well in order to see information about bonus rounds around the casino. However, the secondary player may be especially motivated to press the button when it is flashing.","Specialized Keys Dedicated to Different Games.","A terminal may include specialized or dedicated buttons or keys, where such buttons or keys are specialized for particular games, for particular types of bets, or for any other specialized function. One set of keys may be for placing bets on games of video poker. One set of keys may be for placing bets on a game of blackjack. Other sets of keys may include keys for placing bets on games of roulette, keys for placing bets on games of poker (e.g., Texas Hold'em poker), keys for placing bets on craps, keys for placing bets on slot machine games, keys for placing bets on keno games, keys for placing bets on baccarat games, or keys for placing bets on any other types of games. Specialized keys may be used when a player at a terminal acts as a secondary player. Specialized keys may be used when a player at a terminal acts as a primary player.","A specialized set of keys for roulette may include a key for placing a bet on \u201cred\u201d a key for placing a bet on \u201cblack\u201d a key for placing a bet on odd numbers, a key for placing a bet on even numbers, a key for each number on the roulette wheel, and a key for any other roulette related bet. A player at a terminal who desires to play or to participate in a game of roulette may thus conveniently use the dedicated keys at the terminal for making roulette bets. A complete roulette bet may be specified using two keys for example, a first key may specify a bet amount (e.g., 5 credits) and a second key may specify the bet type (e.g., \u201cred\u201d). A complete bet may also be specified using a single dedicated key. Pressing the key may be tantamount to instructions to bet 5 on red. In various embodiments, a bet amount may be understood, such as by default. For example, where a bet amount is unspecified, the same bet amount from the previous game may be used. Thus, for example, a player may press a dedicated \u201cred\u201d key to bet 5 credits on red if the player's prior bet had also been 5 credits.","Dedicated keys for a game of video poker may include five different \u201chold\u201d keys, each key corresponding to a different hand position. A dedicated key, in any game, may also correspond to a strategy. For example, in video poker, there may be a key which directs the strategy with the highest expected winnings to be executed. By pressing such a key, the player allows software (e.g., software residing on the terminal or software residing with the casino server) to decide which cards to hold and which cards to discard based on a calculation of which leads to the highest expected winnings. In a game of blackjack, a dedicated key may be pressed to play basic strategy.","In a game of craps, dedicated keys may allow a player to make a \u201cpass\u201d or \u201cdon't pass\u201d bet, or to make any other craps specific bet.","A key may be configured to perform one task. For example, a key may be configured to always place a certain type of bet, when pressed. However, in various embodiments, a key may be reprogrammed to perform another dedicated task. For example, a key that used to always place a bet of 5 on black may be used to now place a bet of 10 on red.","Keys Dedicated to Different Types of Bets. Keys Customizable for Different Types of Bets. E.g., Customize a Key for \u201cBet 7 Lines and 10 Cents on Each Line\u201d. Or Customize a Key that Says, \u201cBet that Primary Player Joe Will Fold\u201d.","In various embodiments, keys may be customized for particular types of bets. A player may prefer a certain bet that is generally not easily selected or described. For example, a secondary player may wish to place a bet on 7 pay lines in a slot machine game and to bet a quarter per payline on five of the pay lines and to bet a dollar per payline on the other two lines. The secondary player may program a key to make just this desired bet, or to make any other desired bet. Thus, the player may save himself the trouble of entering intricate instructions each time he wishes to place a bet. In various embodiments, a player may at a first point in time enter detailed instructions for making a complicated bet. The player may then have the opportunity to save the bet. For example, the terminal may display a message for the player asking the player whether he would like to save the bet he just made or just entered. The player may indicate that he would. The terminal may give the secondary player the option of saving the bet to a particular button. For example, the terminal may give the player the option of associating a particular button on the terminal with the bet, so that the player may subsequently simply press the button once in order to make the bet. (In some embodiments, the bet does not take effect until the player confirms or actually initiates a game subsequent to making the bet). In some embodiments, a terminal may store a list of bets made recently by a player at the terminal. For example, the terminal may store the 10 or 50 most recent bets made by the player. The player may have the opportunity to see a list of recent bets and to select one from the list. For example, the player may use a mouse or arrow keys to navigate through a list of recent bets and to select one of them. The player may then make the bet again without having to reenter the bet.","Keys Particular to Display Screens.","In various embodiments, a key may correspond to a particular display screen. Pressing the key may somehow activate the corresponding display screen. For example, pressing the key may cause a mouse pointer to appear in the corresponding display screen, so that the player may now select or click on items shown in that display screen. In some embodiments, a player may be playing multiple games simultaneously, with different display screens showing different games. The player may wish to initiate a new game which is shown in a particular screen. Thus, the player may press a button which activates the screen. The player may then use a general set of betting keys to make a bet in that game and to initiate play of the game. The player may then press another key corresponding to another display screen. The new display screen may be activated. The player may then use the same general set of betting keys to activate to make a bet for the game shown in the new display screen.","Pictures.","In various embodiments, a player may have his own photos loaded onto a terminal. For example, the six screens of a terminal may each show a picture of a different one of the secondary player's grand children. The secondary player may bring his photos to a terminal using a portable device, such as an MP3 player. The player may also download photos from a photo sharing web site, such as Flickr.","Other Special Input Devices. Joystick.","A terminal may have various input devices. These may include joysticks, touch pads, track balls, touch screens, microphones, cameras (e.g., a player may make hand signals to issue commands to the terminal, where such hand signals are picked up by the camera and interpreted by software), foot pedals, electronic pads for recognizing handwriting, or any other input devices. A terminal may include input devices of the same type found on some gaming devices. For example, a terminal may include a handle that can be pulled like the handle of a slot machine. Pulling such a handle may cause the secondary player to bet on the game of a primary player.","How do we Make Sure that People can't Beat on these Things and Destroy Them?","In various embodiments, a terminal may contain expensive or fragile equipment. For example, the terminal may contain multiple buttons and display screens. In various embodiments, sensors may detect behavior which is dangerous to the equipment, such as hitting or banging. For example, vibration or pressure sensors may sense sudden shocks to the equipment. In various embodiments, a camera may monitor areas surrounding the terminal. For example, a camera may monitor the area where a secondary player normally sits or stands. The camera or various sensors may trigger an alert when dangerous behavior is detected or perceived. A casino employee may be alerted to visit the terminal upon detection of potentially dangerous or harmful behavior. The casino employee may be able to ask the secondary player what happened. If necessary, the casino employee may ask the secondary player to refrain from certain behavior. In some embodiments, if potentially harmful behavior is detected at a terminal, a communication line may be opened up between the terminal and a casino employee, such as a security guard. The casino employee may then have the opportunity to talk to the secondary player, ask him what is happening, and perhaps ask the secondary player to refrain from certain potentially damaging behaviors.","Ticker. Ticker of Statistics of Interest. Red\/Black Casino Wide. House Versus Player Casino Wide. Many Other Things Displayed can be Displayed in Ticker Form.","In various embodiments, a display of a ticker may be shown on one or more display screens. The ticker may comprise a band on one or more display screens, with information moving across the band (e.g., from left to right). The band may have a particular color, such as green, or a particular pattern, or any other markings to distinguish it from surrounding graphics or to put on the appearance of a ticker tape. The ticker may contain various information. The ticker may include statistics about games at a casino or at multiple casinos. For example, a ticker may indicate the number of red outcomes that have occurred in roulette across the casino in the last five minutes, the number of black outcomes that have occurred in the last five minutes, the number of sevens that have been rolled in craps in the last hour, the number of times players have busted in blackjack in the last hour, the number of times the jackpot has paid out at any slot machine in the last twenty minutes, the names of the five players with the most winnings in the last hour, the size of a progressive jackpot, the scores in a sports game, or any other statistic. A ticker may vary or be customized in many ways. A ticker may span one display screen or it may continue across two or more display screens. A ticker may even span less than one display screen. A ticker may be wide or narrow. A ticker may run horizontally, vertically, or along a diagonal. A ticker may proceed quickly (e.g., information may go from one side to the other quickly) or slowly. A ticker may appear as red, blue, or any other color. A ticker may have font in yellow, green, or any other color. There may be more than one ticker. For example, tickers may run in parallel across a display screen, or there may be two different tickers on two different displays screens.","A ticker may be customized in various ways. A secondary player may alter the sizes, background colors, font colors, font sizes or any other aspect of a ticker. A secondary player may specify which statistics or other information he wishes to be on the ticker. For example, the secondary player may indicate that he wants statistics only about slot machines and craps. Another secondary player may indicate that he wants statistics describing the winnings of the top 50 players of the most recent hour. Another player may indicate the he wishes to see the scores from sports games currently going on.","In some embodiments, certain ticker feeds may exist and may be available to one or more secondary players in a casino. There may be a blackjack ticker, a craps ticker, a sports ticker, a high rollers ticker, or any other particular ticker. A secondary player may then choose one or more tickers that he would like to see scrolling across on a display screen.","In various embodiments a ticker may be displayed using a matrix of light emitting diodes, such as a rectangular array of such diodes.","The Setup Adjustably Configures to Your Body. For Example, all the Screens Come in to be Within Arms Reach. The Chair Moves Up or Down to Get You Near the Screens.","The terminal may include sensors, such as range finders, lasers, sonar, or cameras to determine the body size of the player (e.g., tall, e.g., short). Portions of the terminal may automatically adjust to conform to the body size of the player. For example, the display screens may move in close to a player so he can reach them (e.g., if the display screens are touch screens). A chair of the terminal may move up or down to adjust to the height of the player.","Audio.","A terminal may have various means of outputting audio. The audio that is output may include audio communication from a player's friends, audio communication from casino personnel, audio associated with a television broadcast, audio associated in with a radio broadcast, audio associated with a movie, TV show, or other form of media, audio associated with a game (e.g., audio outputs associated with winning a prize), or any other type of audio.","Give Headphones to People.","Headphones may be available for a player at a terminal. Using such headphones, a player may ensure that others around him do not hear his audio, or that he may focus on his audio without being distracted by ambient noises. A switch, button, or other input device may allow a player at a terminal to switch audio from one type of output to another. For example, audio may begin by emanating from speakers at a terminal. When a player puts on headphones, the player may flip a switch to cause audio to come through the headphones. In some embodiments, the headphones or the terminal may sense when the player has put on the headphones. Audio meant for the player may then be piped to the headphones rather than broadcast from speakers. In various embodiments, there may be two or more sets of headphones. Each set of headphones may broadcast separate audio feeds. For example, one set of headphones may correspond to a feed from a sporting event while a second set of headphones may provide an audio track for a slot machine game the player is participating in.","Display Mounted Speakers.","In various embodiments, the terminal may include one or more speakers. The speakers may be mounted on the body of the terminal, or on some other structure associated with the terminal. The speakers may form part of the displays. The speakers may be mounted on the displays.","Mute Buttons.","In various embodiments, a terminal may include one or more mute buttons. Pressing a mute button once may silence an audio feed. Pressing the mute button again may cause the audio feed to return.","Squawk Box.","In various embodiments, an open line of communication may exist among a number of parties, such as three, four, five, six, or more parties. The communication may be audio based. A terminal may have a speaker which is attuned to broadcast voice or other audio messages from any person who is in on the communication. Further, a microphone or other audio input device may allow the player to communicate audio messages into the open line of communication. Any spoken message may be broadcast to all parties who are on the communication. If several people speak at once, all spoken communications may be communicated at once. Thus, an open line of communication may potentially result in a cacophonous melee of voices. A line of communication may be open among a group of friends, among a group of terminals, among all terminals, among all secondary players, among all secondary players who open the line of communication, among all players at gaming devices in a casino, among players and casino representatives, among players at multiple different casinos, or among any other group of people.","Phones.","A terminal may include one or more phones and\/or phone lines. A player may be able to place phone calls to another party.","Phone that Only Allows Local Calls.","In some embodiments, a phone at a terminal may only allow local calls. In some embodiments, a phone at a terminal may only allow calls to certain areas, to certain people, to certain devices, or to certain other restricted destinations. In some embodiments, restrictions on phone calls may be put in place only when a player is placing bets on sports. For example, a player may be allowed to make only local phone calls when betting on a sporting event. This may help to restrict the player from finding out information about the result of the sporting event before counterparties to the bet. In various embodiments, a player may not place any bets on sports within a predetermined time of having placed a phone call which is not in accordance with various restrictions. For example, a player may be prohibited from placing a bet on a sporting event within 10 minutes of having completed a long distance phone call.","Calls to Another Node on a Network.","In various embodiments, phone calls may be restricted to certain parties. Phone calls may be restricted to other terminals. Phone calls may be restricted to people calling from within an internal casino network.","And Calls are Recorded. Because of Sports Book Restrictions.","In various embodiments, a phone call placed from a terminal may be recorded. Recorded calls may be checked to ensure that no sports related information is being communicated, or that no other information that may provide special knowledge about what bets to make are communicated. Recorded calls may be checked at random. Recorded calls may be checked after a player has won a bet. Recorded calls may be checked after a player has won statistically more bets than would be expected of a player. Recorded calls may be checked by a person or by a machine or computer (e.g., using voice recognition software). A recorded call may be analyzed based on the location of the counterparty in the call. For example, if the call was placed to a phone near a race track, the recorded call may be scrutinized.","Phone that Allows You to Speed Dial into a Radio Show.","In various embodiments, various speed dial functions may be associated with a phone or phones at a terminal. A player may be able to press a button to dial into a radio show. The player may then hear the radio show over the phone, or even to pose a question to the host of the radio show. In various embodiments, a speed dial function may allow a player to call up a feed of a radio sports broadcast. For example, the player may pick up a phone to listen to the radio broadcast of a game being played by a favored team. Various buttons may allow the player to dial into different sports broadcasts. In various embodiments, speed dials may allow the player to dial any other number or counterparty in an expedited fashion.","Different Information on Different Displays.","In various embodiments, different displays may show different information or different types of information. The display screens may complement each other. For example, some displays may show broad types of information, while others show specific types of information, or more detailed information about something shown in another display. Some displays may cover one game or one area of a casino while other displays cover other games or areas of the casino.","Different Views","One Display Shows Reenactments of Outcomes.","One display may show reenactments of game outcomes. The display may show footage of the actual outcomes, e.g., as the actual outcomes occurred. Outcomes shown may be outcomes for games in which a player at a terminal is participating as either a primary player or as a secondary player.","One Display Shows Just Data about Outcomes.","In various embodiments, a display may show data about outcomes. The display may show what outcomes have occurred. The display may show statistics describing multiple outcomes. For example, the display may show statistics describing which outcomes were most frequently occurring in the casino in the last five minutes. The display may show statistics describing streaks of outcomes (e.g., 10 sevens in a row have been rolled at a craps game).","One Display Shows Overhead Views of Regions of a Game Floor.","In various embodiments, a display may show an overhead view of a region of a casino. The region may be the same region of a particular game that is more closely featured on another display screen of the terminal.","One Display Shows a Whole Game Table.","In various embodiments, one display screen of a terminal may show an entire gaming table. Another display screen, for example, may show more details about the table, such as focusing in on one player at the table, or showing statistics about the table.","Blow Up the Video to Show an Important Event on Many Screens at Once.","In various embodiments, an important or significant event may be brought to prominence. The display area used for that event may be increased. The area may be increased from one display screen to two or more display screens. The area may be increased from a portion of a display screen to take up a whole display screen. Significant events may include the occurrence of a significant outcome in a game in which the secondary player participates, the occurrence of a jackpot, or the occurrence of any other rare, high paying or otherwise significant event.","Picture in Picture. There is a Speed Dial Switch to go from Video to Video.","In various embodiments, a window, frame, or picture may be shown within a larger window, frame, or picture. The smaller window may contain one video feed while the larger window may contain another video feed. The smaller and larger windows may contain other types of feeds or images as well, such as animated reenactments of game outcomes. A player at the terminal may switch the windows so that the footage shown in the larger is now shown in the smaller, and so that the footage that was shown in the smaller is now shown in the larger. A special key or button may rapidly affect the switch. In various embodiments, there may be multiple smaller windows within one larger window. There may be a special key or button which corresponds to each of the smaller windows and\/or which corresponds to the footage within the windows. A player may thus monitor a number of games, sporting events, or other activities at once. When the player becomes interested in one particular game (or sporting event or other activity), the player may press a button that corresponds to the game of interest (e.g., to the window with the game of interest). The footage of interest in the window of interest may then enlarge to take up the larger window, while the footage in the larger window may then shrink to occupy the smaller window. In various embodiments, particular events that occur in a game, sporting event, or other activity may cause the corresponding window (e.g., the window showing the game) to become the large window. For example, if a game shown in a smaller window results in a high-payout outcome, footage of the game may be enlarged and shown in the larger window.","Proprietary Feeds from Different Services. For Example, there is a Feed from One Casino. Or a Feed from One Type of Game that is Only Played in One Place. There May be Financial Arrangements with the Casino to Get this Feed.","Information shown at terminals may come from diverse places. Information may come from different casinos, from vendors that specialize in generating game outcomes for sale, from sports franchises, from race tracks, from media companies (e.g., movies shown on terminals may come from media companies) or from any other source. Different sources may charge for providing such information. For example, a sports franchise may charge for blanket use of sporting footage in a casino, or for use of sporting footage at a particular terminal. In various embodiments, different information sources may charge at different rates and according to different schemes. A source may charge according to one or more of the following: (a) the number of terminals using information from that source; (b) the number of viewers of information from that source; (c) the size of a window in which information from that source was displayed (e.g., the casino owning the terminal may pay more for footage shown in a large window than for footage shown in a small window); (d) the number of other information sources shown together with a given information source (e.g., a casino may pay less for showing footage or information from a given source if such information was displayed at the same terminal with a large number of other types of information than if the information was displayed on its own); (e) the length of time for which a feed from that source was viewed; (f) the celebrity status of people in a feed (e.g., footage showing a poker game being played by a celebrity may be more expensive than is footage showing a poker game played by an unknown person), or based on any other metric. A casino may pay for an information feed on periodic basis. For example, a casino may pay a subscription fee for an information source.","What is the Standard Default Data that is Always Displayed? E.g., Standard Games, Standard Indices.","In various embodiments, a terminal may have a default set of feeds or pieces of information that are displayed. For example, there may be video footage shown from a Wheel of Fortune slot machine game, from a video poker game, from a blackjack table, and from a craps game. In various embodiments, default footage is chosen based on what are the most popular games in a casino. For example, if the most played game by primary players was the Monopoly slot machine game, then it may be assumed secondary players at a terminal will wish to participate in such games. Thus, footage may be shown from a Monopoly slot machine game. In various embodiments, just as default footage may be shown, there may be default configurations for various keys, buttons, or switches at a terminal. For example, a set of keys may be configured by default to be used for placing bets on games of video poker.","Video Feeds. Multiple Full-Motion Video Feeds. Hi Definition Video Signal.","In various embodiments, high bandwidth connections may be used to pipe multiple high-definition video feeds to a terminal. A player may thus enjoy a pleasurable gaming and entertainment experience while at the terminal.","Alerts. Something Happens and Shows in Red, for Example.","A terminal may include several windows, several feeds, information about several games, or other diverse information. When a noteworthy event or occurrence happens in one feed, such feed may be emphasized or brought to prominence. For example, a window with a particular feed may be enlarged, or made brighter. Audio from a particular feed may be made louder, or audio from competing feeds made lower. Footage may flash, or other indicators may flash. A button which can call up a particular feed or information source may flash when a noteworthy event occurs for that feed.","Sounds for Alerts.","In various embodiments, alerts as to the occurrence of a noteworthy event may occur by means of audio. Special sounds may be broadcast for different events. For example, different types of events might have different corresponding sounds. In some embodiments, however, there is a generic sound for any noteworthy event. In some embodiments, the occurrence of a jackpot may be heralded with one type sound, the occurrence of a streak of a certain length may be heralded with another type of sound (e.g., the sounds of chimes play when a primary player wins ten games of blackjack in a row), the initiation of play by a favored primary player (e.g., by a primary player favored by the secondary player at a terminal) may be heralded with a third type of sound (e.g., the sound of a rooster crowing), and so on.","Customize Your Own Alert Sounds.","In various embodiments, a player may customize which sounds will be used to provide alerts or announcements as to the occurrence of particular events. The player may select from a list of special events. The player may similarly select from a menu of sounds. The player may match events to sounds. The player may also provide his own sounds, e.g., via portable MP3 player.","Entertainment.","A secondary player may use the terminal for entertainment purposes. The secondary player may watch movies, TV shows, casino related events, or other forms of entertainment. The secondary player may watch news programs, science programs, documentaries, or other video. The player may listen to music, books on tape, speeches, or other audio. The terminal may have available multiple display screens. Thus, a secondary player may watch entertainment on one screen while watching the progress of games on another screen.","Movies on Demand.","A secondary player may watch a movie at the terminal.

The secondary player may select from a list of pre-recorded TV shows. A secondary player may also watch a regular TV channel that may be fed to the terminal.","Casino Related Events.","A secondary player may watch video feeds of casino related events. For example, the player may watch a video of a concert that played the previous night, of a comedy act, of an animal performance, or of any other casino related event.","Music.","In various embodiments, a secondary player may listen to music at a terminal. The music may come from speakers built into the terminal. A headset with earphones may also be supplied to the player for listening to the music or for other audio communication. A secondary player may select from one or more channels. The channels may correspond to radio stations or to broadcasts made exclusively within a casino. For example, a casino may have its own disc jockey which selects songs or tunes to be broadcast to players in the casino. The player may select a music or audio channel to listen to using a menu. Certain buttons or keys may also be configured to correspond to certain audio or music channels. For example, there may be a \u201cRock and Roll\u201d button, a \u201cJazz\u201d button and a \u201cClassical Music\u201d button. In various embodiments, a secondary player may have the ability to select individual songs to play. The casino or a third party may offer a number of songs for selection by the secondary player. Thus, the terminal, in conjunction with the network, may function as a juke box, although payment may or may not be necessary, in various embodiments. In various embodiments, as a secondary player selects songs to play, the secondary player may develop a list of preferred songs. The secondary player may then have the option of having songs from his list (e.g., songs previously selected) to be played. The terminal may systematically proceed song by song through the secondary player's list of preferred song (e.g., playing one by one and then starting from the beginning) or the terminal may randomly select a song to play at any moment in time.","Songs Chosen to Correspond to Gaming Outcomes.","In various embodiments, a terminal may play a song or tune which is chosen based on an outcome that occurred in a game in which the secondary player participated. For example, if the secondary player made a winning bet in a game, then a song with a happy theme may be played. If a player made a losing bet, a song with a sad theme may be played. Songs may be chosen based on the correspondence of their lyrics to the symbols, graphics, or events in a game. For example, if a \u201cgrape\u201d symbol occurs in a game, then the song \u201cI Heard It through the Grapevine\u201d may be played.","Secondary Player Brings his Own Songs.","In various embodiments, a secondary player may bring his own tunes or songs for listening at the casino. A player may bring an MP3 player to the casino, such as an iPod. The secondary player may dock the MP3 player into the terminal. The speakers of the terminal may then be used to play songs stored on the MP3 player. Further, information about the songs on the MP3 player may be downloaded to the terminal. Various buttons, dials, or other input devices on the terminal may then be used to navigate through the secondary player's list of songs and to select songs for playing. In various embodiments, a secondary player may also store songs on a network, such as on the Internet. A secondary player may store songs on his home computer, where such home computer is accessible via the Internet, e.g., via file sharing software. The terminal may access the secondary player's songs and may play them upon the request of the secondary player. In various embodiments, a secondary player may bring movies or other entertainment to the terminal. The movies may be brought on a portable movie player, on an MP3 player, on a storage medium (e.g., on a flash drive, e.g., on a DVD), or on any other object or device. The movies or other entertainment may be loaded onto the terminal and played.","Requirements to Watch Entertainment\u2014Must be Gaming at a Certain Rate.","In various embodiments, a secondary player may be permitted to watch entertainment or other video unrelated to gaming activities, so long as the secondary player engages in a certain amount of gaming activity. The secondary player may be required to bet a certain amount per unit time, to participate in a certain number of games per unit time, to have a pause between participation in games of no more than X minutes, or to satisfy any other metric of play. Thus, in various embodiments, the ability to watch entertainment may be a reward for the player for his business gaming.","Pausing Entertainment for Game Outcomes.","In various embodiments, video or audio feeds, such as video feeds showing a movie or other entertainment, may be paused for various reasons. Feeds may be paused upon the occurrence of certain events in a game. A feed may be paused if a game in which the secondary player participates comes to a resolution or is about to come to a resolution. A feed may be paused if a game in which the secondary player participates results in an outcome that meets certain criteria. An outcome that meets such criteria may include an outcome that corresponds to a payout over a certain threshold, an outcome that corresponds to a jackpot outcome, an outcome that is a winning outcome, an outcome that had less than a predetermined probability of occurrence, or an outcome that meets any other particular set of criteria. The pausing of entertainment may allow a secondary player to focus on game outcomes or game events without missing a portion of a movie, TV show, or other portion of entertainment. A pause in entertainment may also give the player the opportunity to specify a new bet or set of bets.","Advertising.","In various embodiments, one or more displays may include advertisements or other promotions. Advertisements may be for third party merchants' products, for casino shows, for casino restaurants, for products sold at casino shops, for casino hotel rooms, for other casino events, or for other products or services. In various embodiments, a screen of the terminal may be dedicated solely to advertisements. In various embodiments, advertisements may appear in windows within display screens. A secondary player may also have the ability to make purchases using the terminal. For example, a secondary player may respond to an advertisement and purchase a product that was shown in the advertisement. In various embodiments, various buttons or keys at a terminal may be temporarily or permanently associated with a product, service, or advertisement. For example, a message may be shown in associating with an advertisement. The message may say, \u201cIf you wish to learn more about this product, or to purchase this product, please press the flashing button.\u201d A button at the terminal may be flashing. The player at the terminal may then press the button to view additional screens of information about the product, to open up a line of communication (e.g., a phone call or video conference) with a salesman for the advertised product, to visit a purchase screen where the player can confirm that he wishes to pay a particular price and to receive an advertised product, and\/or to purchase the product outright. For example, in some embodiments, a player may press a button to immediately purchase a product. The product's purchase price may be deducted from the player's gaming credits. In some embodiments, buttons or other input devices may be associated with a product or service even in the absence of a promotion or advertisement. A button or other input device may be permanently associated with a product or service. The player may press the button in order to purchase the product or service. After pressing the button, one or more acceptance or confirmation steps may be required. For example, the player may be required to sign, to supply a thumb print, to supply a credit card number, to supply a shipping address, or to otherwise confirm he wishes to make a purchase, or to otherwise supply necessary details for completing the purchase.","Play Against Multiple Opponents. See One on Each Monitor.","In various embodiments, a secondary player may participate in a game in which there are multiple primary players. For example, the secondary player may participate in a game of Texas Hold'em poker. The terminal may feature images or videos of two or more of the players participating in the game. The images or videos may be shown simultaneously. The images or video may be shown simultaneously on different screens. For example, there may be six primary players in a game of Texas Hold'em. There may be six display screens at the terminal. Each display screen may show video footage of a different one of the six players. In various embodiments, the displays may be arranged horizontally side by side, such as to simulate a visual field as if the secondary player were actually sitting at the live game of poker. In various embodiments, the display screens may be located near or far from the secondary player to simulate visual depth even more realistically. For example, suppose video footage is taken of all the players at a poker table from the vantage point of one seat at the poker table. Video of the primary player furthest from that seat may be shown on a display screen which is located furthest from the secondary player (e.g., furthest of any display screen at the terminal). Likewise, video of the primary player nearest the seat from which the video is taken may be shown on a display screen which is nearest to the secondary player (e.g., the nearest of any display screen at the terminal).","In various embodiments, a player at a terminal may play in a game as a primary player. For example, the player may play in a game of Texas Hold'em poker or in a game of Blackjack. Video or images of his opponents may appear on various screens of the terminal. In some embodiments, each screen may contain an image or video of a different one of the player's opponents.","In various embodiments, a player (e.g., a primary player) whose turn it is to act in a game may be prominently featured at a terminal. A player whose turn it is to act may have his image placed on a center screen on a terminal. If videos or images of multiple players are shown, the image of the player to act may be enlarged, highlighted, made more bright than images of the other players, or otherwise emphasized.","In various embodiments, avatars for players (e.g., for primary players) may be shown on the display screens of terminals. For example, a video or image of a primary player may not be available, or the primary player may wish that a video of him not be shown. Thus, an avatar or other representation of a primary player may be shown on the display screens of a terminal. Where a player acts as a primary player at a terminal, avatars for his opponents may be shown on display screens of the terminal.","Applications to Server Based Gaming. No Reason You can't Now Play Multiple Different Gaming Devices at Once.","In various embodiments, a terminal may function as a gaming device. A terminal may also function as two or more gaming devices. A terminal may, for instance, allow a player to play two or more games at once. In various embodiments, a first screen of a terminal may show a first game. A second screen of a terminal may show a second game. For example, the first screen may show a game of video poker. The second screen may show a slot machine game.","Gaming Device.","The functions of conducting a game may be performed in several steps, in some embodiments. A random number may be generated. The random number may be translated into an outcome. A game scenario may be shown or displayed which ultimately leads to a display of the outcome. For example, reels may be shown to spin and then stop at the outcome. Further steps may include determining intermediate outcomes (e.g., based on the same or other random numbers), receiving decisions from a player, determining a payout based on an outcome, and crediting a player account with a payout. A terminal may perform one or more functions of conducting a game. A terminal may display the outcome of a game to a player. Functions of a game not performed by a terminal may be performed by another device, such as by a casino server or by a separate gaming device. For example, the casinos server may determine a random number and an outcome for a game. The terminal may then display the outcome of the game for a player. Where the terminal and another device together conduct a game, the terminal may be in communication with the other device, e.g., to request game related information from the other device and to receive such game related information from the other device. In various embodiments, a terminal may download software for conducting all or a portion of a game. The software may be downloaded, for example, from a casino server. The software may make the terminal operable to render graphics and to provide audio associated with the game. The terminal may be operable to download software for multiple different games, and therefore the terminal may be operable to conduct portions of multiple different games. For example, a terminal may be operable to conduct a portion of a slot machine game and to conduct a portion of a video poker game.","Two or More Gaming Devices.","In some embodiments, a terminal may function as two or more gaming devices at once. For example, on one screen of the terminal may be displayed graphics and other information from a video poker game. On another screen of the terminal may be displayed graphics and other information from a slot machine game. In some embodiments, as the player at the terminal pleases, he may initiate a new game for one or the other or for both types of games. A terminal may include separate keys or controls for two types of games. For example, one set of keys may be operable to place bets in slot machine game, while another set of keys may be operable to place bets and make decisions in a video poker game. Both sets of keys may be part of the same terminal. Further, other sets of keys may be available, such as keys for craps, roulette, or other games. In some embodiments, a terminal may conduct two of the same type of game at once. For example, a first screen may show a first slot machine game and a second screen may show a second slot machine game. There may be separate sets of keys even for two of the same type of game.","A Player Plays as a Primary Player and as a Secondary Player.","In various embodiments, a terminal may allow a player to play a first game as a primary player and to participate in a second game as a secondary player. For example, a player may place a bet on slot machine game, initiate the slot machine game, and receive a payout based on the outcome of the slot machine game. The player at the terminal may also place a bet on a slot machine game being initiated and played by a different player (e.g., by a primary player). A first display screen of the terminal may show information about a first game in which the player at the terminal is acting as a primary player. A second display screen of the terminal may show information about a second game in which the player at the terminal is participating as a secondary player. One set of keys or buttons or other input devices may allow the player at the terminal to play a first game as a primary player (e.g., to place bets; e.g., to make decisions; e.g., to initiate games). A second set of keys or buttons or other input devices may allow the player at the terminal to participate in a second game as a secondary player (e.g., to select primary players to bet on; e.g., to place bets).","Screen with Control Panel.","In various embodiments, a terminal may include a screen with information about a player using the terminal. Such information may include a credit balance, an amount bet or to be bet on a first game, an amount bet or to be bet on a second game, amounts bet or to be bet on any number of other games, a primary player on whom the secondary is betting, a game in which the secondary player is participating, a pay table for a game in which the player (e.g., the secondary player) is participating, and any other information about the activities of the secondary player. The information about a player at a terminal may generally give the player an idea of how he is doing (e.g., how much he has won or lost) how much money he has left, how much he has just won on a particular game, what are the games in which he is participating, and any other useful information or other information related to the secondary player. In some embodiments, a terminal may indicate to a player how many comp points he has in total, and\/or how many comp points the player has earned over a particular gaming session (e.g., over the gaming session at the terminal). A screen of the terminal may further include interactive areas where the player can touch or otherwise interact with in order to receive further information. The screen may be a touch screen, for example. In various embodiments a player may touch a screen to reveal the rules of a game. For example, the player may touch a \u201crules\u201d button on the screen. In some embodiments, a player may touch a screen to reveal the pay table of a game. In some embodiments, a player may touch a screen to show the pay lines on a game.","Various Screens Show Layers of Information.","In various embodiments, a first display screen at a terminal may show a first set of information. A player at the terminal may wish to delve further into the information, however. Thus the player may provide some indication of where he wants to learn more information. Further information may then appear on another display screen of the terminal. Screens may thus have a hierarchical relationship. A first screen may generally show broad or top-level information. A second screen may generally show more detailed information on specific items from the first screen. The first screen may be located centrally in the field of vision of the player, while the second screen may be located to the side, high above the player, or somewhere else not quite as easily visible as is the first screen. In one example, the first screen may show video footage of a primary player. The secondary player at the terminal may click on an image of the primary player in the video in order to learn more about the primary player. Subsequently, on the second screen, more information about the primary player may appear. Such information may include the primary player's name, age, occupation, the type of strategy typically employed by the primary player, the results of the last ten games of the primary player, the net winnings of the primary player in the last 20 minutes, the number of jackpots won by the primary player in his life, or any other information about the primary player. In another example, a player at a terminal may be watching a sporting event. The player may click on a horse, at which point statistics about the horse may pop up on another screen. In another example, a player may be watching a feed of a game from a blackjack table. The player may click on the table in order to see the percentage of hands won by the dealer, the percentage of hands won by the primary players at the table, the number of blackjacks that have been dealt in the last 100 hands, and any other information about the table. In various embodiments, there may be several levels of hierarchy among display screens at a terminal. It may be possible to repeatedly request more and more specific information on a topic, with each layer of more specific information appearing on a new screen of the terminal.","The following are embodiments, not claims:","A.

At the same time, the first player may play the first game as a primary player. Thus, the first player may simultaneously act as both a primary player and a secondary player. It should be recognized that while various example embodiments are described in terms of a separate primary and secondary player, that in some embodiments, a secondary player and a primary player may be a same player. For example, a player may choose to play a copy of a hand dealt to the player (e.g., take a same original hand in multiple different directions).","O. The method of embodiment N in which the second game is played remotely from the location of the first player.","P. The method of embodiment N in which displaying graphics associated with the first game includes displaying a rendition of spinning slot machine reels.","Q. The method of embodiment N in which displaying graphics associated with the second game includes displaying video footage of the second player playing the second game.","Game Sorting","In some embodiments, a primary player may directly participate in a game of chance. The primary player may place a bet, make game decisions, roll dice (e.g., if the game is a game of craps), and receive winnings and losses based on his bet, his decisions, and events (e.g., random events) that occur during the game. In some embodiments, a secondary player may place bets on games played by a primary player. The secondary player may bet that certain outcomes will occur, that certain decisions will be made, that certain cards will be dealt, that certain numbers will be rolled in a game of dice, or that any other event will occur. The secondary player may be removed from the physical location of the game. The secondary player may be uninvolved with any decisions made during the game. A secondary player may participate in a game via a remote terminal, mobile gaming device, or other device. For example, a secondary player may use a terminal with buttons and a monitor to input bets and to watch the progress of a game.","In various embodiments, a secondary player may view data or information about games in which the secondary player may participate (e.g., about games on which the secondary player can bet). The secondary player may view different types of data, may view data in various ways or presentation formats, may sort the data in different ways, may search through the data in various ways, may filter the data in various ways, and may otherwise view and interact with data about games in various ways.","Data about a Gaming Activity.","Various data may be associated with a game, a player, a game table, a gaming device, or with any entity or event related to gaming. Data may include: (a) a time of day (e.g., a time of day during which a game was played); (b) a game type (e.g., video poker; e.g., slots; e.g., craps; e.g., table game; e.g., \u201cDouble Diamond 2005 Video Slots\u201d), (c) a game platform (e.g., Game King); (d) the maximum payout or prize of a game; (e) a payout of an outcome of a game; (f) a probability of an outcome of a game; (g) a result of the game (e.g., player win; e.g., player loss; e.g., player won the jackpot; e.g., player entered the bonus round; e.g., outcome of \u201ccherry-cherry-cherry\u201d); (h) a decision made in a game (e.g., hit; e.g., discard the first three cards of a video poker hand) (i) a bet made in a game (e.g., a bet of \u201cred\u201d in roulette; e.g., a bet of \u201cdon't pass\u201d in craps); (j) a quality of a decision made in a game (e.g., was an optimal decision made; e.g., by how much did a strategy deviate from optimal strategy; e.g., was a strategy chosen that maximized expected player winnings; e.g., was a strategy chosen that maximized the chances of receiving the highest possible payout), (k) a player (e.g., a player who played a particular game), (l) a location (e.g., a city where a game was played; e.g., an area of a casino where a game was played; e.g., a shop where a game was played; e.g., a gaming table where a game was played); (m) a place in a streak (e.g., a game occurred after 3 wins; e.g., a game occurred after 5 losses; e.g., a game occurred after 3 wins and prior to 6 more wins), (n) a probability or odds associated with a particular outcome that occurred in a game (e.g., a probability associated with an outcome of \u201cbell-bell-bell\u201d that occurred in a game); (o) an amount won in a game; (p) an amount bet in a game; (q) one or more cards dealt in a game (e.g., the ace of spades was dealt in a game; e.g., three diamonds were dealt in a game); (r) one or more indicia that occurred in a game (e.g., \u201ccherry\u201d; e.g., \u201ccherry\u201d and \u201cbell\u201d; e.g., a wild symbol; e.g., \u201cbell\u201d or \u201cbar\u201d); (s) a demographic of a player who played a game (e.g., the primary player of a game is from Wisconsin; e.g., the player of a game is a nurse); (t) a player celebrity status (e.g., the player of a game is a state senator); (u) a popularity of a game (e.g., a game was the fifth most played game in a casino in the past week); (v) a popularity of a game from the vantage point of secondary players (e.g., a game was the most frequently bet on by secondary players of any type of game) (w) a similarity of one game to another (e.g., game A has similar rules to game B; e.g., players who played game A most often played game B); (x) a recommendation, such as of a game, player, dealer, table, etc. (e.g., Slot Mania got positive recommendations from 90% of players); (y) an index, such as an index of players, game results, dealers, game tables, etc. (e.g., an index may describe an average amount won by players at a particular game table; e.g., an index may describe an average amount won per game at a particular type of game in the last hour); (z) a game manufacturer (e.g., a game manufacturer associated with a particular game), (aa) a game rating or review (e.g., by other players); (bb) a number comps associated with the play of a game; or any other data about a game related device, entity; (cc) whether or not a game was a table game; (dd) whether or not a game was played without player input; (ee) a ratio of how much a player has won to how much a dealer has won; (ff) a ratio of how much a set of players has won to how much a dealer has won; or any other data.","Sort by any of the Above Attributes.","In various embodiments, a secondary player may view data associated with a plurality of games, gaming devices, players (e.g., primary players), game tables, or other entities devices, or events. For example, a secondary player may view a listing of games together with, for each game, an indication of the time the game was played, the player who played the game, the amount bet, and the amount won. The secondary player may sort the listing of games by the time the game was played, the player who played the game by the amount of the bet, or by the amount won. Thus, for example, the secondary player may sort the listing of games into chronological order by when the games were played. Similarly, the secondary player may sort the games so that the game with the most won is at the top of the list, and the game with the least amount won is at the bottom of the list. In some embodiments, the secondary player may sort by more than one type of data. For example, the secondary player may sort first by amount won and then by amount bet.","Search for any of the Above Attributes.","In some embodiments, a player may search for a game with a particular value or a particular instance of any associated type of data. For example, a player may search for a game played at a particular time, for a game played by a particular player, for a gaming table with a highly rated dealer, for a gaming device located in a particular area of a casino, and\/or for any other particular characteristic. A secondary player may search for multiple characteristics simultaneously. For example, a secondary player may search for a gaming device that is located in a particular area of a casino and which has had 6 payouts of more than 100 coins in the last hour.","In various embodiments, data about games may be stored in a database, such as in a database located with the casino server. Various database searches techniques may be used to find games with particular attributes. For example, Structured Query Language (SQL) may be used for finding games with particular attributes.","Search for any of the Above Attributes with Respect to a Group of Games, Players, Tables, Dealers, or Other Objects or Entities.","In various embodiments, secondary player may search for data associated with a set of games, a set of table, a set of dealers, a set of gaming devices, a set of locations, or a set of any other objects or entities. For example, a secondary player may search for: (a) a set of tables at which players have won more than 60% of the games in the last 5 minutes; (b) a set of gaming devices that have together paid more than four payouts of more than $100 in the last 10 minutes; (c) a set of primary players each of whom uses basic strategy; (d) a set of dealers, each of whom deals more than 20 hands per hour; or for any other set satisfying some criterion or criteria. In various embodiments, there may be some constraint on a set of objects or entities searched for. For example, a constraint may say that all must be within the same region, such as a room of a casino. Otherwise, for example, a set of primary players who uses basic strategy might be readily found by picking individual primary players from all around the casino, although this may be permitted, in some embodiments. In some embodiments, sets of players, tables, dealers, gaming devices, or other objects or entities are defined or understood to exist in advance of a search. For example, gaming devices in a particular bank are understood to constitute a set of gaming devices. Thus, for example, a secondary player may search for banks of gaming devices that satisfy certain criteria, such as banks of gaming devices that are more than 70% occupied.","Searching for Streaks.","In various embodiments, a secondary player may search for a player, game, dealer, gaming device, game table, or other object or entity that is associated with a streak. A streak may include some pattern of wins, losses, or other outcomes. A streak may include a plurality of consecutive games that were all wins, a plurality of consecutive games that were all losses, a plurality of consecutive games in which a win always follows a loss and a loss follows a win, or any other pattern. A streak may involve only one of something, such as only one game. For example, a winning streak for a primary player may be one game long. A streak may not cover consecutive games. For example, primary player may go on a streak in which he wins every other game over a period of twenty total games. A streak may also include overlapping games. For example, primary players at a gaming table may be on a streak in which primary players at the table win 15 games without loss. However, many of those games may have occurred simultaneously (e.g., many of those games may be against the same dealer cards).","In various embodiments, a secondary player may search for a player, game, dealer, gaming device, game table, or other object or entity that is associated with a streak of a certain length, such as a streak of seven games. In various embodiments, a secondary player may search for a primary player, game, dealer, etc., that is associated with a streak of at least a certain length, such as with a losing streak of at least 10 games. For example, a secondary player may wish to participate in the games of a primary player has lost at least ten games in a row because the secondary player may believe the primary player is due to win soon.","Types of Displays","Tabular Display.","In various embodiments, a secondary player may view data related to a game, gaming device, primary player, game table, dealer, or other entity or device related to gaming using a tabular format. Each line in a table may contain related data, such as data all describing the same game or the same gaming device. For example, one line in a table may contain data related to a game. The line may include data describing the time the game was played, the gaming device at which the game was played, the amount bet on the game, the top jackpot in the game. The next line in the table may contain the same type of data, but about a different game. Thus, each column of the table may contain a similar type of data, such as a time during which a game was played. A secondary player may be able to sort the data using any of the columns. For example, the secondary player may be able to sort games by time played, so that all games will be in chronological order. The secondary player may be able to sort games by type of game, such as video poker or slot machines. After such a sort, all video poker games would be on adjacent lines in the table, for example. In various embodiments, a tabular display may be used to show a list of games, gaming devices, or other entities or devices to a secondary player only after the secondary player has used some filtering or sorting criteria to limit the universe of games (or entities or devices). Otherwise, the list may be so long as to be unwieldy or overwhelming for the secondary player.  shows some embodiments of a tabular display. Column  may indicate the time a game was played, such as the start time of the game. Column  may indicate the name of a game or gaming device. Column  may indicate an amount bet on a game by a primary player. Column  may indicate an outcome of a game. Column  may indicate an amount won in a game by a primary player.","Geographic (Floor Plan).","In some embodiments, a secondary player may view a display of a casino floor-plan or other model of a casino venue. The view may show the location of various rooms, game tables, gaming devices, people and so on. For example, the view may represent a scale model of the configuration of the casino and\/or of the objects in a casino. In some embodiments, a floor plan may not be made according to scale. For example, the sizes of some rooms relative to others may be exaggerated. A secondary player may use the floor plan view to find players, gaming tables, dealers, etc., based on various search criteria, such as based on a specification of a range for certain data. Different visual cues on the floor plan, such as different colors, different shading patterns, different gray levels, and so on may be used to indicate different types of data or data within different ranges. For example, red colors may indicate game tables where players have beaten the dealers, on average. Green colors may indicate game tables where dealers have beaten players, on average.","Players Pick Colors and Choose What Those Colors Will Represent.","In various embodiments, a secondary player may pick colors, shading patterns, gray scales, or other visual cues to use on a geographic view of a casino floor or other gaming venue. For example, a player may choose to use red to represent gaming devices with jackpots over $2000, orange to represent gaming devices with jackpots between $1000 and $2000, and yellow to represent gaming devices with jackpots below $1000. However, the player may just as easily pick a different color scheme to represent data on the floor plan. An interface for the second player may present fixed data ranges, such as ranges of jackpot levels. The player may then select a color to correspond to the range, such as from a menu.","Winning Devices or Players.","In some embodiments, a floor plan view may show in different shades, colors, or other patterns primary players, gaming devices, game tables, or other objects or entities that have had distinctive results. For example, gaming devices which have paid out more than $100 in the last five minutes may be shown in a first shaded color. Gaming devices which have paid out more than $200 in the last five minutes may be shown in a second shaded color. As another example, positions at a gaming table where a player has won more than a certain amount in the last five minutes (or the last X minutes) may be shown with a color, shading, etc.  shows a floor plan view according to some embodiments. Reference numeral  corresponds to gaming devices. Reference numeral  corresponds to game tables, each game table including player positions and a dealer position. Gaming devices , , , and  are shown shaded. The shading may indicate that such gaming devices have paid out more than a threshold amount of money in the most recent time period, e.g., in the last 20 minutes. The different levels of shading (e.g., gaming device  has a darker shading than does gaming device ) may indicate that the different gaming devices have crossed different thresholds. For example, gaming device  may have paid out $500 in the last 10 minutes, whereas gaming device  may have paid out only $250 in the last 10 minutes. Different levels of shading may have other meanings besides amounts paid out. For example, a level of shading may indicate a number of games played at a gaming device, a number of times a bonus round was reached, a size of a jackpot, a percentage of the time the gaming device was occupied, a number of consecutive losses, or any other information. Reference numerals , , and  may indicate player positions at gaming tables. A display of shading or other color at a player position may convey various information. Such information may include an amount won in some period of time, an amount lost in some period of time, a number of consecutive hands won, a number of times a particular hand has been achieved (e.g., blackjack), a skill level, an age of a player, or any other information. The shading of a player position may indicate information about the player currently occupying the position (e.g., information about the player's amount won over the past day in any game), or may indicate information about the position itself (e.g., about how much money was won at this position in the last hour, regardless of the primary player). Reference numeral  may indicate a dealer position. The shading of a dealer position may indicate various information about the dealer himself (e.g., how quickly this dealer deals), about the dealer position (e.g., how many blackjacks did the dealer receive in the past 2 hours, regardless of who was dealing), or about the table itself (e.g., what percentage of the games at this table have been won by primary players in the last hour). In various embodiments, other parts of a floor play may be shaded or otherwise patterned. For example, an entire game table may be shaded. The shading of a game table may indicate that players at the game table have won a higher percentage of games than have players at any other game table.","Hotspots.","A floor plan view may show areas in a casino where a significant amount of activity is taking place, or where a significant amount of a certain type of activity is taking place. For example, a floor plan view may show areas of a casino where more than 80% of the gaming devices are occupied. As another example, a floor plan view may show areas of a casino where more than three jackpots have been won in the last hour. As another example, a floor plan view may show areas of a casino where players have net winnings of more than $10 per player, on average. Areas of significant activity may be indicated or conveyed with the use of certain colors, shades, with boundary lines (e.g., an area of significant activity is shown encircled with a boundary line) or with any other cues. Further, a player may select the colors, shades, or other visual cues to be used for conveying information about certain activity. In various embodiments, a \u201chotness meter\u201d may appear in a view of a casino floor, game table, gaming device or other area. The \u201chotness meter\u201d may consist of a color scheme or shading scheme used to convey information about how well a gaming device, player, or game is doing, for example. For example, a red color may indicate that a gaming device is in the top 5% of all gaming devices in terms of being profitable for players, while a blue color may indicate that a gaming device is in the bottom 5% in terms of being profitable for players. A hotness meter may indicate an amount won, a length of a streak, a profitability of a gaming device, a popularity of a gaming device, a number of times a bonus round has been reached, or may indicate any other information.","Where Most Players are.","A floor plan view may show the locations of players or other casino patrons. Areas with relatively high concentrations of players may be shown in one color, while areas with relatively lower concentrations of players may be shown in another color. In various embodiments, a secondary player may be able to specify a certain category of primary player. For example, a category might be: primary players who have won more than $100 in the last hour; primary players from Minnesota; primary players who play perfect strategy in video poker; primary player who are betting more than $10 per game; or any other category. The floor plan view may then show the locations of primary players falling into a specified category. For example, areas with a high concentration of primary players who have pets may be shown in one color, while areas with a low concentration of such players may be shown in another color. To find and display primary players or other casino patrons falling within a particular category, a secondary player may, for example, peruse a list of available categories. The secondary player may select one or more categories. The secondary player may then select a color or other visual cue to correspond to one or more selected categories. The secondary player may select a visual cue for each category (e.g., where each different category of primary player is to be shown using a different visual cue). The selected visual cue may then be used to show the secondary player the category (or group of categories, e.g., the logical intersection of several different categories) that the secondary player has chosen to view. In various embodiments, a floor plan view may show players (e.g., primary players) according to some individual identifying information, such as according to name or according to an alias. For example, a secondary player may see a dot moving on the floor plan view of a casino. A text box may hover over the dot as it moves, indicating the name of the player who the dot represents.","Interactive Floor Plan View.","In various embodiments, a secondary player may select a region on a floor play, or may select on object, person, or other entity displayed on the floor plan. For example, the secondary player may drag a mouse pointer over a gaming table shown on a floor plan view of casino. Dragging the mouse pointer over the gaming table may bring up a bubble or text box which includes information about the gaming table. For example, the bubble may indicate the name of the dealer, the percentage of times that players have won in the last 10 games, the betting limits, the game, or any other information about the table. A secondary player may interact with a floor plan view in various other ways, such as by touching various parts of a touch screen display device with the floor plan view displayed on it.","Show the Whole Floor as a Roulette Game or Other Game.","In various embodiments, a casino floor or other location within a casino may be shown as one large game. For example, different regions within the casino floor may be shown within distinct boundary lines. Each bounded region may have an identifier. For example, 30 different bounded regions may be numbered 1 to 30. The secondary player may choose a region. For example, the secondary player may place a bet on a particular region. A winning region may then be determined based on events that actually happen within that region. For example, the winning region may be the first region in which a jackpot is won. For example, the winning region may be the first region in which 10 primary players achieve a flush in video poker. A region may be chosen based on any other event or set of events to transpire within that region. In some embodiments, one or more regions in a casino may be used to determine a symbol or indicia. For example, a casino may be divided into five regions. The most frequently dealt card in each region may be determined. For example, out of ten games of video poker and four tables of blackjack, the two of hearts may have been the most frequently dealt card in a first region. Using five regions, a hand of video poker may then be determined. The hand of video poker may be used in a game played by a secondary player.","Some Data for Floor Plan Views.","A floor plan view of casino may convey a number of different types of information. As applicable for any given game, gaming device, game table, player, dealer, or group thereof, a floor plan view may indicate: (a) a ratio of amounts won by a player to amounts won by the house; (b) a length of a streak or other pattern of outcomes; (c) a name (e.g., of a player; e.g., of a dealer); (d) a demographic (e.g., of a player; e.g., of a dealer); (e) a betting limit; (f) a card that was dealt; (g) a number of times a particular card was dealt; (h) a proportion of time that a particular card was dealt (e.g., over the last hour); (i) a speed of play; (j) a highest amount won (e.g., over the last 10 minutes); (k) a size of a jackpot; or any other information. Such information may be indicated using any pattern or color scheme, using text or video, or using any other mode of conveyance.","Pop Up Window.","In various embodiments, a player may view a floor plan view or any other view of information about various games, players, dealers, game tables, gaming devices, or other objects or entities. The player may move a mouse pointer over a particular object or entity (e.g., over a gaming device) and may click on that device. There may be various other ways of selecting the device. A pop-up window or other separate window may then appear to allow the player to view more detailed information or further information about the object or entity which was selected. The window may include a video feed of play or action (e.g., at a gaming device). The window may include a simulation of the action. The window may include statistics, demographic information about players or dealers, pay table information, jackpot information, information about related games, information about historical games (e.g., for comparison purposes), or any other type of information. Thus, in various embodiments, a floor plan view may have one or more selectable elements. When selected, further information may be revealed, such as about the objects or entities represented by those elements. In various embodiments, a player viewing a floor plan may have the opportunity to zoom in on one or more portions of the floor plan view, or of the objects or entities represented. For example, a player may zoom in on a particular group of gaming devices, or on a particular set of gaming tables. The representation of such objects or entities may be expanded to fill a larger screen area and\/or a larger field of view. A player may also zoom out to view a representation of a larger area of a casino or more game tables, for example. When a player zooms in, more information about the objects or entities in the field of view may be provided. There may be more room to provide such information since, for example, a representation of a gaming device may now appear larger and may therefore fit more text, graphics, or other information on it. Information may include statistics (e.g., about games which have occurred at a gaming device), jackpot sizes, payout amounts, player demographic information, or any other information.","Searching for Data Using Filters.","In various embodiments, a secondary player may search for games, dealers, game tables, or primary players, based on various types of data. A secondary player may specify a range of values for a particular type of data, and may find all games, dealers, game tables, or primary players with associated data falling in the specified range. For example, a secondary player may specify a range of gross winnings paid by a gaming device in the last hour, where the range is specified as from $500 to $2000. Thus, every gaming device which has paid $500 to $2000 in the last hour may be found. Such gaming devices may be highlighted on a floor-plan view of a casino. In some embodiments, all other gaming devices besides those with gross winnings falling in the specified range may be blacked out or grayed out in a floor-plan view of the casino. Thus, the specification of a range of data may serve as a filter that highlights or brings to prominence those devices (or games or players or game tables, etc.) falling within a specified range, while filtering out those that do not. In some embodiments, a secondary player may specify multiple filters. The filters may successively eliminate games, gaming devices, game tables, or other entities as ranges for more types of data are specified. For example, a secondary player may specify a particular game manufacturer (e.g., IGT), so that all gaming devices not manufactured by the game manufacturer are blacked out from a casino floor plan. The player may further specify a range for the top jackpot (e.g., $1000 to $2000). All remaining gaming devices with top jackpots outside this range may be blacked out. In this way, a secondary player may successively narrow down a list or a view of gaming devices (or players, entities, game table, etc.). This may help the secondary player to hone in on a gaming device that he wishes to bet on.","Virtual Tour Display (You can Move Virtually Through the Casino and See Overlaid Statistics).","In some embodiments, a secondary player may view a casino as if he were walking through it. For example, the view of the casino may be as from a camera that was positioned somewhere within the casino. The view may evolve as if the camera was moving. In some embodiments, a secondary player may view a casino as if he were flying through it, going through walls, or performing other stunts. The player may view actual footage from the casino, or the player may view a simulated rendition of the casino. The player may navigate through the rendition of the casino by, for example, manipulating a joystick in the direction he wishes to proceed. As the secondary player takes the \u201cvirtual tour\u201d of the casino, the secondary player may view things that a person would normally see while walking through the casino. Namely, the secondary player may see gaming devices, game tables, people, works of art, etc. In some embodiments, the secondary player may see additional information overlays that would not be visible to someone walking through the actual casino. The player may see information superimposed on a gaming device. The information may indicate the length of a streak of games where a primary player has won at the gaming device, the last outcome achieved at the gaming device, the time of the most recent jackpot payout, or any other information. Similarly, information may be superimposed over the image of a gaming table. The information may indicate current players at the gaming table, the ratio of the amount players have won to the amount dealers have won in the last hour, the popularity of the dealer, or any other information related to the gaming table. Thus, in various embodiments, a secondary player may take a virtual tour of a casino, or of any other location, with various features, objects, or people having informative tags that may not be present or visible in the real world. A secondary player taking a virtual tour may thus be able to readily find a game, a primary player, a dealer, a gaming table, or other game or entity that suits his preferences.","Ladder Display\u2014could be a Bar Graph, or Just a Graph with the Cards.","A ladder display may include a first axis representing some set of units. The units may be an amount won at a gaming device in the last hour, for example. As another example, the units may be games in the current winning streak. At various points along the axis may be a number, bar, picture, or other depiction representing a quantity of something that fits at that point on the axis. For example, a number \u201c30\u201d at the point 5 units above the origin on the axis may indicate that there are 30 gaming devices that have just made a payout of $5. A number 31 at a point 8 units above the origin on the axis may indicate that there are 31 gaming devices that have just made a payout of $8. In some embodiments, a ladder display may show a ratio of an amount players have won to an amount that the house has won. Locations on the axis may correspond to ratios such as 0.8 (players have won 80 cents for every dollar the house has won), 1.0 (players and the house have won equal amounts of money), and 1.2 (players have won $1.20 for every dollar the house has won). At various points on the axis there may be bars, with the length of such bars corresponding to the number of gaming tables that should fall at that point on the axis. For example, a bar that appears one inch long extending horizontally from the point on the vertical axis corresponding to a ratio of 0.9 may indicate that there are 3 gaming tables where players have won 90 cents for every dollar won by a dealer. A bar that appears two inches long extending horizontally from the point on the vertical axis corresponding to a ratio of 1.0 may indicate that there are 6 gaming tables where players have won $1 for every $1 that the house has won.","In various embodiments, a ladder display may indicate the average amount that players are ahead or behind at a table. For example, for each $25 dollar range (e.g., \u2212$25 to 0, 0 to $25, $25 to $50, etc.) that ladder display may show the number of gaming tables such that players at those tables are ahead by an average number of dollars falling within the range. For example, the ladder display may show that there are 4 gaming tables where the average player is ahead anywhere from $25 to $50.","In some embodiments, a secondary player may drill down further into the data making up a ladder display. For example, a secondary player may see from a ladder display that there are four gaming devices where the player has won the last five games in a row. The secondary player may then wish to further inquire as to which four gaming devices those are. The player may indicate such a desire in various ways. For example, the player may click on the number \u201c4\u201d on the ladder display indicating the number of gaming devices where the last five games in a row have been won. A text window may then appear showing details about such gaming devices, such as the locations, the type of game, the name of the primary players at the gaming devices, and so on.","In various embodiments, a ladder display may show the number of times that a particular indicium appeared, or the number of gaming devices at which a particular indicium appeared, or the number of gaming tables at which a particular card appeared, or the number of games in which a particular combination of cards appeared. For example, each position on the axis may represent a different card. Thus, for example, there may be 52 positions on the axis. A first position may correspond to an ace of spades, a second position may correspond to a king of spades, and so on. At each position may be listed a number, such as \u201c12\u201d. The \u201c12\u201d may indicate that there have been 12 gaming devices in the last 30 seconds at which the ace of spades has been dealt. It may be possible for a single gaming device to be counted twice in the ladder display, since more than one card may have been dealt at the gaming device.","In some embodiments, each position on the axis of a ladder display may correspond to a combination of indicia. For example, a position may correspond to \u201cbell-bell-bell\u201d. A number listed at the position may indicate the number of gaming devices that have generated the outcome \u201cbell-bell-bell\u201d in the last 10 minutes of time (or in the last X period of time). As another example, a position on the axis of a ladder display may correspond to \u201cAs Ks Js 10h 10d\u201d. A corresponding number may indicate how many video poker games have generated the above card combination in the last hour.","Various embodiments contemplate a ladder display where an axis is oriented vertically, horizontally, or in any other orientation.","Time Varying Attribute (Things Evolving Over Time), E.g., Winnings as a Function of Time.","In various embodiments, a display may include an indication of changing data, changing games, changing circumstances, or other changes occurring over time. A floor plan view of a casino may indicate a time evolution in some circumstance. For example, a floor plan view of a casino may indicate a first gaming table where players were winning the most at a first point in time. The floor plan view of the casino may indicate a second gaming table where players were winning the most at a second point in time. An arrow may be drawn from the first gaming table to the second gaming table, showing how the state of meeting certain criteria (in this case being the table where players win the most) has changed over time. Multiple points in time may be shown, and a secondary player may thereby see how the \u201ccrown\u201d of being the table where players win the most has shifted over time. A secondary player may attempt to discern a pattern as to which table will be the next table where primary players win the most. For example, the secondary player may say to himself, \u201cThese three most recent arrows seem to show a shift to the west of the casino. Therefore, I think the next table which will be the best for players will be this other table on the western side of the casino.\u201d",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1098","num":"1195"},"figref":"FIG. 59","b":["1210","1220","1230","1250","1260","1240","1210","1220","1230","1240","1210","1220","1230","1240"]},"In various embodiments, a time evolution of circumstances may be shown with respect to a single game, a single table, a single player, a single gaming device, a single dealer, or any other single object or entity. For example, a display may show the trend of a player's net winnings over time. The display may show a chart such that at each point in time, the player's cumulative net winnings since the start of the player's gaming session is shown. As another example, a display may show the time between the start of games at a particular gaming table as a function of time. For example, the display may show that it was an average of two minutes between the start of games at a table between 10:00 am and 10:30 am, but it was two minutes and thirty seconds on average between the start of games at the table between 10:30 am and 11:00 am.","In various embodiments, a time evolution of circumstances may be shown with respect to a group or set of games, tables, players, dealers, gaming devices, or any other set of objects or entities. For example, a display may show, for a bank of 10 gaming devices, how many times payouts over $20 have been paid in each five-minute interval over the last three hours.","In various embodiments, a time evolution of circumstances may be shown in tabular format. For example, each row in a table may correspond to a particular point in time. Data associated with each point in time may include a payout paid at that point in time, a decision made in a game at that point in time, an outcome that occurred at that point in time, and so on.","In various embodiments, the ability to see data or circumstances as they evolve over time may give a secondary player a chance to try to predict where a trend is leading. For example, if a group of gaming devices has been paying greater payouts, on average, during each five-minute interval over the last hour, a secondary player may assume this trend will continue and may thereby wish to participate in a game played at one of the gaming devices in the group.","In various embodiments, a secondary player may be given access to a prediction tool or tools. The prediction tools may allow the secondary player to use a set of known data and to extrapolate possible future occurrences based on the known data. For example, a prediction tool may be able to perform linear regressions, to perform predictions using neural networks, to perform predictions using a set of rules, or to perform predictions in any other fashion. The secondary player may use a prediction tool in conjunction with various data (e.g., with various data about games, gaming devices, etc.) and may thereby determine a game in which to participate. In various embodiments, a secondary player may allow a bet to be placed automatically on his behalf based on the outputs of a prediction tool. In various embodiments, a prediction tool may be a software program that resides on a casino server. In various embodiments, a person, such as a \u201cresident expert\u201d may make predictions as to which games are likely to be favorable for a secondary player to participate in. The resident expert may supply his predictions to one or more secondary players. A secondary player may pay to receive the services of a person making predictions and\/or of a prediction tool. A resident expert may be a casino employee. In some embodiments, it may be determined which of a plurality of secondary players has had the greatest success (e.g., has won the most over a certain period of time). This secondary player may be chosen or selected to be a \u201cresident expert\u201d. Other secondary player may then have the opportunity to use the predictions of the chosen secondary player. In various embodiments, data about the success of secondary players may be made available to other secondary players. For example, data about what percentage of bets have won for a first secondary player may be made available to a second secondary player. The secondary player, based on his own evaluation of the data, may then determine whether or not to participate in the same games as does the first secondary player.","Network Diagram (One Game Related to Another Game, which is Related to Another Game). A Network with Related Things Joined Together) Games Played by the Same Player.","In various embodiments, a display may represent gaming devices, players, dealers, gaming tables, or other objects or entities as nodes on a network. The nodes may be connected to each other based on some similarity between the players (or games, or game tables, etc.) represented by the nodes. For example, two gaming devices that are both video slot machines with five reels may be shown as near to one another in the network, perhaps with a direct connection between them. As another example, two games for which the jackpot size is the same may be shown as being near to one another in the network. In one example, a first gaming device featuring a particular game and accepting $1 chips is shown connected in the network diagram to a second gaming device featuring the same game and accepting quarters. The second gaming device is, in turn, shown connected to a third gaming device featuring the particular game but accepting nickels. The first and third gaming devices may not be shown as being directly connected.","In various embodiments, a network display may show primary players. Primary players may be shown connected or near to one another based on: strategies used by the primary players (e.g., primary player use of basic strategy); games played by primary players (e.g., primary players nearby on the diagram all like blackjack); times when the primary players are active (e.g., primary players near to one another on the diagram may play at similar times); demographic of the primary player (e.g., primary players near to one another on the diagram may be within similar age groups; e.g., primary players near to one another on the diagram may have occupations in similar industries).","In various embodiments, a network diagram may show dealers' relationships to one another. Dealers may be located close to one another based on how quickly the dealers deal, based on how full the tables are when the dealers deal, based on how many mistakes the dealers make, based on how much players usually win when the dealers deal, and\/or based on any other factors.","A display which shows gaming devices, players, dealers, or other objects or entities as being connected does not necessarily imply that there is any physical connection between the objects or entities. Rather, the display may seek to illustrate similarities between objects or entities by showing such objects or entities as being proximate to one another or connected to one another in terms of the network display. A secondary player may find a network display useful if, for example, he finds that he likes participating in games of a certain type of gaming device and wishes to find other gaming devices with similar characteristics. To do so, he may find other gaming devices in the network display that are connected to the gaming device he already likes.","A network display may be developed or built in various ways. Objective data about gaming devices, players, dealers, or other objects or entities may be used. For example, the casino server may have data about a gaming device's jackpot, its manufacturer, whether it uses video reels or mechanical reels, or data about any other feature of the gaming device. Objective data may be used to place devices (or players, or dealers, etc.) near to other gaming devices with similar objective data (e.g., with a similar manufacturer; e.g., with a similar jackpot). A network display may be built based on the activities of secondary players. If the games of two different gaming devices tend to be participated in by many of the same secondary players, such gaming devices may be deemed similar, at least insofar as preferences of secondary players. Therefore, such gaming devices may be located near to one another on a network display. Thus, a network display may tend to place near to one another, or connected to one another, gaming devices, primary players, dealers, gaming tables, games, etc., that tend to be preferred by the same secondary players.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1110","num":"1207"},"figref":"FIG. 60","b":["1310","1320"]},"Combination Display and Betting Interface. Drag Chips to Certain Games on the Display to Make a Bet.","In various embodiments, a display may show a representation of a game, a player, a dealer, a game table, or a game. A secondary player may, in some embodiments, use the display to gather information. In some embodiments, a display may be used as a betting interface. A player may place bets on a gaming device, for instance, by selecting or designating the gaming device on the display. For example, a secondary player may drag a representation of a gaming chip onto a representation of a gaming device using a computer mouse. Doing so may indicate that the secondary player is placing a bet equal to the amount represented by the gaming chip on the next game to be played at the gaming device. A player may designate a gaming device in various other ways, such as by double clicking on the representation of the gaming device, such as by circling the gaming device with a mouse pointer, and so on. In various embodiments, a secondary player may designate a primary player using a display. For example, a display may show representations of various primary players. A secondary player may drag a representation of a gaming chip onto a representation of a selected primary player. The secondary player may thereby place a bet on the next game of the selected primary player. In various embodiments, a secondary player may drag representations of gaming chips onto a representation of a gaming table (e.g., in order to place a bet on the next game played at that gaming table), onto a representation of a dealer (e.g., in order to place a bet on the next game played by that dealer), onto a representation of a game (e.g., in order to place a bet on the next instance of that game that is played anywhere in the casino), and so on.","Different Windows for Different Games Out there. The One in Progress Comes to the Foreground. Or there are Different Criteria for Coming to the Foreground.","In some embodiments, a secondary player may participate in two or more different types of games. A secondary player may participate in games at two or more different gaming devices. A secondary player may participate in the games of two or more primary players. A secondary player may participate in the games of two or more dealers. A secondary player may participate in games at two or more tables. In various embodiments, a secondary player may participate in two or more separate games at approximately the same times. For example, the secondary player may place a first bet on a first game at a first gaming table. While the first game is still in progress, the secondary player may place a second bet on a second game at a second gaming table. The first game may resolve while the second game is still in progress. The secondary player may thereupon place a third bet on a third game at the first gaming table. While the third game is still in progress, the second game may finish. The secondary player may thereupon place a fourth bet on a fourth game at the second gaming table. Thus, for example, the secondary player may simultaneously participate in games at two or more gaming tables.","In various embodiments, where a secondary player participates in multiple different games at the same time, games falling into different categories may be shown in different windows. For example, games at different gaming tables may be shown in different windows. For example, games at different gaming devices may be shown in different windows. For example, the games of different primary players may be shown in different windows. In various embodiments, games with a common characteristic may be shown in the same window. For example, games from the same gaming table may be shown in the same window. A secondary player may, for example, place bets on the games of two different primary players, both of whom are sitting at the same gaming table.","In various embodiments, a display may alternately bring windows to the foreground based on events that happen in games featured in those windows. For example, when a game featured in a window comes to a resolution, the window featuring the game may come to the foreground. This may allow a secondary player to see what the result of the game was and how much he won. It may also give the secondary player the opportunity to bet on a new game that is to follow the game that just finished (e.g., a new game that is to be played at the same gaming device as was the game that just finished; e.g., a new game that is to be played by the same primary player as was the game that just finished; e.g., a new game that is to be played at the same gaming table as was the game that was just finished). In various embodiments, a window may come to the foreground when a featured game is about to come to a resolution. This may allow the secondary player a moment of anticipation before seeing the resolution. In various embodiments, a window may come to the foreground when there is a possibility of a large payout being won. For example, a window may feature a game of video poker. If an intermediate outcome of four cards to a royal flush is dealt, the window may come to the foreground, since there is a significant possibility that a royal flush payout may be won. In various embodiments, a window may come to the foreground if a decision is to be made in a game. For example, if a window features a game of blackjack, the window may be brought to the foreground if a decision is to be made or is about to be made in the game. The secondary player may thereby see the decision and may also have the opportunity to evaluate the skill of the primary player making the decision. In various embodiments, a window may come to the foreground if an unusual event happens in the featured game. An unusual event may include a decision that is contrary to basic strategy or optimal strategy, an occurrence of a high-payout outcome (e.g., a jackpot at a slot machine), a situation where every player at a table gets the same outcome; a situation where every player at a table wins; situation where every player at a table loses; or any other event that may be considered rare or unusual.","In various embodiments, a window may be removed from the foreground if gaming activity ceases in the game or games that were featured in the window. For example, if a gaming table is closed down, a window featuring games from the gaming table may be removed from the foreground, or removed altogether.","A window may include a bounded region on a display screen, such as a rectangular region. The region may have a well-defined border. The region may show images, text, or other visual cues which are distinct from those in areas outside the window. When a window comes to the foreground, the complete area of the window may be visible. Parts of the areas of other windows may be obscured by the window in the foreground. When a new window comes to the foreground, parts of the window that was previously in the foreground may become obscured.","Displays of People's Faces or Avatars (Sort by Mood, or Other Facial Features).","In various embodiments, a display may show the faces of primary players. The faces may be real faces, or the faces may be animated faces that do not necessarily minor the actual appearance of the primary player. Faces of primary players may be shown from photographs previously taken of the primary players. Faces of primary players may be shown live, e.g., based on footage taken by a camera of a primary player as he plays a gaming device. By viewing the faces of primary players, secondary players may have more information available to them in determining which games to participate in. For example, a secondary player may think to himself, \u201cThat guy looks like he knows what he is doing, so I'll bet on him.\u201d As another example, a secondary player may think, \u201cShe is looking very lucky today, I think I'll bet on her.\u201d","In various embodiments, to participate in a game of a primary player, a secondary player may click on the face of the primary player on the display viewed by the secondary player. The secondary player may select the face of the primary player in other ways as well. The secondary player may also view the face of a primary player, but my actually select the primary player in a different manner, such as by typing in a name or identifier associated with the primary player.","In various embodiments, software tools may be available for discerning information about a primary player based on images of the primary player's face. For example, software may be used to determine (e.g., to determine with some probability) the mood of a primary player. In various embodiments, a secondary player may sort or search primary players based on the moods of the primary players. For example, a secondary player may search for a primary player that is \u201chappy\u201d because the secondary player may feel such a primary player is likely to be on a winning streak. Software that analyzes images of a primary player may also be used to infer other information, such as age, ethnicity, gender, or health. In various embodiments, a secondary player may search or sort primary players based on any information that is discernable from images of the primary players.","In various embodiments, a display may feature images of dealers, such as images of dealers' faces. A display may also feature avatars of dealers' faces. A secondary player may choose a game to play based on the appearance of the dealer who is dealing that game. For example, a secondary player may wish to participate in a game of a dealer who appears to be in a bad mood, since the bad mood may signify to the secondary player that the house is losing. In various embodiments, software tools may be used to determine information about a dealer from images of the dealer. In various embodiments, software tools may be used to search or to sort dealers based on information that is discerned from images of the dealers.","A Virtual World Display. So Games are Organized into a Virtual World.","In various embodiments, a display may scenes from a virtual world. The virtual world may appear like a fantasy landscape, a dessert, a pasture, or the inside of a building. Within the virtual world may be representations of gaming tables or gaming devices. Such representations may have a similar appearance to actual gaming tables or gaming devices. In some embodiments, representations of gaming tables or gaming devices may have completely different appearances. For example, a gaming table may be represented as a large mushroom, while a gaming device may be represented as a rose bush. A secondary player may select a mushroom in order to participate in games at the gaming table represented by the mushroom. In some embodiments, a virtual world may organize gaming devices and game tables in different ways than they are organized in a real casino. For example, rather than intermingling different types of games, a virtual world may present all gaming devices of a first type in one area, all gaming devices of a second type in another area, and so on. Thus, it may be easy for a secondary player to find a game he might be looking for within the virtual world. In various embodiments, a secondary player may navigate the virtual world as if from the vantage point of a person walking within it. For example, the secondary player may move a joystick forward so as to get closer to objects which appear distant on the screen. Similarly the secondary player may move the joystick backwards so as to get further way from objects which appear distant on the screen.","Ways to Distribute Information Over Multiple Displays Screens (e.g., Different Floor of the Casino on Each Display).","In various embodiments, a terminal, computer, or other device used by a secondary player may include multiple display screens. On the multiple display screens, a secondary player may view information about games in which he is participating, about games that are available for him to participate in, about his current credit balances, about options for betting on games, and\/or about any other pertinent topic. There may be various ways to divide the information shown to the secondary player over the various screens.","Different Games.","In various embodiments, different screens may be used to display information about different games. For example, on a first screen, a secondary player may watch the progress of a video poker game, while on a second screen a secondary player may watch the progress of a slot machine game. As another example, a secondary player may watch the progress of a game at a first gaming device on one screen, while he watches the progress of a game at a second gaming device on another screen.","Different Types of Games.","In various embodiments, information about games of a first type may be displayed on a first screen, while information about games of a second type may be displayed on a second screen. For example, information about table games may be displayed on a first screen, while information about games from gaming devices may be displayed on a second screen. As another example, roulette games may be displayed on one screen, while video poker games are displayed on another screen.","Different Views of a Game. (From the Top, or as if You were Playing).","In various embodiments, different screens may be used to show views of the same game from different vantage points. For example, a secondary player may be participating in a table game of blackjack. One view may show the game unfolding as if the secondary player was sitting in the primary player's shoes. Thus, the secondary player may be able to see the cards dealt, but may not be able to see the primary player. Another view may show the game unfolding as if the secondary player was hovering overhead. Thus, in the second view, the secondary player may see top of the primary player's head and the cards dealt. Other views may also be possible, such as a view from the vantage point of the dealer or such as a view from the underside of the table.","Control Panel Versus Game Information.","In various embodiments, one screen may show the progress of a game in which a secondary player is participating. Another screen may show controls or interfaces that the secondary player may use. Controls or interfaces may include controls for selecting a game in which to participate, controls for selecting an amount to bet, controls for entering search criteria (e.g., search criteria for finding a game of interest to the secondary player), or controls for making any other gaming related decision, or other decision. The screen featuring the controls may be a touch screen, in some embodiments.","Game View Versus View of Statistics (e.g., about a Player, Gaming Device, Dealer, Etc.).","In various embodiments, a first screen may show the progress of a game in which the secondary player is participating. A second screen may show statistics or other information. The statistics or other information may be related in some way to the game being shown on the first screen. The statistics may indicate the probability that one or more outcomes will occur, the number of times similar cards have been dealt already in the last day, the place in a streak that a certain game occupies (e.g., this is the eighth game in a losing streak), or other information. Statistics may relate to the primary player of a game. For example, statistics may indicate the net winnings of the primary player over the last two hours, the typical strategy used by the primary player, the number of times the primary player has won a jackpot in his life, the city the primary player is from, or any other information about the primary player. The second screen may also show statistics about a dealer, game, or gaming table.","One Screen is Common to Several Secondary Players. For Example, all Secondary Players are Participating in the Games at One Table.","In various embodiments, two or more secondary players may be in proximity to one another. A screen may be visible to both of the secondary players. The screen may show information that is relevant to both secondary players. For example, both secondary players may be participating in games at the same gaming table. The screen visible to both secondary players may show the dealer's cards, or may show a view of the gaming table from high up so that all games at the table are visible. Each of the secondary players may have his own personal screen as well. A personal screen may show information that is more pertinent to the individual secondary player. For example, a personal screen may show the cards of the primary player for the game in which the secondary player is participating. Another secondary player may be participating in the game of a different primary player, and so may be unconcerned about such cards.","You can have an Actual Physical Machine Recreate What's Going on Down there. E.g., a Wheel of Fortune on Your Machine Spins. But it Just Says \u201cReenactment\u201d.","In various embodiments, a game played on a first gaming device may be reenacted on a second gaming device. For example, a primary player may play a first game at a first gaming device. A second gaming device located near a secondary player may receive information about the first game. The second gaming device may then reenact the first game by, e.g., displaying similar indicia as were displayed in the first game, by making similar sounds as were made in the first game, by flashing similar lights as were flashed in the first game, and\/or by otherwise mimicking the first gaming device. Thus, the second gaming device may function as a three dimensional display, and may be used to recreate or reenact games played at the first gaming device. In some embodiments, a gaming device near the secondary player may include a spinning wheel, as in a Wheel of Fortune game. The second gaming device may spin the wheel in the manner that the wheel was spun at the first gaming device. The secondary player may then feel the experience of watching a nearby wheel spin. In various embodiments, a device which is not a complete gaming device may nevertheless be used to reenact parts of a game that occurred on a first gaming device, e.g., in a game played by a primary player. For example, a device may include a spinning wheel as in the Wheel of Fortune game, but may not include a video display or spinning reels. In various embodiments, when a device is used to reenact or recreate a game, the device may clearly indicate that the game is only a reenactment that the game is not original, that the game will not pay out real winnings, or may provide some other related indication. When a device provides an indication that a game is only a reenactment, problems such as a person claiming a jackpot shown by the device may be avoided.","Zooming In.","In some embodiments, a secondary player may wish to watch the progress of a game. For example, the secondary player may wish to watch the progress of a game as it is played. As another example, the secondary player may wish to watch the progress of a game that had been played in the past, as if the game was currently being played (e.g., the player wishes to watch footage or a reenactment of the game). A secondary player may, for example, be perusing a floor plan view of a casino. The secondary player may find a gaming table where players have won 80% of the last 40 hands dealt. The secondary player may therefore wish to watch games at that table as the games unfold. A secondary player may indicate in various ways that he wishes to watch a game in progress. The secondary player may click on a gaming device or game table from a floor plan view of a casino. The secondary player may click on a line or record corresponding to a gaming device in a tabular view in order to watch games progressing at that gaming device. The secondary player may also key in the name of a game type, a location in a casino, or any other criteria that may narrow down the universe of gaming devices or players. Once the universe is narrowed down to one or a few games, such games may be watched as they are in progress. For example, the secondary player may be able to watch in real or in near time as bets are made, as cards are dealt.","In some embodiments, a player may watch the progress of a game together with other information. The other information may be information that was not present in the original footage. For example, the casino server may add to the game footage text indicating a probability of a certain final outcome occurring, text indicating the name of a player, text indicating what happened the last time a similar intermediate outcome occurred (e.g., text indicating what happened the last time a primary player drew to a royal flush), or any other text overlay.","Video.","In some embodiments, a secondary player may watch the progress of a game via video. The video may represent actual footage, such as from a camera overlooking a gaming table or gaming device. The video may be live, delayed or it may represent footage that has been stored from a previously played game.","Simulation.","In some embodiments, a secondary player may watch the progress of a game via a simulation. The simulation may be a simulated reenactment of the game. The reenactment may feature the dealing of animated cards and the placement of bets by animated hands holding animated chips. The simulation may show actual indicia which have occurred or are occurring in a game. The simulation may shown an animated spinning of slot machine reels, the animated roll of dice, or the animated spinning of a roulette wheel, for example.","Battle Blackjack.","In various embodiments, a game may be simulated or reenacted metaphorically. For example, rather than showing the cards dealt in a game of blackjack, a reenactment may show two people arm wrestling. As the advantage in the game shifts one way (e.g., the player has a favorable hand, such as a 20 in blackjack versus a 16 for the dealer), the arm wrestler representing the player with the advantage may be shown to be winning the arm wrestling battle (e.g., the arm wrestler representing the player may be shown having pressed the arm of his opponent to within one inch of the table). Similarly, if the player's opponent (e.g., the dealer or another game player) gains an advantage, the arm wrestler representing the opponent may be shown to gain the advantage in the arm wrestling battle. Many other metaphors for a reenacting a game may be used, including various sporting contests, battles, wars, or other confrontations or activities. The advantage of one player or another in a game may be determined probabilistically. For example, the advantage may be determined based on a player's chance of winning a game. A player's advantage may also be determined with the assumption of a particular strategy, such as basic strategy or optimal strategy.","Commentary\u2014Good or Bad Decision.","In various embodiments, a game reenactment, or live game may be shown together with commentary on the game. The commentary may indicate whether decisions made in the game were good or bad. For example, a comment may indicate that a player made a good decision, e.g., a decision according to basic strategy. As another example, a comment may indicate that a player made a decision which gave up $2 in expected value. Comments may indicate other things. For example, a comment might indicate what a player might be thinking. For example, \u201cJohn is considering between hitting or standing right here. Both would be reasonable decisions, though hitting is considered slightly better under normal conditions.\u201d","Simple Text Description of the Game.","In various embodiments, a reenactment of a game or a live display of the progress of a game may be text-based. For example, text may say, \u201cPlayer Henry M. is dealt the A 7 . . . \u201d Thus, a secondary player may get enough information to reconstruct a game, but may not necessarily see indicia or other game events in the form that they originally or actually happen. In various embodiments, a secondary player may hear audio descriptions of a game. The secondary player may hear audio commentary too.","Player Wants to be in a Game with Certain Criteria. As the Criteria Change, the Player is Automatically Switched to the New Table. E.g., I want to be on the Table with the Best Winning Streak. So it Switches You. So Currently You Might Pick a Table. Then, You Check a Box That Says Keep Me on the Table that has the Most Winnings Streak.","In some embodiments, a secondary player may indicate criteria for participating in a game. The criteria may specify a primary player of the game, a game type, a bet amount, a location in a casino, or any other data related to the game. The casino server may find games matching criteria desired by the secondary player (e.g., criteria specified by the secondary player). The casino may then allow the secondary player to participate in one or more of such games. For example, the casino server may allow the player to place a bet on one or more of such games and to receive winnings based on the outcomes of one or more such games. In some embodiments, a secondary player may continue to participate in successive games played at a particular gaming device, a particular table, played by a particular primary player, or otherwise having something in common. For example a secondary player may continue to participate in successive games played at a particular slot machine. The particular slot machine may be a slot machine that has matched criteria specified by the secondary player. For example, the slot machine may be a slot machine that has paid out the most of any slot machine in the casino in the past half hour. However, it may happen that, over time, a game, player, gaming table, gaming device, or other device or entity no longer satisfies the same criteria that it originally satisfied. For example, for a few minutes a particular slot machine may hold the distinction of having paid out more money in the most recent half hour than any other slot machine. However, during the course of those few minutes, other slot machines may make large payouts, so that the first slot machine is no longer the highest paying slot machine in the most recent half hour. Thus, in some embodiments, a secondary player may wish to switch gaming devices, to switch primary players, to switch game tables, or to make some other switch so that the secondary player can continue to participate in games that currently meet his desired criteria. Thus, for example, a secondary player may begin play at a first slot machine that has paid the most of any slot machine in the last half hour. When a new slot machine becomes the slot machine that has paid the most in the most recent half hour, the secondary player may cease participating in games at the first slot machine and may switch to participating in games of the new slot machine.","In some embodiments, a secondary player may specify criteria for a game in which he wishes to participate. The casino server may find a first game satisfying the criteria and allow the secondary player to participate in the game. The secondary player may then continue to participate in games having something in common with the first game, such as in games played by the same primary player as the first game, such as in games played at the same gaming device as the first game, such as in games played at the same gaming table as the first game, such as in games played by the same dealers as the first game, and so on. At some point, the casino server may determine that the games in which the secondary player will participate (e.g., if he keeps participating in the games of the same primary player; e.g., if he keeps participating in games at the same gaming table) will no longer meet the original criteria set forth by the secondary player. At this point, the secondary player may be switched so that he is now participating in games that do meet his original criteria. In various embodiments, a secondary player may specify whether he wishes to be switched from participating in a first set of games (e.g., from participating in a games of a first primary player) to participating in a second set of games (e.g., to participating in the games of a second primary player). The secondary player may indicate a desire to be switched when he originally specifies criteria for participating in games. For example, a secondary player may specify that he wishes to participate in the games of a first primary player who has the highest net winnings of any primary player over the last hour. The secondary player may further specify that the moment a different primary player overtakes the first primary player in terms of having the highest net winnings in the last hour, the secondary player would like stop participating in the games of the first primary player and begin participating in the games of the new, different primary player.","In various embodiments, when the games in which a secondary player is participating no longer satisfy the criteria specified by the secondary player for participating in games, the secondary player may be switched to new games automatically. For example, the secondary player may be automatically switched from participating in the games at a first table to participating in the games at a second table. In some embodiments, the secondary player is informed of this switch. For example, a message may pop up on the screen of the secondary player's display. The message may say, \u201cYou are now participating in games at Blackjack table 6, where player net winnings over the last hour are the highest of any table.\u201d In some embodiments, the secondary player may not even be informed of a switch. Rather, the secondary player may continue to see a reenactment of games without realizing the games are originating from a different gaming table. In some embodiments, though a secondary player may not be told explicitly of a switch (e.g., via a pop-up message), ways may be available for the secondary player to surmise that a switch has occurred. For example, a display screen on which the secondary player is watching a simulated reenactment of a blackjack game may include a table identifier in the lower right hand corner. When the secondary player is switched from participating in the games of a first table to participating in the games of a second table, the table number in the lower right hand corner may change.","In some embodiments, a secondary player may be asked for an input in relation to a potential switch. For example, a message may be displayed for the secondary player indicating that the secondary player is to be switched from participating in a first set of games to participating in a second set of games. The secondary player may be asked whether he would really like to be switched or whether he would like to remain a participant in the first set of games. The secondary player may be informed of the reason for the switch. For example, the secondary player may be informed that he is being switched because the second set of games better match his criteria for participating in games than do the first set of games.","In various embodiments, a secondary player may not provide an indication that he would want to switch from a first set of games to a second set of games. The secondary player may only specify criteria for selecting games in which to participate. The casino server may, in various embodiments, determine at some point that a second set of games better matches the secondary player's criteria for participating in games than does the set of games in which the secondary player is currently participating. Thus, the casino server may ask the secondary player whether he would like to switch and participate in the second set of games. The question may be asked though the secondary player never before indicated an interest in switching. The secondary player may then have an opportunity to accept or not.","In various embodiments, a secondary player may be rotated from game to game according to some algorithm. For example, after every 50 games of a first gaming device in which a secondary player participates, the secondary player may be automatically moved to a second gaming device of the same type (e.g., featuring the same game). In various embodiments, after a certain patterns of wins or losses, a secondary player may be rotated to another gaming device, game table, or primary player. For example, if a secondary player loses five games in a row while participating in the games of a first primary player, the secondary player may be automatically rotated to the games of another primary player. In some embodiments, a secondary player may be asked to confirm his approval before being rotated to a new game.","In various embodiments, a secondary player may wish to participate in a game with a certain characteristic. The secondary player may wish to participate in a game with a certain primary player, in a game at a certain gaming table, in a game at a certain gaming device, in a game with a certain betting limit, in a game with a certain jackpot, in a game made by a particular manufacturer, in a game that follows X consecutive wins, in a game that follows X consecutive losses, or in a game with any other characteristic. However, a game that conforms to the desires of the secondary player may not be immediately available for the secondary player to participate in. For example, there may be no primary player who is playing a particular gaming device whose games the secondary player wishes to participate in. Thus, in various embodiments, a secondary player may be alerted when a game that meets some criteria becomes available. The criteria may include criteria that secondary player has previously used to find a game in which to participate. For example, if no primary player is currently playing at a gaming device in whose games the secondary player wishes to participate, the secondary player may be alerted when a primary player does sit down at the gaming device.","Patterns of Betting","In various embodiments, a pattern of betting may be determined for a player, such as for a primary player or for a secondary player. A pattern of betting may entail any system of rules, tendencies, criteria, or other factors used by a player in placing a bet or series of bets.","A pattern of betting may describe or encapsulate a first player's tendency to: (a) bet on a particular second player; (b) bet on only the house (e.g., in a game of blackjack or roulette); (c) bet on only the player position (e.g., in a game where a house plays against the player); (d) double a bet after a loss; (e) change a bet size under particular circumstances; (f) bet only on a particular type of outcome (e.g., bet only on red in roulette; e.g., bet only on the pass line in craps); (g) employ a particular strategy in a game; (h) bet on a particular type of second player (e.g., a first player's betting pattern may be to always bet on a second player who has won more than $100 in the last 10 minutes); and\/or any other tendency.","A first player's pattern of betting may include the tendency to always bet on another player (e.g., on a primary player) who is the top performing player in the last hour. A first player's pattern of betting may include the tendency to always use optimal strategy in a game of blackjack. A first player's pattern of betting may include the tendency to bet on a second player only when the second player plays a particular game, such as blackjack. A first player's pattern of betting may include the tendency to bet on a second player only when the second player is on a winning streak.","In various embodiments, a pattern of betting may be exhibited by either a primary player or by a secondary player. A secondary player may exhibit a pattern of betting, for example, in the way he chooses primary players on which to bet. The secondary player may tend to choose primary players of a particular age, occupation, or skill level, for example. A secondary player may tend to bet on a particular primary player (e.g., Bob Smith), or the secondary player may tend to bet on a primary player with a certain game history (e.g., a primary player with the most money won in the last hour). A secondary player may tend to bet on any primary player that happens to be seated in a particular spot at a gaming table (e.g., at the spot just to the left of the dealer). Any tendency used by a secondary player to choose primary players on which to bet may constitute a pattern of betting.","In various embodiments, any tendency used by a player in choosing which games to play or bet on may constitute a pattern of betting. For example, a tendency of a player to bet only on blackjack may constitute a pattern of betting. A tendency of a player to bet only on slot machine games may constitute a pattern of betting.","In various embodiments, a tendency of a player to play games at a particular time may constitute a pattern of betting. For example, the tendency of the player to always play games between 1:00 pm and 2:00 pm may constitute a pattern of betting.","In various embodiments, a pattern of betting may constitute an alternating or varying pattern. For example, a secondary player may have the tendency to alternate between betting on the dealer and betting on a primary player in a game of blackjack.","In various embodiments, a pattern of betting that has been determined or deduced need not necessarily fit every bet that has been made by a particular player. For example, out of 1000 bets made by a player, a set of rules made to describe such bets may explain  of those bets, but may fail to explain the remaining 100.","Copying Someone Else's Pattern of Betting","In various embodiments, bets made by a player may be recorded, e.g., by a gaming device or a terminal where such bets are placed. Bets may also be recorded by an information capturing device, such as a scanner or camera.","Bets made by a player may be analyzed for patterns of betting. The central server may, for example, employ statistical algorithms to deduce rules or tendencies of the player in placing bets. A betting pattern may take the form of a set of rules. For example, each rule may specify one or more conditions and an action to be taken if the conditions are true. For example, a rule may state that if the last game of a first player was a win, then the first player should bet twice the amount of his previous bet on the next game he will play. As another example, a rule may state that a first player should place a bet on the player at a particular blackjack table who has won the most money in the last five hands (e.g., the first player should bet that such a player will win again).","Once patterns of betting have been determined, such patterns may be made available for use by other players. Other players may then have the opportunity to follow the same patterns in their own betting practices. For example, a first player may follow the same pattern of betting used by a second player.","A pattern of betting may be made available in a number of forms. A first player may be able to view a list of rules that would allow the first player to follow the pattern. A first player may be able to view a text description of the pattern. A first player may be able to view suggestions of what to do in a given situation (e.g., suggestions of how much to make or which strategy decision to make), where such suggestions are made in accordance with a pattern of betting.","In various embodiments, a first player may indicate a desire to automatically follow a pattern of betting used by a second player. Thus, the first player may authorize a gaming device, the central server, or some other device to automatically place bets on his behalf, or to automatically employ a particular game strategy on his behalf, in accordance with the betting patterns of a second player. The first player may then sit back and watch games unfold without providing any further input.","In various embodiments, a first player may receive information about what bet he should make or what strategy he should use next if he wishes to follow a pattern of betting of a second player. However, the first player may be given the opportunity to manually confirm or enter (e.g., via the press of a button) his own bet, so that the first player has the opportunity but not the obligation to follow the betting pattern of the second player.","In various embodiments, a first player may copy some aspects of a second player's pattern of betting, but not all aspects. For example, a first player may copy the second player's strategy, but not his pattern of varying the bet sizes. As another example, a first player may copy the betting patterns of a second player, but only when the second player is playing blackjack. As another example, a first player may copy the betting patterns of the second player, but only between the hours of 2:00 pm and 3:00 pm. As another example, a first player may copy the betting pattern of a second player, but only when the first player is ahead by more than a certain amount of money. As another example, a first player may copy the betting pattern of a second player, but only when the second player is ahead by more than a certain amount of money.","In various embodiments, a first player may search for a second player with certain characteristics. For example, a first player may search for a second player who has won more than any other player playing blackjack. The first player may then choose to copy the betting patterns of the second player. In various embodiments, a first player may periodically alter the betting patterns which he follows, depending on some criteria. For example, the first player may always follow the betting pattern of the second player who is most ahead at the moment. Thus, as different players win money and become the player with the most winnings at a casino, a first player may change the betting pattern he follows.","In various embodiments, a first player may follow the betting pattern of a second player so long as that second player is still following the same betting pattern. If the second player starts using a different betting pattern or makes bets that are inconsistent with the first betting pattern, then the first player may cease following the betting pattern of the second player.","In various embodiments, following a betting pattern need not include making the exact same bets as another player. Rather, a first player may employ the same rules for making bets that a second player uses, but may employ those rules on a different game.","Statistics on Patterns of Betting","In various embodiments, a player may wish to employ a pattern of betting. The pattern employed may be a pattern that had previously been used by a second player, or that had previously been used by a number of other players. The player may wish to know various statistics about the pattern. For example, the player may wish to know how successful the pattern has been or how many other players have used the same pattern in the past. Knowing statistics about a pattern of betting may allow a player to decide whether or not to use the pattern and\/or whether or not to choose a first pattern of betting over a second pattern of betting.","In various embodiments, a casino server or other device or entity may track the games played, the amounts bet, the strategies used, and any other information about one or more players. The casino server may use the collected information to determine betting patterns and to determine statistics about the betting patterns. The casino may determine how many players are using a particular pattern. The casino may determine how many players are using a particular pattern over a particular time interval (e.g., over a ten-minute period). The casino server may also determine how many players have used a particular pattern at all, e.g., in the last day. The casino server may determine the percentage of time that a particular pattern of betting has been used as opposed to other patterns of betting. For example, a casino server may determine that 20% of the time when any player engages in play at the casino, the player employs a particular pattern of betting.","In various embodiments, a casino may determine statistics or metrics about the success of a pattern. For example, the casino may determine which patterns of betting have resulted in the most money won for players, which patterns have resulted in the most won games for players, which patterns have been profitable for the longest amounts of time, and\/or any other metrics about a pattern. A casino may determine which pattern has been successful over the most recent time period, or during the current time period. For example, in some embodiments, a casino may determine all the patterns of betting that are currently being employed by players across the casino, or by a particular subset of players (e.g., by blackjack players). The casino may then determine which pattern is or has been the most successful according to some metric.","Upon request of a player, or without any particular request, a casino may display statistics about different patterns of betting. For example, the casino may periodically rank and re-rank patterns of betting according to which has been the most successful (e.g., which has generated the most winning per player using the pattern) over the most recent time period. A player may have the opportunity to view statistics about a pattern of betting and to use such statistics, for example, to aid in his decision of whether or not to copy the pattern of betting himself.","In various embodiments, a first player may wish to be alerted or informed about a pattern of betting that is being used by a second player. The second player may be a successful player, for example. The first player may, in particular, wish to be alerted when the second player switches his pattern of betting. For example, the first player may copy a first pattern of betting from the second player. However, if the second player switches to using a second pattern of betting, then the first player may decide to stop using the first pattern of betting, and perhaps to switch to the second pattern of betting.","The following are embodiments, not claims:","A.

During the series of games, no player input may be required. Prior to the series of games, the player may describe rules or parameters according to which the games will be played. The player may thereby configure the gaming device to use these rules or parameters. The parameters may include: (a) the number of games to be played; (b) the time to play each game; (c) the time to play the whole series of games; (d) the amount to wager on each game; (e) the strategy to be used in each game; (f) a criterion or criteria for when to stop playing automatically; (g) a criterion or criteria for when to seek player input; (h) the type or types of games to be played; (i) the gaming device or devices to be used for conducting the game (e.g., for generating game outcomes); (j) the manner in which outcomes will be communicated to the player (e.g., the outcomes may be displayed; e.g., the outcomes may be printed on a paper for the player); or any other parameters.","In various embodiments, a gaming device may be configured to use a particular strategy for a particular period of time. The particular strategy may be an optimal strategy. In various embodiments, a strategy may be optimal in the sense that it maximizes a player's expected winnings for a game once the game has been started. The particular strategy may be a strategy which allows for the highest possible payout. For example, in a game of video poker, one strategy may be to always pursue the royal flush. In various embodiments, a player may configure a gaming device to play optimal strategy for the next ten minutes. In various embodiments, a player may configure a gaming device to play blackjack using basic strategy for the next 20 minutes.","In various embodiments, a gaming device may be configured with a frequency of play. For example, the gaming device may be configured to play 10 games per minute. A gaming device may similarly be configured to have a particular period of time between games. For example, a gaming device may be configured to initiate each new game ten seconds after the last game was initiated. A gaming device may be configured to play a game of a certain length. For example, a slot machine may be configured so that the reels take 10 seconds before they stop spinning.","In various embodiments, a gaming device may be configured to play for some length of time. For example, the gaming device may be configured to conduct games for the next 45 minutes. In various embodiments, a gaming device may be configured to play games until some amount of money is won or lost. For example, a gaming device may start with a player bankroll of $50. The gaming device may be configured to keep playing until either the bankroll reaches $75 (and thereby $25 has been won) or until the bankroll reaches $25 (and thereby $25 has been lost). In various embodiments, the gaming device may cease playing even though an amount won or lost (or a bankroll) has not reached an exact threshold. For example, having started at $50, a bankroll may reach $25.50 at a dollar-denomination machine. The machine may stop playing because one further bet would risk leaving the bankroll at $24.50, which is below the lower limit for which the gaming device has been configured.","In various embodiments, a gaming device may be configured to play optimal strategy for some percentage of the games played. For example, a gaming device may be configured to play optimal strategy in 80% of games played. Thus, for example, the gaming device may randomly determine, for each game, whether it will use optimal strategy. If random determination may be made such that there is an 80% likelihood that optimal strategy will be used (e.g., there is a biased drawing made to determine whether optimal strategy will be used. In various embodiments, a gaming device may be configured to play optimal strategy for some percent of the time. For example, for the first 60% of a period of time during which a gaming device is playing automatically, optimal strategy may be used. For the remaining 40% of the time, some non-optimal strategy may be used. In various embodiments, using a strategy that is not optimal does not necessarily mean that a gaming device won't make the same decision that would have been made had it been using optimal strategy. In various embodiments, two different strategies may sometimes yield the same decision. For example, a strategy to maximize expected winnings may sometimes yield the same decision as a strategy to always shoot for the highest possible payout.","In various embodiments, a gaming device may be configured to pursue a first strategy (e.g., optimal strategy) for some percentage of time or for some percentage of games played. During the times or the games when optimal strategy is not used, some other strategy may be used. The other strategy may be a strategy which attempts to obtain the largest possible payout, whether or not obtaining such a payout is a remote possibility. The other strategy may be a strategy which always seeks to obtain a payout above a certain level. For example, one strategy in video poker may be to maximize the chances of receive a flush or better.","In various embodiments, a gaming device is configured to play a sequence of games automatically. Playing games automatically may include making strategy decisions. However, in various embodiments, a gaming device may halt the automatic play of a game and wait to receive a player input to the game. The player may then provide an input. The input may indicate a strategy to pursue in a game. For example, the input may indicate which cards to hold in a game of video poker, or whether to hit or stand in blackjack. A gaming device may halt automatic play to allow for player input for various reasons. A gaming device may halt automatic play if: (a) two possible decisions are equally valid according to some strategy (e.g., if two possible decisions both lead to the same expected winnings for the player); (b) a possible payout for a game is larger than a predetermined threshold (e.g., if a possible payout for a game is more than 500 times the amount wagered); (c) a large payout has more than a predetermined probability of occurring (e.g., if a royal flush has more than a 1% chance of occurring); (d) a winning payout is certain to occur (e.g., if a player has received three cards of the same rank in the first five cards dealt in a game of video poker, the player may be allowed to complete the game manually to experience the pleasure of winning); (e) if the gaming device has been configured to stop for any particular outcome or intermediate outcome (e.g., if the gaming device has been configured to stop automatic play when there are two aces dealt to a player in a game of blackjack then the gaming device may actually stop automatic play when two aces are dealt to a player in a game of blackjack); or any other circumstances or criteria dictate that the gaming device should halt automatic play. In various embodiments, automatic play may stop so that a gaming device may accept a player decision. However, automatic play may resume once a player has made his decision, in various embodiments. In various embodiments, after automatic play has stopped, a player must explicitly indicate that he wishes for automatic play to resume. For example, the player may press a button that says \u201cresume automatic play\u201d. Otherwise the player may continue to initiate games and make decisions manually.","In various embodiments, automatic play may be halted upon any event or sequence of events. A sequence of events may include a sequence of outcomes. Automatic play may be halted if, for example, the player wins on five games in a row, the player loses on five games in a row, the player wins more than a predetermined amount of money in a some number of games (e.g., if the player wins more than $50 in ten hands), a particular card occurs in a predetermined number of games in a row, a particular outcome occurs in a predetermined number of games in a row, or upon any other sequence events or pattern of events. Further patterns are described herein, and various embodiments contemplate that automatic play may be halted upon the occurrence of any particular or designated pattern or sequence of events.","In various embodiments, automatic play may be paused for some period of time to allow for player input. However, if the player has not provided input after some period of time, the gaming device may automatically determine an input. For example, the gaming device may determine an input according to optimal strategy. In various embodiments, a halt or a pause in automatic play may be emphasized with a beep, vibration, or other alert. For example, a beep may signify to the player that he must make some decision in a game and that he cannot sit back and watch games proceed automatically. Similarly, a vibration on a mobile gaming device may alert a player to take the mobile gaming device out of his pocket because his input is required. In various embodiments, a player may set the preference as to the type of alert that will be provided to him. In various embodiments, when automatic play stops, the gaming device may display or otherwise communicate a message to the player. The message may say that input is requested from the player. The message may further indicate the amount of time that the player has to provide an input (e.g., before automatic play is resumed). In various embodiments, when a player is asked for a manual input, the player may have an option to tell the gaming device to make its own decision. For example, a button may read \u201cKeep playing\u201d. Pressing such a button may cause the gaming device to determine a decision. The decision may be made according to any particular strategy, such as according to optimal strategy.","In various embodiments, a gaming device may halt automatic play. However the gaming device may halt automatic play only to allow a player to view the state of the current game. The gaming device may, after some period of time, resume automatic play. In various embodiments, upon a halting or pausing of automatic play, a player may have the opportunity to interject and make his own decision. For example, a player may press buttons which are ordinarily indicative of a player strategy. For example, a player may press buttons underneath cards dealt in a game of video poker, indicating the player's desire to hold the cards. By pressing such buttons, the player may override the decision process of the gaming device and cause his own decisions to be registered in the game. In various embodiments, a player may override the decisions of the gaming device at any point, not just when the gaming device has paused. For example, the player may at any point during automatic play press a button which says \u201cstop\u201d. The player may then have the opportunity to input his own decisions. The player may later press a button labeled \u201cresume\u201d or the like. Automatic play may thereupon resume.","In various embodiments, a gaming device may make decisions automatically. However, the gaming device may seek confirmation from the player. Upon learning of a decision (e.g., because an indication of the decision is displayed on the screen of the gaming device), a player may have the opportunity to press a button (or provide some other input) to stop the gaming device and instead to cause the gaming device to make a different decision. In various embodiments, a gaming device may make automatic decisions. The gaming device may allow some period of time (e.g., 3 seconds) for the player to override a decision. However, if there is no input from the player, the gaming device may proceed to generate the remaining part of the game stemming from the decision.","In various embodiments, when automatic play has been halted or paused, the player may have the opportunity to specify a new strategy to be used. When automatic play is subsequently resumed, the new strategy may be employed.","In various embodiments, when a player elects to bet on some number of games, such games may be generated and conducted for the first time for the player. In various embodiments, when a player elects to bet on some number of games, such games may include games that have already been played by other players (e.g., by primary players). Thus, for example, a player may elect to bet on 100 games. A casino server may then select 100 games that have been previously played. The selection may be random. If such games were winning for the player who originally played them, the current player may win as well. If such games were losing for the player who originally played them, the current player may lose as well. In various embodiments, a player may elect to play some number of games. A casino server may then use games that are currently being played or about to be played. For example, the casino may use games that are played at video poker machines around the casino. The player may participate in such games and may win if those games result in a win for the player side, and may lose if those games result in a loss for the player side. In various embodiments, a player may bet against a primary player, and may e.g., win when the primary player loses and lose when the primary player wins. Thus, it will be appreciated that when a player selects some number of games in which to participate, the games may be generated for the first time for that player, or the games may be games that have been or will be played by others.","In various embodiments, two or more players may wish to engage in automatic play. For example, both players may wish to have 50 games played automatically by the players' respective gaming devices. The players may, in various embodiments, participate in the same games. The common games played may, for example, come from other players around the casino. In various embodiments, the casino may have a data feed of game results from around the casino. The data feed may go to the gaming devices of players who wish to play automatically, and may thereby allow such players to participate in games from around the casino. In various embodiments, when players participate in a common set of games, the players may participate in such games out of order. For example, player A may participate first in game X and then in game Y. Player B may participate first in game Y and then in game X.","In various embodiments, a number of interfaces may be associated with automatic play. Input buttons may allow a player to override a strategy, to tell a gaming device to halt automatic play, to tell a gaming device to resume automatic play, to indicate a particular strategy to be used, to indicate the parameters using which a gaming device should initiate a session of automatic play, and to perform any other function. In various embodiments, a player may be required to make two button presses to override a strategy suggested by the gaming device. The two button presses may include pressing each of two different buttons, or may include pressing the same button twice (e.g., double clicking). In this fashion, there may be a reduced chance that a player automatically overrides a good decision of the gaming device. In various embodiments, a wheel, such as a thumb wheel, may allow a player to vary the speed of automatic play. For example, the player may move the wheel one way to increase the speed of play, and may move the wheel the other way to decrease the speed of play. In various embodiments, a button may be used to indicate that a gaming device should proceed with automatic play, such as after the gaming device has paused.","In various embodiments, when automatic play has been paused to await the player's input, or for any other reason, the player may cause automatic play to resume in various ways. The player may double click on a button to cause automatic play to proceed. In some embodiments, the player may press any button to cause automatic play to proceed. In some embodiments, the player may touch any area of a touch screen to cause automatic play to proceed. In some embodiments, the player may make a noise or vocalization. For example, the player may clap twice in order to cause automatic play to proceed. In various embodiments, a player may scroll a thumb wheel to cause automatic play to proceed.","In various embodiments, when automatic play has been paused to await the player's input, the player may provide an input in various ways. Certain ways may be available for the player to quickly and\/or conveniently provide a desired input with minimal effort. In a game of video poker, a list of strategies may be provided for a player. The list of strategies may include corresponding expected winnings for each strategy, and\/or may include one or more other statistics for each strategy. The strategies may be sorted by expected value or by some other metric. The player may then select a strategy with one input based on his desired metric. For example, to execute the strategy with the highest expected winnings, the player may simply click on the strategy from the list. This may save the player the trouble of executing the strategy himself by, for example, selecting all cards to hold in order to follow the strategy. In some embodiments, a player may indicate that a random strategy should be followed. For example, in bonus round, a player may have the option of opening one of three envelopes. The player may press a button, touch an area of the screen, or otherwise provide an indication that a random strategy should be chosen on the player's behalf and carried out (e.g., that a random envelope should be chosen).","Game Play as Lottery Ticket\/Entry into Drawing","In various embodiments, every game played could be an entry into a drawing. The faster games are played (e.g., in an automatic play mode), the more entries a player may receive. Drawings may be done at certain times, e.g., at 4:00 every day or at random times. Thus, players may be encouraged to play games at a more rapid pace (e.g., to have games played automatically at a more rapid pace) so as to accumulate plenty of entries by the time any random drawing occurs. In various embodiments, cards received in games may constitute entries into a drawing. A player may win if the cards he has received in a game match the cards drawn in a drawing. As will be appreciated, other game indicia may serve as entries into a drawing, where indicia drawn may be compared to indicia received from players entering the drawing. In various embodiments, games played, cards received, or other indicia received may serve as entries into a drawing. In various embodiments, a meter may indicate to a player how many hands he has played, how many cards he has received, and\/or how many other types of indicia he has received. The meter may thereby indicate to the player how many entries he has in an upcoming drawing. The player may be encouraged to play more rapidly so as to watch the meter go higher.","In various embodiments, outcomes or indicia received by a player in a first game may serve as entries into a second game, e.g., into a drawing. In various embodiments, entry into the second game may be free of charge. For example, the player's outcomes or indicia may be entered automatically once the player has made his bet in the first game and played the first game. In various embodiments, the player may have to pay extra or otherwise provide extra consideration in order to be entered into the second game. In various embodiments, the player may make a bet on a first game, and then pay an additional amount equal to 10% of the bet in order to be entered into a second game. In various embodiments, the price of entry into the second game may be a proportion of the bet in the first game (e.g., 20%; e.g., 50%), or may be a fixed price (e.g., $0.10; e.g., $1.00). In various embodiments, a player may stand to win in the second game an amount that is based on the bet made by the player for the second game. In various embodiments, the player may stand to win in the second game an amount that is based on the bet made by the player for the first game. In various embodiments, a player may make a single bet prior to starting the first game. The single bet may enter the player into both the first game and into the second game. In various embodiments, the player makes a first bet on the first game. The player later (e.g., after completing the first game) has the option of making the second bet in order to enter his outcome from the first game into the second game. In various embodiments, the player may configure his gaming device, mobile gaming device, personal computer, or other device, to automatically (e.g., without the player's further input) enter the player into the second game. The automatic entry may entail deducting further credits from the player. In various embodiments, the player may manually confirm a desire to be entered in the second game after finishing the first game.","Interface","In various embodiments, an interface, such as a graphical user interface, may allow a player to enter or play in a second game based on an outcome, result, or indicium from a first game. The player may use the interface to specify an amount to bet in the second game. For example, the player may enter an absolute amount to bet (e.g., $0.25) or may enter a percentage. The percentage may represent a percentage of the player's bet for the first game. The player may use the interface to specify whether he will be entered automatically into the second game following the conclusion of the first game. For example, if the player checks a particular box on the interface, then at the conclusion of a first game, an additional number of credits will be deducted from the player's credit balance and the player will be automatically entered into the second game. In various embodiments, the player may check a box that says he never wishes to be entered into a second game following the conclusion of the first game. In this case, the player may proceed from game to game without ever being entered into the drawing (or other procedure) of the second game. In various embodiments, a player may check a box or otherwise indicate that he wishes to have the option of entering the second game following the conclusion of the first game. Subsequently, once the player has finished the first game, the player's device (e.g., gaming device, e.g., betting terminal, e.g., mobile gaming device, e.g., kiosk) may prompt the player with a question asking the player whether or not he would like to enter his outcome from the first game into the second game. The player may then press one of two buttons, such as \u201cyes\u201d button or \u201cno\u201d button, to indicate whether or not he would like the outcome from the first game to enter him into the second game. The prompt given to the player may indicate a number of credits that will be deducted from the player should he decide to be entered into the second game.","The interface may include a graphical display on a display screen. The display may include text boxes, check boxes, buttons, or other areas where a player may enter information. The player may enter information using a mouse, keyboard, joystick, track ball, or any other input device. The player may enter information using a touch screen interface, e.g., by touching the display which shows information that the player enters. In various embodiments, the player may use voice to enter information into the interface.","In various embodiments, the interface may show an indicator of whether the player will be automatically entered into the second game, whether the player will not be entered into the second game, or whether some other event will transpire. For example, a border of the graphical user interface may be a first color if the player will be automatically entered into the second game, and a second color if the player will not be automatically entered into the second game. In this way, a player may be easily aware of when he will automatically be entered into the second game and when he will not be. Many other indicators are also possible. For example, a flashing portion of the display screen, or a flashing light on the player's gaming device may indicate when the player will or will not be automatically entered into the second game. In various embodiments, a sound effect or tone may indicate when the player stands to be automatically entered into a second game, and when he doesn't.","In various embodiments, the player may readily enter into his GUI a preference as to whether or not to be automatically entered into a second game upon completing a first game. For example, the player may check a box that causes the outcomes of his first game (e.g., a slot machine game) to be automatically entered into a second game (e.g., a lottery-type drawing). However, after playing 10 games, the player may decide he no longer wishes to be entered automatically into the second game following the completion of the first game. As such, the player may uncheck the box. The player may indicate a desire to be entered automatically or not in many other ways. For example a button or a switch on the player's device may toggle the device between a state where the player is entered automatically into the second game and a state where he is not.","In various embodiments, the player may configure his device (e.g., his gaming device), to automatically enter him into the second game conditional on the occurrence of some outcomes. For example, if the player is playing a game of video poker, the player may wish that only hands with the ranking of \u201cflush\u201d be entered into the second game. Thus, if the player achieves a flush in the first game, the hand may be automatically entered into the second game. However, if the player does not achieve a flush in the first game, then the player may receive no entry into the second game following the first game.","In various embodiments, when the player has been entered into a second game, a message or other text may appear on his display screen (e.g., on his GUI). The message may inform the player that he has been entered into the second game.","In various embodiments, when a player begins a first game, bets for both the first game and for the second game may be deducted from the player's credit balance. In this way, money is not later automatically deducted from the player. Rather, the player consciously chooses at the outset to bet in both the first and the second game. If the player wanted to, the player could bet only in the first game.","In various embodiments, a jackpot, such as a progressive jackpot, may receive as contributions portions of bets made from automatic play. Thus, automatic play may cause a jackpot to grow in size. Players who participate in automatic play may also have the opportunity to win the jackpot, such as the progressive jackpot. Thus, players may have additional incentive to engage in automatic play.","In various embodiments, a particular area of a casino includes facilities to allow secondary players to monitor primary players at one or more games throughout the casino, or at one or more games beyond the casino. The area of the casino may include one or more monitors. Such monitors may be small or large. Large monitors, for example, may be visible to multiple secondary players. Small monitors may be visible to individual secondary players. Further, the individual players may customize the small monitors so as to view the primary player of interest, a statistic of interest, a game of interest, or anything else of interest. The monitors may display various information. Monitors may display video feeds from games. For example, a monitor may show a video feed of a blackjack game which is in progress. Monitors may recreate game outcomes. For example, a monitor may show a rendition of a slot machine game that has been or is being played by a primary player. Monitors may also show statistics. For example, a monitor may show the total amount of money won by a primary player in the last hour, the number of times a particular dealer has busted in the past half hour, the number of consecutive times red has come up at the roulette wheel, and so on. In various embodiments, a monitor may show betting rules, odds, payout ratios, and other information which may apply to bets made by the secondary player. For example, a monitor may indicate that a secondary player can win a payout at odds of 1:1 by for betting that a primary player will get red in roulette, and that the secondary player can win a payout at odds of 16:1 for betting that a primary player will get red four times in a row at roulette.","In various embodiments, an area of the casino may include facilities for betting on one or more games being monitored. For example, terminals may allow secondary players to place bets on a game, e.g., on a game which is being monitored. The terminal may include keys, acceptors for charge cards (e.g., for credit cards or debit cards), acceptors for currency or gaming chips, acceptors for cashless gaming tickets, keys or buttons for entering betting information (e.g., for entering an amount to bet; e.g., for choosing a game on which to bet), and any other facilities or interfaces for allowing bets. A terminal may include a monitor. The monitor may be used to display betting information to a secondary player, to show the secondary player the game on which he is betting, to show the secondary player how much money he has won, and to show the secondary player any other information related to his bet or otherwise relevant to the player.","In various embodiments a betting area for secondary players to bet on and monitor the games of primary players may have the appearance of a sports book.","As used herein, the term \u201cviewing window\u201d includes an area of a gaming device at which symbols or outcomes are visible. The area may, for instance, include a pane of glass or other transparent material situated over reels of the gaming device. Thus, only the portion of the reels under the transparent material may be visible to the player. A viewing window may include a display screen, in some embodiments. The symbols or outcomes visible in the viewing window may include the symbols or outcomes that determine the player's winnings.","Encryption","As used herein, the term \u201cencryption\u201d refers to a process for obscuring or hiding information so that the information is not readily understandable without special knowledge. The process of encryption may transform raw information, called plaintext, into encrypted information. The encrypted information may be called ciphertext, and the algorithm for transforming the plaintext into ciphertext may be referred to as a cipher. A cipher may also be used for performing the reverse operation of converting the ciphertext back into plaintext. Examples of ciphers include substitution ciphers, transposition ciphers, and ciphers implemented using rotor machines.","In various encryption methods, ciphers may require a supplementary piece of information called a key. A key may consist, for example, of a string of bits. A key may be used in conjunction with a cipher to encrypt plaintext. A key may also be used in conjunction with a cipher to decrypt ciphertext. In a category of ciphers called symmetric key algorithms (e.g., private-key cryptography), the same key is used for both encryption and decryption. The sanctity of the encrypted information may thus depend on the key being kept secret. Examples of symmetric key algorithms are DES and AES. In a category of ciphers called asymmetric key algorithms (e.g., public-key cryptography), different keys are used for encryption and decryption. With an asymmetric key algorithm, any member of the public may use a first key (e.g., a public key) to encrypt plaintext into ciphertext. However, only the holder of a second key (e.g., the private key) will be able to decrypt the ciphertext back in to plaintext. An example of an asymmetric key algorithm is the RSA algorithm.","It will be appreciated that other methods besides encryption may be used to hide or obscure information, such as encoding or steganography. Such methods may also be used in conjunction with cryptography.","Encryption may be used to:","Send a message only specific recipients can read. For example, Alice and Bob may both be in possession of the same secret key. Alice may encrypt a plaintext message with the secret key. She may transmit the resultant ciphertext to Bob. Bob may then decrypt the cyphertext using the secret key so as to view the plaintext version of the message.","Allow messages to be encrypted by many and decrypted only one (e.g., PGP). For example, Alice may possess a public and a private key. Bob may wish to send Alice a message that only Alice will be able to read. Bob may create a message in plaintext and encrypt it using Alice's public key. Bob may send the resultant ciphertext to Alice. Alice may then decrypt the ciphertext using her private key, and may thereby view the plaintext message. Should Cindy intercept the ciphertext message on its way from Bob to Alice, Cindy would not be able to decrypt the message since Cindy would not have access to Alice's private key. Alice's public key, although available to Cindy, would not be sufficient to decrypt the ciphertext message in a practicable amount of time.","Authenticate the sender of a message. This use of encryption may include having the sender create a digital signature. For example, Alice would like to send a message to Bob in such a way that Bob can be confident that the message has come from her. Alice may construct a plaintext message and encrypt the plaintext into ciphertext using her private key. Alice may then send the ciphertext message to Bob. Bob may then use Alice's public key to decrypt the ciphertext back in to plaintext. Since Alice's public key only works to decrypt a ciphertext message created using Alice's private key, and since presumably only Alice has access to her own private key, Bob can be confident that the message originated from Alice.","Allow for non-repudiation. If a sender has applied a digital signature to a message, or portion of a message, then the sender will not later be able to claim he did not send the message.","Guarantee a time\/data sent. See hashing below.","Guarantee receipt by recipient. See hashing below.","Verify that a message has not been altered after being sent by the sender. See hashing below.","Hashing is a process whereby input data, typically of arbitrary length, is transformed into output data, typically of shorter length and\/or of fixed length. A hash function is a function that performs the transformation. Often, useful hash functions will be one-way functions. That is, for a given input, the output can be computed readily. However, for a given output, the input which produced the output will be difficult to calculate. Also, useful hash functions will often have the property that two differing inputs rarely produce the same output. Hashing can be used for the following purposes:","To perform data redundancy checks. For example, a database may contain a large number of names. The names may be of arbitrary length. To check for redundant names, hash values for the names may be created. The hash values may be of smaller size than the names and may all be of the same length. Thus, it may be easier to compare the hash values of the names that it will be to compare the names themselves.","To verify that a message has not been altered. For example, Alice can send a plaintext message to Bob along with a hash value of the message. Alice can apply a digital signature to the hash value so as to assure Bob that the hash value has been sent by Alice. When Bob receives the plaintext message from Alice, Bob can compute the hash value of the message. If the hash value that Bob computes is the same as the hash value that Alice has sent to Bob, then Bob can be fairly confident that the message has not been altered en route from Alice to Bob.","To prove possession of a message without having to reveal the message. For example, Alice can send a message to Bob. Bob can take the hash of the message and send it back to Alice. Alice may thus be assured that Bob has the message without the risk of the message being intercepted en route from Bob to Alice.","To prove possession of a message at a certain time without having to reveal the message. For example, Alice might have a great idea and wish to prove she came up with it at a certain time without having to reveal the idea. Thus, Alice might write out the idea in the form of text, and take a hash value of the text. Alice can then publish the hash of the text in a newspaper. It will then be readily apparent that Alice had possession of the idea at least on the date of the newspaper's publication.","To timestamp a document. For example, a document may be sent to a time-stamping service. The service may then determine the hash value of the document. The service may append the then current date and time to the hash value of the document and apply a digital signature to the result. The digitally signed hash value plus date and time may then be published. So long as the time-stamping service can be trusted to provide accurate dates and times (e.g., not to use old dates and times) then the published timestamp may serve as proof that the document was in existence as of the date and time provided by the time-stamping service. Further precautions may ensure that it becomes very difficult for even the time-stamping service to provide fake times and dates. For example, the time-stamping service may add a sequence number, (e.g., 1, 2, 3, etc.) to each document it timestamps. If the service wishes to provide an old date, the service would have to find an older sequence number. The older sequence number would have to fit between two sequence numbers used immediately before and immediately after the desired fake date. However, no such sequence number would be available if, e.g., no numbers had been skipped in the first place.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1273","num":"1441"},"figref":["FIG. 48","FIG. 48","FIG. 48","FIG. 48"],"b":["110","130","160","140","110","120","170","190","190","110","190","180","120","110","170","150"]},"In some embodiments, the server of Casino A  may receive data about a game from gaming device  or from monitoring device .

Announcements may include promotions for other products, such as automobiles, toothpaste, or plane flights to the Caribbean. Announcements may further include announcements about primary players in which the secondary player may be interested. For example, an announcement may indicate that a favored primary player of the secondary player has just begun play.","Another area of the display screen includes a list of primary players that are available in the sense that the secondary player may participate in the games of these primary players.

For Example, One Player Bets on Whether a Winning Outcome Will be Achieved in the Game of Another Player. For Example, One Player Bets on Whether Another Player Will Win.","In various embodiments, one player may place a bet and either win or lose money based on the results of a game played by another player. As used herein, \u201cprimary player\u201d, \u201cprimary players\u201d, and the like, may refer to a player or players who most directly participate in a game, such as a casino game. A primary player may, for example, be physically located at a slot machine and may participate in a game at the slot machine by inserting a coin, indicating a bet amount, and pulling a handle of the slot machine. A primary player may also be physically located at a table game, such as a game of blackjack with a live dealer. In various embodiments, a primary player directly initiates a game in which he participates, e.g., by pulling the handle of slot machine or physically placing a bet at a table game and motioning to a dealer that he is interested in playing. In various embodiments, a particular game would not occur but for the actions of the primary player.","As used herein, \u201csecondary player\u201d, \u201csecondary players\u201d, and the like, may refer to a player or players who participate or may come to participate in games played by primary players or by other secondary players. For example, a secondary player places a bet on a game in which a primary player is involved. The secondary player wins if the primary player wins, and the secondary player loses if the primary player loses. In another example, a secondary player places a bet for a game that has already occurred. When placing the bet, the secondary player does not know the outcome of the game. Once the secondary player has placed the bet, the outcome of the game may be revealed to the secondary player, and the secondary player may be paid if the outcome is a winning outcome. In another embodiment, secondary player A places a $10 bet on secondary player B, betting that secondary player B will win a game on which secondary player B has placed a $20 bet. If secondary player B wins the $20 bet, then secondary player A will win the $10 bet. In various embodiments, the secondary player does not initiate the game in which he participates. In various embodiments, a game in which the secondary player participates would occur whether or not the secondary player chose to bet on the game. The game in which a secondary player participates may be initiated by a primary player or may be initiated automatically, e.g., by a computer program.","Where ever data is used herein, it should be understood that such data may be stored, such as in a database or in any other suitable medium, format, or data structure.

The data may be retrieved as needed from its storage location. When data is generated but not immediately needed, such data may be stored for later retrieval. Data may be accessible by reference to any part of the data, including any tag or label associated with the data. For example, if some data elements of a set of data elements are known, the remaining data elements from the set of data elements may be retrieved based on the known data elements. For example, the known data elements may serve as a search key for finding the remaining data elements in the set of data elements.","In all applicable embodiments described herein, any data generated, transmitted, stored, retrieved, or used may also be stored for auditing purposes. Such data may be made available to regulators to casinos (e.g., to casinos generating the data; e.g., to casinos using the data), or to any other relevant party. Data that may be stored may include data describing the size of a bet made by a primary player on a game, the type of bet made by a primary player on a game, intermediate events that occurred during a game (e.g., rolls prior to the final roll in a game of craps), the date of a game, the decision options that were available in a game (e.g., hit, stand in blackjack), the decisions that were made in a game, the outcome of a game, the amount paid to the winner of a game, and so on.","In various embodiments, data may be collected and stored relating to any searches of game related data. For example, suppose a secondary player searches for all games in which a payout of more than 100 coins was won. Accordingly, data indicating the search criteria may be stored so that it may be possible to determine in the future that a secondary player searched for all games in which a payout of more than 100 coins was won. Further data describing the results of a search may be stored. For example, if the search by the secondary player yielded 1218 games, then this fact may be stored. Further identifiers for each game identified by the search may be stored.","One Player Places Bets on a Game in which Another Player Participates.","In various embodiments, a secondary player may place a bet on the outcome of a game itself. For example, a secondary player may place a bet on the outcome of a slot machine game. If the outcome \u201cbar-bar-bar\u201d occurs in the game, then the secondary player may receive ten times his bet. The secondary player need not, in various embodiments, place the same type of bet as does the primary player. For example, the primary player may initiate a craps game with a \u201cpass\u201d bet. The secondary player may bet on the same craps game, but may place a \u201cdon't pass\u201d bet. Thus, though the secondary player and the primary player have placed bets on the same game, the primary player may lose and the secondary player may win.","One Player Places Bets on how Another Player Will do.","In various embodiments, a secondary player may place a bet on what will happen to a primary player in a game. The secondary player does not, in various embodiments, bet on the outcome of the game itself, but only on how the outcome of the game effects the primary player given the primary player's bet on the game. For example, the secondary player may bet that the primary player will win the game. If the primary player wins, then the secondary player's bet may be a winning bet and the secondary player may receive a payment. If, however, the primary player loses, then the secondary player may lose.","In various embodiments, the secondary player may bet that the primary player will lose. The secondary player may thus receive a payment for a winning bet if the primary player loses, but the secondary player may lose his bet if the primary player wins.","It should be noted that often, a bet placed by a primary player will provide the house or casino with an advantage. This is how the house may make money, on average. Thus, if a secondary player is permitted to place a bet against a primary player, then the secondary player may enjoy the same advantage as the house. In various embodiments, the secondary player may be charged a fee for betting against the primary player. The fee may provide the house with an advantage in a bet that might otherwise favor the secondary player. The fee may be a flat fee. The fee may be a percentage of the secondary player's bet. The fee may be taken only from payments of winnings received by the secondary player. For example, if the secondary player wins a payment of $10 based on a $10 bet placed, 50 cents may be deducted from the payment and kept by the house.","In various embodiments a fee charged to the secondary player may be set at an amount which provides to the house the same advantage as the house had against the primary player. As used herein, a \u201chouse advantage\u201d or \u201chouse edge\u201d may be defined as a ratio of the expected amount won by a casino to the initial amount bet by a player. Suppose that a house advantage on a game is 1.41%. Thus, a primary player who bets $1 could expect to receive $0.98.59 back, on average. Further, suppose that a primary player initially bets $1 and may receive back $0 (for a net loss of $1) or may receive back $2 (for a net gain of $1). An exemplary such bet would be a $1 pass bet in the game of craps. The secondary player, in this example, may bet $1 against the primary player. The secondary player would then expect to receive back $1.01.41, on average. In order to give the house the same advantage against the secondary player that it had against the primary player, the secondary player may be charged a fee of $0.02.82. This fee may be rounded to $0.03, or may be varied over a large number of secondary player bets so as to average out to $0.02.82. With the fee taken into account, the secondary player might expect to receive $0.98.59 back per dollar bet, providing the house with the same advantage against the secondary player as it had against the primary player.","In various embodiments, the secondary player may not be allowed to take exactly the opposite position as does the primary (e.g., where all wins for the primary player are losses for the secondary player, and vice versa). In various embodiments, an outcome that causes the primary player to lose may not result in a win for the secondary player, even though the secondary player has bet against the primary player. For example, an outcome of \u201cplum-orange-cherry\u201d may cause the primary player to lose, but may also cause the secondary player to lose. In various embodiments, an outcome that caused the primary player to lose may result in a push or tie for the secondary player. In this way, the house may maintain an edge against the secondary player even if the house also had an edge against the primary player. In various embodiments, the outcomes which are losing for the primary player and not winning for the secondary player may be chosen in such a way that the house is given the same advantage over the secondary player that it had over the primary player. For example, suppose that a particular game provides the primary player with the potential to either win $1 net, or lose $1 net. Suppose further that the game has a 2% house edge. Suppose further that outcomes X and Y in the game are both losing outcomes for the primary player. Outcome X occurs with probability 0.03, and outcome Y occurs with probability 0.01. With a bet of $1 against the primary player, the secondary player would ordinarily expect to win $1.02, for an average net profit of $0.02. However, in various embodiments, outcomes X and Y may also be counted as ties for the secondary player. The secondary player's expected payment is then reduced by the probability of X times the amount that would have been won (beyond the bet amount) upon the occurrence of X, plus the probability of Y times the amount that would have been won (beyond the bet amount) upon the occurrence of Y. This reduction is equal to 0.03\u00d7$1+0.01\u00d7$1=$0.04. The secondary player's expected winnings have thus been brought down from $1.02 to $0.98. This reduction provides the house with the same 2% edge against the secondary player as it had in the original game against the primary player.","In various embodiments, the secondary player may bet against an outcome that would ordinarily be winning in a game. For example, in a game of blackjack, the secondary player may bet that the dealer will win. In various embodiments, the house may then alter the probabilities of various outcomes in the game so as to return an edge to the house. For example, if a secondary player bets on the dealer in a game of blackjack, the house may remove cards with low point values from the deck. This may reduce the probability of a dealer win, and thus may reduce the probability that the secondary player may win when betting on the dealer. In various embodiments, a game where the secondary player bets on the house may not be a game that was actually played by a primary player. Rather, the game may be a game that is or was simulated by the house with probabilities of various outcomes altered from the standard probabilities of the game.","In various embodiments, a secondary player may take the house's position, or approximately the house's position, and bet against a primary player. The secondary player may thereby lose whatever the primary player wins, and win whatever the primary player loses. For example, if the primary player loses his bet of $1, then the secondary player may win $1. However, if the primary player wins $10, the secondary loses $10. In order that the house may be sure of collecting $10 from the secondary player in the event that the primary player wins $10, the house may require the secondary player to place a sufficient deposit with the house to cover possible losses of the secondary player. The deposit might come in the form of a credit balance that the secondary player has accumulated (e.g., as a result of inserting bills, or as a result of winning bets), in the form of a financial account that the house is free to charge in order to collect on the secondary player's obligations (e.g., the secondary player may provide a credit card number), in the form of a check that the secondary player has provided to the house, or in any other suitable form. In various embodiments, the house may require a deposit or other commitment from the secondary player equal to the maximum possible payout that may be received by the primary player. For example, suppose the primary player participates in a game in which the primary player may win up to $100. If the secondary player bets against the primary player, then the secondary player may risk losing up to $100 in a game. The house may thus require the secondary player to have a credit balance of as much as $100 in order to bet against the primary player. In various embodiments, the house may require the secondary player to confirm (e.g., by pressing a button) that the secondary player is aware he has the potential to lose up to X amount, where X is the maximum the secondary player might lose from participating in a game.","In various embodiments, a secondary player may bet against a primary player while not mirroring the payouts of the primary player. For example, the secondary player may bet $1 on a game in which the secondary player bets that the primary player will lose. If the primary player does lose the game, the secondary player may receive $1.25, for a net profit of $0.25. If, the primary player wins, the secondary player may lose his bet of $1, for a net loss of $1. The secondary player may lose $1 regardless of the amount that the primary player wins. For example, the secondary player may lose $1 whether the primary player wins $1 or whether the primary player wins $100.","In various embodiments, the secondary player may bet that a primary player will win a certain multiple of the primary player's bet in a given game. For example, the secondary player may bet $5 that the primary player will win at least triple the primary player's bet of $2 in a game. The secondary player may win $20 if the primary player wins at least $6. Otherwise, the secondary player may lose his bet of $5.","In various embodiments, the secondary player may be paid according to a table or function that maps every possible result of a primary player to a payment for the secondary player. For example, the secondary player may receive $3 if the primary player wins $0, $5 if the primary player wins $1, $0 if the primary player wins $2, $0 if the primary player wins $3, $1 if the primary player wins $4, and so on. As will be understood, the function need not perform a linear or continuous mapping.","In various embodiments, a secondary player may be forbidden and\/or prevented from placing a bet that would provide the secondary player with an edge. For example, a secondary player may be prevented from betting against a primary player, where the house had an edge versus the primary player.","A Player Places Bets for Games from the Past.","In various embodiments, a secondary player may place a bet on a game that has occurred in the past. With respect to the game, at least one of the following may have occurred in the past (e.g., before the secondary player placed a bet on the game): (a) the game's start; (b) the game's conclusion; (c) collection of a bet from the primary player who played the game; and (d) payment of winnings to the primary player who played the game.","When a game is originally played, a record of the game may be created. The record may include data sufficient to recreate all or part of the game. Such data may include: (a) one or more seeds or random numbers used to generate outcomes for the game; (b) one or more outcomes of the game (e.g., \u201ccherry-bell-lemon\u201d; e.g., a sequence of five cards, such as cards constituting a poker hand; e.g., a set of hands of cards, such as a player hand and dealer hand, or such as a player hand and hands of the player's opponent; e.g., the number or numbers showing on one or more dice, such as in a game of craps; e.g., a sequence of numbers showing on a sequence of dice rolls; e.g., a set of numbers in a game of keno; e.g., the payouts achieved in a bonus round; e.g., the level achieved in a bonus round); (c) one or more symbols comprising an outcome of the game; (d) one or more cards; (e) reel positions for one or more reels of a slot machine; (f) a number of decks used; (g) a decision made by a primary player of the game; (h) one or more algorithms used to generate an outcome of the game; (i) an identifier for the gaming device used in the game; (j) a pay table used for the game; (k) a make, model, or year for the gaming device used in the game; (l) a date or time when the game was played; (m) a location where the game was played; (n) a dealer involved in the game; (o) a position of the primary player at a table used in playing the game; (p) an identifier (e.g., a name) for the primary player who played the game; (q) an identifier of another player in the game (e.g., another player at a blackjack table where the game was played); (r) a bet made by a primary player of the game; (s) winnings received by the primary player in the game; (t) video footage of the game; (u) audio footage of the game; and (v) an order of cards dealt from a deck of cards. Video footage of the game may include video footage from various perspectives. In some embodiments, video footage may show or focus on cards, dice, or reels, or other items which determine and\/or reveal the outcome of a game. Video footage may include footage of actions in a game, such as footage of a player making bets, making decision, and\/or collecting winnings. Such video footage may focus on a player's hands, for example. In some embodiments, video footage may show or focus on a dealer or other casino representative in charge of a game. In some embodiments, video footage may show or focus on a player's face or body. For example, video footage may show a player's facial expressions or body language during a game. In some embodiments, video footage may focus on spectators. In some embodiments, video footage is recorded from a live game. In some embodiments, video footage is generated. Video footage may be generated based on stored data about a game.","Video footage may be generated in a number of ways. In some embodiments, video footage may be generated by assembling stock video clips. For example, one stock video clip may show a primary player (e.g., an actor acting as a primary player) making a bet. Another stock video clip may show a primary player rolling the dice. There may be stock video clips of every possible outcome in a game. For example, there may be a stock video clip showing the every possible roll of two dice. To assemble video footage of a complete game, the casino may e.g., put together a video clip of a bet being made, a video clip of an outcome being rolled corresponding to the outcome that actually occurred in the original game the secondary player is betting on, and a video clip of a player collecting his winnings. In some embodiments, stock video footage may include video footage of entire games. Should a similar game later occur, the same video footage may be used for the similar game when the secondary player is participating in the similar game.","In some embodiments, video footage is generated using computer algorithms. For example, computer algorithms may generate footage showing a simulated primary player placing a bet and rolling dice, the dice bouncing and landing, a simulated croupier paying winnings, and so on. In various embodiments, video may be generated so as to be true, as much as practicable, to the data of the game. For example, video may be generated to show a video or animated depiction of an outcome that actually occurred in a game of a primary player.","In various embodiments, video may be generated based on data about a game. Data indicating the bet amount of a primary player may be used to generate video of a primary player (e.g., a simulated primary player) making a bet of the same bet amount. Data indicating an outcome of a game may be used to generate video showing the same outcome being generated. Data indicating intermediate symbols or indicia that appear during a game may be used to generate video showing those same intermediate symbols or indicia. For example, data indicating that a particular position at a blackjack table was dealt the seven of hearts may be used to generate video showing the simulated dealing of the seven of hearts on a simulated blackjack table. Data indicating the identity of a primary player may be used to generate video. For example, based on a stored photo of a primary player, the casino may generate cartoon caricatures of the primary player playing a game. Data indicating the age or other demographic of a primary player may be used to generate video. For example, if the primary player is a 60 year-old female, the casino may generate a cartoon caricature of a 60 year-old female playing a game. In some embodiments, demographic data about a player may be used to retrieve stock footage of a player with similar characteristics. For example, stock footage of a 60 year-old female player may be retrieved.","The record of the game may be stored by a gaming device, casino server, third party server, or other device. Subsequently, a secondary player may place a bet on the game, or on some aspect of the game. Once the secondary player has placed a bet, data stored in the record may be used to recreate the game, or to recreate some aspect of the game. For example, video footage of the game may be shown to the secondary player. In some embodiments, the outcome of the game may simply be displayed for the secondary player.","Based on the outcome of the game, and based on the bet placed by the secondary player, the secondary player may lose his bet, lose a portion of his bet, break even, or be paid winnings. For example, if the outcome of the game is a winning outcome, then the secondary player may be paid based on the standard rules of the game. For example, if the secondary player bets $10 on a game of blackjack, and the primary player in the game received 20 points to the dealer's 19, then the secondary player may win $10 in addition to keeping his bet.","If the secondary player has placed a bet on what would happen to the primary player, then the winnings and\/or losses of the primary player may be revealed to the secondary player. For example, if the secondary player bet against the primary player, and the primary player lost, the secondary player may win. If the secondary player made a bet whereby the secondary player receives twice the winnings of the primary player, and the primary player wins $20, then the secondary player may receive $40","A Primary Player on which a Secondary Player was Betting is No Longer Available.","In various embodiments, a secondary player may participate in one or more games played by a primary player. For example, the secondary player may place bets on the games played by the primary player. The primary player may, at some point, terminate his playing session. The secondary player may, on the other hand, wish to continue his participation in the games of the primary player, and may thus find himself deprived of opportunities to make bets on the games of the primary player.","A Primary Player is Asked to Stay.","In various embodiments, the primary player may signal his intention to terminate a playing session. For example, the primary player may stand up, cash out, refrain from placing a bet even though he is at a table game, and so on. The secondary player may signal his desire to continue participating. For example, the secondary player may press a button labeled \u201ccontinue session\u201d on a betting interface. The secondary player may communicate his desire verbally (e.g., to a casino representative), via text (e.g., via a text message sent to a casino representative) or in any other manner. Regardless of whether the secondary player actually signals his desire to continue participating, the primary player may be contacted. For example, a representative of the casino may contact the primary player. Such a representative may include a waitress, pit boss, dealer, etc. The primary player may be asked to stay and to continue playing. The primary player may be offered a benefit for staying, such as cash, goods or services, a free meal, show tickets, improved odds, comp points, and so on. The primary player may be informed that there is a secondary player who appreciates the results of the primary player and wishes for the primary player to remain.","In some embodiments, a primary player who has signaled an intent to leave may be asked to stay only if one or more criteria are satisfied. For example, the primary player may be asked to stay only if at least three secondary players have been participating in the games of the primary player. Other criteria may include: (a) there are at least X secondary players watching the games of the primary player; (b) there are at least X secondary players who are interested in participating in the games of the primary player; (c) there has been at least X dollar amount of bets placed by secondary players on each game of the primary player; (d) there has been a total of at least X dollar amount of bets placed by secondary players on games of the primary player during a particular period of time, number of games, particular playing session, etc.; (e) the casino has made at least X dollars of profit from secondary players having participated in the games of the primary player; (f) the casino has made at least X dollars of theoretical win or profits from secondary players having participated in the games of the primary player; and so on. It will be appreciated that a casino may require any combination of the above criteria to be met in order for a primary player to be asked to stay. There may be multiple ways of meeting the above criteria, including by partially satisfying two or more of the criteria. It will further be appreciated that there may be other criteria that a casino may use based on whose satisfaction the casino may ask a primary player to continue with a playing session.","In various embodiments, a casino may offer a primary player an opportunity to play a fair game (i.e., where the primary player's expected winnings accounting for the cost of betting are exactly 0), if the primary player will continue to play.","The Casino Plays Automatically.","In some embodiments, when a primary player terminates a playing session, the casino or house may play in place of the primary player. For example, a dealer at a blackjack table may continue to deal a hand to the position where the primary player had been. The dealer may make decisions for the hand, such as hit or stand decisions. The decisions may be made according to optimum strategy. The decisions may also be made based on inputs from the secondary player. Another representative of the casino may also stand in for the primary player. For example, the other representative may sit at the table or slot machine where the primary player had been, and may resume play.","In some embodiments, game outcomes may be generated automatically once the primary player leaves. For example, a slot machine that the primary player has left may continue to generate outcomes. The secondary player may thus continue to place bets on the outcomes.","In some embodiments, a computer algorithm may make decisions in a game. The computer algorithm may substitute in for a primary player in a game so that a secondary player may participate in the game without the presence of a human primary player. In some embodiments a computer algorithm may act as a primary player even when a secondary player had not been participating in games of a prior human primary player. In other words, a computer algorithm need not necessarily substitute in for a primary player, but may serve as a simulated or artificial primary player from the get go. A computer algorithm may make decisions in a game. The computer algorithm may make decisions of how much to bet; decisions of what types of bets to make (e.g., the computer algorithm may decide whether or not to make an insurance get in a game of blackjack); decisions of whether to check, bet, raise, call, or fold (e.g., in a game of poker); decisions about whether or not to receive additional cards (e.g., in games of blackjack or video poker); and any other decisions that may be made in a game. The computer algorithm may refer to a stored set of rules for making decisions in a game. For example, the computer algorithm may refer to a table which lists one or more possible situations which might arise in a game and which lists a corresponding decision that should be made should that situation arise. The computer algorithm may also include procedures, logic, or other computational methods for computing a decision given a game state. For example, in a game of video poker, a computer algorithm may compute expected winnings given each of several possible decisions. The computer may determine which of the decisions leads to the highest expected winnings and make that decision.","In various embodiments, a computer algorithm may be programmed to make decisions which yield the highest expected winnings, payouts, and\/or profits in a game. In various embodiments, a computer algorithm may be programmed to approximate the play of a human player. The computer algorithm may be programmed to, at least occasionally, favor strategies with emotional or intuitive appeal over those that are optimal. For example, a computer algorithm may be programmed to pursue a high paying hand in a game of video poker even when expected winnings would be optimized by pursuing a lower paying but more certain hand. In various embodiments, computer algorithms may be programmed with different personalities. Some might be programmed to take big risks in the strategies they use. Some might be programmed to play conservatively. Some computer algorithms may be programmed to bet frequently (e.g., in games of poker). Some computer algorithms may be programmed to bet infrequently, and only with very good hands (e.g., in games of poker).","An Interrupted Session of the Primary Player is Resumed when Primary Player Returns.","In some embodiments, when a primary player leaves, the session of the secondary player may be put on hold. That is, for the time being, the secondary player may not have the opportunity of placing bets and participating in games played by the primary player. However, the secondary player may have the opportunity to resume playing when the primary player returns and initiates new games.","An Alert is Given to the Secondary Player when Primary Player Returns.","In some embodiments, the secondary player may be sent an alert when the primary player has returned, or when the primary player is soon to return, or when the primary player is likely to return. The alert may take the form of a phone call, email, text message, verbal alert by a casino representative, and so on.","In some embodiments, a secondary player may indicate a primary player in whose games the secondary player may be interested in participating. The secondary player may thereby \u201ctag\u201d or \u201cbookmark\u201d the primary player as a player in whose games the secondary player may wish to participate. In various embodiments, the casino may allow the secondary player to easily determine when a bookmarked primary player is playing (e.g., is seated at a gaming device or gaming table; e.g., has inserted a player tracking card at a gaming device or gaming table; e.g., has played one or more games in the recent past). For example, a secondary player may peruse a list of bookmarked primary player. The secondary player may select one of the primary players from the list and may then be shown whether or not the primary player is currently playing, what game the primary player is playing, where the primary player is playing, or any other information of interest. In some embodiments, the casino may alert the secondary player anytime a bookmarked primary player has begun playing. In some embodiments, the casino may keep track of various statistics related to primary players that the secondary player has bookmarked. The casino may report such statistics to the secondary player when the secondary player makes contact with the casino (e.g., sits at terminal from which the secondary player may participate in games of the primary player), or at any other time. Statistics may include statistics about recent games played, recent wins, recent losses, recent large payouts, recent profits, and so on. Statistics need not necessarily be recent, but may be recent if the secondary player has previously learned of older statistics about the primary player. In various embodiments, if a secondary player is ready to begin participating in the games of a primary player, the secondary player may be offered (e.g., by default) the opportunity to participate in games of a bookmarked primary player. The secondary player may be offered the opportunity to participate in the games of a first bookmarked primary player (e.g., a primary player that is first on the secondary player's list of favorite primary players). If the secondary player declines, the secondary player may be offered the opportunity to participate in games of a second bookmarked primary player (e.g., a primary player that is second on the secondary player's list of favorite primary players), and so on. In various embodiments, secondary players may share tags or bookmarks of primary players amongst themselves. For example, a secondary player may publish a list of whom he thinks are \u201clucky\u201d primary players. Other secondary players may view the list and decide to participate in the games of the listed primary players.","An Expected Value is Paid to the Secondary Player.","In various embodiments, a secondary player may have placed a bet on results of a primary player spanning more than one game. For example, the secondary player may have bet that a primary player would be ahead monetarily after one hour of play. If, however, the primary player leaves prior to completing one hour of play, there is the potential that the secondary player's bet remains unresolved. In various embodiments, the secondary player's bet is settled for the expected value (EV) of the secondary player's winnings. For example, if, based on the current time, the current winnings of the primary player, and the odds of the game that the primary player has been playing, the expected winnings of the secondary player are $8, then the secondary player may be paid $8 when the primary player terminates his session. The bet may also be settled for various functions of the EV, such as for the EV less a processing fee, 50% of the EV, and so on.","Bets are Returned to the Secondary Player.","In some embodiments, when the primary player terminates a session, a bet made be the secondary player that was dependent on the primary player finishing the session may be returned to the secondary player.","Options to Participate in the Games of Other Primary Players are Shown to the Secondary Player.","In some embodiments, when the primary player terminates a session, the secondary player may be presented with other primary players on whom or on whose games the secondary player might bet. By selecting one or more of the new primary players, the secondary player may continue participating in games. For the purposes of a bet that required the completion of the session by the original primary player, the new primary player may be treated as if he was continuing where the original primary player left off. For example, the new primary player may be treated as if he has lost $6 during the past half hour, as the original primary player actually did. If the new primary player subsequently wins $10 in the next half hour, a bet made by the secondary player that the original primary player would be ahead after an hour of play would be a winning bet.","When a selection of new primary players is presented to the secondary player, primary players presented may be chosen by the casino based on similarities to the original primary player. For example, suppose the original primary player was from Texas. When the original primary player terminates his session, new primary players may be presented wherein each is also from Texas. Other characteristics that the original and new primary players may share include: (a) both may play the same type game (e.g., both may play IGT's Wheel of Fortune\u00ae slot machines); (b) both may be of the same gender; (c) both may be the same age; (d) both may have the same occupation; (e) both may have the same geographic location of residence or origin; (f) both may have common interests (e.g., in music, food, sports, etc.); and (g) both may share common birthdays.","The Secondary Player is Given the Opportunity to Become a Primary Player. He's Told where he can Sit Down and Start Playing.","In some embodiments, when a primary player terminates his session, the secondary player is offered the chance to become a primary player. For example, the secondary player is shown the location of the slot machine or table game where the primary player had been playing. The secondary player may be offered the opportunity to take the seat and\/or take the place of the primary player.","Historical Games of the Primary Player are Found.","In some embodiments, when the primary player terminates a session of play, the secondary player may be offered the opportunity to participate in historical games of the primary player. In various embodiments, the historical games may include games in which the secondary player has not already participated. The secondary player may thereby have the opportunity to continue benefiting from the skill, luck, or other value he associates with the primary player.","Maintenance of Player Privacy.","In various embodiments, the identity of a primary player may be shielded from the secondary player. This may prevent a secondary player from finding out sensitive financial information about the primary player, from scolding the primary player for unfavorable outcomes, or for otherwise causing harm or discomfort to the primary player.","The Secondary Player Doesn't See Who he is Betting on.","In various embodiments, facial features or any other potentially identifying features of a primary player are hidden from the secondary player. For example, in video footage of the game of the primary player, the face is blurred, covered, or completely omitted from the field of view. Voices may be edited out or masked.","The Secondary Player does not Know the Location of the Person he is Betting on.","In various embodiments, the location of the primary player is disguised or kept hidden. Otherwise, especially for a live game, it would be conceivable that the secondary player could find the primary player by simply going to the location of the primary player. Thus, in various embodiments, video footage of the game of the primary player may omit distinguishing characteristics of the primary player's location. Such characteristics may include identifiable features of a casino, such as pictures, sculptures, fountains, names of restaurants, signs for a bathroom, signs for a poker room or other casino sector, and so on. Distinguishing features of a table game may also be disguised or omitted. For example, a unique design or color of a table may be omitted. In various embodiments, games or locations with readily identifiable and\/or unique characteristics may be ineligible for participation by secondary players.","Limits to how Many Times a Secondary Player can Bet on One Particular Person.","In various embodiments, there may be a limit as to the number of games of a primary player in which a secondary player may participate. This may lessen the likelihood of the secondary player developing any strong feelings towards the primary player one way or the other. In various embodiments, there is a limit to the amount of time that the secondary player is allowed to spend participating in the games of a given primary player.","In various embodiments, a secondary player may be switched from participating in the games of a first primary player to participating in the games of a second primary player. The secondary player may be switched without the secondary player knowing that he has been switched. For example, the secondary player may receive data about a game that includes the symbols, indicia, and\/or outcomes generated during the game. However, the secondary player may not necessarily receive identifying information about a primary player of the game. Thus, when the secondary player is switched from participating in the games of a first primary player to participating in the games of a second primary player, the secondary player may not be aware of the switch since the secondary player may have no access to identifying information for either the first or second primary players. In various embodiments, the secondary player may be switched from participating in the games of a first primary player to participating in the games of a second primary player after a predetermined number of games. For example, after participating in 25 games of a first primary player, the secondary player may be switched to participating in the games of a second primary player. In various embodiments, a switch may occur at random. For example, after every game played by a first primary player, the casino may randomly generate a number between 1 and 100. If the number is greater than 80, the casino may switch the secondary player from participating in the games of the first primary player to participating in the games of a second primary player. In some embodiments, the switch may occur after a random number of games with an upper boundary. For example, if the secondary player has not been switched after 20 games with a first primary player, the secondary player may be switched automatically. In some embodiments, a secondary player may be switched upon his own request. In various embodiments, when a secondary player is switched between the games of different primary players with reasonable frequency, the chances with which a primary player's privacy becomes compromised may be reduced. In some embodiments, a secondary player may be informed when he has been switched from the games of a first primary player to the games of a second primary player. In some embodiments, the secondary player is not informed of the switch.","Introduction of a Time Delay so that the Primary Player is No Longer Located Where he Had been by the Time the Secondary Player Begins Participation in the Games of the Primary Player.","In various embodiments, a secondary player is restricted to betting on games that have occurred a predetermined amount of time in the past, e.g., one day or more in the past. In this way, the secondary player is unlikely to be able to contact the primary player, as the primary player may no longer be in the vicinity. In various embodiments, the secondary player is restricted to betting on games that have been played by a primary player who has already left the location in which the games were originally played.","A Secondary Player or Spectator is Provided with Knowledge about What the Next Cards Will be, or What the Primary Player's Opponent Holds. The Secondary Player May Watch the Primary Player Struggle with a Decision while the Secondary Player Already Knows the Correct Decision.","In various embodiments, a secondary player may be informed of some information about a game that the primary player does not know, or at least did not know at the time the primary player was participating in the game. For example, a primary player may be engaged in a game of video poker. The secondary player may watch the progress of the game from a remote terminal. The secondary player may be informed that the next four cards in the deck are all aces. However, this information is not known to the primary player. Thus, the secondary player may experience the excitement of hoping the primary player will draw four cards.","The Secondary Player Knows the Next Cards, the Symbols that Will Occur on Reels, the Proper Door to Open in a Bonus Game, Etc.","In various embodiments, a secondary player may be informed of one or more of the following at a point in a game prior to when a primary player finds out (or found out): (a) an outcome of a game (e.g., \u201ccherry-cherry-cherry\u201d); (b) a payment that the primary player will receive based on the game; (c) a game result (e.g., win, lose); (d) a reel position; (e) a symbol that will appear on a reel (e.g., the secondary player may know that the third reel of a slot machine will show a symbol \u201cbar\u201d that will complete a winning outcome of \u201cbar-bar-bar\u201d prior to when the primary player finds out); (f) a card that will be received by the primary player; (g) a card that will be received by a dealer; (h) a card that is at or near the top of the deck being used in a game of cards; (i) a hand of cards that will be achieved by a primary player should the primary player make a particular decision (e.g., a hit decision in blackjack); (j) an order of cards in a deck of cards (k) a payment, result, or outcome that would result from a particular choice in a bonus game of a gaming device (e.g., the primary player would win 200 coins by choosing door number 3 in a bonus game); (l) a card that will be received by the primary player's opponent; (m) a card held by the primary player's opponent (e.g., in a poker hand); (n) a number that will appear on a die in a game (e.g., in craps); (o) a number that will come up in the game of roulette; and so on.","The Secondary Player May Make a New Bet at Apparently Good Odds if the Primary Player is not Likely to Make a Decision that would Win for the Secondary Player.","In various embodiments, a secondary player may be allowed to place a bet on a game being played by the primary player after finding out information about the game. The bet may be made at odds apparently favorable to the primary player. For example, suppose that a primary player holds an initial hand of video poker comprising the Ks, Kc, 10h, 3c and 7d. Unbeknownst to the primary player, but known to the secondary player, the next four cards in the deck are the Ah, Kh, Qh, and Jh. Thus, were the primary player to discard the Ks, Kc, 3c, and 7d, the primary player would achieve a royal flush, the highest paying outcome, in various embodiments. The secondary player may be allowed to bet four coins on the game. The secondary player may win 1 coin for a pair, jacks or better, 2 coins for two-pair, 3 coins for three-of-a-kind, and 800 for a royal flush. Thus, the secondary player may bet 4 coins with an apparent potential to win 800 coins. Indeed, it is possible that the second player will win 800 coins. However, it would be very unlikely for the primary player to discard a pair of kings in order to draw four cards to the 10h. Thus, it is more likely the primary player will keep his pair of kings, draw three cards, and end up with three kings, providing the secondary player with a payout of 3 coins. Thus, in various embodiments, the strategy of a primary player may be predicted, e.g., by the casino server. The predicted strategy may be, e.g., an optimal strategy given lack of any knowledge about future results or outcomes (e.g., future cards in a deck). Based on predictions of the primary player's strategy, the casino server may provide betting opportunities for the secondary player such that the house will maintain an advantage given the predicted strategies. The same betting opportunities provided to the secondary player may have provided the house with a disadvantage if the primary player were to be able to utilize knowledge of future results or outcomes (e.g., future cards in a deck). Accordingly, a secondary player may make certain bets on a game in the hopes that the primary player will deviate from optimal or conventional strategy.","The Secondary Player May Provide Hints.","In various embodiments, a secondary player may have the opportunity to convey a hint to the primary player. A hint may take the form of a suggested decision. For example, a hint may indicate that the primary player should discard the first and third cards in his hand of video poker. A hint may take the form of a veto. For example, the primary player may first indicate a particular choice of strategy, such as a particular combination of cards to discard in a game of video poker. The secondary player may provide an indication that such a strategy should not be followed. The secondary player may be allowed only one veto, or may be allowed up to a predetermined number of vetoes. A hint may take the form of information about a symbol, result, or outcome of a game. For example, in the bonus round of a slot machine game, the secondary player may inform the primary player of the number of coins behind door . It may happen that there are more coins behind door , but the secondary player may only be allowed to give a hint about door , in some embodiments.","The Secondary Player May Watch the Primary Player for Entertainment Purposes. The Secondary Player May Watch Facial Expressions During Good Outcomes or During Near-Misses.","In various embodiments, the secondary player may derive entertainment or other gratification from watching the experiences of the primary player. The secondary player may, for instance, watch a primary player play a game in which the primary player will win a large payout. The secondary player can watch the expression on the face of the primary player (e.g., from video footage) and see the expression change from neutral to an expression of surprise and elation. The secondary player may choose to participate in games that are likely to have or to have had an emotional impact on the primary player. The secondary player may thus choose games in which a payment above a predetermined amount was won, in which a certain outcome (e.g., a winning outcome) was achieved, in which a jackpot was achieved, in which a bonus round was played, and so on. A secondary player may also choose a game in which the primary player comes close, or apparently comes close to achieving a large payment. For example, the secondary player may choose a game in which the primary player has four cards to a royal flush in video poker, and will draw a fifth card. The secondary player may also choose a game in which two out of three reels of a slot machine line up on jackpot symbols.","A Search is Performed to Find Games that Include Near Misses of High Paying Outcomes, or any Other Characteristic.","In various embodiments, a secondary player may receive information about various games that will happen, are in progress, or have happened already. Based on the information, the secondary player may choose a game in which to participate, or which to watch. The secondary player may have a preferred game he likes to play, a preferred primary player he likes to bet with (or on), a preferred dealer in whose game he wishes to participate, and so on. The secondary player may also wish to participate in games where he knows something about the outcome, results, or other information about the game. For example, the secondary player may wish to participate in games where the first two reels of a slot machine show the jackpot symbols.","In various embodiments, the secondary player may indicate a desired criterion, or desired criteria about the game. Various games satisfying the criterion or criteria may then be made available for the secondary player to participate in. The secondary player may then choose one or more of the games to participate in. In various embodiments, once the secondary player has indicated a criterion or criteria, the secondary player may automatically begin participating in a game matching the criterion or criteria. Criteria indicated for a game by a secondary player may include one or more of the following: (a) the game has a particular dealer; (b) the game has a particular number of players; (c) the game is played at a particular gaming device; (d) the game is played at a particular type of gaming device; (e) the game is played by a particular primary player; (f) the game is played by a primary player with a particular characteristic (e.g., age, race, marital status, nationality, area of residence, occupation, etc.); (g) the game has a potential payout above a particular level (e.g., the game has a payout of more than 1000 times the bet); (h) the game has an expected payout above a certain level (e.g., an expected payout of more than 95% of the original bet); (i) the game has a bonus round; (j) the game is played in a certain location; (k) the game is played at a certain time or date; (l) the game is, or will be a winning game (e.g., the game will pay at least three times an initial bet of the primary player); (m) the game will feature an outcome that has almost all the required symbols necessary for a large payout (e.g., a game of video poker has four cards to a royal flush); and so on.","Preventing Collaboration.","In various embodiments, measures may be taken to prevent collaboration between the primary player and the secondary player. Particularly if the secondary player knows information about the game, such as hidden cards in a deck, the secondary player would be able to confer an advantage to the primary player and to himself by communicating with the primary player. As discussed previously, the identity of the primary player may be shielded from the secondary player. Similarly, the identity of the secondary player may be shielded from the primary player. One or both of the primary and secondary players may be kept in an enclosure, such as a sound-proof room or Faraday cage, that reduces the possibility of communication. Signal detectors, such as antennas, may be placed near the primary or secondary players to detect possible communications between the two. Cell phones, pagers, Blackberries\u2122 and other communication devices may be temporarily confiscated from either or both of the primary and secondary players. The secondary player may participate in the game only after one or more, including all game decisions have been made in the game.","What Happens if a Machine Needs Servicing in the Middle of a Roll? What Happens if the Primary Player is Taking Too Long to Finish a Game?","In various embodiments, the completion of a game may be delayed or prevented. For example, a gaming device may break down in the middle of a game. A primary player may get into a discussion with a friend in the middle of a video poker game, and may thus delay a decision in the game for several minutes. A secondary player participating in a delayed game may find the delay frustrating and may wish to complete the game in some other manner.","A Game is Completed Automatically.","In various embodiments, the game may be completed automatically, e.g., by the casino. The game that is completed automatically may, in fact, be a copy of the original game, so that the primary player can complete the original game on his own. However, the secondary player may receive a payment based on the automatically completed game. The game may be completed using a predetermined strategy, such as optimal strategy. The game may be completed using a random strategy where, for example, one of several possible strategies is selected at random.","The Secondary Player Makes the Decisions in a Game.","In some embodiments, the secondary player may have the opportunity to complete the game by making his own decisions. For example, if the game is blackjack, the secondary player may indicate decisions such as \u201chit\u201d or \u201cstand\u201d so as to complete the game. The secondary player may, in various embodiments, complete a copy of the original game, so that the primary player may complete the original game on his own. A copy of the original game may include a second game with one or more similar parameters or aspects to the first game. For example, in the copied version of the game, one or more of the player hand, the dealer's hand, the order of cards in a deck, the prizes available behind certain doors in a bonus game, etc., may be the same as in the original game.","A Bet is Returned to the Secondary Player.","In various embodiments, when a game is delayed, the bet placed by the secondary player on the game may be returned to the secondary player.","The Secondary Player is Provided with an Expected Value of his Winnings at that Point in the Game.","In various embodiments, when a game is delayed, the expected payment or the expected winnings to be paid the secondary player may be provided to the secondary player. In some embodiments, a function of the expected payment is provided, such as the expected payment less a fee.","Communication Between the Secondary Player and the Primary Player.","In some embodiments, the primary player and the secondary player may be given the opportunity to communicate. Communication may occur via text, voice, or any other means. Communication may occur through the casino server. Communication may be monitored by the casino, such as by a computer program or a casino representative. Communication may be edited or prevented if there is inappropriate or threatening language and\/or if communication somehow provides either the primary player or secondary player with an unfair advantage.","The Secondary Player Sends Help to the Primary Player. For Example, \u201cYou Should Hit Here\u201d.","In some embodiments, the secondary player may send help to the primary player. The secondary player may help the primary player with strategy in a game such as blackjack, video poker, or live poker. In video poker, the secondary player may suggest which cards the primary player should discard. In blackjack, the secondary player may suggest whether to hit, stand, double down, split, etc. In a live game of poker, the secondary player may advise the primary player whether to check, bet, raise, fold, or call. The secondary player may also suggest an amount of a bet or raise. The secondary player may provide other suggestions or opinions, such as suggesting that another player is probably bluffing. The secondary player may provide additional information, such as the probabilities of various events occurring given a particular strategy. For example, the secondary player may indicate that the primary player would have roughly 2 to 1 odds against making a flush should he continue in a game of poker.","The Secondary Player Takes Over the Game.","In various embodiments, a secondary player may take the place of a primary player in making decisions in a game. For example, the secondary player may transmit signals that cause game decisions to be made without additional input by the primary player. For example, the primary player may press a button on a gaming device labeled \u201cdefer to secondary player\u201d. The secondary player may then select, e.g., cards to discard from a remote terminal. The remote terminal may, in turn, transmit to the gaming device indications of which cards the secondary player has chosen to discard. The chosen cards may then be removed from the primary player's hand and replaced with new cards. The primary player may win or lose, and may receive payments based on the decisions made by the secondary player.","Sending a Tip to the Primary Player.","In various embodiments, the secondary player may send a tip, other consideration, or other token of gratitude to the primary player. For example, if the primary player has just won a large payment, thereby causing the secondary player also to win a large payment, the secondary player may be grateful and wish to tip the primary player. The secondary player may provide an indication that he wishes to tip the primary player, e.g., by pressing a button on a remote terminal. The casino server may then deduct the amount of the tip from an account associated with the secondary player, and add such amount to an account associated with the primary player. The casino server may also cause the amount of the tip to be paid out at the primary player's gaming device or table, e.g., in the form of a coin or cashless gaming receipt. In some embodiments, the primary player may pay to have something delivered to the primary player. For example, the secondary player may pay for a bottle of wine. A casino representative, such as a waitress, may then deliver the bottle of wine to the primary player at the location of the primary player.","Betting Interfaces.","A secondary player may participate in the game of a primary player using various interfaces. The interfaces may allow the secondary player to select a game in which to participate, including selecting various aspects of a game, such as the machine on which the game is played, the primary player playing the game, the time, and so on. The interface may allow the secondary player to select a bet type. For example, the secondary player can bet for a primary player to win, or for a primary player to lose. The interface may allow the secondary player to select a bet amount. The interface may allow the secondary player to insert cash or other consideration, to identify himself (e.g., for the purposes of receiving comp points), and to cash out winnings or remaining balances.","Internet.","A secondary player may participate using a network, such as the internet or a casino intranet. The secondary player may employ a computer, such as a personal computer, for this purpose. The secondary player may view a selection of games to participate in, progress of a current game, credit balances, etc., using a computer monitor. The secondary player may input decisions using a mouse, computer keyboard, or any other computer input device. For example, the secondary player may key in a bet amount using a numeric keypad on a computer keyboard. The secondary player may also use a device such as a phone, a cell phone, personal digital assistant, or Blackberry\u2122. The contents of the following United States patent applications, listed with serial numbers, titles, and matter numbers in parenthesis, are incorporated by reference herein for all purposes: (a) Ser.

The device used by the secondary player for participating in games may communicate with a casino server via the network, as is commonly known in the art. Messages may be exchanged back and forth between a device used by the secondary player and the casino, the messages taking the form of streams of bits represented by electronic pulses, optical pulses, or any other practical representation.","Felt Table with Live Dealer.","In various embodiments a secondary player may participate in a game by sitting at a table and interacting with a casino representative. The table at which the secondary player sits may be different from the table the primary player sits at. Thus the game activities of the primary player may occur elsewhere from the location of the secondary player. However, the secondary player may store cash or chips at his table, and may indicate bets by placing chips at certain parts of the table. From this table, the secondary player may watch the action in the game of the primary player, e.g., using closed circuit television. Based on the outcome of the game played by the primary player, the secondary player may receive payments at his table. Thus, for example, the casino representative at the table of the secondary player may collect bets from the secondary player, and may pay winnings to the secondary player if the outcome of the game of the primary player is winning for the primary player. The table of the secondary player may appear similar to that of the primary player. For example, the table may have the same shape and surface markings. The secondary player may even sit at the same position with respect to his table as the primary player sits with respect to the primary player's table. The secondary player may enjoy a similar experience to that of the primary player, only, perhaps, without the cards, dice, or other game apparatus used at the table of the primary player. In various embodiments, the table of the secondary player may serve as a means for the secondary player to make bets, receive winnings, and possibly to view the game of the primary player.","In some embodiments, the secondary player uses the same table or gaming device as does the primary player. For example, the secondary player may place a bet beside the hand of the primary player. The secondary player may then receive payments based on the outcome of the game of the primary player.","Machine at the Casino.","In some embodiments, a secondary player may participate in a game using a machine or terminal configured to allow participation in a separate game. The terminal may include a coin slot, bill validator, credit card reader, and\/or other means for accepting consideration. The terminal may include buttons, keys, roller balls, and\/or other input devices that may be used by the secondary player for selecting a game in which to participate, for selecting bet amounts, for selecting bet types, and so on. The terminal may be in communication with the device that conducts the actual game. For example, the terminal of the secondary player may be in communication with a gaming device at which the primary player is playing. The terminal may thus receive from the device of the primary player an indication of games played by the primary player, amounts bet, outcomes received, and other pertinent information. The terminal of the secondary player may be in direct communication with the device of the primary player, or may be in communication with the casino server which, in turn, communicates with the device of the primary player. The terminal of the secondary player may also be in communication with sensors, detectors, and\/or other monitoring devices at a game played by the primary player, such as at a blackjack game. For example, the terminal of the secondary player may receive feeds from cameras located at a blackjack game being played by the primary player. In various embodiments, a dealer or other casino representative may report information about a game of the primary player. For example, a dealer may input into keypad connected to the casino server that a primary player has been dealt an ace and a ten in a game of blackjack. Such information may subsequently be received at the terminal of the secondary player, and may be used in determining a payment for the secondary player. The terminal of the secondary player may be a mobile device, e.g., a mobile device as set forth in Nevada bill AB471.","In some embodiments, the terminal of the secondary player may be constructed or configured to look like a gaming device. Betting interfaces at the terminal may be designed to mimic or appear similar to those at the gaming device. Graphics shown on the housing or the screen may also be similar. However, the terminal may simply recreate and redisplay games and outcomes generated by the gaming device. The terminal may not, in various embodiments, generate games or outcomes of its own, e.g., using its own processor or locally stored algorithms. In various embodiments, the terminal may comprise a kiosk.","Casino Desk.","In various embodiments, a secondary player may visit a casino desk, casino cage, or other casino venue where bets may be placed in person. The secondary player may there select a game in which to participate. The secondary player may place a bet. The secondary player may receive some record of his bet. The record may be a paper receipt, for example. The record may include the name of the secondary player, the name of the primary player, the type of game, the time of the game, the machine or location at which the game was played, the amount of the bet, the terms of the bet (e.g., what outcomes constitute winning outcomes), and any other pertinent information. Upon resolution of the game, the secondary player may return to the desk and receive payment of any winnings.","How Bets are Entered.","In various embodiments bet amounts and bet selections may be entered using buttons, keyboards, microphones, computer mice, joysticks, or any other input devices. A secondary player may also place bets and indicate bet amounts according to rules. Rules may include instructions that may be followed by a computer algorithm, the instructions indicating rules or conditions specifying when and how much to bet. By betting according to rules, the secondary player may save himself the effort of repeatedly indicating a desire to place a bet. Rules may include the following: (a) continue betting $1 on each new game until the secondary player provides an indication to stop; (b) continue betting $1 on each new game for the next 20 games; (c) bet $1 on the game following every win, and double the prior bet following every loss; (d) continue betting until a credit balance reaches either 0 or $100; and so on. In some embodiments, rules may be entered explicitly by the secondary player. In some embodiments, different sets of rules may be predefined. A secondary player need then only select one of the predefined sets of rules to have betting done automatically on his behalf according to the selected set of rules. In some embodiments, a set of rules indicates that the prior bet should be repeated. A secondary player may simply need to confirm each new bet before it is made. For example, for a first game, a secondary player may bet 5 coins on each of 7 pay lines of a slot machine game. For a second game, the secondary player may simply press a \u201crepeat prior bet\u201d button in order to once again bet 5 coins on each of 7 pay lines. Without pressing such a button, the process of entering the bet again might be time consuming. Further, the primary player may have continued on with the next game before the secondary player had time to enter the bet a second time. In various embodiments, a secondary player may specify a bet with reference to a prior bet. For example, the secondary player may indicate a desire to bet twice his prior bet, or to make the same bet he made two games ago.","Layout of the Betting Screen and the Graphical User Interface.","In various embodiments a secondary player may choose a bet type; choose a bet amount; follow the progress of a game; follow the progress of a primary player; view statistics related to a gaming device, table, dealer, primary player, casino, etc.; all using a betting interface on a display screen. The display screen may also function as a touch screen so that the secondary player may interact with the screen by touching it in certain locations. A first location of the screen may include a selection area. Shown in the selection area may be any number of attributes pertaining to a game. For example, a selection area may list a number of primary players. The secondary player may select one of the primary players to indicate that the secondary player would like to participate in the game of the selected primary player. The selection area may present a selection of: (a) primary players; (b) gaming devices; (c) times; (d) dates; (e) casinos; (f) game types (e.g., video poker, slot, etc); (g) dealers; (h) opponents; (i) game results (e.g., ranges of payouts provided by the game, such as games which paid 0-2 coins, games which paid 3-4 coins, games which paid 5-6 coins, etc); and so on. Possible selections may be presented as a menu, a list, a scroll bar, or any other presentation. The secondary player may go through various layers of selection until he has completely specified a game in which to participate. For example, the secondary player may first select a primary player, then a gaming device, then a time of a game. Each set of choices may be presented as a new menu.","A second location of the screen may include a betting area. In the betting area, the secondary player may indicate an amount to bet on a game. The secondary player may specify a number of outcomes to bet on, such as a number of pay lines to bet on, or a number of hands of video poker on which to bet. The secondary player may also specify an amount to bet on each pay line or each outcome. If different types of bets may be made (e.g., a main bet and an insurance bet in blackjack, or pass line and hard eight in craps), then the secondary player may specify which of such bets he wishes to make. A secondary player may specify bets to be made on the primary player. For example, the secondary player may specify a bet that the primary player will lose or will win, or may specify a bet that the primary player will win more than a certain amount.","A third location of the screen may include an area where information about a game is displayed. The area may allow the secondary player to follow the progress of the game. In this area, the secondary may watch as new symbols (e.g., cards in a card game or symbols on slot reels) arise, as new bets are made by the primary player and\/or his opponent(s), as decisions are made by the primary player, as decisions are made by the dealer, as hidden symbols are revealed (e.g., as a dealer's down card is turned face up in the game of blackjack), as bets are collected (e.g., from the primary player), and as winnings are paid out (e.g., to the primary player). The third location of the screen may include live video, animations depicting a reenactment of the game, pre-recorded video of the game, pre-recorded video depicting a game similar to the game in which the secondary player is participating, or any other video depiction. The third location may include text descriptions of events in the game. For example, a text description may read, \u201cJoe Smith has just been dealt a pair of kings.\u201d","A fourth location of the screen may allow a secondary player to view statistics related to a gaming device, table, dealer, primary player, casino, etc. For example, the fourth location may show the number of times a primary player has won or lost in his last 100 games, a graph depicting the bankroll of the primary player over the last two hours, the number of times a particular gaming device has paid more than 20 coins in the last day, and so on. Statistics may be presented in any conceivable form, such as using tables, graphs, bar graphs, line graphs, pie charts, and so on.","A fifth location of the screen may allow a secondary player to communicate with the primary player, with a casino representative, with other secondary players, or with others. The fifth location may comprise a chat area, for example, where text conversations are tracked, and where different statements are labeled with the name of the originator of the statement.","A sixth location of the screen may allow the secondary player to follow his own progress. For example, the secondary player may see his account balance and statistics about his own wins or losses.","A seventh location of the screen may allow the secondary player to cash out a portion of his winnings and\/or account balances.","An eighth location of the screen may allow the secondary player to summon a casino representative, e.g., to order food.","As will be appreciated, the locations described above may be overlapping. All locations need not have the same function at once, but may alternate. For example, at a first point in time, the screen may be occupied completely with video footage of a game. When the game finishes, the video footage may be replaced with statistics about the player. It will be further appreciated that there may be additional locations on the screen.","In order to participate in the games of a primary player, a secondary player may provide identifying information about himself. Identifying information may include a name, age, state of residence, nationality, driver's license number, social security number, and\/or any other identifying information. The casino may use such identifying information in order to verify that the secondary player is authorized to place bets and\/or to participate in games as a secondary player. For example, the casino may use identifying information to verify that a secondary player is over 21 years of age. The casino may only permit the secondary player to participate in games of the primary player if the secondary player is over 21 years of age.","In various embodiments, a secondary player may be identified automatically by the casino. For example, the secondary player may seek to participate in a game while situated at a remote terminal or device. The remote terminal or device may be configured to check the identity of the secondary player prior to communicating with the casino. The terminal or device may only communicate with the casino, in some embodiments, if the secondary player is a particular player. Thus, the casino may automatically identify a secondary player by virtue of the terminal or device at which the secondary player is situated. If a terminal or device is configured only to communicate with the casino when a particular secondary player has identified himself to the terminal or device, then the casino can be assured that a particular secondary player is desirous of participating in games. The particular secondary player may be, for example, a particular secondary player that is authorized to participate in games. In some embodiments, a remote device or terminal may constitute a mobile device (e.g., a mobile device as set forth in Nevada bill AB471). The mobile device may be programmed to be used only by a particular secondary player. Therefore, if the secondary player is authorized to make bets, and the mobile device is configured to communicate with the casino only when the particular secondary player is using it, then the casino may assume that it is an authorized secondary player that is placing bets through the mobile device.","The Secondary Player Bets on Outcomes on which the Primary Player Did not.","In various embodiments, a secondary player may place bets on results or outcomes that were not bet on by the primary player. As will be appreciated, for a given game, there can be many possible outcomes, and many types of bets placed on the various outcomes. For example, in craps, many different bets can be placed in the same game, among them pass and don't pass.","The Secondary Player Bets on a Pay-Line that the Primary Player Did not.","In various embodiments, the secondary player may bet on a pay-line of a slot machine that was not bet on by the primary player. For example, a slot machine may include three pay-lines, e.g., lines , , and . The primary player may bet on pay-line . The secondary player may bet on pay-line  and\/or pay-line . The secondary player may, in various embodiments, bet on pay-line  as well. In some embodiments, the secondary player is only allowed to bet on pay-lines that the primary player has not already bet on. Such embodiments may help prevent a secondary player from determining a game in which the primary player has achieved a winning pay-line, and then betting on the same pay-line. In some embodiments, a secondary player may bet on pay-lines that were not available to the primary player when he played. For example, the secondary player may bet on a custom pay-line consisting of the top two symbols on a first reel, and the bottom symbol on a second reel of a slot machine. In some embodiments, the secondary player may bet on a pay-line that was not even visible to the primary player during his play of the game. For example, a slot machine may only show one symbol on each reel in a viewing window. The symbol on each reel that is one position above the viewing window may not be visible. Nevertheless, the secondary player may have the opportunity to bet on a pay-line comprising the row of symbols one position above the viewing window. Similarly, the secondary player may bet on a pay-line comprising the row of symbols one position below the viewing window. In various embodiments, any other pay-line or outcome may be constructed using visible and non-visible symbols. For example, a pay-line may be constructed using some symbols that were visible, and some symbols that were not visible to the primary player.","In various embodiments, the secondary player may place bets on symbols that were never even shown to the primary player. Such symbols may have occurred, for example, well above the viewing window. In some embodiments, such symbols may be shown to the secondary player.","Play a Card Game with Unused Cards. For Example, in Video Poker, Only the Top 10 Cards May be Used During a Game. The Secondary Player could Play Another Game Using Cards from the Bottom of the Deck.","In various embodiments, a secondary player may play a game using cards, symbols, or other indicia that were not revealed to the primary player. For example, a primary player may participate in a game of video poker. The primary player may use the top nine cards from a shuffled deck during the game (e.g., the primary player receives an initial deal of five cards, and subsequently draws four additional cards). However, in a standard 52-card deck, 43 cards would remain in the deck. The secondary player may play a new game using the 43 remaining cards. The secondary player may thus engage in a game for which no person yet knows the outcome. This may help to avoid situations where a secondary player can choose to participate in a game where he knows the outcome will be favorable to him. In various embodiments, a secondary player may participate in a new game using cards remaining after a game of blackjack, after a game of poker, after a game of casino war, or after any other game. In various embodiments, the secondary player may make his own decisions in the game, e.g., rather than relying upon decisions of the primary player. In various embodiments, a secondary player may use cards remaining in a deck for a game other than the game for which the deck was first used. For example, after a deck is used for a video poker game of the primary player, the secondary player may use the remaining cards in the deck for a game of blackjack.","The Secondary Player Bets on Some Function of the Data from a Game.","In some embodiments, a secondary player may bet on some function or transformation of the outcomes, results, or other data used in a game played by a primary player. As used herein, the term \u201cfunction\u201d may refer to a process or procedure for relating any acceptable input to an output, such that there is only one output per unique input. The output and input may be numerical or non-numerical. As used herein, a \u201cfunction of\u201d an input may refer to the resultant output when the function is used to relate the input to the output. As used herein, the term \u201ctransformation\u201d may refer to a process or procedure for relating any acceptable input to an output.","An Outcome is Generated Using a Function of a Random Number Used in Generating an Outcome in the Primary Game. Suppose a Random Number 10232 was Used to Generate an Outcome in a Game of a Primary Player. The Random Number+1 could be Used, Such that the Number 10233 is Used. This could Yield a Completely Different Outcome.","Various games played at a casino utilize random number generators. For example, a slot machine may utilize a random number generator to choose a random number for each reel of the slot machine. Each random number is then used to determine the symbol that should be revealed by the corresponding reel. In various embodiments, a game played by a secondary player may use a new set of random numbers generated based on some function of the random numbers used in a game played by the primary player. For example, the random numbers used in the game played by the secondary player may consist of the random numbers used in the game played by the primary player with one added to each. Thus, {10245, 31189, 19320} may be transformed to {10246, 31190, 19321}. The new set of random numbers may be used as inputs to an algorithm (e.g., the same algorithm used in the game played by the primary player), to generate the symbols or outcomes of the game played by the secondary player. As will be appreciated, any function of the random numbers in the primary player's game may be used to come up with random numbers in the secondary player's game. For example, one may be subtracted from each random number, the order of the random numbers may be changed (e.g., so each random number now corresponds to different one of the reels), each random number may be multiplied by a factor, and so on.","In various embodiments, seed numbers may be used in the generation of random numbers. Thus, in some embodiments, a seed number used in a game played by a primary player may be transformed according to some function (e.g., one may be added) in order to generate a seed to be used in the game played by the secondary player.","In various embodiments, a game played by a primary player may result in a first outcome with a first associated payout. The game may be disguised by changing the first outcome to a second outcome with the same payout. Thus, the primary player may view the first outcome while he plays the game, but the secondary player may view the second outcome when he participates in the game. Monetarily, the primary player and the secondary player may have had the same experiences. In other words, given identical bets, both the primary player and the secondary player will have had the same payouts, in various embodiments. However, the primary player and the secondary player will have seen different representations of the game. For example, suppose a slot machine game includes several possible outcomes. Among the possible outcomes are \u201cbar-bar-bar\u201d with an associated payout of 10 coins, and \u201ccherry-cherry-cherry\u201d, also with an associated payout of 10 coins. The primary player may play the game and achieve the outcome \u201cbar-bar-bar\u201d. The secondary player may also participate in the game. When the game is presented to the secondary player, the secondary player may be shown an outcome of \u201ccherry-cherry-cherry\u201d.","Thus, in various embodiments, a first outcome of a game may be generated for a primary player. The casino may determine what other outcomes have the same payout as the first outcome. From among the other outcomes, the casino may select one to present to a secondary player who has participated in the game.","In various embodiments the outcome presented to a secondary player may differ both in terms of the constituent symbols and in terms of the payout from the outcome that was seen by the primary player. However, over the course of two or more games, a secondary player may be presented with outcomes whose associated payouts sum to the same total as do the payouts associated with the outcomes presented to the primary player over the course of the same two or more games. For example, both a primary player and a secondary player may participate in the same two games. In the first game, the primary player may be presented with outcome A and receive an associated payout of 4 coins. For the first game, the secondary player may be presented with outcome C and receive an associated payout of 3 coins. In the second game, the primary player may be presented with outcome B and receive an associated payout of 6 coins. For the second game, the secondary player may be presented with outcome D and receive an associated payout of 7 coins. Thus, neither the primary and secondary players have been presented with different outcomes over the course of the two games. However, after two games, both have received the same total payouts, each having received 10 coins in total.","In various embodiments, a secondary player may view what is essentially the same game that the primary player is playing. However, the game may be disguised by replacing symbols from the presentation to the primary player with new symbols for presentation to the secondary player. For example, a \u201ccherry\u201d when viewed by the primary player becomes a \u201cdog\u201d when viewed by the secondary player. In terms of underlying logic, however, the games may remain the same. For example, \u201ccherry\u201d may always map to \u201cdog\u201d, and likewise there may be a consistent function which maps the symbols shown to the primary player to the symbols shown to the secondary player. The pay tables on display for the primary and secondary players may exhibit a similar functional relationship. For example, suppose the primary player's pay table includes a line showing a payout of 15 for \u201ccherry-cherry-cherry\u201d. A corresponding line on the pay table for the secondary player may include a line showing a payout of 15 for \u201cdog-dog-dog\u201d. In various embodiments, other graphics may be altered. For example, a background coloration of the game viewed by the primary player may be blue, whereas the background coloration of the same game viewed by the secondary player may be green.","In various embodiments, a second game presented to the secondary player may be a different type of game from that presented to the primary player. However, an outcome may be chosen for presentation to the secondary player that has the same payout as an outcome that occurred in a game played by the primary player. For example, a primary player may be involved in a game of Casino War. The secondary player may view the outcomes of the games of the primary player, but disguised as the game of craps. For example, if the primary player wins a game of Casino War (e.g., by being dealt a card with a higher rank than the card dealt to the dealer), then the secondary player may be shown an animated sequence of dice rolling a seven during the first roll of the game (i.e., a winning outcome in craps). If, however, the primary player loses the game of Casino War, then the secondary player may be shown an animated sequence of dice rolling a two on the first roll of the game (i.e., a losing outcome in craps).","The various methods of disguising a game described herein may provide an advantage, in certain embodiments, of making it difficult for the secondary player to determine details about the original game in which he is participating. For example, this may make it difficult for the secondary player to vary his bets based on advanced knowledge about the outcome of the original game.","The Same Random Number May be Used, but a Different Reel Configuration.","In various embodiments, a gaming device may store an internal table or function which maps random numbers to symbols or outcomes. For example, the random number 1293 may map to the symbol of \u201ccherry\u201d on reel 1 of a slot machine. In various embodiments, a game played by a secondary player may utilize the same random numbers used in a game played by a primary player. However, the game of the secondary player may include a different table or matching function between random numbers and symbols. Thus, for example, in the game played by the secondary player, the number 1293 may map to the symbol \u201cbell\u201d instead of \u201ccherry\u201d. Accordingly, using the same random numbers, the game of the secondary player may arrive at different symbols or outcomes than those that occurred in the game of the primary player.","In various embodiments, a gaming device may store an internal table or function which maps random numbers to reel positions. For example, the random number 2451 may instruct a gaming device to stop reel  with position  visible in the viewing window of the gaming device. Each position on a reel may feature a symbol. For example, a reel may have ten positions, each position corresponding roughly to 36 degrees of arc of the circular reel. Thus, by instructing a gaming device to stop a reel at a certain position, a random number will also instruct the reel to display the symbol featured at the certain position. In various embodiments, the game played by the secondary player may utilize the same random numbers utilized by the game played by the primary player. However, the positions and\/or ordering of one or more symbols may be changed. Thus, the same reel position in the game of the secondary player may corresponding to a different symbol than it did in the game of the primary player. Thus, using the same set of random numbers, the game of the secondary player may nevertheless result in different symbols or outcomes than does the game of the primary player.","What if all Cherries were Transformed into Bars? A Secondary Player May Bet on Real Outcomes, but with One Aspect Altered into Another.","In some embodiments, one or more symbols obtained in a game played by a primary player may be mapped to other symbols in a game played by a secondary player. For example, any \u201ccherry\u201d symbol in a game of a primary player may be transformed into a \u201cbar\u201d symbol in a game of a secondary player. Thus, if the primary player receives the outcome of \u201ccherry-bell-cherry\u201d, the secondary player will receive the outcome of \u201cbar-bell-bar\u201d. The pay table, between the two games, may remain the same. In embodiments where the pay table remains the same, it is possible for a winning outcome to be mapped to a losing outcome, and for a losing outcome to be mapped to a winning outcome. In some embodiments, a first card in one game is transformed into a second card in another game. For example, the two of hearts becomes the king of diamonds. In some embodiments, an entire outcome in a game of the primary player may be mapped to a different outcome in a game of the secondary player. For example, the outcome of \u201cbell-lemon-plum\u201d may map to \u201ccherry-cherry-cherry\u201d. In various embodiments, when one symbol in a game played by a primary player is mapped to another symbol in a game presented to a secondary player, the same mapping may also occur in the pay table. For example, suppose the symbol \u201clemon\u201d in a game played by the primary player is mapped to the symbol \u201ctree\u201d in a game presented to the secondary player. If there is a line in the pay table of the primary player indicating a payout of 100 associated with the outcome \u201clemon-lemon-lemon\u201d, then there may be a corresponding line in the pay table of the secondary player indicating a payout of 100 associated with the outcome \u201ctree-tree-tree\u201d.","A Secondary Player May Bet on Original Deals of Cards, but with 7s Now Wild.","In some embodiments, symbols in a game played by the primary player can take new meaning in the game of the secondary player. For example, in a game of cards, any seven dealt in the game of the primary player may count as a wild card in the game of the secondary player. Thus, for example, the primary player may receive a final poker hand of Qs Qh Jd 3h 7s. The primary player may then be paid based on having a hand with a pair, jacks or better. The secondary player may be paid based on having a hand with three of a kind, since the 7s, as a wild card, may count as a queen.","A Secondary Player May Bet on a Blackjack Hand Occurring with Poker, or Vice versa.","In various embodiments, the secondary player may use the same symbols or outcomes obtained by the primary player, but to play a different game. For example, the primary player may be engaged in a game of blackjack. The secondary player may use the cards received by the primary player to form a poker hand. Thus, if the primary player receives the 2s 7s 3s As and 6s, yielding 19 points in the game of blackjack, the secondary player may receive a flush (all spades) in a game of poker.","A Secondary Player May Bet on Shifted Data. For Instance, an Outcome Consists of the Last Two Reels from One Slot Pull, and then the First Reel of the Next Slot Pull. Or a Hand of Poker Consists of the Last Three Cards from One Hand and the First Two Cards from the Next Hand.","In various embodiments, data, symbols, or outcomes from two or more games of a primary player may be combined to create a single game for the primary player. For example, three cards used in a first game of the primary player, and two cards used in a second game of the primary player may be combined to form a single hand of cards for a single game of the secondary player. Data used in consecutive games of the primary player may be treated as a stream of data frames, each frame including all the data from one game. For example, each frame may include the three symbols appearing on the pay-line of a slot machine. A new stream of data frames may be created by shifting the frame limits over (e.g., left or right) by some number of data points, e.g., by some number of symbols. Thus, for example, each frame in the new stream of data frames may include symbols from reels two and three followed by a symbol from reel one. In other words, new games have been created by using the last two symbols in a first game of the primary player and the first symbol in a second game of the primary player. Thus, by shifting data frames used in a sequence of games of a primary player, a new sequence of games may be generated for a secondary player.","A Secondary Player May Bet on the Same Outcome, but with a Different Pay Structure. For Example, a Secondary Player May Lose on a Royal Flush.","In some embodiments, a secondary player may receive the same outcomes as does a primary player. However, the pay table that applies to the secondary player may differ from that which applies to the primary player. For example, in a game of video poker, the primary player may win 5 coins with a flush, but the secondary player may only win 2 coins.","A Secondary Player May Bet on an Aggregate Outcome of a Primary Player. For Example, a Secondary Player May Bet that a Primary Player Will be Ahead or Behind after an hour.","In some embodiments, a secondary player may place a bet that depends on multiple games or outcomes of a primary player. For example, the secondary player may bet that the primary player will win the next three games in a row, or that the primary player will win the next game but lose the following game. The secondary player may bet that the winnings or losses of the primary player will satisfy one or more conditions after a designated period of time. The secondary player may bet that the winnings of the primary player will total more than a given amount in the next hour. The secondary player may bet that the losses of the primary player will exceed more than $1000 in the next 6 hours. The secondary player may bet that primary player will either lose more than $100 or will win more than $200 in the next 15 minutes. Winnings and losses may be net of each other (e.g., a $20 win and $10 loss may net to a $10 win) or may count separately (e.g., a winnings total is the sum of all amounts won regardless of bets lost). The secondary player may bet on any statistic pertaining to outcomes received by the primary player. For example, the secondary player may bet that the primary player will receive more than 10 payouts of more than 20 coins each in the next 25 minutes. The secondary player may bet that the primary player will achieve 4 full-houses in the next 50 games. In various embodiments, the secondary player may track the net winnings or net losses of the primary player. Thus, for example, if the primary player has lost $200 after an hour, the secondary player will also have lost $200. If the primary player has won $734, the secondary player will also have won $734.","A Secondary Player May Take the Upside of a Primary Player, but not his Downside.","In some embodiments, the secondary player may make a payment or place a bet that entitles the secondary player to an amount equal to the primary player's winnings, if any, over a period of time, but does not obligate the secondary player for anything if the primary player has net losses. For example, if the primary player achieves winnings over the next hour of $50, the secondary player may also receive $50. However, if the primary player loses in the next hour, the secondary player does not owe anything beyond his initial bet or payment. In various embodiments, the secondary player may receive, or owe monies based on more complicated functions of the primary player's winnings and losses. For example, the secondary player may receive three times the primary player's winnings (if there are any) for the next hour, but may owe 1.5 times the primary player's losses if the there are losses.","In some embodiments, a secondary player may bet that a primary player will receive five payouts of over 20 coins.","A Secondary Player May Bet the Difference Between What a Primary Player Bet and What the Primary Player could have Bet. A Secondary Player May Complete a Partial Bet and Thereby Win Only the Extra Payouts that Resulted from the Extra Amount Bet.","In some embodiments, a secondary player may place a bet that a primary player could have made but did not. This includes completing a bet that the primary player made. The secondary player may, in this fashion, win any payments that a primary player would have won, beyond those the primary player actually did win, had the primary player made the bet.","For Example, Many Machines Require Three Coins Bet to Win the Jackpot. If a Primary Player Bets Only Two Coins, then a Secondary Player May Bet the 3and then Win the Difference of What Someone would Win with Three Coins Versus Two Coins Bet.","Various gaming devices include pay tables that are based on the number of coins bet. For example, if a player bets one coin and receives the outcome \u201cbell-bell-bell\u201d, then the player wins 100 coins. If, however, the player bets two coins and receives the same outcome, then the player wins 200 coins. Many gaming devices provide better payout odds for each incremental coin bet. Thus, in the prior example, if the player bets three coins and receives the outcome \u201cbell-bell-bell\u201d, then the player wins 400 coins. Thus, the incremental payout odds for the third coin bet are better than those for the second coin bet, at least with respect to \u201cbell-bell-bell\u201d. Accordingly, for example, if a primary player bets only two coins in a game, a secondary player may take advantage of the better incremental payout odds offered for the third coin bet by betting the third coin himself. If the outcome of \u201cbell-bell-bell\u201d occurs, the secondary player may thus receive the difference between the payout for three coins bet and the payout for two coins bet, i.e., the difference between 400 coins and 200 coins, equal to 200 coins.","In various embodiments, a secondary player may add to or complete a bet on a game made by a primary player so that the total bet of both the primary and secondary player would result in a higher set of payouts. The secondary player may receive any extra payouts associated with his bet. Thus, if the payout associated with the primary player's bet alone is X, and the payout associated with the primary player's bet plus the secondary player's bet is Y, then the primary player may receive X, and the secondary player may receive Y-X.","In Craps, Placing Bets Behind the Bets of Other People.","In various embodiments, a primary player in a game of craps is given additional opportunities to bet during the course of a game. For example, when the primary player establishes a point for a pass line bet, he has the opportunity to place bets behind his pass line bet, called \u201codds bets\u201d. The odds bets often have no house edge, and therefore are typically more advantageous to a player than almost any other bet in a casino. However, a player at a craps table often does not make an odds bet, or does not make the full amount of an odds bet that he is allowed. In various embodiments, a secondary player is allowed to make an odds bet that a primary player could have made. The secondary player may then be paid for the odds bet if the odds bet wins. Accordingly, the secondary player may enjoy the opportunity to make a bet at true odds, without the requirement of first making a disadvantageous pass line bet.","In various embodiments, a secondary player may make odds bets or may make partial bets such as betting the third coin at a slot machine, even if the primary player has already made such bets. The secondary player may nevertheless receive the incremental payouts associated with such bets. For example, the secondary player may bet a single coin which counts as the third coin bet at a slot machine. The secondary player may thus be eligible to win the difference in payouts between the payout for three coins bet and the payout for two coins bet.","Primary Players Might See Who or how Many People are Betting on them.","In various embodiments, a primary player may be made aware of a secondary player who is participating in the game of the primary player, or who subsequently participates in the game of the primary player. The primary player may receive a name, an image, and description of various attributes (e.g., age, occupation, area of residence, etc.) of the secondary player. The primary player may also receive an indication of the performance of the secondary player while participating in the games of the primary player. For example, the primary player may see how much the secondary has won or lost, what types of bets he has made, how many games he has participated in, for how long he has been participating in the games of the primary player, and so on. The primary player may derive a measure of satisfaction or gratification from the participation of secondary players. For example, a primary player may feel proud that a large number of secondary players have participated in his games. He may feel proud to have won money for them. In various embodiments, the primary player may have the opportunity to communicate with a secondary player. For example, the casino server may provide the primary player with contact information for a secondary player.","In various embodiments, a primary player may be compensated based on participation by secondary players in the games of the primary players. The primary player may be compensated per secondary player and per game. For example, the primary player may receive 0.5 cents per secondary player per game. Thus, if three secondary players each participate in two games of the primary player, the primary player may receive 0.5 cents\u00d73 secondary players\u00d72 games=3 cents. Thus, the primary player benefits by having more secondary players and by increasing the number of games in which each secondary player participates. The primary player may be compensated with a percentage of the bets made by secondary players participating in his games. The primary player may be compensated with some percentage of expected winnings to be derived from the bets of secondary players participating in the games of the primary player.","A primary player may thus be encouraged to convey some value to secondary player so as to attract secondary players to participating in his games. The primary player may convey value by employing good strategy, for example. The primary player may also attempt to provide entertainment, e.g., by telling jokes or by making commentary about his games.","In various embodiments, the games of a primary player, and\/or data from the games of a primary player may be made available for participation and\/or for viewing by interested secondary players. Data from the games of a primary player may be made available on an ongoing, continuous, and\/or real-time basis. Secondary players may, at their leisure or pleasure, view or participate in the games. As such, data from the games of the primary player may be broadcast or transmitted in an analogous fashion to programs on a television or radio show, or analogously to periodically updated Web pages. Secondary players may tune in or out as desired. Each primary player may constitute a \u201cchannel\u201d or \u201cstation\u201d. A secondary player may, for example, view a list of primary players just as he would a list of television stations. The secondary player may then decide which primary player or \u201cstation\u201d he wants to participate with. When selecting a primary player, the secondary player may also have the opportunity to review data about historical games played by the primary player. For example, the secondary player may be able to review the primary player's wins and losses over the prior 20 games.","In various embodiments, a casino may select from a subset of available primary players to choose primary players for whose games data will be made available to secondary players. In some embodiments, a casino may serve as a \u201cdisc jockey\u201d by choosing which primary players will have their data made available to others. The disc jockeys may be humans (e.g., casino employees), or may be computer algorithms which automatically select certain primary players based, for example, upon a defined set of rules. The disc jockey or jockeys may select primary players based on any number of factors. A primary player may be selected based on: (a) recent results (e.g., recent wins or high payouts); (b) based on long term results (e.g., long term profits); (c) based on skill at playing a game (e.g., based on his use of basic strategy in blackjack); (d) based on his celebrity status (e.g., based on whether his name has been published in any newspaper in the past year); (e) based on a history of being favored by secondary players; and so on. At any given time, a disc jockey may decide to stop making data available from certain primary players, and\/or to commence making data available from other primary players. For example, a disc jockey may decide that a primary player has hit a string of losses and therefore would not be of interest to any secondary player. The disc jockey may accordingly stop making data from the primary player available. For example, a disc jockey may decide that a given primary player has just won a large payout and therefore would be of interest to secondary players. Accordingly, the disc jockey may commence making data from the primary player available.","In various embodiments, the data about the games of a primary player may be made available across one or more casinos. A first casino may broadcast or transmit data from the games of one or more primary players to a second casino. The broadcast may occur via the radio or television spectrums, via mobile wireless frequencies, via microwave frequencies, via metal or optical cables, or via any other means. Secondary players in one or more of the casinos may view the data (e.g., may view games that are reconstructed based on the data). The data may be made available on the Internet, on one or more radio stations, on television, on interactive television, and so on. For example, a secondary player may visit a web page on which are listed names or identifiers for one or more primary players. The secondary player may click on an identifier in order to view data about games of the corresponding primary player. In some embodiments, a secondary player may set the channel on his television to a particular channel whereby identifiers for various primary players are listed on a menu. The secondary player may select an identifier from the menu (e.g., using a remote control) and may thereby call up on the television screen further data pertaining to the games of the primary player.","In various embodiments, data about the game of a primary player may originate in a first casino. For example, the primary player may play the game in the first casino. Data about the game may be transmitted to a second casino. From the second casino (e.g., from a terminal located in the second casino), a secondary player may participate in the game. The second casino may thereby derive revenue from the secondary player by using data originating from the first casino. In various embodiments, the first casino and the second casino may split revenue, win, profits, theoretical win, or any other financial gain that has been derived from the use of the data at the secondary casino. For example, 50% of the theoretical win from a bet by the secondary player (i.e., the casino advantage on the bet multiplied by the amount bet by the secondary player) may be given to the first casino by the second casino. The financial gain may be split with one percentage going to the first casino and another percentage going to the second casino. In some embodiments, the second casino pays a flat fee to the first casino for the use of the data. The flat fee may cover all possible uses of the data (i.e., uses of the data in as many games as the second casino desires) or may cover a single use of the data (i.e., in one game). In some embodiments, the second casino keeps a fixed financial gain from the use of the data and pays any remaining financial gain to the first casino. For example, the second casino may keep 2 cents of theoretical win per game in which the data is used, and give the remaining portion of the theoretical win to the first casino. As will be appreciate, financial gain may be split between the first and second casinos in many other ways.","A Secondary Player Watches Games in Progress.","The secondary player may have various ways of watching or following the game or games in which he is participating. Following a game may include receiving information about the outcome or result of the game, receiving information about symbols or indicia that have arisen in the game (e.g., cards that have been dealt), receiving information about outcomes or results received by a dealer or opposing players, receiving information about decisions that are available or have been made in a game (e.g., decisions by a primary player to hit or stand), receiving information about player mannerisms in a game (e.g., facial expressions of a primary player or his opponents), information about amounts bet on a game (e.g., amounts bet by the primary player or the secondary player), information about amounts won on a game (e.g., amounts won by the primary player or the secondary player); and so on.","A Split Screen Allows the Secondary Player to See Multiple Roulette Wheels in the Casino at Once.","In various embodiments, the secondary player may follow the progress of one or more games in which he participates using one or more display screens. Display screens may include cathode ray tubes, flat panel displays, plasma displays, liquid crystal displays, diode displays, light-emitting diode displays, organic light-emitting diode displays, projection displays, rear projection displays, front projection displays, digital light processing (DLP) displays, surface-conduction electron-emitter (SED) displays, electronic ink displays (e.g., E-Ink Corp's display technology), holographic displays, and so on. A secondary player may follow the progress of a game using a device such as a Blackberry\u00ae, iPod\u00ae, personal digital assistant, mobile phone, laptop computer, camera, personal computer, television, electronic book (eBook) and so on. A single screen may contain information about a single game in which the secondary player participates. A single screen may also contain information about multiple games in which the secondary player participates. The display screen may display information about one game on one part of the screen, and about another game on another part of the screen. For example, the screen may be divided into four quadrants, each quadrant showing information about a different game that the secondary player is participating in. A secondary player participating in two games may view a first of the two games on one display screen, and a second of the two games on another display screen. A secondary player may thus watch or follow the progress of games using multiple displays screens.","Views Come from Overhead Cameras.","In various embodiments, a secondary player may follow the progress of a game in which he participates using video and\/or audio feeds from the proximity of the game. For example, a camera may capture the progress of a blackjack game played by a primary player. By watching a video feed, the secondary player may see the cards dealt in the game, the decisions made by the primary player, the decisions made by the dealer, and the result of the game (e.g., win for the primary player, win for the dealer, blackjack for the primary player, tie). In various embodiments, video or audio feeds may be live, delayed, or may be stored and played back at a later time for the secondary player.","Data is Piped Electronically from the Slot Machines.","In various embodiments, data may be captured from a gaming device or live table game, encoded into electronic form, and transmitted to a display device, speaker, or other output device used to present the data to the secondary player. The output devices may decode the electronic data and present it in a sensible form for human viewing. The presentation may include a text description of occurrences in the game. For example, text may read, \u201cAt 9:02 pm, slot machine number 1423 achieved the outcome of bar-bar-bar. Congratulations, you have won 20 coins.\u201d The presentation may include a reconstruction of the game. For example, the game may be reconstructed using animated renditions of the game. For example, an animated slot machine may show animated reels spinning and stopping to show the outcome achieved by the actual slot machine which generated the game the secondary player participated in. In another example, an animated dealer using animated cards may be used to reconstruct a live table game of blackjack. In various embodiments, a computer synthesized voice may report to the secondary player occurrences in a game in which the secondary player participates.","Only Active Machines are Shown to the Secondary Player. For Example, the Machine Currently Resolving into an Outcome is Shown.","In various embodiments, a secondary player may participate in several games at once. The games may not necessarily all proceed at the same pace. For example, one game may finish while another is still in progress. In some embodiments, games or aspects of games may be presented to the secondary player only as important or relevant events occur in the game. For example, when a first game finishes, all or part of the game may be presented to the secondary player. For example, when the first game finishes, a depiction or an image of the final outcome (e.g., the final cards in the primary player's hand) may be flashed onto a display screen viewed by the secondary player. The image pertaining to the first game may be removed when a second game finishes. When the second game finishes, a depiction or image of the final outcome in the second game may be flashed onto the display screen. In this way, the secondary player need only view aspects of a game that are most relevant, most important, or most interesting to him. When a game is in an uninteresting stage (e.g., when the reels of a slot machine are spinning), the secondary player may view information about other games. Information that may be deemed worthy of showing to a secondary player may include: information about a decision that is to be made in a game (e.g., the primary player has received an initial hand of blackjack and must now decide to hit or stand); information about a decision that has been made in a game (e.g., the primary player has decided to hit); information about a new card, symbol, or other indicium obtained in a game (e.g., a new reel of the slot machine has stopped, showing a new symbol for the pay-line); information about a final outcome of a game; information about entry into a bonus round or bonus game (e.g., the primary player has just won the opportunity to play a bonus round); information about a symbol, card, or other indicium obtained by a dealer or by an opponent of the primary player; information about an amount bet (e.g., by the primary player or by the secondary player); and information about an amount won (e.g., by the primary player or by the secondary player).","The Secondary Player is Alerted when his Favorite Primary Player Sits Down.","In various embodiments, a secondary player may prefer to participate in the games of particular primary players, in the games of particular gaming devices, in games played at particular gaming tables, in games played with particular dealers, and so on. A secondary player may explicitly record his preferences, e.g., by informing the casino. In some embodiments, the secondary player may be assumed to have certain preferences, based, for example, on a history of participating in the games of a particular primary player. For example, if a secondary player has participated in 300 games of a particular primary player, the secondary player may be assumed to prefer or to enjoy participating in the games of the primary player. In some embodiments, the casino may inform a secondary player when a game in which the secondary player may be interested in participating is or will be in progress. For example, suppose that the secondary player has indicated that he likes to participate in games played by primary player Joe Smith. When Joe Smith sits down at a gaming device and begins playing, the casino may detect the presence of Joe Smith (e.g., by means of a player tracking card inserted by Joe Smith) and may then alert the secondary player that Joe Smith has begun playing. The secondary player may then place bets on the games of Joe Smith. The casino may alert the secondary player using any number of communication means. A casino representative may call the secondary player, may send a text or email message to the secondary player, may page the secondary player, may find the secondary player in person, and so on.","A Secondary Player is Alerted as to the Presence of a Primary Player Who has Done Well for him.","A secondary player may be alerted when a primary player commences play if the secondary player has had favorable results in the past when participating in the games of the primary player. Favorable past results may mean that: the secondary player is ahead in terms of winnings based on all prior participation in the games of the primary player; the secondary player was ahead in the most recent time period during which he participated in the games of the primary player; the secondary player won more than a predetermined amount of money (e.g., more than $500) in a single session while participating in the games of the primary player; the secondary player won a jackpot or other high-paying outcome while participating in the games of the primary player; the secondary player was ahead in the most recent X number of games when participating in the games of the primary player; or any other measure of performance while participating in the games of the primary player.","A Secondary Player is Alerted as to the Presence of a Primary Player with Good statistics.","A secondary player may be alerted when a primary player commences play if the primary player has a certain historical record or certain statistics that may be of interest to the secondary player. The historical record may include a record of: having won one or more jackpots or other high-paying outcomes; having won money for other secondary players; having achieved profitable sessions in the most recent gaming session or in any prior gaming session; having achieved a profit during some prior time period (e.g., during the past six months); and so on. A secondary player may also be alerted if a primary player that has some measure of popularity commences play. For example, primary players may be rated, e.g., by one or more secondary players, based on the secondary players' degree of satisfaction with, or other feelings towards the primary player. A primary player may, for example, be rated highly if he has won money for many secondary players in the past. Thus, for example, if a highly rated primary player commences play, a secondary player may be alerted and may be given the opportunity to participate in the games of the primary player.","A Secondary Player is Alerted when Good Machine is Taken.","In various embodiments, a secondary player may be alerted if play commences at a gaming device or table that is or may be of interest to the secondary player. The gaming device may be of interest due to a number of factors, among them: the secondary player has won a jackpot or other high-paying outcome while participating in games of the gaming device; the secondary player has had profitable sessions at the gaming device; the secondary player has had recent profitable sessions at the gaming device; the secondary player has had profitable sessions at another gaming device similar to the gaming device (e.g., at a gaming device of the same type or from the same manufacturer); one or more recent games at the gaming device have resulted in jackpots or high-paying outcomes; recent games at the gaming device have resulted in profits for the player or players at the gaming device; the gaming device is highly rated (e.g., by secondary players); and so on.","A Secondary Player Pays a Fee to Participate in Games.","In various embodiments, a secondary player may be required to pay in order to participate in the game of a primary player. The amount paid may be based on the status, rating, historical results, or requests of the primary player. For example, if the primary player is a well-known celebrity, the fees required of a secondary player may be higher than if the primary player were a lesser-known celebrity. If the primary player has had highly favorable historical results (e.g., has made large profits in the past), then the fees required of the secondary player may be higher than if the primary player did not have such favorable historical results. In various embodiments, the primary player may also declare a fee required for secondary players to participate in his games. A portion of such fee paid by a secondary player may be paid to the primary player.","Rules for Using Old Data in a Game with Real Money on the Line. There is Opportunity of Misconduct Since the Player and\/or the Casino May Know the Data Already.","The use of historical games, outcomes, and other data related to a game presents an opportunity for an advantage by any party with knowledge of a data. For example, a casino might provide secondary players with the opportunity to participate only in games whose results the casino knows are losing for the player (and therefore winning for the casino). In another example, a secondary player may have already participated in a particular game (e.g., as a primary player) and may therefore know the outcome of the game in advance. The secondary player may thus make a large bet on the game if he knows the game will result in a winning outcome for him, and will make a small bet or no bet on the game if he knows the game will result in a losing outcome for him.","Before the Original Data is Generated, it May be Tagged for Reuse at a Particular Date and Time in the Future. That Way, the Casino May be Afforded No Discretion as to Whether or not to Use the Data.","In various embodiments, before a particular game is played for the first time, a casino designates a time, date, location, and\/or any other situation or circumstance under which the game will be made available for participation by others. The situation under which the game will be made available may be chosen randomly, according to some algorithm, or in any other fashion. Once the situation or circumstances for future participation in the game have been established, the game may commence for the first time. In this way, the casino has established future circumstances under which the game may be made available for participation by others (e.g., by secondary players) before the casino is aware of the outcome of the game. The casino cannot, therefore, decide not to allow participation in the game if the game turns out to result in a jackpot for the player. In various embodiments, the establishment of future circumstances under which a game will be available for participation by others is binding upon the casino. Regulators may keep track of when games must be made available for future participation, and may verify that the games have in fact been made available. In various embodiments, players or other parties may not necessarily know the circumstances under which a game must be made available in the future. In this way, players will not be able to selectively choose games to participate in based on advanced knowledge of the outcomes. In various embodiments, a record is stored, the record including information about a game and information about circumstances under which the game is to be made available in the future for participation by others.","Data May be Put in a Queue. When it Reaches the Front of the Queue, it Must be Used.","In various embodiments, when a game is played or generated for the first time, data or information about the game is placed in a queue. Games from the queue are then made available for participation by secondary players based on a first-in-first-out model. Thus, a game becomes available for participation based on a relatively straightforward scheduling algorithm, and there is little discretion on the part of the casino as to when the game will become available for participation. In various embodiments, other scheduling algorithms may be used. For example, games are made available according to a last-in-first-out scheduling algorithm. Any other scheduling algorithm may be used, particularly if the casino has little control over the schedule once the outcome of a game is known.","One Set of Data May be Used after and Only after Another Set of Data.","In various embodiments, data about a second game may be associated with data about a first game. The association may dictate that the data about the second game may be used to allow participation in the second game by a secondary player when, and only when, the data about the first game has been used. Similarly, data about a third game may be associated with the data about the second game, such that the data about the third game may be used when, and only when, the data about the second game has been used. In this way, through a chain of association, data about different games can be made available in sequence, allowing the secondary player to participate in a sequence of games. Data about different games may be associated in many ways. For example, data about a first game and a second game can be stored in locations with sequential addresses in a semiconductor memory. The casino may access the locations in the memory sequentially by address, and thereby make available data about the first game and data about the second game in sequence. In some embodiments, data about a given game may be associated with an index. The index may be a numerical index using integer numbers, for example. With such an indexing scheme, data about a game associated with index 235, for example, would be made available once data about a game associated with index 234 had already been made available. In some embodiments, the index may be a time. The time may represent a time during which the associated data was originally generated, or a time when the data should be made available again, for example. For instance, when the time associated with a particular set of data actually comes to match the current time, the particular set of data may be made available so that a secondary player might participate in a game generated using the data.","The Time, Date, and\/or the Machine that Generated the Data May be Chosen at Random.","In various embodiments, a game that is made available for participation by a secondary player is selected at random using one or more randomly chosen variables or parameters. For example, a time and\/or date may be chosen at random. Once a time and date have been chosen, for example, a game played at that time and date may be made available for participation by the secondary player. A gaming device, player, dealer, casino, location, and type of game may also constitute parameters that are chosen at random. In various embodiments, several parameters must be chosen at once in order to narrow down the universe of games to one particular game. For example, to determine a unique game, a time, date, and machine number may be required. In various embodiments, the parameters may be chosen by the secondary player, by the casino, or by third parties, such as regulators. Parameters may, in various embodiments, be chosen after the game has been played for the first time.","The Secondary Player May Choose the Time and\/or Machine.","In various embodiments, a secondary player may choose the time, date, machine, or other parameter used to select a game. The choice may not necessarily by random.","Regulators May Choose the Time and\/or Machine.","In various embodiments, a third party, such as a gaming regulator, may select a game that will be made available for participation by a secondary player. The third party may, in particular, have no stake in the outcome of the game. Therefore the third party may not be biased towards selecting a game that is winning for the secondary player or winning for the casino. The regulator or other third party may not necessarily select the game directly. Rather the third party may select one or more parameters (e.g., a time, date, machine number) that may be used to select a game that meets the selected parameters.","A Player Who Had his Player Tacking Card in a Gaming Device when the Data was Originally Generated May be Prevented from Playing a Game Based on that Data.","In various embodiments, the casino may verify that the secondary player was not present for a game when it was originally played and\/or had no knowledge of the result of the game. The casino may verify that the player was not staying at the casino's hotel during the day or time when the game was played. For example, the casino may check records of who had checked into its hotel on the day of the game. The casino may check to see whether the player made any bets at the casino on the day of the game. For example, the casino may check to see whether the player had a player tracking card inserted into a gaming device, or otherwise on record, for the day of the game. It will be understood that the casino may verify the presence of the player not just during a particular day, but during longer or shorter time periods as well. For example, the casino may verify that there is no record of a player's presence during an entire 5 day period surrounding the day of the game. A casino may verify that a player was not in the same city where the game was played at the time the game was played. For example, the casino may verify that there is no record of the player at any other casino affiliated with the casino (e.g., under the same ownership as the casino) during the day of the game. The casino may use any practicable means to verify that the player had no knowledge of the game or the outcome of the game.","Disallowing Variation of Bet Size.","In various embodiments, a secondary player may be prevented from varying the sizes of his bets over the course of a gaming session. In particular, the secondary player may be prevented from varying his bet sizes if he is participating in games that were first played in the past. The secondary player may thereby be prevented from varying his bet sizes based on advanced knowledge of the outcomes of the game. For example, the secondary player may be prevented from making larger bets when he knows the outcome of a game will be favorable, and a small bet when he knows the outcome of a game will be unfavorable.","Bet Limits on Game.","In various embodiments, limits may be placed on the size of bets placed on games that have already been generated or played. For example, a secondary player may be permitted to bet no more than $1 on a game that has been played in the past. In this way, the casino's losses will be limited even if the secondary player has knowledge of the outcome of the game. In some embodiments, the total amount of bets placed on a game may be limited. For example, bets placed by all secondary players participating in a particular game may be limited to totaling less than $5.","Limits on Winnings.","In various embodiments, potential winnings or payouts for a game may be capped. For example, if the payout for an outcome of \u201cbell-bell-bell\u201d in an original game was 2000 coins, the potential payout for the same game may be reduced to 500 coins when a secondary player is participating in the game. This may limit the potential losses to a casino for a secondary player that has knowledge of the outcome of a game.","Disguising a Game.","In various embodiments, one or more aspects of a game may be disguised before a secondary player is allowed to participate in the game. Thus a secondary player who had previously participated in the game may still fail to recognize the game and to bet accordingly. A game may be disguised in a number of ways. One or more graphics of the game may be changed to appear differently. For example, a \u201ccherry\u201d symbol may appear in a different shade of red or with three cherries on a stem rather than two. In some embodiments, new symbols are substituted in for old symbols. For example, rather than \u201ccherry\u201d symbols, a game may use \u201cblueberry\u201d symbols. However, outcomes containing blueberries may result in the same winnings as did outcomes with cherry symbols in the original game. In some embodiments, sound effects are changed or disguised. For example the background music in the disguised game may be different from that in the original game. In some embodiments, the animation or video sequences may be altered. For example, reels of a gaming device may appear to spin faster or slower, to appear jerkier or less jerky, etc., than they did in the original game. For live games, features of one or more players may be hidden or disguised. For example the face of a dealer at a live game may be blurred out in footage of the game. In some embodiments, a new face may be super-imposed over the old face of a dealer or player so as to heighten the effect of the disguising. As will be appreciated, there are many other possible ways of disguising a game so that its outcome is not predictable to even a player who has knowledge of the original game. As described elsewhere in this document, a game may be disguised by using a different game skin while maintaining the same underlying events, outcomes, logic, etc. In some embodiments, a game may be generated and presented using at least two steps. In a first step, the results of one or more random events are determined, leading to the determination of a final outcome and a final payout for the game. In the second step, data about the results of the random event(s), the final outcome, and the final payout are used to create a graphical presentation for the player. For example, once it is determined that a player will receive an outcome consisting of three like symbols, with an associated payout of 20 coins, such data may be fed into the second step. In the second step, a graphical rendering of slot machine reels may be created, with such rendering showing the reels spinning and finally landing on an outcome with three like symbols. Further the graphical rendering may include a flashing message that says, \u201cCongratulations, you won 20 coins!\u201d It will be appreciated that the first step may be performed by a first device, processor, algorithm or set of algorithms, and that the second step may be performed by a second device, processor, algorithm, or set of algorithms. Accordingly, the second device, processor, algorithm, or set of algorithms may be removed and replaced with a third device, processor, algorithm, or set of algorithms. This third device, processor, algorithm, or set of algorithms may receive the same set of data from the first step as did the second device, processor, algorithm, or set of algorithms. However, the third device, processor, algorithm, or set of algorithms may perform the second step in a different fashion. The third device, processor, algorithm, or set of algorithms may thereby generated a different set of graphics, graphical renderings, or other presentation formats than did the second device, processor, algorithm, or set of algorithms. Thus, the underlying structure of the game has remained the same, but it has been presented using a different skin.","Choosing Aspects of a Game.","In various embodiments, a secondary player may choose a game in which to participate based on one or more attributes of the game or associated with the game. The secondary player may indirectly choose the game by first choosing an attribute, and then having the opportunity to participate in one or more games having the chosen attribute. Various attributes may be especially meaningful to a secondary player and thus a secondary player may prefer to play games having those attributes. In various embodiments, the casino may select for the secondary player a game with an attribute that is anticipated to be meaningful for the secondary player. In various embodiments, the casino may provide the secondary player with the ability to search for a game based on one or more attributes of the game.","Choose a Special Date.","In various embodiments, a secondary player may find a particular date to be meaningful. Thus, the secondary player may select a game that was played on the date. If the casino knows a date to be meaningful for the secondary player, then the casino may select for the player a game played on that date.","Choose the Secondary Player's Birthday.","A meaningful date for a secondary player may be a birthday. The birthday may be the birthday of the secondary player, of a relative of the secondary player's, of a pet of the secondary player's, of a friend of the secondary player's and so on. The secondary player may indicate to the casino that such a date is meaningful to the secondary player. The casino may accordingly select a game for the secondary player that was played on the date. The casino may also have a record of the secondary player's birthday based on information already provided to the casino by the secondary player. For example, the secondary player may have provided the casino with his date of birth when signing up for a player tracking card, or when taking a loan from the casino. The casino may then select, without request from the secondary player, a game that was first played on the birthday of the secondary player.","Choose a Date on which a Big Jackpot was Won.","In various embodiments, a secondary player may wish to play a game that was first played on the date that a large payout, such as a jackpot, was won. This may give the secondary player the opportunity to participate in the game in which the jackpot was won. The secondary player may indicate to the casino a desire to play a game that was first played on the day of a big jackpot. The casino may then allow the secondary player to participate in one or more games played on the day of the jackpot. The secondary player may not himself know the date when a big jackpot was won. Thus, the secondary player may request that he be allowed to participate in games from the same date as the date that the last big jackpot was won.","Choose a Date when the Progressive was Still Big. The Secondary Player May Have a Shot at the Large Progressive.","In various embodiments, a secondary player may wish to have the opportunity to win a large progressive jackpot. As is well known, the size of a progressive jackpot may vary over time. In general, as time passes without a progressive jackpot being won, the progressive jackpot becomes larger. The current size of a progressive jackpot may not be large enough to satisfy the desires of a secondary player. Therefore, the secondary player may wish to participate in a historical game from a time that the progressive jackpot was larger. Accordingly, the secondary player may request to participate in a game that was first played at a time the progressive jackpot was in excess of a certain threshold. The casino may, accordingly, allow the secondary player to participate in such a game.","Choose a Gaming Device.","In various embodiments, a secondary player may search for a gaming device having desired attributes or characteristics. Upon finding a gaming device with desired attributes or characteristics, the secondary player may choose to participate in games played at the gaming device. The secondary player may search for a gamine device using a search form. In the search form, the player may select from among various characteristics of a gaming device, some of which are described below.","A secondary player may search for a gaming device based on the historical results of the gaming device. For example, a secondary player may search for a gaming device with one or more of the following characteristics: (a) the gaming device has paid more than X amount of money in the last Y amount of time; (b) the gaming device has paid more than X amount of money in general; (c) the gaming device has paid X amount of in excess of what it has taken in, in the last Y amount of time; (d) the gaming device has made X amount in excess of what it has taken in, in general; (e) the gaming device has generated winning games for players in X % of its games in the last Y period of time; (f) the gaming device has generated winning games for players in X % of its games out of the last Y games; (g) the gaming device generated winning games for players in X of its most recent games; (h) the gaming device has paid X payouts greater than Y in the last Z games; (i) the gaming device has paid X payouts greater than Y; (j) the gaming device has paid a jackpot in the last X days (or other time period); (k) the gaming device has paid X jackpots in general; (l) the gaming device has entered X number of bonus rounds in his last Y games; (m) the gaming device has entered X number of bonus rounds ever.","A secondary player may search for a gaming device based on the type of game or based on a characteristic of a game played at the gaming device. A secondary player may search for a gaming device with one or more of the following attributes: (a) the gaming device uses mechanical reels; (b) the gaming device uses video reels; (c) the gaming device has three reels; (d) the gaming device has five reels; (e) the gaming device has X number of reels; (f) the gaming device accepts a particular denomination of bets (e.g., penny, nickel, quarter, dollar); (g) the gaming device has X number of pay-lines; (h) the gaming device has 1 pay-line; (i) the gaming device has 3 pay-lines; (j) the gaming device has more than 1 pay-line; (k) the gaming device allows multiple bets per pay-line; (l) the gaming device is made by a particular manufacturer; (m) the gaming device or a game at the gaming device was introduced in the last X years (e.g., the game is a new game); (n) the gaming device has a particular theme (e.g., I Love Lucy, Regis Philbin); (o) the gaming device features a slot game; (p) the gaming device features a video poker game; (q) the gaming device features video blackjack; (r) the gaming device is part of a particular cluster of gaming devices (e.g., a cluster of gaming devices where an outcome at one gaming device may influence an outcome at another gaming device in the cluster); and so on.","A secondary player may search for a gaming device based on one or more payouts that may be provided by the gaming device. Such payouts may be contingent on a primary player of the gaming device obtaining a particular outcome at the gaming device. A secondary player may search for a gaming device that has a top payout of over X times a bet, that has a payout of over X amount, and\/or that has at least X payouts over Y amount. A secondary player may search for a gaming device that has more than X outcomes that are winning and\/or a gaming device that has more than X outcomes that pay more than Y. A secondary player may search for a gaming device that has a particular or a particular range of payout frequency. For example, a secondary player may search for a gaming device that pays, on average, between once every five games and once every seven games.","A Simulated Game Matches Search Criteria.","In various embodiments, a secondary player may specify search criteria in order to find a game in which to participate. The casino may then provide the secondary player with the opportunity to participate in a simulated game which matches the search criteria. For example, a secondary player may search for a game of blackjack in which the dealer up-card is a six. The casino may then offer the secondary player an opportunity to participate in a simulated game of blackjack in which the dealer has an up-card of six. The simulated game may have been simulated in the past. For example, the casino may have simulated numerous games in the past and stored data about the games. The casino may then find one of the games from the stored set of games such that the found game matches the secondary player's search criteria. The casino server may then offer the secondary player the opportunity to participate in the found game. In the aforementioned example, the casino server may offer the secondary player the chance to participate in a simulated game in which the dealer had an up-card of six. In various embodiments, a simulated game may include a game where player decisions were made by a computer routine. In various embodiments, a simulated game may include a game in which random events were generated using a computer routine. In various embodiments, a secondary player may perform a search for a game of a primary player matching certain criteria. The casino may, once the search criteria have been specified by the secondary player, generate one or more simulated games matching the search criteria. For example, the secondary player may search for a series of games in which a primary player has won 10 consecutive games in a row. The casino may thereupon simulate a series of games. The casino may continue simulating games until the simulated primary player has won 10 games in a row. The casino may then, for example, provide the secondary player with the opportunity to participate in the next simulated game. In various embodiments, the casino may construct one or more games that match search criteria of the secondary player. For example, if the secondary player is interested in participating in a game of craps in which the first roll of the dice is an eight, then the casino may begin a simulated game and force the first roll to be a eight. Subsequent rolls in the game may be generated at random. In embodiments described herein, any searches performed by a secondary player for a particular type of game may be satisfied by simulated games and\/or by games constructed by the casino server. In various embodiments the odds, the payouts, the rules, and\/or the required bet amount for a game may be changed when a secondary player has specified a criterion that the game must meet. For example, if the secondary player specifies a game of blackjack in which the primary player has a good starting hand (e.g., an 11 point total) then the payout for a winning hand may be reduced.","Search for a Trend.","In various embodiments, a secondary player may search for a particular trend or pattern among one or more games. For example, a secondary player may search for any string of 10 consecutive games played by the same primary player in which the primary player won all 10 games. Once finding the trend, the secondary player may participate in the game immediately following the trend. For example, a secondary player may find a trend of spins at a roulette wheel in which three consecutive spins resulted in the number 13. The secondary player may then participate in the spin of the roulette wheel that immediately followed the three spins in which the number 13 came up. The secondary player may not know the result of the spin which immediately followed the three spins where a 13 came up. A secondary player may search for various trends, including: (a) a series of consecutive games played by the same primary player in which the primary player has lost all the games; (b) a series of consecutive games played by the same primary player in which the primary player has won all the games; (c) a series of consecutive games played by the same primary player in which the primary player has tied in all the games; (d) a series of consecutive games played by the same primary player in which the primary player has generated at least a predetermined amount of net winnings; (e) a series of consecutive games played by the same primary player in which the primary player has generated at least a predetermined amount of gross winnings; (f) a series of consecutive games played by the same primary player for which a particular symbol (e.g., \u201cbell\u201d) has occurred in every game; (g) a series of consecutive games played by the same primary player in which the primary player has alternated every game between winning and losing; (h) a series of consecutive spins at of a roulette wheel that have resulted in the same outcome (e.g., the number 4); (i) a series of consecutive spins at of a roulette wheel that have resulted in the same type of outcome (e.g., a red outcome); (j) a time period (e.g., a five-minute time period) during which 80% of blackjack games played by any primary player were won; (k) a time period (e.g., a one-hour period) during which three jackpot outcomes were won at slot machines in a particular casino; (l) a series of games (e.g., games played at a particular table at a casino) in which a particular starting hand occurred at least 20% of the time (e.g., in which primary players received a blackjack at least 20% of the time); and so on. In various embodiments, a secondary player may search for a primary player who is the biggest loser within a given population during a given period of time. For example, a secondary player may search for a primary player who has lost the most during a one-hour period of time at the reel slot machines. In various embodiments, a secondary player may search for a primary player who is the biggest winner within a given population during a given period of time. In various embodiments, a secondary player may search for a primary player who has had the most outcomes paying more than $50 within a given population during a given period of time. In various embodiments, a secondary player may search for a primary player who is the biggest loser over his entire playing session when compared to any other primary player. In various embodiments, a secondary player may search for a primary player who is the biggest loser over his entire playing career, at least at a particular casino. In various embodiments, a secondary player may search for a trend that is based on an area of a casino. For example, a secondary player may search for an area of a casino such that games played in that area over the last hour have resulted in net winnings for all players of $3000. In various embodiments, a secondary player may search for a trend that is based on a type of game. For example, the secondary player may search for a type of game such that, in the last X minutes, games of that type have resulted in average winnings for primary players of more than $20. In various embodiments, a secondary player may search for a trend that is based on primary players with a certain characteristic. For example, the secondary player may search for a trend in which primary players from Arkansas have won, on average, more than $50 per player over the last hour.","Choose a Primary Player.","In various embodiments, a secondary player may search for a primary player having desired attributes or characteristics. Upon finding a primary player with desired attributes or characteristics, the secondary player may choose to participate in games of the primary player. The secondary player may search for a primary player using a search form. In the search form, the player may select from among various characteristics of the primary player, some of which are described below. For example, the secondary player may enter an age or age range desired in a primary player. The secondary player may also select a characteristic of a primary player from a menu. For example, the secondary player may select one of fifty states from a menu, the state indicating a desired residence location for a primary player. As will be appreciated, a secondary player may search for a primary player in many other ways. For example, a secondary player may communicate to a casino representative (e.g., via text message) a description of a primary player. The casino representative may then check records of people currently checked into its hotel or currently playing at gaming devices (e.g., with tracking cards inserted), and may attempt to locate a person matching the description provided by the secondary player. In some embodiments, a secondary player may seek a particular and unique individual, i.e., the secondary player may submit a description that can only be satisfied by one person in the world. For example, the secondary player may submit a name. In some embodiments, the secondary player may submit a description that may be satisfied by any one or a plurality of primary players. The secondary player need not have a particular individual in mind.","A secondary player may search for a primary player based on the historical results of the primary player. For example, a secondary player may search for a primary player with one or more of the following characteristics: (a) the primary player has won more than X amount of money in the last Y amount of time; (b) the primary player has won more than X amount of money in general; (c) the primary player has made X amount of profits in the last Y amount of time; (d) the primary player has made X amount of profits in general; (e) the primary player has won X % of his games in the last Y period of time; (f) the primary player has won X % of his games out of the last Y games; (g) the primary player won X of his most recent games; (h) the primary player has won X payouts greater than Y in the last Z games; (i) the primary player has won X payouts greater than Y; (j) the primary player has won a jackpot in the last X days (or other time period); (k) the primary player has won x jackpots in general; (l) the primary player has used optimal strategy in his last X games; (m) the primary player has used good or expert level strategy in his last X games; (n) the primary player has entered X number of bonus rounds in his last Y games; (o) the primary player has entered X number of bonus rounds ever.","A secondary player may search for a primary player based on a historical relationship between the primary player and the secondary player. The secondary player may search for a primary player in whose game or games the secondary player has previously participated. The secondary player may search for a primary player, where, participating in the games of the primary player: (a) the secondary player has won a jackpot; (b) the secondary player has made a profit; (c) the secondary player has entered X number of bonus rounds; (d) the secondary player has won in X of the last Y games; (e) the secondary player has won X % of the last Y games; (f) the secondary player has won X payouts more than Y amount; and so on. The secondary player may also search for a primary player where the secondary player has participated in more than X number of games with the primary player.","A secondary player may search for a primary player based on demographic characteristics of the primary player. For example, the secondary player may search for a primary player based on one or more of the primary player's: (a) age; (b) race; (c) marital status; (d) number of children; (e) number of grandchildren; (f) religion; (g) place of birth; (h) place of residence; (i) gender; (j) occupation; (k) income; (l) disability status; (m) education level; (n) high school attended; (o) college attended; and so on. For example, the secondary player may wish to participate in games of a primary player who shares one or more demographic characteristics with the secondary player.","A secondary player may search for a primary player based on hobbies enjoyed by the primary player. For example, the secondary player may search for a primary player that enjoys a particular game or sport, or for a primary player that is a fan of a particular sports team.","A secondary player may search for a primary player with whom the secondary player has some prior connection or relationship. The secondary player may search for a primary player in whose games the secondary player has previously participated. The secondary player may search for primary players in whose game the secondary player has previously won money, won a jackpot, won a large payout, or had some other result of interest to the secondary player.","In various embodiments, a secondary player may search for a particular game based on attributes of the game. The search may be particular to an individual game. For example, a search may distinguish between two games played by the same primary player at the same gaming device. In some embodiments, a secondary player may search for a game in which a certain amount has been bet. For example, a secondary player may search for a game in which three coins have been bet. The bet of three coins may make the primary player of the game eligible to win the jackpot. The secondary player may search for a game in which X number of pay-lines are activated, or a game in which X number of hands of video poker are being played simultaneously. A secondary player may search for a game based on the time or date on which the game was played.","In some embodiments, a secondary player may search for a game based on events that transpire within the game. For example, the game may have already occurred, or the game may be in process at the time of the secondary player's search. A secondary player may search for a game in which: (a) a particular set of cards have been dealt (e.g., a video poker game where a pair has been dealt in an initial hand, or a blackjack hand where cards totaling 11 have been dealt as a starting hand); (b) a particular symbol or symbols of an outcome have been determined (e.g., two bar symbols have appeared on the reels of a gaming device out of an outcome consisting of three symbols); (c) a bonus round has been reached; and\/or (d) a certain level of a bonus round has been reached.","Providing a Game for the Secondary Player to Participate in.","At some point, the secondary player may be ready to participate in a game with certain attributes. The attributes may be attributes specified by the secondary player. For example, the secondary player may have searched for a game with the certain attributes, or otherwise provided an indication of a desire to participate in a game with the certain attributes. In some embodiments, the casino may, for other reasons, wish to have the secondary player participate in a game with the certain attributes.","An Actual Historical Game is Provided.","Given a set of attributes or characteristics, a casino may retrieve data about a historical game with the given set of attributes or characteristics. The historical game may be a game that was actually played by a real human player. For example, when a secondary player has indicated a desire to play in a game of video poker that was played by a primary player aged 60 years old, the casino may retrieve data about a game that was actually played in the past by a 60 year-old primary player and that was played at a video poker machine. The data retrieved may be used to display information about the game to the secondary player (e.g., to show screen shots of the cards being dealt in the game), to determine what the outcome of the game was, to determine whether the secondary player is a winner based on bets placed on the game by the secondary player, and to determine an amount to pay the secondary player. Data about historical games may be stored in a database or in any other storage means. Data about historical games may be indexed by different attributes, such as the age of the player or the type of game. Games may thus be searched by attributes, and data about games with attributes desired by a secondary player may be retrieved.","A Historical Simulated Game is Provided.","Given a set of attributes or characteristics, a casino may retrieve data about a historical game that was simulated. The game may not ever have been played by a real human being. In some embodiments, the outcome of the game may have been determined prior to play by a real human being. However, subsequent to the outcome being generated, a person (e.g., a secondary player) may have participated in the game. As with a historical game originally played by a live player, data about a historical game that was simulated may be stored in a database and indexed by attributes. Subsequently, data about historical games may be searched according to desired attributes. The data may then be used to recreate the game for a secondary player, and to determine an outcome and an amount to be paid to a secondary player.","A Current Actual Game is Provided.","Given a set of attributes or characteristics, a casino may determine a current game in progress with the given set of attributes or characteristics. For example, a 60 year-old primary player from Wisconsin may currently be involved in a game at a video poker machine in which an initial hand with a pair has been dealt. The secondary player may be allowed to participate in the game in progress. For example, the secondary player may be allowed to place a bet on what the final outcome of the game will be. In various embodiments, the secondary player need not have the benefit of the same pay table as does the primary player, since the secondary player is placing a bet in the middle of the game and has more information than the primary player did at the start of the game.","A Current Simulated Game is Provided.","Given a set of attributes or characteristics, a casino may simulate a game having the given attributes or characteristics. The casino may, for example, use a computer algorithm to determine cards to deal in a card game (e.g., video poker) or to determine symbols to show in a simulated reel slot machine. For example, if a secondary player desires to participate in a game of video poker, the casino may simulate a game of video poker. If the secondary player desires to participate in a video slot machine game, the casino may simulate a video slot machine game. In various embodiments, the casino may use algorithms to simulate table games as well as games typically played on a gaming device. For example, the casino server may simulate craps, blackjack, or poker. If other players would normally be present in a game, the casino may use computer algorithms to simulate the decisions that would have been made by humans. For example, in order to simulate a game of poker, the casino may use algorithms designed to bet, call, fold, raise, or check, according to certain pre-programmed rules. In some embodiments, a secondary player may wish to participate in a game in which certain symbols or outcomes occur. The casino may, in some embodiments, simulate multiple games until the desired symbols or outcomes occur. The secondary player may have the opportunity to participate only in the game, of the multiple games, in which the desired symbols or outcomes occurred. For example, the secondary player may indicate a desire to participate in a game in which three-of-a-kind was dealt on the initial hand in a game of video poker. The casino may deal a number of simulated hands of video poker. Only when the casino finally deals an initial hand with three-of-a-kind, e.g., due to random chance, does the casino allow the secondary player to then place a bet and to receive winnings for the final outcome of the game. In some embodiments, the casino may accept a bet from the secondary player first, simulate multiple games until a game with desired characteristics is simulated, and then pay the player based upon the outcome of the game with the desired characteristics. In some embodiments, the simulation may begin with a game of the desired attributes. For example, if a secondary player desires to play in a game of video poker with three-of-a-kind dealt on the starting hand, then the simulation may begin by immediately dealing three-of-a-kind. The simulation may randomize the remaining cards (e.g., shuffle the cards remaining after the three cards of the same rank have been dealt, the remaining cards completing a standard deck of 52 cards). The game may continue with two additional cards dealt from the randomized deck to complete the initial hand, followed by the discarding of one or two cards, followed by the replacing of the discarded cards with new cards from the randomized deck. In various embodiments, the secondary player may or may not have the opportunity to make decisions in a simulated game. For example, in some embodiments, the secondary player may choose which cards to discard in a game of video poker. In some embodiments, the cards that are discarded may be chosen automatically, e.g., by a computer algorithm employing optimal poker strategy.","An Alert is Provided for when a Game with Desired Characteristics Will be Played.","Given a set of attributes or characteristics, a casino may determine when such a game will be played or will be likely to be played. For example, a secondary player may wish to participate in a game played by a primary player at a 3-reel slot machine, the primary player having three kids and a birthday in April. The casino may determine that a primary player with three kids and a birthday in April is indeed seated at a 3-reel slot ma
