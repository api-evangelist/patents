title: Electrical current transferring and brush pressure exerting interlocking slip ring assembly
abstract: An annular stator holder within a homopolar motor housing is positioned within magnetic fields established by magnet coils positioned in surrounding relation to brushes in sliding contact with the motor rotor. Also enclosed within the stator holder is a slip ring preassembled with the brushes attached thereto on one side by soft-solder joints with the other side attached by hard-solder joints to spring devices for clamping to the stator holder by leaf springs to exert pressure on the brushes thereby maintained in sliding contact with the rotor.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60\/545,893 filed Feb. 20, 2004, entitled \u201cELECTRICAL CURRENT TRANSFERRING AND BRUSH PRESSURE EXERTING INTERLOCKING SLIP RING ASSEMBLY\u201d, incorporated herein by reference.","The present invention relates generally to the transfer of electrical current between spaced surfaces of machines through which electrical power is converted into mechanical output power.","The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefore.","The provision of a ring interlocking assembly within electrical to mechanical power conversion machines, such as motors for positioning of brush and conductive spring devices is disclosed for example in U.S. Pat. No. 6,628,036 B1 to Lynch et al. It is an important object of the present invention to facilitate disassembly and reduce energy consumption during power transfer between the spring devices and the brushes of such motors.","In accordance with the present invention, electrical power is transmitted through a plurality of conductive spring devices of a motor attached by hard solder joints to individual ring sections of a slip ring assembly. The ring sections are held attached to each other by overlapping attachment links through which the slip ring assembly may be clamped to a base holder associated with a stator housing of the motor within which magnetic fields are established. Brushes attached by soft solder joints to the ring sections are thereby held in sliding contact with a surface of a rotor to which a mechanical output shaft of the motor is connected. Upon assembly the spring devices are clamped to the base holder to thereby hold the brushes under pressure in sliding surface contact with the rotor.","Referring now to the drawing in detail,  illustrates an electric super-conducting homopolar type of drive motor , having a stator housing  from which an output shaft  extends. Such motor  is referred to for example in U.S. Pat. No. 6,628,036 B1 to Lynch et al. As shown in , the output shaft  of the motor  is connected to a rotor  for rotation therewith about an axis . As generally known in the art the housing  of the homopolar motor  has a radially outer annular flux shield section  and axial end walls  enclosing annular magnet coil assemblies  positioned therein to which DC power is supplied from magnet control circuitry  as diagrammed in  so as to establish magnetic fields for imparting rotation to the rotor . The magnet coil assemblies  are fixedly supported within the housing  on axially spaced annular stator bases  in surrounding relation to metal fiber brushes . Spring devices  of serpentine shape as disclosed in the aforementioned Lynch et al patent, have axial ends that are gold-plated and positioned within an annular holder . As also diagrammed in , an electric wire connection  extends from the holder  to motor control circuitry  as generally known in the art.","Pursuant to the present invention, each of the spring devices  at one axial end thereof as shown in  is provided with a hard-solder joint  for attachment thereof to an annular electrically conductive interlocking ring assembly . Each of the brushes  is attached to one side of the interlocking ring assembly  opposite the spring device  by soft-solder joints . The spring devices  and the brushes  are shown attached to the ring assembly  in . After the ring assembly  is assembled with the spring devices  and the brushes  soldered thereto, it is positioned inside the housing  within an annular cavity  enclosed by the holder  about the rotor  as shown in .","As shown in , the brush interlocking ring assembly  is formed by a plurality (such as eight) of ring sections  interconnected by shorter overlapping attachment links . Each of the links  as shown in  is provided with a pair of threaded holes  threadedly receiving screws  having their slotted heads exposed on the same side of the ring assembly  with the brushes  which are positioned on the ring sections  and attached thereto by the solder joints . The ring sections  are held assembled with the links  by the screws  extending through holes  formed in the ring sections  in alignment with the link screw holes . As shown in , spring attachment leaves  are attached by screws  to an axial end  of the annular holder  for holding the spring devices  clamped to the holder . The spring devices  thereby exert pressure on the brushes  to hold them in sliding contact with an annular surface  on the rotor , axially spaced from the end  of the holder . Each of the spring devices  as shown in ,  and  is formed from a pair of inner and outer braids  and . At the side of the spring device  attached to the brush holding ring section  by the solder joint , it is stiffened. At the other side of the spring device , it is held flattened under pressure in surface contact with the fixed end  of the base holder .","As shown in  each of the axial ends  of the housing  is spaced from the base holder end  by an annular insulator . Also, a radially inner portion of the holder end  is axially spaced at location  within the annular cavity  from the rotor shaft .","It will be apparent from the foregoing description that the ring sections  and the links  of the interlocking ring assembly  may be dissembled by withdrawal of the link screws  for separate removal of the ring sections  with the attachment links  from the motor housing . For assembly of the link assembly  with the spring devices  and the brushes , the spring devices  are attached by the hard solder joints  to one of the surfaces of each of the ring sections  before attachment of the brushes  to the opposite surfaces thereof by use of the soft-solder joints  with a lower melting point, in order to avoid melting of the previously applied spring solder joints . The ring sections  and the attachments links  may then be assembled and attached through the spring leaves  as shown in  to the end  of the stator base holder  for installation within the motor , establishing low loss fixed current paths from the motor control circuitry  to the brush assemblies , with pressure being exerted by means of the spring devices  on the brushes  maintaining them in sliding contact with the rotor surface .","As a result of the foregoing described arrangement, the interlocking ring assembly  provides a stable mounting structure for the spring devices  and the brushes  in sliding contact with the rotor , while allowing for facilitated individual removals thereof. Although eight of the brushes  are shown in , any other number of the metal fiber brushes  may be accommodated pursuant to the present invention. Other types of brushes may also be accommodated, such as foil brushes, braid brushes, micro-fiber brushes, ring brushes, solid brushes, liquid metal brushes and liquid-fiber hybrid brushes. The assembly of the brushes  and the conductive spring devices  on the interlocking ring assembly  could also be used in commutating motors, other than the non-commutating slip ring type of motor  as hereinbefore described.","Other alternative embodiments of the present invention may be resorted to, within the scope of the appended claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING","p":["A more complete appreciation of the invention and many of its attendant advantages will be readily appreciated as the same becomes better understood by reference to the following detailed description when considered in connection with the accompanying drawing wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["2","2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"],"b":["3","3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 2"],"b":["4","4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 4"],"b":["5","5"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIGS. 2\u20135"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
