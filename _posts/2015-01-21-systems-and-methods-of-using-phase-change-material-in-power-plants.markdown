{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATION DATA","STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT(S)","EXAMPLE 1"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/929,747, filed on Jan. 21, 2014, the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference.","This invention was made with government support under Grant No. 1357918 by the National Science Foundation. The government has certain rights in the invention.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention is directed to the field of power plants. In particular, the present invention is directed to systems and methods for cooling a power plant using phase change materials.","The cooling towers for power plants generally consume a large amount of water. For example, in the year 2000, coal and gas power plants in the eight-state Interior West region of the United States withdrew over 650 million gallons of water per day, totaling over 728,000 acre-feet each year. That is enough water for the annual needs of at least 3.64 million people. Water in the West of the United States is becoming increasingly valuable especially in light of widespread drought conditions.","2. Description of Related Technology","Although agriculture is the largest water user in most of the United States, power production can have a large impact on the water supply and water quality in specific locations, especially in river basins that are already over-extended with other water uses. Large amounts of research have been devoted to design a cooling tower with a higher cooling efficiency and to reduce water consumption. For example, U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2010\/0018237 discloses a low water consumption cooling tower for gasification plants. The cooling tower comprises a wet section having a plurality of wet section fans and a dry section having a plurality of dry section fans. The wet section fans are adjustable to operate at different rates, depending upon ambient conditions surrounding the cooling tower. The wet section may comprise at least one shutter door. In operation, the wet section fans typically operate at an increased rate during a summer peak price period and at a reduced rate during a winter peak price period and an off-peak price period. The dry section fans operate at the increased rate all year. This method allows for less evaporative cooling and more latent cooling thereby reducing water consumption.","U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2010\/0154406 discloses a cooling tower system that exhibits increased energy efficiency. The cooling tower system includes a cooling tower unit, an expansion engine and a power operated component such as a fan or pump. The process fluid is first used to heat a working fluid for an expansion engine before being sent to the cooling tower for cooling. Power generated by the expansion engine is utilized to operate a component of the cooling tower such as a fan or a pump. The cooling tower is also utilized to provide cooling to condense the working fluid from vapor to liquid. The cooling tower removes waste heat from the process fluid.","U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2013\/0000867 discloses a hybrid cooling system for condensing an exhaust stream of a steam turbine. The cooling system comprises a dry cooling circuit, a dry air-cooled unit performing heat dissipation to cooling water flowing therein, and a wet cooling circuit and a wet cooled unit performing heat dissipation to the cooling water flowing therein. The cooling water flowing in the dry cooling circuit is separated from the cooling water flowing in the wet cooling circuit, and the dry and wet cooling circuits are connected to a common condenser. The hybrid cooling system reduces the evaporation and deposition losses of the wet cooling system, thereby reducing water consumption.","EP 2 498 037 A2 discloses a hybrid fan cooling tower apparatus that extends along a vertical axis. The cooling tower includes a first housing structure having an inlet and a first outlet located at a first position along the vertical axis, wherein the housing structure includes a base and opposing side walls that extend along the vertical axis away from the base. The tower also includes a heat exchanger disposed in the housing structure. The heat exchanger is positioned adjacent the first outlet and extends at least partially across the first outlet. The hybrid tower employs an air current generator positioned in a plane normal to the vertical axis and oriented to direct an air stream toward the base and through the heat exchanger and the first outlet.","Even with these improved cooling tower designs from the prior art, water consumption is still a major disadvantage for power plants throughout the world. The reliance on water places constraints on the location of power plants, which is currently limited to areas near a large body of water. Unfortunately, these areas are also densely populated, creating safety and pollution concerns. A cooling tower that reduces or eliminates water consumption will enable building of power plants in remote areas with little water available which are poorly suited for human living and agriculture.","An aspect of the invention may be a cooling system for cooling a fluid, comprising: a phase change material container housing at least one phase change material; at least one conduit for transporting said fluid passing through said phase change material; an air flow chamber; a device for generating an air flow through the air flow chamber; an air flow outlet fluidly connected to said air flow chamber for removing heated air from said cooling system; and a phase change material flow system for circulating phase change material from said phase change material container via said air flow chamber and back to said phase change material container.","Another aspect of the invention may be a method for operating a cooling system for cooling a fluid, comprising steps of: transferring heat from the fluid to a phase change material to melt at least some of the phase change material to provide liquid phase change material; spraying droplets containing said liquid phase change material into circulating air for cooling and solidifying at least some of the liquid phase change material to provide solid phase change material by heating said air to provide heated air; recycling the solid phase change material to the transferring step; and removing the heated air from the cooling system","Still yet another aspect of the invention may be a cooling system for cooling a fluid, comprising a heat exchanger including an encapsulated phase change material, wherein heat is transferred from the fluid to an encapsulated phase change material to melt at least some of the phase change material therein.","For illustrative purposes, the principles of the present disclosure are described by referencing various exemplary embodiments.

The cooling system  has a PCM flow system , which includes a PCM container  housing at least one PCM . The PCM container  has at least one conduit  located therein for transporting fluid  through the PCM  located within the PCM container . The fluid  may be any fluid typically used for cooling, such as water.","An air flow chamber  is located above the PCM container  within the cooling system . The air flow chamber  is provided with an air flow device  for generating air flow through the air flow chamber  and an outlet  for removing heated air from the cooling system . The air flow device  in the embodiment shown in  is large fan-type object with rotating blades. However, other mechanisms may be used as the air flow device  in order to create the air flow. ","The PCM system  comprises an outlet  located at a lower portion of the PCM container , at least one PCM spray nozzle  for spraying liquid-containing PCM droplets  into the air flow chamber , and a pump  in fluid communication with the PCM spray nozzle  and outlet  of the PCM container . The pump  moves the liquid-containing PCM from the outlet  to the PCM spray nozzle  and the PCM spray nozzle  sprays the liquid-containing PCM  into the air flow chamber . The PCM outlet  may be located at a lower portion of the phase change material container , where the phase change material  contains liquid phase change material . In an exemplary embodiment, the PCM outlet  is at or near the bottom of the phase change material container . However, the liquid PCM  may also be pumped to an elevated position in the air flow chamber  below the air flow device  and sprayed downwardly into the PCM container .","For certain implementations, the PCM , may be a PCM that can be a mixture of two or more materials. By selecting two or more different materials and forming a mixture, a temperature stabilizing range can be adjusted for any desired application. The resulting mixture can exhibit two or more different phase transition temperatures or a single modified phase transition temperature when encapsulated in the coated articles described herein.","Phase change materials may be broadly divided into organic phase change materials and inorganic phase change materials. Organic phase change materials, include paraffinic hydrocarbons (CH) and fatty acids (CH(CH)COOH). Other organic phase change materials include fatty alcohols, glycols, ethers, amides, fatty acid esters, linear hydrocarbons, branched hydrocarbons, cyclic hydrocarbons, halogenated hydrocarbons and combinations thereof. Alkanes (often referred to as paraffins), esters and alcohols are particularly preferred. Alkanes are preferably substantially n-alkanes that are most often commercially available as mixtures of substances of different chain lengths, with the major component, which can be determined by gas chromatography, having 10-50, or usually between 12 and 32 carbon atoms. Examples of suitable major components of alkane organic phase change materials include n-octacosane, n-docosane, n-eicosane, n-octadecane, n-heptadecane, n-hexadecane, n-pentadecane and n-tetradecane.","Suitable esters for use as organic phase change materials may comprise one or more C-Calkyl esters of C-Cfatty acids, particularly methyl esters where the major component is methyl behenate, methyl arachidate, methyl stearate, methyl palmitate, methyl myristate or methyl laurate. Suitable alcohols for use as organic phase change materials include one or more alcohols where the major component is, for example, n-decanol, n-dodecanol, n-tetradecanol, n-hexadecanol, and n-octadecanol.","Inorganic phase change materials include salt hydrates (MHO), as well as inorganic salts such as aluminum phosphate, ammonium carbonate, ammonium chloride, cesium carbonate, cesium sulfate, calcium citrate, calcium carbonate, calcium chloride, calcium hydroxide, calcium oxide, calcium phosphate, calcium saccharate, calcium sulfate, cerium phosphate, chromic chloride, iron phosphate, lithium carbonate, lithium sulfate, magnesium chloride, magnesium sulfate, manganese chloride, manganese nitrate, manganese sulfate, potassium acetate, potassium carbonate, potassium chloride, potassium hydroxide, potassium phosphate, rubidium carbonate, rubidium sulfate, disodium tetraborate, sodium acetate, sodium bicarbonate, sodium bisulfate, sodium borate, sodium carbonate, sodium citrate, sodium chloride, sodium hydroxide, sodium nitrate, sodium percarbonate, sodium persulfate, sodium phosphate, sodium propionate, sodium selenite, sodium silicate, sodium sulfate, sodium tellurate, sodium tetraborate, sodium thiosulfate, strontium hydrophosphate, zinc acetate, zinc chloride, eutectic of LiCOand NaCO, and combinations thereof.","Phase change materials can undergo a solid-liquid\/liquid-solid phase transition at phase changing temperatures. A person skilled in the art may select the proper phase change material depending on the temperature of the fluid  entering and exiting the PCM container . At the temperature of the fluid  entering the PCM container , the phase change material should be essentially a liquid. In addition, at the temperature of the fluid  exiting the phase change material container , the phase change material should also be liquid.","Referring to , in some embodiments, the PCM  in the PCM container  may be a slurry of solid particles  and liquid PCM . The provision of a slurry of phase change material  in the PCM container  offers some advantages by promoting heat transfer through the phase change material  and by stabilizing the temperature of the slurry. The lower portion of the phase change material  in the PCM container  will contain liquid PCM .","Referring back to , in some embodiments, the phase change temperature of the PCM  is from about 0\u00b0 C. to about 100\u00b0 C. below the temperature of the fluid  entering into the inlet  and passing through the PCM container  via the conduit . In some embodiments, the phase change temperature of the PCM  is from about 5\u00b0 C. to about 80\u00b0 C. below the temperature of the fluid  passing into the inlet  and passing through the phase change material container  via conduit . In some embodiments, the phase change temperature of the PCM  is from about 10\u00b0 C. to about 60\u00b0 C. below the temperature of the fluid  passing into the inlet  and through the phase change material container  via conduit .","In some embodiments, the fluid  is steam which is passed through the conduit  to be condensed. The steam enters the conduit  through the fluid inlet  and exits as a liquid (such as water) through the fluid outlet . In an exemplary embodiment, the steam condensation temperature is in the range of from about 20\u00b0 C. to about 70\u00b0 C., or from about 25\u00b0 C. to about 60\u00b0 C., or from about 30\u00b0 C. to about 55\u00b0 C., or from about 30\u00b0 C. to about 50\u00b0 C., or from about 35\u00b0 C. to about 45\u00b0 C. It has been found that at a fluid condensation temperature of about 40\u00b0 C. using a phase change material, net power production can be increased, with a gain of up to 10%, in comparison with air cooled condensers.","In an another exemplary embodiment, the phase change temperature of the PCM  is in the range of from about 10\u00b0 C. to about 60\u00b0 C., or from about 15\u00b0 C. to about 50\u00b0 C., or from about 20\u00b0 C. to about 45\u00b0 C., or from about 20\u00b0 C. to about 40\u00b0 C., or from about 25\u00b0 C. to about 35\u00b0 C.","Generally, the enthalpy of phase change for the phase change of the PCM  is high. Suitable organic phase change materials  exhibit a high enthalpy of phase change, typically greater than 50 J\/g, usually at least 90 J\/g, preferably at least 100 J\/g, more preferably greater than 120 J\/g, even more preferably greater than 150 J\/g and most preferably greater than 200 J\/g when determined by Differential Scanning calorimetry (DSC) as measured using a Perkin Elmer DSC1 at a scan speed of 5\u00b0 C.\/minute. This high enthalpy of phase change allows a relatively large amount of heat transfer from the fluid to the PCM  and from the PCM droplets  to the air, based on the weight of the PCM , and allows use of less material to transfer the heat rendering the cooling system  more energy efficient.","In some embodiments, one or more types of thermal conductivity enhancers, including metal meshes, graphite foams, and nano-sized additives may be added to the PCM  to facilitate heat transfer to or from the PCM . Metal meshes have mesh holes for enhancing thermal conductivity. The meshes have a structure in which fibers of the mesh are interwoven, such as a film or sheet provided with through holes. More details about metal meshes can be found in, for example, EP 2 612 755 A1, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","Graphite foams offer an integrated network for heat flow. In one embodiment, graphite foams are embedded between the conduits  to enhance thermal conductivity in the PCM container . Such graphite foams may add drag to phase change material slurries, which may be compensated by increasing the pumping power of the pump . The graphite foams are described in, for example, WO 2012\/011934 A1, which is incorporated herein by reference.","In another embodiment, high thermal conductivity nano-sized additives may be added to the PCM . Some examples of nano-sized additives include carbon nanotubes, carbon\/graphite nanofibers, and exfoliated graphene nanoplatelets (xGnP). In an exemplary embodiment, xGnP at 10 wt % loading in a phase change material, such as paraffin, can provide up to a 10-fold increase thermal conductivity. However, the viscosity of the paraffin\/xGnP composite increases as the loading, f, of the xGnP, increases, thereby placing an effective upper limit on the amount of xGnP that can be incorporated into the phase change material .","Suitable nano-sized additives include carbon black, other carbon-based materials, silicon carbide, carbon nanotubes (commercially available from Carbon Nanotechnologies, Inc.) and nano fibers (commercially available from Applied Sciences, Inc. of Ohio). In some embodiments, the nano-sized additives have a loading of from about 2 wt. % to about 15 wt. % of the total weight of the phase change material\/nano-sized additive composition, or from about 3 wt. % to about 12 wt. %, or from about 3 wt. % to about 10 wt. % or from about 4 wt. % to about 8 wt. % or from about 5 wt. % to about 7 wt. % of the total weight of the phase change material\/nano-sized additive composition.","Referring to , the PCM container  houses PCM . The top surface of the PCM  held in the PCM container  receives solid phase change material  from the air flow chamber . During operation, the lower portion of the PCM  held in the PCM container  contains liquid PCM . In some embodiments, the combination of the solid PCM  and the liquid PCM  forms a slurry of phase change material  in the PCM container . As shown in , at least one conduit  runs through the PCM container , and as shown in  it is contemplated that a plurality of conduits  run through the PCM container . The fluid  to be cooled enters the conduit  through a fluid inlet  and the cooled fluid  exits from the conduit  through fluid outlet . As the fluid  passes through the conduit  in the PCM container , heat is transferred from the fluid  through the wall(s) of the conduit  to the PCM . As a result of the transfer of this heat, solid phase change material  is melted whereby a large amount of heat is absorbed as a result of the high enthalpy of phase transition of the PCM.","Referring to , in some embodiments, a plurality of conduits  pass through PCM container  to provide a greater surface area for heat transfer from the fluid to the PCM  held within the PCM container . The conduits  pass through the PCM  in the PCM container . Solid PCM  may be provided to the top surface of the PCM  in the PCM container , though it is also possible to deliver the solid PCM  to other locations within the phase change material  in PCM container . Thus, in operation, the phase change material  in the PCM container  typically contains a mixture of solid PCM  and liquid PCM  which may form a slurry. As a result of the heat transfer from the fluid  to the PCM , the solid PCM  in the PCM container  undergoes a phase change to become liquid PCM .","Referring to , at the lower portion of the PCM container , the PCM  includes liquid PCM . Liquid-containing phase change material  at the lower portion of the PCM container  exits through an outlet  to enter the phase change material flow system . Thus, the PCM  in the PCM container  undergoes a constant vertical flow from the top of the PCM container  to the bottom of the PCM container  and then is returned to the PCM container  by the phase change material flow system . In the process of moving through the PCM container , the PCM  absorbs heat from the fluid in the at least one conduit  and solid PCM  undergoes the solid-liquid phase change to form liquid phase change material .","In some embodiments, the solid PCM  may become molten at from about 30% to about 70% of the distance from the top surface of the PCM  to the bottom of the PCM container , or from about 40% to about 60%, or from about 45% to about 55% of the distance from the top surface of the PCM  to the bottom of the PCM container .","In some embodiments, each conduit  has a diameter of from about 0.025 m to about 0.1 m, or from about 0.035 m to about 0.09 m, or from about 0.045 m to about 0.08 m, or from about 0.055 m to about 0.07 m. The distance between the conduits  may be from about 0.01 m to about 0.03 m, or from about 0.015 m to about 0.025 m.","Referring to , the flow and thermal behavior of slurries comprising solid PCM  of a defined size suspended in liquid PCM  is explained.  shows a schematic representation of one embodiment of vertical flow from the top to the bottom of the PCM container  that passes a phase change material slurry over the assembly of conduits . The overall net flow of PCM  towards the bottom of the PCM container  may be at a volume flux in a range of from about 1 mm\/s to about 20 mm\/s, or from about 2 mm\/s to about 15 mm\/s, or from about 2 mm\/s to about 12 mm\/s, or from about 3 mm\/s to about 10 mm\/s. The denser solid PCM  may settle through the liquid PCM  due to buoyancy effects as the slurry flows towards the bottom of the PCM container .","In some embodiments, the thermofluidic phenomena in the PCM container  may be characterized by dimensionless parameters as listed in Table 1 that may be used to correlate fluid flow and heat transfer. Table 1 shows value ranges for the dimensionless control variables. In Table 1, U is the free stream volume flux entering the cylinder array, Vand Vare the volumes of the solid particles and the total slurry, and \u03b1 is the thermal diffusivity of the liquid phase PCM.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0077","num":"0076"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Dimensionless Control Variables"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"70pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Parameter","Equation","Range"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"Reynolds number","Re = UD\/v","\u2003\u20031-1200"]},{"entry":[{},"Prandtl number","Pr = v\/\u03b1","\u2003\u20021-100"]},{"entry":[{},"PCM volume fraction","\u03c6 = V\/V","0.01-0.6"]},{"entry":[{},"Diameter ratio","\u03b4 = d\/D","0.01-0.4"]},{"entry":[{},"Spacing ratio","\u03c3 = S\/D","0.1-2\u2009"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}}},"These dimensionless control parameters are correlated to pressure coefficient (C) and Nusselt number (Nu) as:\n\n=2\u0394(,\u03c6,\u03b4,\u03c3)\n\n(,\u03c6,\u03b4,\u03c3)\n\n()]\n\nwhere \u03c1and kare the density and thermal conductivity of the liquid phase change material , and his the heat transfer coefficient of the phase change material slurry, Q is the total heat supplied by the fluid  entering the conduit , A is the total surface area of the conduits , and Tand Tare the average conduit surface temperature and the phase change material temperature before absorbing heat from the conduit , respectively. Tis the temperature of the PCM  exiting the PCM container , i.e. after heat absorption from the conduit .\n","Referring back to , the air flow chamber  is where the heat transfers from the liquid-containing phase change material droplets  to an air flow through the air flow chamber . The air flow chamber  has plurality of air inlets  for the cool air to enter the air flow chamber  and an air outlet  for the heated air to exit the air flow chamber . The air flow in the air flow chamber  may be from the bottom to the top of the air flow chamber  as shown. The air flow may be driven by an air flow device  in the air flow chamber . The air flow device  may be one or more fans or any other suitable conventional apparatus.","One or more phase change material spray nozzles  spray fine droplets  of liquid-containing phase change material into the air flow chamber .","Referring to , a droplet  of liquid-containing phase change material is exposed to the air flow in the air flow chamber . The PCM droplets  provide a large surface area for transferring heat from the PCM droplets  to the air. As the heat is being transferred from the PCM droplets  to the air flow, the surface  of the PCM droplets  starts solidifying. As more heat is transferred out of the PCM droplets , the PCM droplets  may completely solidify. In some embodiments, PCM droplets  may contain only liquid PCM  though in other embodiments, PCM droplets  can potentially be a slurry of a portion of solid PCM  in liquid PCM .","The air flow in the air flow chamber  is controlled such that the air flow is not strong enough to carry the PCM droplets  out of the air flow chamber  through the air outlet . At the exit of the phase change material spray nozzle , the PCM droplets  have a relatively high velocity to propel the PCM droplets  through the air flow in the air flow chamber . In this embodiment, due to the direction of spraying, the PCM droplets  gradually lose velocity as they travel through the air flow chamber  and become solidified. The air flow rate should be adjusted so as not to entrain the PCM droplets  and carry them out through air outlet . The PCM droplets  eventually fall back to the surface of the PCM  in the phase change material container  which, in this embodiment, is located below the air flow chamber .","The diameter of the PCM droplets  is in millimeters. If the size of the droplets  is too small, a large amount of phase change material will be lost from the cooling system  since small PCM droplets  will be carried out of the air flow chamber  by the air flow through the air outlet . If the size of the PCM droplets  is too large, then there may not be sufficient surface area for transferring heat from the PCM droplets  to the air flow in the air flow chamber . As a result, the PCM droplets  may not be sufficiently solidified while passing through the air flow. Thus, if the diameter of the PCM droplets  is too large, the heat rejection from the PCM droplets  to the air may not be complete and this will result in a reduction in the efficiency of the cooling system .","In some embodiments, the mean diameter of the PCM droplets  is from about 0.5 mm to about 20 mm, or from about 1 mm to about 15 mm, or from about 1 mm to about 12 mm, or from about 2 mm to about 10 mm. The phase change material spray nozzles  are designed to generate phase change material droplets  with a narrow size distribution of, for example, \u00b12 mm, more preferably, \u00b11 mm and, most preferably, \u00b10.1 mm.","The phase change material spray nozzle  injects phase change material droplets  into the air flow chamber . While the phase change material droplets  travel through the air flow in the air flow chamber , they lose heat to the air flow and become solidified. The travel distance for the phase change material droplets  before they solidify depends on the size of phase change material droplets  and air flow rate in the air flow chamber . When the size of the phase change material droplets  increases, the phase change material droplets  take longer to solidify, thus requiring a larger and taller air flow chamber . Air flow rate increases will enhance heat transfer from the phase change material droplets  to the air flow, thus accelerating solidification of the phase change material droplets  and may reduce the size and height of the air flow chamber . Therefore, smaller phase change material droplets  and a higher air flow rate will accelerate solidification of the phase change material droplets  as they travel through the air flow, thus reducing the residence time required for the phase change material droplets  to solidify in the air flow chamber .","The one or more phase change material spray nozzles  spray phase change material droplets  into the air flow chamber . The phase change material spray nozzles  are designed to provide droplets  of a desired size and may atomize the liquid-containing phase change material  pumped from the lower portion of the phase change material container . The phase change material spray nozzles  spray the phase change material droplets  with a velocity such that the phase change material droplets  can travel through the air flow for sufficient time for transferring heat to the air flow and at least partially or completely solidifying the phase change material droplets , before the phase change material droplets  are returned to the phase change material container . In preferred embodiments, the phase change material droplets , as they lose velocity and heat, become solidified and fall back to the top surface of the phase change material  in the phase change material container .","In a preferred embodiment, droplets  of phase change material will be completely solidified upon passage through air chamber  prior to being returned to phase change material container . Thus, it is desirable to ensure that the residence time of the phase change material droplets  in the air chamber  is sufficient to completely solidify the liquid phase change material  in droplets . In the embodiment shown in , the phase change material droplets  are sprayed in a generally upward direction to maximize contact time with the air flow by requiring that the droplets  travel both upwardly in air chamber  and then back downwardly in air chamber  thereby providing additional time to solidify the phase change material . This embodiment allows use of a smaller air chamber  and thus a smaller cooling system . Alternatively, the droplets  can be sprayed from the top or another location of air chamber  but this may require enlargement of air chamber  to ensure sufficient residence time of droplets  in air chamber  for the desired complete solidification of liquid phase change material  to occur. Typically, the phase change material droplets  will be sprayed at an angle of 60-120\u00b0 relative to the upper surface of the phase change material  in the phase change material container , or from 70-110\u00b0 or from 80-100\u00b0 or at about 90\u00b0.","It is also desirable to ensure that the solid phase change material  is returned to the phase change material container  in a manner which distributes as evenly as possible over the entire area of the phase change material  in phase change material container . This can be accomplished, for example, by directing the spraying of phase change material droplets  into air chamber  in a manner which ensures that the droplets  are relatively evenly distributed over the upper surface of the phase change material  in the phase change material container  when the solid phase change material  returns to the phase change material container . An exemplary spray pattern is shown in .","In some embodiments, the air flow rate in the air flow chamber  is from about 10,000 kg\/s to about 130,000 kg\/s, or from about 20,000 kg\/s to about 120,000 kg\/s, or from about 30,000 kg\/s to about 100,000 kg\/s, or from about 40,000 kg\/s to about 90,000 kg\/s, or from about 50,000 kg\/s to about 80,000 kg\/s. In some embodiments, the air velocity in the air flow chamber  may be from about 4 m\/s to about 14 m\/s, or from about 5 m\/s to about 13 m\/s, or from about 6 m\/s to about 12 m\/s, or from about 7 m\/s to about 11 m\/s, or from about 8 m\/s to about 10 m\/s.","The size of phase change material droplets  is correlated with the air flow speed in the air flow chamber . A faster air flow rate tends to carry phase change material droplets  out of the air flow chamber  more easily. The faster air flow rate also enhances heat transfer from the phase change material droplets  to the air flow. Thus, the size of phase change material droplets  should be increased when a faster air flow rate is used in the air flow chamber . Conversely, a slower air flow rate tends to not carry phase change material droplets  out of the air flow chamber . However, a slower air flow rate is less efficient for heat transfer from the phase change material droplets  to the air flow. Thus, a slower air flow rate requires smaller phase change material droplets  to provide more surface area for the heat transfer. A slower air flow rate also requires less power input into the air flow generation device . The air flow velocity must be sufficiently high to generate a sufficient heat transfer coefficient to remove the required amount of heat.","In another aspect, the present invention provides a method as shown in  for operating a cooling system  for cooling a fluid. The method includes the steps of transferring heat from the fluid to a phase change material  to melt at least some solid phase change material  to provide liquid phase change material ; spraying droplets  of liquid-containing phase change material  into circulating air for cooling and solidifying at least some of the liquid phase change material  to provide solid phase change material  by heating said air to provide heated air; recycling the solid phase change material  to the transferring step; and removing the heated air from the cooling system .","In the method, shown in , in supplying step , a fluid  to be cooled is supplied to at least one conduit  and passed through a phase change material container  for transferring heat from the fluid in the conduit  to the phase change material  in the phase change material container . In liquid circulating step , liquid-containing phase change material  is circulated from the phase change material container  to at least one phase change material spraying nozzle  for spraying liquid-containing phase change material droplets  into an air flow chamber . In air circulating step , air is circulated through the air flow chamber  for cooling the phase change material droplets , whereby the cooled phase change material droplets  become solidified and solid phase change material  is returned to the phase change material  located in the phase change material container .","The fluid to be cooled may be from any source of fluid that requires cooling such as fluid from a boiler that has been heated in a power plant. The fluid needs to be cooled and then cycled back to the boiler of the power plant. In supplying step , the fluid is supplied to the at least one conduit  passing through the phase change material container , where the at least one conduit  is bathed in a body of phase change material  which may be in the form of a slurry of solid phase change material  in liquid phase change material . The heat from the fluid in the conduit  is transferred through the wall of the conduit  to the phase change material  in the phase change material container . The absorption of heat from the conduit  causes a solid to liquid phase transition of the solid phase change material  to form liquid phase change material . After heat is transferred out of the fluid to the phase change material , the fluid is cooled and exits the conduit  through fluid outlet .","The phase change material container  has liquid phase change material  at its lower portion. A pump  pumps liquid-containing phase change material  through the outlet  from the phase change material container  to the at least one phase change material spray nozzle  through conduit .","The liquid-containing phase change material  in the conduit  may have a flow rate of from about 1,000 kg\/s to about 5,500 kg\/s, or from about 2,000 kg\/s to about 4,500 kg\/s, or from about 2,500 kg\/s to about 4,000 kg\/s, or from about 3,000 kg\/s to about 4,000 kg\/s, or from about 3,300 kg\/s to about 3,800 kg\/s.","The nozzle  sprays droplets  of the liquid-containing phase change material  of a desired size and\/or size distribution, which travel through the air flow chamber  as shown, for example, in .","The air flow in the air flow chamber  is generated by an air flow device . The air flow device  may be one or more fans or any other suitable device for generating an air flow. The air flow device  controls the air flow rate in the air flow chamber . The air flow rate may be in the range of from about 10,000 kg\/s to about 130,000 kg\/s, or from about 20,000 kg\/s to about 120,000 kg\/s, or from about 30,000 kg\/s to about 100,000 kg\/s, or from about 40,000 kg\/s to about 90,000 kg\/s, or from about 50,000 kg\/s to about 80,000 kg\/s.","In some embodiments, the air velocity in the air flow chamber  may be from about 4 m\/s to about 14 m\/s, or from about 5 m\/s to about 13 m\/s, or from about 6 m\/s to about 12 m\/s, or from about 7 m\/s to about 11 m\/s, or from about 8 m\/s to about 10 m\/s.","The air flow is generated by drawing cool air into the air flow chamber  using, for example, a device such as an air flow device . The circulating air makes contact with the phase change material droplets , as shown in . Heat is transferred from the phase change material droplets  to the air flow, which warms up the air flow. After losing heat, the phase change material droplets  become solidified and fall back into the phase change material container .","A cooling tower based on the parameters listed in Table 2 was simulated.

The spray-freezing distance for the PCM droplets in relation to the size (diameter) of the phase change material droplet is shown in . The spray-freezing distance is the distance that the PCM droplet must travel before the PCM droplet solidifies. It is observed that an increase of the size of the phase change material droplet will require a larger spray-freezing distance, thus a larger and\/or taller air flow chamber. The computer simulated model shows three different air flow chambers with heights of 65 m, 75 m, and 85 m. Note that, in contrast to finned-tube ACCs, the steam condensation and air-cooling are decoupled in the present invention, which allows the steam tubes be optimized independently of the air flow chamber to reduce cost and pressure drop.","Encapsulated Phase Change Materials","The spray-freezing of PCMs is able to help in the cooling of power plants, but there is a chance of contamination caused by drift when spray-freezing PCMs. Encapsulating the PCMs can help avoid spray nozzle clogging due to dust and other debris.","A solution employing encapsulated PCMs (EPCMs) may involve using a modular based EPCM lattice. This will provide high h, which involves no blow away or the use of a nozzle. The EPCM lattices can be fabricated using low cost fabrication methods, such as via the use of molds and 3D-printing. Different modules may have different Tfor the EPCMs. It is further possible to employ holographic polymerized photonic crystals as the EPCM encapsulant.","A diagram of a power plant system  that may employ the air-cooled EPCM heat exchanger is shown in .

The cooling fluid  may be, for example, water, from the condenser . The cooling fluid  enters the cooling tower  via the conduit .

The EPCM modules  are circulated within the airflow chamber  using the cable  and ultimately leave the airflow chamber  via the EPCM outlet . The EPCM inlet  and the EPCM outlet  are relatively small openings, which are about 1% larger than the size of the PCM structure thereby allowing for use of a flexible material e.g. a rubber or plastic film to form a seal around the EPCM inlet  and the EPCM outlet  that can be used to limit evaporative loss via the EPCM inlet  and EPCM outlet  to about 0.0% to 0.0042%.","EPCM modules  are uniformly distributed in the cooling tower and may be moved using the cable  at a suitable speed such as about 1 m\/s.

Compared to an existing fin-tubed air-cooled condenser (ACC), the PCM recirculating mesh system  reduces the dry-cooling initial temperature difference (ITD) required for operation of the system to 20\u00b0 C., which makes the steam condensation temperature comparable to that of a wet cooling tower, without dissipating water to the environment. Furthermore, the low ITD dramatically improves the power production efficiency compared to current ACCs that have an ITD>35\u00b0 C. Power production efficiency (eta) can be calculated by eta=1\u2212TL\/TH, where TL is the condenser temperature which is decreased relative to a typical ACC by fixing the PCM melt temperature. Also, the PCM recirculating mesh system  simultaneously increases both the heat transfer coefficient and heat transfer area, relative to those of complex finned tubes in current ACCs by significantly increasing the surface to area ratio. The PCM recirculating mesh system  has an air-side h value that is about four times the air-side h value of complex finned tubes in current ACCs. The PCM recirculating mesh system  also reduces the surface area and operational cost of primary steam by using indirect dry cooling to decouple steam condensation and heat rejection. Steam pathways can thus be optimized independently for reduced pressure drop and cost. Overall, the PCM recirculating mesh system  also reduces the capital cost and sub-freezing concerns relative to current ACC.","Compared to a spray-freezing cooling tower, the proposed PCM recirculating mesh system  has no particulate emissions because the encapsulated PCMs that are connected together into strong structures prevents contamination due drift loss. Furthermore, there is no need for additional air-side equipment when employing the present invention, since the absence of spray nozzles obviates potential nozzle clogging due to dust\/debris. Also, the use of modular-based mesh  allows for different melting temperature PCMs to be substituted at different times to allow customization of the system to address different climatic conditions.","PCM Carousel",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0158","num":"0157"},"figref":["FIG. 28","FIG. 28","FIG. 28"],"b":["400","400","400","410","410","410","410","411","410","411","425","410"]},"As the EPCM structure  rotates, ambient air is blown over the EPCM structure  in an airflow chamber .
