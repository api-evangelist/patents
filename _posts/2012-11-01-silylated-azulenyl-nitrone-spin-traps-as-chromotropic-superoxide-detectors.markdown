By far, the most commonly used probes include cyclic nitrones, hydroethidine, nitro blue tetrazolium, and other chemiluminescent and fluorescent species have received a criticism for various reasons.To overcome the existing problem associated with these probes, an effective approach, a selective, mechanism-based colorimetric detection of superoxide anion has been developed by using a novel silylated azulenyl nitrone spin trap. The synthesized nitrones were found to trap superoxide anion, and hence, can be the potential biomarkers for superoxide production. The synthesized spin traps could offer a highly convenient method compared to other available colorimetric detection methods. This research describes the design, synthesis, chemical properties, testing and potential use of new silylated azulenyl nitrone compounds.","Provided herein are compounds of formula (I) or (II), compositions of the same, and methods of using the same in trapping superoxide anion,",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0005","num":"0004"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"71.97mm","wi":"62.65mm","file":"US09156862-20151013-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sup":["1 ","2 ","6","3 ","4 ","5 ","6 "]},"Methods disclosed herein using the compounds of formula (I) or (II) can be diagnostic and\/or therapeutic.

Such compositions can be prepared in a manner well known in the pharmaceutical art and comprise at least one active compound. In preferred embodiments, the active compound is in purified form.\n\nGenerally, the compounds of this invention are administered in a pharmaceutically effective amount. The amount of the compound actually administered will typically be determined by a physician, in the light of the relevant circumstances, including the condition to be treated, the chosen route of administration, the actual compound administered, the age, weight, and response of the individual patient, the severity of the patient's symptoms, and the like.\n\nThe pharmaceutical compositions of this invention can be administered by a variety of routes including oral, rectal, transdermal, subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, and intranasal. Depending on the intended route of delivery, the compounds of this invention are preferably formulated as either injectable or oral compositions or as salves, as lotions or as patches all for transdermal administration.\n\nThe compositions for oral administration can take the form of bulk liquid solutions or suspensions, or bulk powders. More commonly, however, the compositions are presented in unit dosage forms to facilitate accurate dosing. The term \u201cunit dosage forms\u201d refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages for human subjects and other mammals, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active material calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect, in association with a suitable pharmaceutical excipient. Typical unit dosage forms include prefilled, premeasured ampoules or syringes of the liquid compositions or pills, tablets, capsules or the like in the case of solid compositions. In such compositions, the active agent is usually a minor component (from about 0.1 to about 50% by weight or preferably from about 1 to about 40% by weight) with the remainder being various vehicles or carriers and processing aids helpful for forming the desired dosing form.\n\nLiquid forms suitable for oral administration may include a suitable aqueous or nonaqueous vehicle with buffers, suspending and dispensing agents, colorants, flavors and the like. Solid forms may include, for example, any of the following ingredients, or compounds of a similar nature: a binder such as microcrystalline cellulose, gum tragacanth or gelatin; an excipient such as starch or lactose, a disintegrating agent such as alginic acid, Primogel, or corn starch; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate; a glidant such as colloidal silicon dioxide; a sweetening agent such as sucrose or saccharin; or a flavoring agent such as peppermint, methyl salicylate, or orange flavoring.\n\nInjectable compositions are typically based upon injectable sterile saline or phosphate-buffered saline or other injectable carriers known in the art. As before, the active compound in such compositions is typically a minor component, often being from about 0.05 to 10% by weight with the remainder being the injectable carrier and the like.\n\nTransdermal compositions are typically formulated as a topical ointment or cream containing the active ingredient(s), generally in an amount ranging from about 0.01 to about 20% by weight, preferably from about 0.1 to about 20% by weight, preferably from about 0.1 to about 10% by weight, and more preferably from about 0.5 to about 15% by weight. When formulated as a ointment, the active ingredients will typically be combined with either a paraffinic or a water-miscible ointment base. Alternatively, the active ingredients may be formulated in a cream with, for example an oil-in-water cream base. Such transdermal formulations are well-known in the art and generally include additional ingredients to enhance the dermal penetration of stability of the active ingredients or the formulation. All such known transdermal formulations and ingredients are included within the scope of this invention.\n\nThe compounds of this invention can also be administered by a transdermal device. Accordingly, transdermal administration can be accomplished using a patch either of the reservoir or porous membrane type or of a solid matrix variety.\n\nThe above-described components for orally administrable, injectable or topically administrable compositions are merely representative. Other materials as well as processing techniques and the like are set forth in Part 8 of Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 17th edition, 1985, Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa., which is incorporated herein by reference.\n\nThe compounds of this invention can also be administered in sustained release forms or from sustained release drug delivery systems. A description of representative sustained release materials can be found in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences.\n\nIn another embodiment, the pharmaceutical compositions can be in unit dose or unit of use forms or packages. As is known to those of skill in the art, a unit dose form or package is a convenient, prescription size, patient ready unit labeled for direct distribution by health care providers. A unit of use form contains a pharmaceutical composition in an amount necessary for a typical treatment interval and duration for a given indication.\n\nA unit dosage form contains a pharmaceutical composition in an amount necessary for administration of a single dose of the composition. The present invention provides unit dosage forms of pharmaceutical compositions in an amount for delivery of a dose of about 0.1 to 125 mg\/kg of the azulenyl nitrone to a subject. The subject can be, for example, a human subject with an average weight of about 80 kg. In certain embodiments, the present invention provides a unit dosage form that comprises about 10, 25, 50, 100, 500, 1000, 2000 or 2500 mg of the azulenyl nitrone. In certain embodiments, the unit dosage form consists essentially of these amounts of the azulenyl nitrone; in other words, the unit dosage form can additionally comprise other ingredients for administration of the azulenyl nitrone such as pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, excipient or diluent, a vial, syringe, or patch or other ingredients known to those of skill in the art for administering the azulenyl nitrone.\n\nTypical unit dosage forms include prefilled, premeasured ampoules or syringes of the injectable compositions or unit dose wrapped tablets or capsules in the case of solid, oral compositions. The unit dosage form can be, for example, a single use vial, a pre-filled syringe, a single transdermal patch and the like.\n\nAs is known to those of skill in the art, a unit of use form or package is a convenient, prescription size, patient ready unit labeled for direct distribution by health care providers. A unit of use form contains a pharmaceutical composition in an amount necessary for a typical treatment interval and duration for a given indication. The methods of the invention provide for a unit-of-use package of a pharmaceutical composition comprising, for example, an azulenyl nitrone in an amount sufficient to treat an average sized adult male or female with about 10, 25, 50, 100, 500, 1000, 2000 or 2500 mg orally or 10, 25, 50, 500, 1000, 2000 or 2500 mg subcutaneously three times weekly for one month. Thus a unit of use package as described above would have twelve (three times per week injections for four weeks) prefilled syringes each containing 10, 25, 50, 500, 1000, 2000 or 2500 mg of azulenyl nitrone pharmaceutical composition.\n\nThe pharmaceutical compositions can be labeled and have accompanying labeling to identify the composition contained therein and other information useful to health care providers and subjects in the treatment of the diseases and\/or disorders described above, including, but not limited to, instructions for use, dose, dosing interval, duration, indication, contraindications, warnings, precautions, handling and storage instructions and the like.\n\nRole of Free Radicals in Various Diseases\n","Oxidative stresses due to free radicals have been implicated in various pathological conditions. The involvement of free radicals in disease is triggered by various factors such as genetic, environmental and disturbance of metabolic systems. Free radicals produced in mitochondria are widely believed to be the major cause of manifestation of a pro-oxidative shift in the plasma thiol\/disulfide redox state which impairs glucose tolerance. These conditions are generally observed in cancerand diabetes.As in the other cases, the enhanced activity of NAD(P)H oxidase and xanthine-oxidase are the major cause of ROS generation derived from superoxide anion. These conditions are normally observed in chronic inflammationand ischemia\/reperfusion injury respectively.","An alteration of cellular thiol\/disulfide redox state as a result of oxidative stress has been found in many cancer cells. Damage to DNA, occurs due to free radical-induced permanent modification of genetic materials, thereby leading to cell mutagenesis and carcinogenesis. An increased level of DNA damage has also been found in tumors which suggests the involvement of oxidative stress in the etiology of cancer. If DNA is severely damaged, then affected cells are selectively eliminated by the process called apoptosis. Apoptosis, a normal biological process, is a programmed cell death that destroys the damaged cells that could otherwise cause a threat to the integrity of organisms by leading to many morphological changes.However, uncontrolled apoptosis can lead to the destruction of healthy cells.The consequences of DNA damage are arrest or induction of transcription, induction of signal transcription pathways, genomic instability, and replication error; all of them are associated with carcinogenesis.The formation of the DNA oxidation product, 8-oxo-7-hydro-29-deoxyguanosine (8-oxo-dG), has been studied most extensively as a potential biomarker of carcinogenesis because it is easily detectable. 8-oxo-dG was first detected in urine by Shigenaga et alTobacco smoking is one of the sources of carcinogenic reactive oxygen species.","Free radicals are also involved in diabetes mellitus.Hyperglycemia is the common characteristic of both type-1 diabetes mellitus (insulin-dependent) and type-2 diabetes mellitus (non-insulin-dependent). Hyperglycemia is the condition in which an excessive amount of glucose is circulated in the blood plasma. Increased glucose levels are shown to increase the production of free radicals from various sources. The major site of superoxide anion formation in diabetes is mitochondrial complex IIwhich is different from the sites mitochondrial complex I and the ubiquinone-complex III that generate superoxide anion under normal conditions. Glucose auto-oxidation has been shown to produce superoxide anion in diabetic patientsThe advanced glycation end (AGE) products are the result of glucose oxidation which interact with specific cell surface binding proteins with subsequent generation of ROS.The increased level of ROS may cause the development of diabetic complications such as accelerated atherosclerosisand other vascular pathologies.","Various inflammatory diseases are associated with the elevated production of ROS.Atherosclerosis is one of the chronic inflammatory diseases that is characterized by hardening and thickening of the arterial walls that develop in the inner coat.In the presence of hyperlipidemia, oxidative stress may activate the genes that induce an inflammatory response to the vascular endothelium. The injured endothelial cells then stimulate the recruitment of mononuclear cells into the arterial walls which bind oxidized low-density lipoprotein (LDL) resulting in abnormal macrophages, that subsequently undergo apoptosis. The massive apoptosis of macrophages causes the formation of atherosclerotic plaque.Moreover, experimental data shows that hypertension may cause an intensification of atherosclerosis.","A role for oxidative stress in hypertension has been supported by the study of an animal model by Vaziri et alvia in vivo glutathione depletion. Similarly, a potential causative role for oxidative stress is also found in patients with essential hypertension.The mechanism that seems to contribute to hypertension is increased generation of superoxide anion in the vessel wall followed by the formation of peroxinitrite anion,which in turn, increases vasoconstriction.In vivo studies in animals demonstrated that angiotensin II is the main factor that is involved in the oxidative stress that leads to a chronic high blood pressure.","It is suggested that oxidative stress is also involved in several neurodegenerative diseases. Among the other organs, brain and nervous tissue suffer more oxidative damages. The reason for this is the large amount of oxygen consumption in a relatively small tissue mass (brain) and a high content of oxidizable polyunsaturated fatty acids. Brain has a high iron contentthat can be released as ions during brain injury, and these ions are capable of catalyzing free radical reactions resulting in HO. formation which thereby accelerates lipid peroxidation and autoxidation of neurotransmitters.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by impairment of higher cognitive functions and extensive neuronal loss. Two pathological features found in AD patients are the accumulation of amyloid plagues (amyloid-\u03b2 peptide) in the brain and the presence of neurofibrillary tangles and neuropil threads.A progressive cerebral accumulation of amyloid-\u03b2 peptide is the major event in the development of Alzheimer's disease. This accumulation causes neurofibrillary damage in neurons, neurotransmitter defects and neuronal death. These phenomena are the major cause of loss of cognitive functions.The evidence of increased lipid peroxidation and decreased polyunsaturated fatty acids content, increased protein and DNA oxidation, increased formation of 4-hydroxynonenal (product of lipid peroxidaiton) in AD ventricular fluids, the presence of advanced glycation end products, malondialdehyde, nitrotyrosine, and peroxynitrite in neurofibrillary tangles supports the involvement of oxidative stress in the brains of Alzheimer's disease brain victims.The significant amount of lipid peroxidation has been implicated by the increased level of 4-hydroxynonenal in the postmortem cerebrospinal fluid of Alzheimer's disease patients.Individuals with Down's syndrome have been shown to develop Alzheimer's disease as they get older.Down's syndrome is a genetic disease due to the presence of three copies of chromosome 21 that leads to mental retardation. There is evidence of overexpression of Cu\/ZnSOD in Down's syndrome that may result in increased production of hydrogen peroxide.Overproduction of Cu\/ZnSOD in transfected cells appears to promote increased lipid peroxidation. ","Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by a problem in controlling movement that includes slow movement of foot and hand when they are at rest and muscle rigidity. PD is associated with a selective loss of neurons in a part of the midbrain called the substantia nigra.The cells of the substantia nigra produce dopamine, a neurotransmitter-chemical messenger between brain and nerve cells, which communicates with cells in another region of the brain. It is believed that oxidative stress is an initiator of dopaminergic cell degeneration which is also associated with the presence of Lewy bodies in the substantia nigra and elsewhere based on the postmortem.Lewy bodies are small spherical proteins which affect the brain's normal functions and interrupt the action of important chemical messengers.","Similarly, in Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), motor neurons are the main targets affected in the motor cortex, spinal cord and brain stemwhich leads to muscle tone impairment, respiratory failure, paralysis, and often death. Multiple mutations are associated with familial ALS. Studies show that 20% of familial ALS patients carry mutations in the Cu\/ZnSOD gene, suggesting the involvement of free radicals.One hypothesis concerning the etiology of ALS is that metals at the active sites of mutant Cu\/ZnSODs allow these enzymes to catalyse oxidation reactions via peroxynitrite-generated nitrating species.Several lines of transgenic mice overexpressing mutant Cu\/ZnSOD have shown to develop a motor neuron disease, whose pathology and mode of progression resemble familial ALS patients. Gurney, Becker et al. used azulenyl nitrone (AZN) to suggest oxidative stress in SOD mutant transgenic mice.Recently, Siddque's team discovered mutation in ubiquilin 2 gene in the brains and in the spinal cords of ALS victims.The mutant ubiquilin 2 gene causes the accumulation of damaged protein contributing several forms of ALS.","Other neurodegenerative diseases contributed to oxidative stress may include, Huntington's disease,multiple sclerosis,neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosesand Friedreich's ataxia.","Injury to heart, brain, lungs, intestine, liver, kidney and skeletal muscle resulting from ischemic\/reperfusion may present in a variety of clinical conditions such as organ transplantation, stroke, myocardial infractions, and many other situations.On the basis of hospital discharge records, 5 million patients (16.2%) were diagnosed with ischemic cardiovascular events and such events were the major cause of death (38.7%) in the United States.Occurrence of tissue damage is attributed to the large amount of ROS production during ischemia\/reperfusion.Under the ischemic condition (oxygen deprivation), xanthine dehydrogenase is converted into xanthine oxidase that utilizes oxygen, which in turn, depletes ATP leading to the accumulation of the purine catabolite hypoxanthine. Upon subsequent reperfusion (reoxygenation), xanthine oxidase uses the influx of oxygen to oxidize hypoxanthine into xanthine with rapid generation of superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide.Treatment with a synthetic SOD mimetic has been shown to attenuate tissue damage in a rat model of ischemia\/reperfusion injury.","Obstructive sleep apnea is a breathing disorder among adults, characterized by an abnormal pause in breathing during sleep.The resulting repeated hypoxia and reoxygenation is similar event to the conditions of ischemia\/reperfusion. Untreated and severely affected individuals often develop cardiovascular diseases such as coronary artery disease, arterial hypertension and cerebrovascular diseasethat are associated with increased mortality.The involvement of free radicals in obstructive sleep apnea, which could be the cause of the associated cardiovascular events, has been implicated by the detection of increased production of superoxide anion from polymorphonuclear neutrophils in affected patients after exposure to various stumuli.","Most of the free radical mediated diseases, such as neurodegenerative, cardiovascular and some common forms of cancer, increase with age. Aging is a process of progressive loss in the efficiency of physical and cognitive functions of an organism after the reproductive phase of life. The fact that free radicals cause deleterious damage to cells over time which results in aging was proposed by Harman et al.Several studies also support his theory by showing progressive generation of free radicals and almost exponential increases in accumulation of oxidatively damage proteins, lipids and DNAs during aging.Mitochondria are the primary sites of generation of oxidants during the aging process. Much of the oxidized DNAs, especially the nuclear DNA, are repaired by the cell but the mitochondrial DNA receives only low repair activity.Over time, the damaged mitochondrial DNA accumulates and slowly shuts down mitochondria causing cell to age and eventually die.","Methods of Treatment and Prevention","The present azulenyl nitrones are used as therapeutic agents for the treatment of conditions in mammals.

A silyl substituent, a non-polar, oxophilic, electropositive group, has a strong propensity to react with an oxygen anion such as that which is present in a superoxide spin adduct. Hence, the presence of a nearby silyl group in nitrone molecules is expected to confer distinctive reaction pathways with superoxide that are not available in traditional nitrones. Moreover, due to colorimetric properties of azulene compounds, the end products of the spin trapping would likely yield characteristically colored molecules.

This step might also result in the rapid opening of the isoxazoline ring.

The wavelength dependence of the intensity of emitted light has been recorded at \u02dc490 nm (emission). The quantum yield of amide was measured at 2.7%. These results suggest that compound 74 has fluorescence, and this probe may possibly be employed to detect superoxide anion in biological system by identifying its orange fluorescence.

Solutol HS 15 is a non-ionic solubilizer and emulsifying agent produced from 1 mole of 12-hydroxystearic acids and 15 moles of ethylene oxide. It provides excellent solubility to poorly soluble (lipophilic) molecules in water, and hence, it is used for formulation of drugs in the pharmaceuticals industry.","In this experiment, as expected, solutol HS 15 was found to increase the solubility of nitrone 25 in water. To prepare the concentration of 0.64 mg\/ml of nitrone 25 in 3:7 solutol HS 15:1% saline solution, 1 ml of solutol HS 15 was heated until it turned into a clear liquid and cooled to room temperature.

It was then diluted with 2.3 ml of 1% saline solution in water with frequent shaking and warming. It was then cool to room temperature to obtained green solution.

The aqueous formulation of nitrone 25 with solutol HS 15 is believed to be amenable for mitochondrial superoxide detection and other biological studies.","Superoxide radical anion generation and its reactions in biological systems have received considerable attention because of the involvement of superoxide in physiological process as well as in the pathogenesis of various diseases. In biomedical research, it is important to characterize the specific free radical and its exact role in diseases which will allow investigators to design molecular or pharmacological approaches to prevent or ameliorate free radical-mediated maladies. But the direct detection of biologically generated superoxide radical anion, the identification of its sites of production, and its quantification are of the major challenges. By their nature, the inherent reactivity of most free radicals makes their direct in vivo detection impossible. Because of this difficulty, various techniques based on an indirect detection of superoxide have been developed with some degree of success.","Thus, techniques such as ESR (with cyclic nitrone spin traps), fluorescence, chemiluminescence and cytochrome c reduction have been used to study in vitro and in vivo detection of superoxide radicals in hopes of gaining insight with regard to cellular metabolism and pathogenesis of diverse cytotoxic events but each exhibits potential pitfalls as well as advantages. The Fluoresence-based technique using MitoSox red is considered as a simple and accurate method for estimation of biological superoxide, and hence it has been widely used for this purpose. However, it was found unreliable for intracellular detection because it does not detect superoxide specifically.","In a search for a more reliable, selective, and convenient method, this research developed structurally diverse novel azulenylsilane nitrones. Structurally, these novel nitrones are set up in such a way that they are specific for superoxide detection. For example, a nitrone moiety and an adjacent silyl group react readily with radicals and oxygen anion respectively. Such nitrones can trap superoxide efficiently because superoxide is both radical and an oxygen anion. Moreover, such nitrones allow chromotropic detection of superoxide by the virtue of their azulene core. Synthesis of dinitrone 55 has made it possible to design and synthesize other nitrone congeners with the incorporation of the electron-withdrawing cyano group, which yields a stable, characteristically colored, end product from its spin trapping reaction with superoxide. As expected, 2-terbutyldimethylsilyl-1 ethyl-3-azulenylnitrone (22), 2-tert-butyldimethylsilyl-3-azulenecarboxaldehyde 1-1nitrone (23), 2-tert-butyldimethylsilyl-3-tert-butylnitrone-1-(2-tert-butyl-4-cyano-5-phenyl)-azulenylisoxazoline (24) and mitochondria-targeted 2-tert-butyldimethylsilyl-1-[5-(3-aminoguanidinyl-phenylethynyl)-phenyl) 2-tert-butyl-4-cyano-5-phenyl isoxazole]-3-tert-butylazulenylnitrone (25) have been shown to trap superoxide radical anion efficiently yielding UV-VIS identifiable and even potentially fluorescence-detectable orange products. The in vitro results suggest that the chromotropic detection of superoxide using these nitrones can be a promising method in contrast to other available methods. Further work involves synthesis of mitochondria-targeted nitrones 65 and 66. Examination of superoxide reaction with nitrone 25 in biological systems encountered is underway. The in vivo detection of superoxide radical anion may provide additional information. Thus, nitrone 25 may be mitochondriotropic, and may have significant potential as a diagnostic tool for biological superoxide detection.","All of the moisture sensitive reactions have been carried out using syringe septum rubber cap technique under Nor Ar atmosphere or in a vial by flushing Nor Ar gas into it.
