The Government has certain rights in the invention.","The present invention relates to power conversion and, more particularly, to rectifier circuits that convert alternating current into direct current.","Rectifier circuits convert alternating-current (AC) into direct-current (DC). For example, some rectifier circuits include a diode circuit that is configured to function as a rectifying element by conducting alternating half-cycles of an AC input signal. Such rectifiers may be limited in switching speed by total capacitance therein. The efficiency of such rectifier circuits can be limited by the threshold forward voltage (about 0.3 V) for the rectifier circuits to become conductive. For high current applications, the threshold forward voltages of the diodes may result in an unacceptable heat generation.","In some embodiments of the present invention, a rectifier circuit may include a depletion mode semiconductor having an output connected to a rectified signal output node of the rectifier circuit, a hot carrier semiconductor diode having a cathode connected to a source node of the depletion mode semiconductor and an anode connected to a gate node of the depletion mode semiconductor and an alternating current (AC) input node that is connected to the anode of the hot carrier semiconductor diode and the gate node of the depletion mode semiconductor and that is configured to receive an AC input signal.","Some embodiments provide that, responsive to a first half cycle of the AC input signal, the hot carrier semiconductor diode is forward biased to cause an applied voltage at the source node of the depletion mode semiconductor and an applied voltage at the gate node of the depletion mode semiconductor to be slightly different, which forward biases the depletion mode semiconductor. In some embodiments, responsive to a second half cycle of the AC input signal, the hot carrier semiconductor diode is reverse biased to cause the source node of the depletion mode semiconductor to float relative to the gate node of the depletion mode semiconductor, which reverse biases the depletion mode semiconductor to cause the depletion mode semiconductor to generate a rectified output signal through the rectified signal output node during at least the first half cycle of the AC input signal.","Some embodiments provide that the hot carrier semiconductor diode includes a Schottky diode. Some embodiments provide that the hot carrier semiconductor diode includes a silicon Schottky diode.","In some embodiments, the depletion mode semiconductor includes a high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) that incorporates at least one heterojunction as a conducting channel.

In some embodiments, the reverse conducting cascode switch includes a source node that is connected to the anode of the hot carrier semiconductor diode, the gate node of the depletion mode semiconductor and an output terminal of the reversing transistor.","Some embodiments provide that, responsive to a first half cycle of the AC input signal, the hot carrier semiconductor diode is forward biased to cause an applied voltage at the source node of the depletion mode semiconductor and an applied voltage at the gate node of the depletion mode semiconductor to be slightly different, which saturates the depletion mode semiconductor.

In some embodiments, the hot carrier semiconductor diode includes a silicon Schottky diode.","Some embodiments provide that the depletion mode semiconductor includes a high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) that incorporates at least one heterojunction as a conducting channel. In some embodiments, the depletion mode semiconductor includes a GaN high electron mobility transistor (HEMT).","Some embodiments provide that the hot carrier semiconductor diode includes a silicon Schottky diode, the depletion mode semiconductor includes a GaN high electron mobility transistor (HEMT), and when a first half cycle of the AC input signal is applied to the AC input node, a voltage drop between the AC input node and the rectified signal output node includes a sum of a Schottky diode forward biased voltage drop and a voltage drop due to a source to drain resistance of the GaN HEMT.","In some embodiments, the reversing transistor includes a bipolar junction transistor with a collector terminal, a base terminal and an emitter terminal.

The rectifier circuit of some embodiments includes a high-speed, high-voltage, normally-on field effect transistor (FET) connected to a rectified signal output node of the rectifier circuit and a high-speed, low-voltage diode having a cathode connected to a source node of the FET and an anode connected to both of a gate node of the FET and an alternating current (AC) input node that is operable to receive an AC input signal.","In some embodiments, wherein responsive to a first half cycle of the AC input signal, the diode is forward biased to cause an applied voltage at the source node of the FET and an applied voltage at the gate node of the FET to be slightly different, which causes the FET to saturate.

Thus, n-type material has a majority equilibrium concentration of negatively charged electrons, while p-type material has a majority equilibrium concentration of positively charged holes.","Various embodiments of the present invention may arise from the present realization that high-voltage, high-speed rectifier circuits can benefit from low forward voltage drop characteristics, which may enable increased temperature operation relative to circuits experiencing higher voltage drops.","Reference is now made to , which is a schematic diagram of a rectifier circuit that uses a depletion mode semiconductor and a hot carrier semiconductor diode as rectifying elements in accordance with some embodiments of the present invention. The rectifier circuit  may include a rectifier anode  and a rectifier cathode , between which current may be allowed to flow in a first direction with low forward voltage drop characteristics and prevented from flowing in a second direction. In this manner, an alternating current (AC) input signal applied at, for example, the rectifier anode  may be delivered to the rectifier cathode  as a rectified signal output. The rectifier circuit  may include a depletion mode semiconductor  having an output connected to the cathode , which may be described as the rectified signal output node of the rectifier circuit.","In some embodiments, the depletion mode semiconductor  may include a high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) device. Some embodiments provide that the depletion mode semiconductor  may include any bidirectional conducting and forward blocking depletion mode device, such as, for example, a JFET using any semiconductor, a GaN HEMT, a SiC MESFET, and\/or MOSFET in any semiconductor, among others. Some embodiments provide that the HEMT may include at least one heterojunction as a conducting channel. In some embodiments, the depletion mode semiconductor  may include GaN, AlGaAs, and\/or GaAs, among others. Some embodiments provide that the depletion mode semiconductor  may include a source node , a gate node  and\/or a drain node .","The rectifier circuit  may include a hot carrier semiconductor diode  that includes a cathode  and an anode . In some embodiments, a hot carrier diode may be characterized by a low forward voltage drop and a very fast switching action and may be referred to a majority carrier semiconductor. Some embodiments provide that the cathode  may be connected to a source node  of the depletion mode semiconductor  and the anode  may be connected to a gate node  of the depletion mode semiconductor . In some embodiments, the node defined by the connection between the gate node  of the depletion mode semiconductor  and the anode  of the hot carrier semiconductor diode  may be connected to the rectifier anode .","In some embodiments, the hot carrier semiconductor diode  may include a Schottky diode. Some embodiments provide that the hot carrier semiconductor  may include any low voltage, majority carrier high speed diode with low forward drop. For example, some embodiments include a Schottky, junction barrier Schottky (JBS) etc. in any semiconductor, such as, for example, Si, SiC GaN, GaAs, etc. For example, some exemplary embodiments provide that the hot carrier semiconductor diode  includes a silicon Schottky diode. In this regard, some embodiments provide that the rectifier circuit  includes a GaN HEMT and a silicon Schottky diode used in combination with one another. In this manner, a high-voltage high-speed rectifier with low forward voltage drop may be realized via a combination including a high-voltage high-speed normally-on field effect transistor and a low-voltage high-speed diode. In some embodiments, a rectifier circuit  as described herein may be referred to as a cascode rectifier.","In some embodiments, the hot carrier semiconductor diode  and the depletion mode transistor , as discussed above, may be integrated into a single device to form an on-chip device.","Some embodiments of the rectifier circuit  may operate as follows. First, consider the forward biased case where current flows from anode to cathode. In some embodiments, this may correspond to a first half cycle of an AC input signal being applied to the rectifier anode . As the voltage is greater on the anode  than the cathode , the hot carrier semiconductor diode  is forward biased and thus conductive with a small voltage drop. The conducted voltage (minus the small voltage drop) of the hot carrier semiconductor diode  is applied to the source node  of the depletion mode semiconductor . As the AC input signal is also applied to the gate node  of the depletion mode semiconductor , a slight forward bias of the depletion mode semiconductor  gate to source junction is realized.","Resulting from the forward bias of the depletion mode semiconductor gate to source junction, the depletion mode semiconductor  becomes conductive from the source node  to the drain node . Some embodiments provide that the resulting rectifier anode  to rectifier cathode  voltage drop may be the hot carrier semiconductor diode  voltage drop plus the voltage drop due to the source node  to drain node  resistance of the depletion mode semiconductor .","Now, consider the reverse biased case where current flows from the rectifier cathode  to the rectifier anode . In some embodiments, this may correspond to a second half cycle of an AC input signal being applied to the rectifier anode . Under static conditions, the hot carrier semiconductor diode  may be in a blocking or non-conducting state. In this regard, the voltage at the source node  of the depletion mode semiconductor  may be floating. When the gate to source voltage drops below a threshold voltage, the depletion mode semiconductor  may be in a blocking and\/or non-conducting mode as a result of the gate to source junction of the depletion mode semiconductor becoming reverse biased.","When the depletion mode semiconductor  is in a non-conducting mode, the rectifier circuit  ceases to conduct. In some embodiments, the reverse voltage across the hot carrier semiconductor diode  may be limited to the threshold voltage of the depletion mode semiconductor . The resulting rectifier circuit  may thus possess the high voltage and low capacitance characteristics of a high-voltage depletion mode semiconductor  with the switching characteristics of a low-voltage high-speed hot carrier semiconductor diode . Some embodiments provide that the hot carrier semiconductor diode  need only sustain the threshold voltage of the depletion mode semiconductor. In this manner, the high speed characteristics of the depletion mode semiconductor  may be exploited to form a diode with low forward drop without having to resort to synchronous rectification.","Some embodiments provide that the depletion mode semiconductor  may include a field effect transistor (FET). For example, according to some embodiments of the present invention a high-voltage, low-capacitance rectifier circuit may be provided that includes a high-speed, high-voltage, normally-on FET  connected to a rectified signal output node of the rectifier circuit and a high-speed, low-voltage diode  having a cathode  connected to a source node  of the FET  and an anode  connected to a gate node  of the FET . In some embodiments, the diode  may be a Schottky diode. Some embodiments provide that the diode  is a silicon Schottky diode. In some embodiments, the FET includes a high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) circuit that incorporates at least one heterojunction as a conducting channel. Some embodiments provide that the HEMT is a GaN HEMT.","In use and operation, some embodiments provide that responsive to a first half cycle of the AC input signal, the diode  is forward biased to cause an applied voltage at the source node  of the FET  and an applied voltage at the gate node  of the FET  to be slightly different. In this regard, the FET  may become saturated. Additionally, responsive to a second half cycle of the AC input signal, the diode  is reverse biased to cause the source node  of the FET  to float relative to the gate node  of the FET . Accordingly, the FET  may be reverse biased and thus may operate in a non-conducting mode. In this regard, the FET  may generate a rectified output signal through the rectified signal output node  during the first half cycle of the AC input signal and no output during the second half cycle of the AC input signal.","Brief reference is now made to , which is a graph illustrating a plot of rectifier static forward characteristics of a rectifier circuit  as described in . As illustrated, the static characteristics of the rectifier circuit  in a forward biased (conducting) mode provide a substantially linear voltage-to-current correspondence once the applied voltage exceeds the voltage drop of the hot carrier semiconductor diode . As illustrated, the voltage drop of the hot carrier semiconductor diode  in an embodiment as tested was approximately 0.4V. Further, the slope of the voltage-current curve corresponds to the resistance between the source and drain nodes  and  of the depletion mode semiconductor  as tested.","Brief reference is now made to , which is a graph illustrating a plot of reverse characteristics of a rectifier circuit  according to some embodiments of the present invention. The static characteristics of the rectifier circuit  in a reverse biased (non-conducting) mode illustrate a leakage current of up to approximately 800 \u03bcA at an applied reverse voltage of approximately 500V. Some embodiments provide that the leakage current may be attributed to the leakage current between the drain and gate nodes  and  of the depletion mode semiconductor .","The rectifier circuit  may include substantially non-linear capacitance characteristics with respect to reverse bias voltage. Some embodiments provide that the total capacitance of the rectifier circuit  is the series combination of the hot carrier semiconductor diode  and the drain to source capacitance of the depletion mode semiconductor . In this regard, the total capacitance may be expressed as:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mrow":{"mi":"CTotal","mo":"=","mfrac":{"mn":"1","mrow":{"mfrac":[{"mn":"1","mi":"CDeplMode"},{"mn":"1","mi":"CDIODE"}],"mo":"+"}}},"mo":";"}}},"br":{},"b":["102","104"]},"By way of example, brief reference is made to , which is a graph illustrating a plot of reverse voltage capacitance characteristics of a rectifier circuit  according to some embodiments of the present invention. As illustrated, when the reverse voltage across the rectifier circuit  is less than the threshold voltage of the depletion mode semiconductor , the depletion mode semiconductor  is conducting and the total capacitance of the rectifier circuit  may be dominated by the reverse bias capacitance of the hot carrier semiconductor diode . When the reverse voltage across the rectifier circuit  exceeds the threshold voltage of the depletion mode semiconductor , depletion mode semiconductor  is in a non-conducting mode and the total capacitance of the rectifier circuit  is the series combination of the output capacitance of the depletion mode semiconductor  and the reverse capacitance of the hot carrier semiconductor diode . Accordingly, as illustrated, the capacitance of the rectifier circuit  drops significantly when the reverse bias exceeds the depletion mode semiconductor threshold, which may be approximately 2.5 V according to some embodiments. By providing low reverse voltage capacitance, the rectifier circuit  may provide increased switching speeds.","In some embodiments, the rectifier circuit  described herein may be supplemented by a low-voltage high-speed switching device to provide a reverse conducting characteristic. For example, reference is now made to , which is a schematic diagram of a reverse conducting cascode switch in accordance with some embodiments of the present invention. The reverse conducting switch  includes a depletion mode semiconductor  having a drain node  that is connected to a drain node  of the reverse conducting switch . A hot carrier semiconductor diode  includes a cathode  that is connected to a source node  of the depletion mode semiconductor . Some embodiments provide that the hot carrier semiconductor diode  also includes an anode  that is connected to a gate node  of the depletion mode semiconductor . A reverse conducting switch  may include a source node  that is connected to the anode  of the hot carrier semiconductor diode  and the gate node  of the depletion mode semiconductor .","In some embodiments, a reversing transistor  may be provided that may include a collector node  connected to the cathode  of the hot carrier semiconductor diode  and the source node  of the depletion mode semiconductor . An emitter node  of the reversing transistor  may be connected to the source node  of the reverse conducting switch , the anode  of the hot carrier semiconductor diode  and the gate node  of the depletion mode semiconductor .","In some embodiments, the reversing transistor  may include any low voltage, high speed, normally off switch. For example, the may include Silicon MOSFET, DMOS, etc., high speed bipolar junction transistor, such as, for example, silicon-germanium (SiGe) heterojunction bipolar transistors, SiC bipolar transistors, and\/or GaAs HBT (heterojunction bipolar transistor), among others.","In some embodiments, the reversing transistor  may include a base node  that is connected to a base node  of the reverse conducting switch . In this manner, the base node  may receive a signal causing the reversing transistor  to conduct from the source node  to the gate node  of the depletion mode semiconductor , which causes the depletion mode semiconductor  to become conductive from the source terminal  to the drain terminal . In this manner, a reverse conducting switch  may be provided that may selectively conduct from the drain node  to the source node .","In some embodiments, the reversing transistor  and a matching hot carrier semiconductor diode , for example, could be integrated in a larger chip that contains the gate driver circuits. Some embodiments provide that the depletion mode semiconductor  of the switch  could be also be integrated into the chip and\/or may a separate component.","Although not illustrated herein, multiple ones of the rectifier circuits and\/or reverse conducting switches described herein may be used in combination with one another to provide full wave rectifiers and\/or rectifiers capable of receiving and\/or rectifying polyphase AC input signals.","In the drawings and specification, there have been disclosed typical embodiments of the invention and, although specific terms are employed, they are used in a generic and descriptive sense only and not for purposes of limitation, the scope of the invention being set forth in the following claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The accompanying drawings, which are included to provide a further understanding of the invention and are incorporated in and constitute a part of this application, illustrate certain embodiment(s) of the invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 5"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
