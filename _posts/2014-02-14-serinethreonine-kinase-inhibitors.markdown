U.S. application Ser. No. 13\/782,513 that was filed on Mar. 1, 2013, which claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/605,523 that was filed on Mar. 1, 2012. The entire content of these applications is hereby incorporated herein by reference.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to compounds that inhibit serine\/threonine kinases and are useful for treating hyperproliferative and neoplastic diseases by inhibiting signal transduction pathways, which are commonly overactive or overexpressed in cancerous tissue. The present compounds are selective inhibitors of ERK (extracellular-signal regulated kinase). The present invention further relates to methods for treating cancer or hyperproliferative diseases with compounds of the present invention.","2. Description of the State of the Art","The processes involved in tumor growth, progression, and metastasis are mediated by signaling pathways that are activated in cancer cells. The ERK pathway plays a central role in regulating mammalian cell growth by relaying extracellular signals from ligand-bound cell surface receptor tyrosine kinase (\u201cRTK's\u201d), such as ErbB family, PDGF, FGF, and VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase. Activation of an RTK induces a cascade of phosphorylation events that begins with activation of Ras. Activation of Ras leads to the recruitment and activation of Raf, a serine-threonine kinase. Activated Raf then phosphorylates and activates MEK1\/2, which then phosphorylates and activates ERK1\/2. When activated, ERK1\/2 phosphorylates several downstream targets involved in a multitude of cellular events, including cytoskeletal changes and transcriptional activation. The ERK\/MAPK pathway is one of the most important for cell proliferation, and it is believed that the ERK\/MAPK pathway is frequently activated in many tumors. Ras genes, which are upstream of ERK1\/2, are mutated in several cancers, including colorectal, melanoma, breast and pancreatic tumors. The high Ras activity is accompanied by elevated ERK activity in many human tumors. In addition, mutations of BRAF, a serine-threonine kinase of the Raf family, are associated with increased kinase activity. Mutations in BRAF have been identified in melanomas (60%), thyroid cancers (greater than 40%) and colorectal cancers. These observations indicate that the ERK1\/2 signaling pathway is an attractive pathway for anti-cancer therapies in a broad spectrum of human tumors (Kohno, M. and J. Pouyssegur. \u201cPharmacological inhibitors of the ERK signaling pathway: application as anticancer drugs.\u201d . Vol. 5 (2003): pp. 219-224).","The ERK pathway has also been cited as a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of pain and inflammation (Ma, Weiya and Remi Quirion. \u201cThe ERK\/MAPK pathway, as a target for the treatment of neuropathic pain.\u201d 9(4) (2005): pp. 699-713; and Sommer, Claudia and Frank Birklein. \u201cResolvins and inflammatory pain.\u201d 1000 3:19 (2011)).","Therefore, small-molecular inhibitors of ERK activity (i.e., ERK1 and\/or ERK2 activity) would be useful for treating a broad spectrum of cancers, such as, for example, melanoma, pancreatic cancer, thyroid cancer, colorectal cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer, and ovarian cancer, as well as a treatment for pain and inflammation, such as arthritis, low back pain, inflammatory bowel disease, and rheumatism. Such a contribution is provided herein.","There is a continuing need for new and novel therapeutic agents that can be used for cancer and hyperproliferative conditions. The Raf\/MEK\/ERK pathway is an important signaling pathway, which is frequently overexpressed and\/or overactive in many cancerous tissues. Design and development of new pharmaceutical compounds is essential.","More specifically, one aspect provides compounds of Formula I:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0010"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"29.29mm","wi":"62.06mm","file":"US09259470-20160216-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sub":["1","2","1","2"],"sup":["1","2","3 ","4 "]},"Another aspect provides compounds of Formulas II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX and X, or a stereoisomer, tautomer or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.","Another aspect provides a method for treating a hyperproliferative disorder by administering a therapeutically effective quantity of a compound according to Formula I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX or X, or a stereoisomer, tautomer or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, to a patient in need thereof.

While enumerated embodiments will be described, it will be understood that they are not intended to limit the invention to those embodiments. On the contrary, the invention is intended to cover all alternatives, modifications, and equivalents, which may be included within the scope of the present invention as defined by the claims. One skilled in the art will recognize many methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein, which could be used in the practice of the present invention. The present invention is in no way limited to the methods and materials described. In the event that one or more of the incorporated literature and similar materials differs from or contradicts this application, including but not limited to defined terms, term usage, described techniques, or the like, this application controls.","The phrase \u201ca\u201d or \u201can\u201d entity as used herein refers to one or more of that entity; for example, a compound refers to one or more compounds or at least one compound. As such, the terms \u201ca\u201d (or \u201can\u201d), \u201cone or more\u201d, and \u201cat least one\u201d can be used interchangeably herein.","The phrase \u201cas defined herein\u201d refers to the broadest definition for each group as provided in the Detailed Description of the Invention or the broadest claim. In all other embodiments provided below, substituents that can be present in each embodiment, and which are not explicitly defined, retain the broadest definition provided in the Detailed Description of the invention.","As used in this specification, whether in a transitional phrase or in the body of the claim, the terms \u201ccomprise(s)\u201d and \u201ccomprising\u201d are to be interpreted as having an open-ended meaning. That is, the terms are to be interpreted synonymously with the phrases \u201chaving at least\u201d or \u201cincluding at least\u201d. When used in the context of a process, the term \u201ccomprising\u201d means that the process includes at least the recited steps, but may include additional steps. When used in the context of a compound or composition, the term \u201ccomprising\u201d means that the compound or composition includes at least the recited features or components, but may also include additional features or components. Additionally, the words \u201cinclude,\u201d \u201cincluding,\u201d and \u201cincludes\u201d when used in this specification and in the following claims are intended to specify the presence of stated features, integers, components, or steps, but they do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, integers, components, steps, or groups thereof.","The term \u201cindependently\u201d is used herein to indicate that a variable is applied in any one instance without regard to the presence or absence of a variable having that same or a different definition within the same compound. Thus, in a compound in which R\u2033 appears twice and is defined as \u201cindependently carbon or nitrogen\u201d, both R\u2033s can be carbon, both R\u2033s can be nitrogen, or one R\u2033 can be carbon and the other nitrogen.","When any variable (e.g., R, R, Ar, Xor Het) occurs more than one time in any moiety or formula depicting and describing compounds employed or claimed in the present invention, its definition on each occurrence is independent of its definition at every other occurrence. Also, combinations of substituents and\/or variables are permissible only if such compounds result in stable compounds.","The term \u201coptional\u201d or \u201coptionally\u201d as used herein means that a subsequently described event or circumstance may, but need not, occur, and that the description includes instances where the event or circumstance occurs and instances in which it does not. For example, \u201coptionally substituted\u201d means that the optionally substituted moiety may incorporate a hydrogen or a substituent.","The term \u201cabout\u201d is used herein to mean approximately, in the region of, roughly, or around. When the term \u201cabout\u201d is used in conjunction with a numerical range, it modifies that range by extending the boundaries above and below the numerical values set forth. In general, the term \u201cabout\u201d is used herein to modify a numerical value above and below the stated value by a variance of 20%.","As used herein, the recitation of a numerical range for a variable is intended to convey that the invention may be practiced with the variable equal to any of the values within that range. Thus, for a variable that is inherently discrete, the variable can be equal to any integer value of the numerical range, including the end-points of the range. Similarly, for a variable that is inherently continuous, the variable can be equal to any real value of the numerical range, including the end-points of the range. As an example, a variable that is described as having values between 0 and 2, can be 0, 1 or 2 for variables that are inherently discrete, and can be 0.0, 0.1, 0.01, 0.001, or any other real value for variables that are inherently continuous.","Compounds of Formula I exhibit tautomerism. Tautomeric compounds can exist as two or more interconvertable species. Prototropic tautomers result from the migration of a covalently bonded hydrogen atom between two atoms. Tautomers generally exist in equilibrium and attempts to isolate an individual tautomers usually produce a mixture whose chemical and physical properties are consistent with a mixture of compounds. The position of the equilibrium is dependent on chemical features within the molecule. For example, in many aliphatic aldehydes and ketones, such as acetaldehyde, the keto form predominates; while in phenols, the enol form predominates. Common prototropic tautomers include keto\/enol (\u2014C(\u2550O)\u2014CH\u2014\u21c4\u2014C(\u2014OH)\u2550CH\u2014), amide\/imidic acid (\u2014C(\u2550O)\u2014NH\u2014\u21c4\u2014C(\u2014OH)\u2550N\u2014) and amidine (\u2014C(\u2550NR)\u2014NH\u2014\u21c4\u2014C(\u2014NHR)\u2550N\u2014) tautomers. The latter two are particularly common in heteroaryl and heterocyclic rings, and the present invention encompasses all tautomeric forms of the compounds.","It will be appreciated by the skilled artisan that some of the compounds of Formula I may contain one or more chiral centers and therefore exist in two or more stereoisomeric forms. The racemates of these isomers, the individual isomers and mixtures enriched in one enantiomer, as well as diastereomers when there are two chiral centers, and mixtures partially enriched with specific diastereomers are within the scope of the present invention. The present invention includes all the individual stereoisomers (e.g., enantiomers), racemic mixtures or partially resolved mixtures of the compounds of Formula I and, where appropriate, the individual tautomeric forms thereof.","The compounds of Formula I may contain a basic center and suitable acid addition salts are formed from acids that form non-toxic salts. Examples of salts of inorganic acids include the hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, chloride, bromide, iodide, sulfate, bisulfate, nitrate, phosphate, and hydrogen phosphate. Examples of salts of organic acids include acetate, fumarate, pamoate, aspartate, besylate, carbonate, bicarbonate, camsylate, D and L-lactate, D and L-tartrate, esylate, mesylate, malonate, orotate, gluceptate, methylsulfate, stearate, glucuronate, 2-napsylate, tosylate, hibenzate, nicotinate, isethionate, malate, maleate, citrate, gluconate, succinate, saccharate, benzoate, esylate, and pamoate salts.

Some alkyl moieties have been abbreviated, for example, methyl (\u201cMe\u201d), ethyl (\u201cEt\u201d), propyl (\u201cPr\u201d) and butyl (\u201cBu\u201d), and further abbreviations are used to designate specific isomers of compounds, for example, 1-propyl or n-propyl (\u201cn-Pr\u201d), 2-propyl or isopropyl (\u201ci-Pr\u201d), 1-butyl or n-butyl (\u201cn-Bu\u201d), 2-methyl-1-propyl or isobutyl (\u201ci-Bu\u201d), 1-methylpropyl or s-butyl (\u201cs-Bu\u201d), 1,1-dimethylethyl or t-butyl (\u201ct-Bu\u201d) and the like. The abbreviations are sometimes used in conjunction with elemental abbreviations and chemical structures, for example, methanol (\u201cMeOH\u201d) or ethanol (\u201cEtOH\u201d). In certain embodiments, alkyl is Calkyl. In certain embodiments, alkyl is Calkyl.","Additional abbreviations used throughout the application may include, for example, benzyl (\u201cBn\u201d), phenyl (\u201cPh\u201d), acetate (\u201cAc\u201d) and mesylate (\u201cMs\u201d).","The terms \u201calkenyl\u201d and \u201calkynyl\u201d also include linear or branched-chain radicals of carbon atoms.","The terms \u201cheterocycle\u201d and \u201cheterocyclic\u201d include four to seven membered saturated or partially unsaturated rings containing one, two or three heteroatoms selected from the group consisting of O, N, S, S(\u2550O) and S(\u2550O).

another and\/or from starting materials. The desired products of each step or series of steps is separated and\/or purified (hereinafter separated) to the desired degree of homogeneity by the techniques common in the art. Typically such separations involve multiphase extraction, crystallization from a solvent or solvent mixture, distillation, sublimation, or chromatography. Chromatography can involve any number of methods including, for example: reverse-phase and normal phase; size exclusion; ion exchange; high, medium and low pressure liquid chromatography methods and apparatus; small scale analytical; simulated moving bed (\u201cSMB\u201d) and preparative thin or thick layer chromatography, as well as techniques of small scale thin layer and flash chromatography. One skilled in the art will apply techniques most likely to achieve the desired separation.","Diastereomeric mixtures can be separated into their individual diastereomers on the basis of their physical chemical differences by methods well known to those skilled in the art, such as by chromatography and\/or fractional crystallization. Enantiomers can be separated by converting the enantiomeric mixture into a diastereomeric mixture by reaction with an appropriate optically active compound (e.g., chiral auxiliary such as a chiral alcohol or Mosher's acid chloride), separating the diastereomers and converting (e.g., hydrolyzing) the individual diastereoisomers to the corresponding pure enantiomers. Enantiomers can also be separated by use of a chiral HPLC column.","A single stereoisomer, e.g., an enantiomer, substantially free of its stereoisomer may be obtained by resolution of the racemic mixture using a method such as formation of diastereomers using optically active resolving agents (Eliel, E. and Wilen, S. . New York: John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 1994; Lochmuller, C. H., et al. \u201cChromatographic resolution of enantiomers: Selective review.\u201d . Vol. 113, No. 3 (1975): pp. 283-302). Racemic mixtures of chiral compounds described herein may be separated and isolated by any suitable method, including: (1) formation of ionic, diastereomeric salts with chiral compounds and separation by fractional crystallization or other methods, (2) formation of diastereomeric compounds with chiral derivatizing reagents, separation of the diastereomers, and conversion to the pure stereoisomers, and (3) separation of the substantially pure or enriched stereoisomers directly under chiral conditions. See: Wainer, Irving W., ed. . New York: Marcel Dekker, Inc., 1993.","Under method (1), diastereomeric salts can be formed by reaction of enantiomerically pure chiral bases such as brucine, quinine, ephedrine, strychnine, \u03b1-methyl-\u03b2-phenylethylamine (amphetamine), and the like with asymmetric compounds bearing acidic functionality, such as carboxylic acid and sulfonic acid. The diastereomeric salts may be induced to separate by fractional crystallization or ionic chromatography. For separation of the optical isomers of amino compounds, addition of chiral carboxylic or sulfonic acids, such as camphorsulfonic acid, tartaric acid, mandelic acid, or lactic acid, can result in formation of the diastereomeric salts.","Alternatively, by method (2), the substrate to be resolved is reacted with one enantiomer of a chiral compound to form a diastereomeric pair (Eliel, E. and Wilen, S. . New York: John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 1994, p. 322). Diastereomeric compounds can be formed by reacting asymmetric compounds with enantiomerically pure chiral derivatizing reagents, such as menthyl derivatives, followed by separation of the diastereomers and hydrolysis to yield the pure or enriched enantiomer. A method of determining optical purity involves making chiral esters, such as a menthyl ester, e.g., (\u2212) menthyl chloroformate in the presence of base, or Mosher ester, \u03b1-methoxy-\u03b1-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl acetate (Jacob III, Peyton. \u201cResolution of (\u00b1)-5-Bromonornicotine. Synthesis of (R)- and (S)-Nornicotine of High Enantiomeric Purity.\u201d 47, No. 21 (1982): pp. 4165-4167), of the racemic mixture, and analyzing the H NMR spectrum for the presence of the two atropisomeric enantiomers or diastereomers. Stable diastereomers of atropisomeric compounds can be separated and isolated by normal- and reverse-phase chromatography following methods for separation of atropisomeric naphthyl-isoquinolines (WO 96\/15111).","By method (3), a racemic mixture of two enantiomers can be separated by chromatography using a chiral stationary phase (Lough, W. J., ed. . New York: Chapman and Hall, 1989; Okamoto, Yoshio, et al. \u201cOptical resolution of dihydropyridine enantiomers by high-performance liquid chromatography using phenylcarbamates of polysaccharides as a chiral stationary phase.\u201d . Vol. 513 (1990): pp. 375-378). Enriched or purified enantiomers can be distinguished by methods used to distinguish other chiral molecules with asymmetric carbon atoms, such as optical rotation and circular dichroism.","Biological Evaluation","Determination of the activity of ERK activity of a compound of Formula I is possible by a number of direct and indirect detection methods. Certain exemplary compounds described herein were assayed for their ERK inhibition assay (Biological Example 1). The range of ERK binding activities was less than 1 nM (nanomolar) to about 10 \u03bcM (micromolar). A cell-based function assay (Biological Example 2) was used to determine the effect of ERK inhibitors on down-stream signaling by assaying phosphorylation of P90RSK.","Administration and Pharmaceutical Formulations","The compounds described herein may be administered by any convenient route appropriate to the condition to be treated.
