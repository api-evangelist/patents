on Feb. 29, 2008.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to novel compounds, to pharmaceutical compositions comprising the compounds, to a process for making the compounds and to the use of the compounds in therapy. More particularly, it relates to certain substituted 1H-pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridine compounds useful for inhibiting Raf kinase and for treating disorders mediated thereby.","2. Description of the State of the Art","The Raf\/MEK\/ERK pathway is critical for cell survival, growth, proliferation and tumorigenesis. Li, Nanxin, et al. \u201cB-Raf kinase inhibitors for cancer treatment.\u201d . Vol. 8, No. 6 (2007): 452-456. Raf kinases exist as three isoforms, A-Raf, B-Raf and C-Raf. Among the three isoforms, studies have shown that B-Raf functions as the primary MEK activator. B-Raf is one of the most frequently mutated genes in human cancers. B-Raf kinase represents an excellent target for anticancer therapy based on preclinical target validation, epidemiology and drugability.","Small molecule inhibitors of B-Raf are being developed for anticancer therapy. Nexavar\u00ae (sorafenib tosylate) is a multikinase inhibitor, which includes inhibition of B-Raf, and is approved for the treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma and unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. Other Raf inhibitors have also been disclosed or have entered clinical trials, for example SB-590885, RAF-265, PLX-4032 and XL-281. Other B-Raf inhibitors are also known, see for example, U.S. Patent Application Publication 2006\/0189627, U.S. Patent Application Publication 2006\/0281751, U.S. Patent Application Publication 2007\/0049603, International Patent Application Publication WO 2007\/002325 and International Patent Application Publication WO 2007\/002433.","Pyrrolopyridines are known, see for example, International Patent Application Publication WO 2005\/062795 and International Patent Application Publication WO 2007\/013896.","International Patent Application Publication WO 2008\/079906 and International Patent Application Publication WO 2008\/079909 also disclose pyrrolopyridines.","International Patent Application Publication WO 2006\/066913, International Patent Application Publication WO 2008\/028617 and International Patent Application Publication WO 2009\/012283 also disclose kinase inhibitors.","In one aspect, the invention relates to compounds that are inhibitors of Raf kinases, particularly B-Raf inhibitors.

necessary. The need for such protection will vary depending on the nature of the remote functionality and the conditions of the preparation methods. Suitable amino-protecting groups (NH-Pg) include acetyl, trifluoroacetyl, t-butyloxycarbonyl (\u201cBoc\u201d), benzyloxycarbonyl (\u201cCBz\u201d) and 9-fluorenylmethyleneoxycarbonyl (\u201cFmoc\u201d). The need for such protection is readily determined by one skilled in the art. For a general description of protecting groups and their use, see T. W. Greene, et al. . New York: Wiley Interscience, 2006.","Methods of Separation","It may be advantageous to separate reaction products from one another and\/or from starting materials. The desired products of each step or series of steps is separated and\/or purified (hereinafter separated) to the desired degree of homogeneity by the techniques common in the art. Typically such separations involve multiphase extraction, crystallization from a solvent or solvent mixture, distillation, sublimation, or chromatography. Chromatography can involve any number of methods including, for example: reverse-phase and normal phase; size exclusion; ion exchange; high, medium and low pressure liquid chromatography methods and apparatus; small scale analytical; simulated moving bed (\u201cSMB\u201d) and preparative thin or thick layer chromatography, as well as techniques of small scale thin layer and flash chromatography. One skilled in the art will apply techniques most likely to achieve the desired separation.","Diastereomeric mixtures can be separated into their individual diastereomers on the basis of their physical chemical differences by methods well known to those skilled in the art, such as by chromatography and\/or fractional crystallization. Enantiomers can be separated by converting the enantiomeric mixture into a diastereomeric mixture by reaction with an appropriate optically active compound (e.g., chiral auxiliary such as a chiral alcohol or Mosher's acid chloride), separating the diastereomers and converting (e.g., hydrolyzing) the individual diastereoisomers to the corresponding pure enantiomers. Enantiomers can also be separated by use of a chiral HPLC column.","A single stereoisomer, e.g., an enantiomer, substantially free of its stereoisomer may be obtained by resolution of the racemic mixture using a method such as formation of diastereomers using optically active resolving agents (Eliel, E. and Wilen, S. . New York: John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 1994; Lochmuller, C. H., et al. \u201cChromatographic resolution of enantiomers: Selective review.\u201d 113(3) (1975): pp. 283-302). Racemic mixtures of chiral compounds of the invention can be separated and isolated by any suitable method, including: (1) formation of ionic, diastereomeric salts with chiral compounds and separation by fractional crystallization or other methods, (2) formation of diastereomeric compounds with chiral derivatizing reagents, separation of the diastereomers, and conversion to the pure stereoisomers, and (3) separation of the substantially pure or enriched stereoisomers directly under chiral conditions. See: Wainer, Irving W., Ed. . New York: Marcel Dekker, Inc., 1993.","Under method (1), diastereomeric salts can be formed by reaction of enantiomerically pure chiral bases such as brucine, quinine, ephedrine, strychnine, \u03b1-methyl-\u03b2-phenylethylamine (amphetamine), and the like with asymmetric compounds bearing acidic functionality, such as carboxylic acid and sulfonic acid. The diastereomeric salts may be induced to separate by fractional crystallization or ionic chromatography. For separation of the optical isomers of amino compounds, addition of chiral carboxylic or sulfonic acids, such as camphorsulfonic acid, tartaric acid, mandelic acid, or lactic acid can result in formation of the diastereomeric salts.","Alternatively, by method (2), the substrate to be resolved is reacted with one enantiomer of a chiral compound to form a diastereomeric pair (Eliel, E. and Wilen, S. . New York: John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 1994, p. 322). Diastereomeric compounds can be formed by reacting asymmetric compounds with enantiomerically pure chiral derivatizing reagents, such as menthyl derivatives, followed by separation of the diastereomers and hydrolysis to yield the pure or enriched enantiomer. A method of determining optical purity involves making chiral esters, such as a menthyl ester, e.g., (\u2212) menthyl chloroformate in the presence of base, or Mosher ester, \u03b1-methoxy-\u03b1-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl acetate (Jacob III, Peyton. \u201cResolution of (\u00b1)-5-Bromonornicotine. Synthesis of (R)- and (S)-Nornicotine of High Enantiomeric Purity.\u201d 47, No. 21 (1982): pp. 4165-4167), of the racemic mixture, and analyzing the H NMR spectrum for the presence of the two atropisomeric enantiomers or diastereomers. Stable diastereomers of atropisomeric compounds can be separated and isolated by normal- and reverse-phase chromatography following methods for separation of atropisomeric naphthyl-isoquinolines (WO 96\/15111).","By method (3), a racemic mixture of two enantiomers can be separated by chromatography using a chiral stationary phase (Lough, W. J., Ed. . New York: Chapman and Hall, 1989; Okamoto, Yoshio, et al. \u201cOptical resolution of dihydropyridine enantiomers by high-performance liquid chromatography using phenylcarbamates of polysaccharides as a chiral stationary phase.\u201d . Vol. 513 (1990): pp. 375-378). Enriched or purified enantiomers can be distinguished by methods used to distinguish other chiral molecules with asymmetric carbon atoms, such as optical rotation and circular dichroism.","Biological Evaluation","B-Raf mutant protein 447-717 (V600E) was co-expressed with the chaperone protein Cdc37, complexed with Hsp90 (Roe, S. Mark, et al. \u201cThe Mechanism of Hsp90 Regulation by the Protein Kinase-Specific Cochaperone p50. Vol. 116 (2004): pp. 87-98; Stancato, L F, et al. \u201cRaf exists in a native heterocomplex with Hsp90 and p50 that can be reconstituted in a cell free system.\u201d 268(29) (1993): pp. 21711-21716).","Determining the activity of Raf in the sample is possible by a number of direct and indirect detection methods (US 2004\/0082014). Activity of human recombinant B-Raf protein may be assessed in vitro by assay of the incorporation of radio labeled phosphate to recombinant MAP kinase (MEK), a known physiologic substrate of B-Raf, according to US 2004\/0127496 and WO 03\/022840. The activity\/inhibition of V600E full-length B-Raf was estimated by measuring the incorporation of radio labeled phosphate from [\u03b3-P]ATP into FSBA-modified wild-type MEK (see Example A).","Administration and Pharmaceutical Formulations","The compounds of the invention may be administered by any convenient route appropriate to the condition to be treated.
