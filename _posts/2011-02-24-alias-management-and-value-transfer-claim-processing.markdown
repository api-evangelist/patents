{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCES TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND","BRIEF SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present non-provisional application claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7119(e) of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61\/325,809, entitled \u201cALIAS MANAGEMENT FOR VALUE TRANSFER,\u201d filed Apr. 19, 2010, of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61\/349,473, entitled \u201cVALUE TRANSFER DEVELOPMENT KIT,\u201d filed May 28, 2010, and of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61\/348,524, entitled \u201cVALUE TRANSFER CLAIM SYSTEM AND METHOD,\u201d filed May 26, 2010, the entire disclosure of each of the referenced applications is incorporated herein by reference in their entirety for all purposes.","Value transfers enable a sending entity to transfer value to a recipient entity. Traditionally, such value transfers exposed sensitive information in order to identify the recipient entity, such as a credit card number or a recipient name. Some value transfer systems utilize aliases to protect sensitive information. In such systems, a recipient entity registers an alias by which they may be identified. However, alias enabled value transfer systems require that the recipient entity be registered before the alias may be used to receive a value transfer, which reduces the utility of the value transfer system as a whole.","Traditional value transfer systems were also engineered to be stand alone closed systems. Deep integration with third parties and issuers, such as exposing application programming interfaces and distributing software development kits, was not implemented and thus widespread adoption was not facilitated.","Thus, there is a need in the art for an alias management and value transfer claim processing system that addresses the above concerns. Embodiments of the invention address these and other problems, individually and collectively.","Embodiments of the invention disclosed herein include systems, technical architectures of the systems, and methods for an alias management and value transfer claim processing system. An alias management and value transfer claim processing system can be implemented using one or more computer apparatuses and databases.","One embodiment of the invention is directed to a method for receiving a value transfer request message comprising a recipient entity alias, a transfer amount, and a sending entity identifier, determining if the recipient entity alias is registered; and if the recipient entity alias is not registered, sending a registration request message to a recipient entity and sending a hold message to a sending entity issuer to reserve at least the transfer amount from a sending entity source account identified by the sending entity identifier.","Another embodiment is directed to a method comprising upon receiving a response message from the unregistered recipient entity, performing the operations of sending a debit message to the sending entity issuer to debit at least the transfer amount from the sending entity source account and sending a credit message to a recipient entity issuer to credit the transfer amount to a recipient entity destination account.","In a further embodiment, the method further comprises the transfer amount being held in the sending entity source account or an escrow account.","Embodiments of the invention are directed to systems, architectures of the systems, and methods for conducting alias management and value transfer claim processing.","In an example embodiment, an alias management and value transfer claim processing method may comprise receiving a value transfer request message comprising a recipient entity alias, a transfer amount, and a sending entity identifier. Once it is received, the method may continue by determining if the recipient entity alias is registered. If the recipient entity alias is not registered, the method may continue by sending a registration request message to a recipient entity and sending a hold message to a sending entity issuer to reserve at least the transfer amount from a sending entity source account identified by the sending entity identifier. For example, a sending entity may attempt to send $100 to the recipient entity alias \u201cted@ted.com.\u201d If this alias is registered, then a money transfer of $100 may occur in real time. If the alias is not registered, then a message asking the recipient entity may be send to \u201cted@ted.com\u201d asking him to register in order to receive the money transfer. A message may be sent to the sending entity's bank to place a hold of $100 on the sending entity's account.","In a further embodiment, the method further comprises upon receiving a response message from the recipient entity, performing the operations of sending a debit message to the sending entity issuer to debit at least the transfer amount from the sending entity source account and sending a credit message to a recipient entity issuer to credit the transfer amount to a recipient entity destination account.","As used herein, a \u201csource account\u201d may be a bank account, mobile phone account, online value storage account, or other account from which money or units of value may be transferred. Examples of a source account may include an account holding a digital currency or digital points, a micro-payment account, or a mobile telephone account. A source account may also be an account associated with a portable consumer device, such as a credit card account.","As used herein, a \u201cdestination account\u201d may be a bank account, mobile phone account, online value storage account, or other account from which money or units of value may be transferred to. The same type of accounts that comprise of a source account may also be a destination account. In an example embodiment, funds from one type of source account may be transferred to a destination account of a different type.","As used herein, a \u201cportable consumer device\u201d may be a credit card, a debit card, a mobile phone, a pre-paid card, a mobile application, a payment instrument, a specialized application, or any portable device or software application capable of transferring funds. Such devices may include contact or contactless smart cards, ordinary credit or debit cards (with a magnetic strip and without an embedded microprocessor), keychain devices (such as the Speedpass\u2122 commercially available from Exxon-Mobil Corp.), etc. Other examples of portable consumer devices include cellular phones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), pagers, payment cards, security cards, access cards, smart media, transponders, and the like, where such devices may include an embedded or incorporated contactless chip or similar element. In an example embodiment, a value transfer transfers funds from one account associated with a portable consumer device to another account associated with another portable consumer device. For example, a value transfer may transfer funds from one credit card account to another credit card account.","The alias management and value transfer claim processing system may facilitate value transfers without exposing sensitive information, such as by using an alias, also referred to as a customer identity alias. As used herein, an \u201calias\u201d may be an alpha-numeric value, such as a username, and may be static or dynamic. An alias may also comprise of Unicode characters or other CJK (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) characters. An alias may be used to identify a sending entity instead of sharing sensitive information, to preserve privacy and reduce the likelihood of fraud. An alias may be associated with one or more portable consumer devices or source accounts.","In a further embodiment, an alias may be a verifiable value, such as a phone number or an email address. The alias is verifiable if the alias value may be used to contact a user the alias represents. The user may be contacted for verification purposes. For example, a phone number and an email are verifiable aliases because the alias value indicates a method to contact a user, such as by SMS or email. For example, in a value transfer transaction, the sending entity may send money from the alias \u201cted@ted.com\u201d rather than by presenting a credit card number.","In certain embodiments, an alias management and value transfer claim processing system enables a sending entity to conduct a value transfer to an unregistered recipient entity. The value transfer may be conducted without exposing a primary account number or other sensitive information by using an recipient entity alias. The unregistered recipient entity may be contacted about their waiting claim via a verifiable alias. The unregistered recipient entity may claim the value transfer by registering with the alias management and value transfer claim processing system. The registered alias may be used later to send or receive subsequent value transfers. For example, a sending entity may send a value transfer to the alias \u201cted@ted.com,\u201d which may be unregistered. The owner of \u201cted@ted.com\u201d may then be contacted about the value transfer and respond to claim the value.","In other embodiments, the alias management and value transfer claim processing system enables the sending entity to send a value transfer to a registered recipient entity. The registered recipient entity may be identified via a registered alias, primary account number (\u201cPAN,\u201d also known as a printed account number or permanent account number), or other identifier. For example, a sending entity may send a value transfer to the alias \u201cted@ted.com,\u201d which may be registered and associated with a destination account. A value transfer may then be processed in real time.","The alias management and value transfer claim processing system may also provide various value transfer supporting functions, such as anti-money laundering checks, account management tools, foreign exchange calculation, and fees calculations, among other functions to be described in detail later in the specification. Value transfers may be scheduled to occur in the future or on a reoccurring basis. Value transfers may also be conducted in real time and\/or on a one-time basis.","The alias management and value transfer claim processing system may operatively communicate with various issuers to effectuate a value transfer between accounts hosted by the various issuers. For example, the alias management and value transfer claim processing system may communicate with a sending entity issuer to hold funds and to debit funds. The alias management and value transfer claim processing system may also communicate with the recipient entity issuer to credit value transfer funds.","The alias management and value transfer claim processing system may support value transfer functions through web exposed value transfer application programming interfaces (\u201cAPIs\u201d). The various value transfer supporting functions may be called by an issuer, an originating institution, or other entity via the APIs. In an example embodiment, a sending entity may visit the website of an originating institution, such as a merchant website, and may initiate a value transfer from that website. The originating institution website may have embedded commands to call the alias management and value transfer claim processing system APIs to conduct the value transfer. In an example embodiment, the value transfer APIs may be called from any platform or device with internet access.","A software development kit (\u201cSDK\u201d) for the alias management and value transfer claim processing system may be distributed to and implemented on issuer systems. The SDK may be adopted in whole or piecemeal to engage with existing issuer systems and may assist issuers in adopting and supporting value transfer functionality. The SDK may be a white-label implementation of the alias management and value transfer claim application and may be implemented in a turnkey solution or as a set of a la carte modules. The modules may be described in more detail in the discussion of . The SDK may be used to locally implement value transfer functionality at an issuer and may facilitate communication with the alias management and value transfer claim processing system APIs. The SDK may also be implemented with various entities other than issuers, such as on a merchant website, a social networking website, or other originating institutions, to support value transfer functionality from those originating institution systems. For example, a social networking site may integrate components of the SDK to support value transfer between its users or from its platform. The SDK may be implemented and branded to match the systems of the originating institution or issuer. For example, a website created from the SDK may be branded with the logos from an originating institution. The functionality of the alias management and value transfer claim processing system and the SDK is described in greater detail later in the specification and in .","The sending entity may initiate a value transfer by identifying the recipient entity. The sending entity may identify the recipient entity by providing a PAN, a general identifier, or a recipient entity alias. The sending entity may identify himself or herself by providing a PAN, an alias, a general identifier, or otherwise authenticating with the payment processing network. For example, a sending entity may authenticate by providing a password. In an example embodiment, the source account is implied from the sending entity's identity. The sending entity may also provide a transfer amount and identify a source account from which funds will be debited to fund the value transfer. The sending entity may provide the described data directly to a payment processing network or indirectly to the payment processing network through an originating institution, such as a bank, a merchant, etc. Hereinafter, messages described as sent directly between the sending entity and the payment processing network may also be understood to be sent from the sending entity to an originating institution and from the originating institution to the payment processing network. For example, a sending entity may communicate with a payment processing network to conduct a value transfer, or the sending entity may conduct a value transfer via merchant website and that further communicates with the payment processing network.","If the payment processing network determines that the recipient entity alias is registered or that the recipient entity PAN or identifier is valid, then a value transfer may be executed. Various anti-money laundering, fee determination, and blacklist functions may be conducted to mitigate risk and fraud, and to calculate debit and credit amounts. The sending entity and the payment processing network may operatively communicate to provide supplemental information and to signal acceptance of terms and conditions. Messages may be sent to the sending entity issuer to debit funds and further messages may be sent to the recipient entity issuer to credit funds to effectuate the value transfer.","However, if the recipient entity alias is not registered with the payment processing network, then a claim value transfer may be executed. In a claim value transfer, even though the recipient entity is not registered, the value transfer is approved and at least the transfer amount is reserved from the sending entity's account and held for the recipient entity to claim. Reserved funds may not be used for purposes other than the value transfer until the reserve is lifted. For example, the funds may be reserved by a hold, also known as a block, so that the held funds are available if and when the recipient entity claims them. Alternatively, the funds may be transferred to an intermediate escrow account. Reserved funds may be returned to the source account if the claim value transfer is not claimed within a predetermined amount of time of if the claim value transfer is canceled or otherwise is unable to complete. A claim value transfer may authorize a value transfer but does not settle it until the recipient entity claims the funds.","After reserving the funds, the payment processing network may send a registration request message via the recipient entity alias, such as via an e-mail address or a phone number, to inform the recipient entity of the reserved funds and their right to claim the funds. The recipient entity can then register with the payment processing network and claim the reserved funds. Upon receiving the recipient entity claim of the claim transfer, anti-money laundering and other checks are performed, and messages are sent to the respective sending entity issuer and recipient entity issuer to effectuate a value transfer. In an example embodiment, the subsequent operations mirrors that of a non claim value transfer.","The alias management and value transfer claim processing system may comprise of multiple modules to support value transfers. Such modules may support functionality such as alias management, reporting, anti-money laundering, blacklist support, user registration, fees and foreign exchange rate determination, notification, and other functions. These functions may be performed, in whole or in part at the payment processing network and\/or at an issuer or originating institution, as a counterpart to the operations performed at the payment processing network.","I.

The value transfer may use a portable consumer device or a source account as the funding source for the value transfer. The sending entity  may be an individual, an agent, an organization, such as a business, or other entity that is capable of initiating a value transfer.","As used herein \u201coriginating institution\u201d  may refer to any suitable entity or entities that may support or provide a platform, system, or services that the sending entity  may use to initiate a value transfer with the payment processing network. The originating institution  may be a value transfer service provider. An originating institution  may interface with and call the alias management and value transfer claim processing APIs of the alias management and value transfer claim application . For example, the originating institution  may be a website operator with embedded components of the SDK that allows a sending entity  to perform a value transfer from the website. An originating institution  may call the value transfer APIs. The originating institution  may be a bank or issuer that hosts a website or other interface from which a sending entity  may send a value transfer. In an example embodiment, the originating institution  may be the same as the sending entity issuer .","The payment processing network  refers to a network of suitable entities that have information related to an account associated with a portable consumer device of the sending entity or recipient entity. This information includes data associated with the account on the portable consumer device such as profile information, account data, aliases, value transfer history, metadata, and other suitable information. The payment processing network  may also have information related to a source account not associated with a portable consumer device.","The payment processing network  may have or operate a server computer and may include a database .

The delivery amount function may also take into consideration fees and foreign exchange markup rates to determine the delivery amount.","An anti-money laundering (\u201cAML\u201d) module  may provide blacklist checks, blocked BIN\/PAN checks, and value and velocity checks. The blacklist check function may determine if the sending entity is named on certain blacklists or watch lists. In an example embodiment, the blacklist check function takes as an input parameter the sending entity name. The AML module  may then determine if the sending entity name is present on any blacklist. Example blacklists may include the Office of Foreign Asset Control Specially Designed Nationals list. The function may return whether or not the sending entity name was found on a blacklist. The functions may also use \u201cknow your customer\u201d data supporting anti-money laundering checks. The same checks may also be conducted on the recipient entity and recipient entity name. In an example embodiment, the anti-money laundering module  creates an AML and fraud score, based upon various data points including transaction history of both sending and recipient entity, and may provide the score to issuers. The score may also be an indication of risk, for which a threshold may be defined. The score may also be used by the anti-money laundering module  to determine whether to allow the value transfer.","A blocked BIN\/PAN check may determine if a recipient entity BIN or PAN appears on certain blacklists. In an example embodiment, the blocked BIN\/PAN check takes as input the recipient entity BIN or PAN and determines if it exists on any blacklist or if it is blocked. The check may return whether or not the recipient entity BIN\/PAN was found on a blacklist. The same checks may also be conducted on the sending entity BIN\/PAN. The BIN\/PIN blacklists may be created by issuers or derived from data from credit agencies or other payment processing networks.","The value and velocity checks may determine if the velocity or value of transactions exceeds a certain threshold, so as to likely indicate fraud. In an example embodiment, the value and velocity checks take as input parameters the transfer amount, the sending entity PAN or alias, a transaction history, and the recipient entity PAN or alias. The velocity checks may determine if the number of transactions from a sending entity within a given time period exceeds a threshold. For example, there may be a velocity limit of six transactions per day, so that if a sending entity conducts more than six transfers within a day then the velocity check fails. Alternatively, the velocity checks may fail if a recipient entity receives more than a threshold number of transactions for a given time period. For example, velocity checks may fail if a recipient entity receives more than twenty transactions per day. Value checks may determine if the amount of value transferred from a sending entity within a given time period exceeds a threshold. For example, there may be a value limit of $10,000 USD per week, so that transactions from a sending entity that cause the sending entity to exceed $10,000 USD in a week may fail the check. Alternatively, value checks may fail if the amount a recipient entity receives exceeds a certain threshold within a give period of time. For example, there may be a value limit of $100,000 USD per week, so that transactions that cause a recipient entity to receive more than $100,000 USD per week may fail the check. More than one value or velocity check may be applicable simultaneously. Value checks may also be applied to single transactions. In an example embodiment, there may be a maximum and minimum transaction limit. For example, there may be a $10 minimum for any value transfer and a $1,000 maximum for a value transfer.","The alias management module  may provide logic to allow the sending of a value transfer using an alias and to allow the registration of an alias. The alias management module  may provide alias check and value transfer via alias functions. The alias check function may determine if an alias is registered. In an example embodiment, the alias check function may take as an input parameter an alias and return whether that alias is registered. The value transfer via alias function may allow a user to send a money transfer to an alias. In an example embodiment, the value transfer via alias function takes in as input a recipient entity alias and a transfer amount. If the alias is registered, it may be looked up in the database to derive a PAN. The alias management module  may also allow value transfers via an alias to be sent to an unregistered alias. In this case, the value transfer will be approved but not settled until the value is claimed. The alias management module  may also comprise of logic supporting scheduled and reoccurring value transfers.","The claim value module  may provide logic to allow the sending of a value transfer to an unregistered alias. The claim value module  may place a reserve on at least the transfer amount until the value is claimed or released. The hold may be placed by the claim value module  by sending a hold message to the sending entity issuer. Such a reserve may place a hold on the funds in the source account or may transfer the funds to an escrow account. The claim value module  may then comprise of logic to send a registration request message to the recipient entity alias informing them of value available to be claimed. Such a registration request message may comprise of the amount to be claimed, instructions to claim the money, and an expiration date for the claim. The instructions may comprise a URL, phone number, or other method to communicate with the alias management and money transfer claim application . In an example embodiment, the registration request message is sent to an unregistered recipient entity's email or phone number. The claim value module  may also cooperate with the account management module  to register a recipient entity and process their claim for value. For example, an unregistered recipient entity may visit a URL to register and to claim the funds by sending registration information, such as their name, alias, deposit account information, and portable consumer device information to the claim value module . In an example embodiment, a user may enroll or register a recipient only account, which permits them only to receive a value transfer. In a further embodiment, a user may enroll or register a full service account, which permits them to both send and receive value transfers from that account.","The transaction gateway module  may support messaging flows and gateway functionality supporting the processing of financial transactions. In an example embodiment, the transaction gateway  operatively communicates with issuers to send credit and debit messages. These messages may be original credit transaction messages and account funding transaction messages. The credit and debit messages may be modified to contain specific information to support the value transfer, such as alias and issuer information. In an example embodiment, if the value transfer fails, an AFT reversal may be sent to unwind the value transfer. In an example embodiment, an original credit transaction message may comprise of a processing code, a transaction code, a transaction code qualifier, a business application identifier, and a merchant category code.

Modules may constitute either software modules (e.g., code embodied on a machine-readable medium or in a transmission signal) or hardware modules. A hardware module is tangible unit capable of performing certain operations and may be configured or arranged in a certain manner. In example embodiments, one or more computer systems (e.g., a standalone, client or server computer system) or one or more hardware modules of a computer system (e.g., a processor or a group of processors) may be configured by software (e.g., an application or application portion) as a hardware module that operates to perform certain operations as described herein.","In various embodiments, a hardware module may be implemented mechanically or electronically. For example, a hardware module may comprise dedicated circuitry or logic that is permanently configured (e.g., as a special-purpose processor, such as a field programmable gate array (FPGA) or an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC)) to perform certain operations. A hardware module may also comprise programmable logic or circuitry (e.g., as encompassed within a general-purpose processor or other programmable processor) that is temporarily configured by software to perform certain operations. It will be appreciated that the decision to implement a hardware module mechanically, in dedicated and permanently configured circuitry, or in temporarily configured circuitry (e.g., configured by software) may be driven by cost and time considerations.","Accordingly, the term \u201chardware module\u201d should be understood to encompass a tangible entity, be that an entity that is physically constructed, permanently configured (e.g., hardwired) or temporarily configured (e.g., programmed) to operate in a certain manner and\/or to perform certain operations described herein. Considering embodiments in which hardware modules are temporarily configured (e.g., programmed), each of the hardware modules need not be configured or instantiated at any one instance in time. For example, where the hardware modules comprise a general-purpose processor configured using software, the general-purpose processor may be configured as respective different hardware modules at different times. Software may accordingly configure a processor, for example, to constitute a particular hardware module at one instance of time and to constitute a different hardware module at a different instance of time.","Hardware modules can provide information to, and receive information from, other hardware modules. Accordingly, the described hardware modules may be regarded as being communicatively coupled. Where multiple of such hardware modules exist contemporaneously, communications may be achieved through signal transmission (e.g., over appropriate circuits and buses) that connect the hardware modules. In embodiments in which multiple hardware modules are configured or instantiated at different times, communications between such hardware modules may be achieved, for example, through the storage and retrieval of information in memory structures to which the multiple hardware modules have access. For example, one hardware module may perform an operation, and store the output of that operation in a memory device to which it is communicatively coupled. A further hardware module may then, at a later time, access the memory device to retrieve and process the stored output. Hardware modules may also initiate communications with input or output devices, and can operate on a resource (e.g., a collection of information).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0079","num":"0078"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["1","102","104","102","104"]},"Upon receiving the value transfer request message, the payment processing network  queries the database  at operation  to determine if the recipient entity alias is registered. The database  queries for the recipient entity alias and at operation  sends a message to the payment processing network  indicating that the alias was not found and was not registered with the alias management with value transfer claim processing system  or the payment processing network . The payment processing network  receives the message from the database  indicating that the recipient entity alias was not registered and, at operation , informs the sending entity .","At operation , the sending entity  sends a message to the payment processing network  indicating that they wish to continue with a claim value transfer. In an example embodiment, the payment processing network  may present the sending entity with details about the claim value transfer. The details may include confirming the source account or portable consumer device, the sending entity's currency, the transfer amount, and an estimate of fees and foreign exchange rates, given the provided recipient entity nation of residence. These details may include a base exchange rate, a recipient entity currency, a foreign exchange markup percent or amount, a final rate, any fixed or percent fees, and the final amount to be transferred to the recipient entity. The payment processing network  may also present the claim code that will be sent to the recipient entity. In an example embodiment, the sending entity may override the system generated claim code and present a customized claim code. The sending entity  may review or edit these details and in operation , send a message to the payment processing network  indicating they wish to continue with the claim value transfer.","The payment processing network  receives the sending entity  confirmation to initiate a claim value transfer and at operation  sends a hold message to the sending entity issuer . The hold message instructs the sending entity issuer  to reserve at least the transaction amount. The reserve may ensure that at least the transaction amount is available for the value transfer should the recipient entity claim the funds. In an example embodiment, at least the transfer amount is held in the sending entity source account with a hold or block placed on those funds. In a further embodiment, at least the transfer amount is moved from the sending entity source account to an escrow account. The escrow account may be an account with the same issuer but associated with the payment processing network, the originating institution, or another entity. The escrow account may also be an account with a different issuer. The hold may also be placed for a total amount including the transfer amount and any associated transaction fees, markup rates, etc.","At operation , the payment processing network  sends a registration request message to the recipient entity . The registration request message may be sent to the recipient entity  via the recipient entity alias. In an example embodiment, if the recipient entity alias was an email, then the registration request may be sent via email. In another embodiment, if the recipient entity alias was a phone number, then the registration request message may be sent via SMS or by a phone call. The registration request message may be sent via a channel or process available to the recipient entity alias. For example, if the recipient entity alias is a Facebook account identifier, then the registration request message may be sent via Facebook message.","The registration request message may comprise of a message indicating that the recipient entity  may claim a value transfer. The message may indicate who sent the value transfer, when it was sent, and the transfer amount that may be claimed. The registration request message may also comprise the claim code and an expiration date of the claim code. The registration request message may also comprise of instructions indicating how the recipient entity  may claim the funds. The instructions may comprise of a URL linking to a website from which the recipient entity  may register. The instructions may also comprise of data indicating other methods for the recipient entity  to enroll, such as a phone number of an interactive voice response system or a customer service representative. The message may also comprise of a physical address, such as the address of an ATM or bank branch, from which the recipient entity  may register.

The registration request message may also include fees and foreign exchange information, as described above. Also included may be explanatory verbiage indicating that the fees and exchange rates are an estimation that may change at the time of transfer.","At operation , after the recipient entity  receives the registration request message, the recipient entity  responds to the registration request by communicating a response message to the payment processing network . If the recipient entity  rejects the value transfer, then the funds that are reserved will be released. This may cause the hold or block on the funds to be lifted, or for the funds to be returned from the escrow account back to the sending entity source account. In an example embodiment, the funds are returned to the source account through a chargeback transaction or an AFT reversal. The payment processing network  may also communicate to the sending entity  that the value transfer was canceled.","If the recipient entity  claims the value transfer funds, then the recipient entity exchanges information with the payment processing network  to register. In an example embodiment, claiming and registration may be done via a specific URL for claiming the funds, or via a payment processing network website. To claim the funds, the recipient entity  may provide the claim code. The recipient entity  may also enter a CAPTCHA value and agree to presented terms and conditions of the claim value transfer. If the claim code and CAPTCHA input are valid, and the terms and conditions are agreed to, the recipient entity  may then present information about their portable consumer device or destination account. In registering, the recipient entity  may create an alias for themselves which may be used subsequently to send or receive value transfers. The recipient entity may also provide additional information to create a user profile, such as name, address, phone number, etc. At operation , the payment processing network  stores the recipient entity  registration information in the database . In an example embodiment, the account registered may be used to receive value transfers. In a further embodiment, the account registered may be used to send and receive value transfers.","At operation , the payment processing network  conducts fraud, anti-money laundering, and blacklist checks. Such checks may include velocity and value checks, which may limit the number of transactions or the transaction amount for a given period of time, for both the sending entity and the recipient entity. The velocity and value checks may apply domestic standards and cross-border standards. The cross-border standards may vary depending upon the nation from which funds originate and the nation which funds are being remitted into. The payment processing network  also may conduct blacklist checks, ensuring that neither the sending entity or recipient entity are on such lists. The lists may include governmental, issuer created, originating institution created, or other blacklists. These lists may block funds suspected of funding terrorism or other illicit activities. The payment processing network  may also analyze other data, such as know your customer data, geo-location data, payment instrument data, sending entity and recipient entity profile data, transaction history and other data in order to access the risk associated with the transaction. The other data may include data processed on other payment processing networks or payment gateways. If the fraud, anti-money laundering, and blacklists checks are passed, then the value transfer may proceed to operation . If the checks do not pass, then the value transfer may be canceled.","At operation , after the value transfer has passed the checks at operation , the payment processing network  sends a debit message to the sending entity issuer . The debit message may instruct the sending entity issuer  to debit at least the transfer amount from the source account of the sending entity  or an escrow account. The debit message may include calculated fees and other charges which may be added to the transfer amount to instruct the sending entity issuer  to debit a specific amount. All or some of the debited funds may be reserved\u2014either held in the source account or in an escrow account. Any remaining funds may be debited from the source account. In an example embodiment, the debit message is an account funding transaction. At operation , the sending entity issuer  responds. If the sending entity issuer  rejects the debit message, then the value transfer is canceled and notification is send to the sending entity. The rejected value transfer data may be stored in the transaction history and the reserved funds unheld. If the sending entity issuer  accepts the debit message, the value transfer continues and sends a confirmation\/authorization message to the payment processing network .","At operation , after receiving the confirmation of the debit, the payment processing network  sends a credit message to the recipient entity issuer . The credit message may instruct the recipient entity issuer  to credit the transfer amount to the destination account of the recipient entity . If the credit message is rejected, then the recipient entity issuer  communicates the rejection to the payment processing network  which may cancel the value transfer and notify the sending entity . The rejected value transfer data may be stored in the transaction history. If the credit is successful, then at operation , the recipient entity issuer  sends a confirmation\/authorization message to the payment processing network .

The alias management and money transfer claim processing system may allow the sending entity to authenticate without disclosing any sensitive information, such as a credit card number or PAN. The alias management and money transfer claim processing system may also provide various anti-money laundering, fees determination, and other supporting functions helpful to value transfers. The alias management and money transfer claim processing system also provides a SDK package and API support, which encourages the adoption of the alias management and money transfer claim processing system with issuers and increases the likelihood such functionality may be incorporated into third party originator systems. The authorize and hold method also allows a value transfer to be authorized and sent to an unregistered alias. This increases the utility of the overall value transfer system, encourages unregistered recipient to register and subsequently use the system, and guarantees that unregistered recipient entities have assurance that funds will be available for them to claim.","The alias management and money transfer claim processing method may also be described from the perspective of the sending entity.
