No. 60\/750,489, filed Dec. 13, 2005, which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.","This invention was made in whole or in part with governmental support from National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease under SBIR grant No. 5R44 AI051106. Accordingly, the government may have certain rights in the invention.","The invention is directed to antibacterial compounds that expand the repertoire of erythromycin-like antibiotics. More particularly, the invention concerns ketolide antibiotics containing a modified erythronolide nucleus.","An increasing number of microbial strains have acquired resistance to the currently available antibiotic compounds, resulting in a potentially dangerous threat to public health. Thus the need for expanding the options available to treat microbial-based conditions has grown with the increasing use of antibiotics. The need for new antimicrobial compounds extends beyond treatment of human and animal infections to a need to preserve food and other perishable commodities. New antibiotics can also be essential for treatment of plants having microbial infections and to the preservation of materials that otherwise are subject to microbially caused corrosion. Thus, there is a clear need for an expanded armament of compounds which can provide a multifaceted defense against unwanted microbial activity.","U.S. Pat. No. 5,866,549 (which is incorporated herein by reference) and U.S. Pat. No. 5,635,485 disclose modified forms of erythromycin which lack a cladinose residue at the 3-position and which are derivatized in various ways in positions 9-12 of the macrolide ring. Such erythromycin derivatives lacking the cladinose and having a 3-keto group are termed \u201cketolides.\u201d U.S. Pat. No. 5,750,510 (incorporated herein by reference) also discloses modified erythromycin derivatives. All of the compounds disclosed in the above-referenced patent documents are derived from erythromycin A, and thus contain an ethyl group at position 13 of the macrolide ring.","While erythromycin A and its chemical derivatives have found long-standing use in the treatment of microbial diseases, it has recently been discovered that these antibacterials have significant safety risks associated with their use. In particular, these antibacterials have been shown to inhibit certain ion channels in cardiac tissues resulting in lengthening of the QT interval in the electrocardiogram. Such lengthening of the QT interval is associated with induction of torsades de pointes in susceptible individuals, occasionally leading to cardiac arrest. See, for example, H. Ohtani et al., \u201cComparative pharmacodynamic analysis of Q-T interval prolongation induced by the macrolides clarithromycin, roxithromycin, and azithromycin in rats,\u201d & (2000) 44: 2630-2637. The principal cardiac ion channel thought to be involved in this, the hERG or Ichannel, is inhibited by a wide range of drugs with no clear structure-activity relationship, precluding prediction of intrinsic binding affinities of drugs to the channel. Further, hERG is a membrane-spanning ion channel with extracellular and cytosolic faces, and inhibition of hERG by erythromycin-like antibacterials is believed to occur by binding of the drug to the cytosolic face of the channel. As erythromycin-like antibiotics are often actively accumulated into cells at unpredictable levels, the effects of particular macrolide antibacterials on the QT interval are extremely complex and impossible to predict based on their structure.","There thus exists a need for new antibacterial agents having improved efficacy and cardiac safety. U.S. Pat. No. 6,395,710 (incorporated herein by reference) discloses ketolide antiinfective agents prepared from analogs of erythromycin A, which are in turn prepared by genetic engineering. These ketolides show improved activity against a range of erythromycin-sensitive and resistant microorganisms. After extensive testing, we have unexpectedly discovered particular combinations of substituents on these compounds that provide not only improved antibacterial activity but also improved pharmacokinetic behavior and cardiac safety. Such compounds are of particular importance for the safe, effective treatment of bacterial infections.","In one aspect, the invention relates to particular macrolide antiinfective agents having improved safety and efficacy.","In one embodiment of the invention, 7-quinolyl ketolide compounds having the general structure (I) and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof are provided",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0010"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"66.97mm","wi":"69.85mm","file":"US07595300-20090929-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sup":["1 ","2 ","1 ","2 ","3","3 "],"sub":["1","5 "]},"In one embodiment of the invention, compounds of formula (I) are provided wherein Ris H.

The majority of 15F-6dEB eluted from 0.4-3.5 CV of the elution solvent. The capture operation typically achieved >75% purity with a recovery yield of >85%.","Solvent Exchange: The product pool from the capture operation was diluted with water to 25% (v\/v) MeOH\/water. A column was prepared with sufficient Bakerbond C18 40 \u03bcm resin (J. T. Baker) to achieve a bed height of at least 20 cm and product loading of <55 g 15F-6dEB per L of resin. For the solvent exchange operations performed in the purifications described below, 38 L of resin were used in a 440 mm diameter column (25 cm bed height). The column was equilibrated with 4 column volumes (\u201cCV\u201d) of 25% (v\/v) MeOH\/water at 175 cm\/hr (4.5 liters per minute (LPM)). Next, the diluted product pool was loaded onto the column at 175 cm\/hr. The product was eluted with 2-3 CV of 100% non-denatured ethanol (Goldshield Distributors) at a flow rate of 100 cm\/hr (2.5 LPM). 15F-6dEB typically elutes from 0.75-1.75 CV and elution fractions were pooled to achieve >95% recovery. Elution of 15F-6dEB can be monitored online by UV absorbance at 254 nm. After completion of the solvent exchange operation, the resin was cleaned by washing with 3 CV of 80% (v\/v) MeOH\/20% (v\/v) 50 mM Tris pH 7.8. The resin was then washed with 2 CV of 100% MeOH and stored for later use.","Vacuum Distillation and Filtration Operations: The solvent exchange eluate containing the 15F-6dEB was further concentrated by vacuum distillation and filtered to prepare the 15F-6dEB solution for bioconversion. Vacuum distillation was carried out using a R-220 Buchi Rotavapor System (Buchi Labs, Switzerland) with a 20L flask or equivalent apparatus. The rotavapor system was operated with waterbath at 40\u00b0 C., chiller at <5\u00b0 C., vapor at <20\u00b0 C., vacuum at 50-90 mBar, and agitation at 60-120 rpm. The solvent exchange eluate was distilled until a product concentration of >150 g\/L 15F-6dEB was achieved. Next, the concentrated product pool was filtered (Pall HDC II 1.2 \u03bcm nominal PP filter cartridge or equivalent) to remove insolubles. Additional 100% ethanol was used to rinse equipment and washed through the filtration apparatus to dilute the filtered product pool to >100 g\/L 15F-6dEB. This filtered pool was then ready for sterilization with an appropriate filter and feeding to the bioconversion fermentation.","Characterization: A sample of crude 15-F-6dEB was purified by chromatography on silica gel using a gradient of hexanes and ethyl acetate.

Vacuum distillation was carried out using a R-220 Buchi Rotavapor System (Buchi Labs, Switzerland) with a 20L flask or equivalent apparatus. The rotavapor system was initially operated with waterbath at 40-50\u00b0 C., chiller at <0\u00b0 C., vapor at 18-22\u00b0 C., vacuum at 50-90 mBar, and agitation at 60-120 rpm. The vacuum pressure setting was manually controlled to maintain a vapor temperature of 18-22\u00b0 C. The distillation was considered complete when the pool volume had been reduced by \u02dc90% and the MeOH content was sufficiently low to proceed with the subsequent extraction operation.","Liquid-Liquid Extraction: The concentrated capture pool was transferred to a suitable container to perform liquid-liquid extraction with ethyl acetate (EtOAc). A saturated solution of sodium bicarbonate was added (at least two-fold dilution) to a final volume of 26 L per 800 L of harvested broth. This aqueous pool, or feed, was verified to be at pH 8-9 before extraction. The pH may be adjusted up to pH 8 with sodium hydroxide if necessary. The feed was extracted by adding \u2153 volume of ethyl acetate (\u201cEtOAc\u201d) and agitating gently for 2 minutes (i.e. agitating at the minimum rate that the mixture visually appeared well-mixed). The extraction mixture was allowed to settle until phases separated (typically 1-2 hrs with organic extract on top of aqueous raffinate). The EtOAc extract was transferred to a new container. The extraction was repeated twice with \u2153 volume of EtOAc and adjustment of raffinate to pH 8-9 prior to each extraction, if necessary. The organic extracts were combined and extracted sequentially with \u2153 volume saturated sodium bicarbonate in water and \u2153 volume saturated sodium chloride in water.","Drying: The organic pool from the liquid-liquid extraction was dried to solids to remove all solvent. The organic pool was dried to solids in a R-220 Buchi Rotavapor System with a 20 L flask. The rotavapor system was operated with waterbath at 40\u00b0 C., chiller at <0\u00b0 C., vapor at 18-22\u00b0 C., vacuum at 50-110 mBar, and agitation at 60-120 rpm. The vacuum pressure setting was manually controlled to maintain a vapor temperature of 18-22\u00b0 C. The solids are broken up and further dried to constant weight in a vacuum oven at 40\u00b0 C. and 5-30 mBar.","Crystallization: High purity 15F-EryA was produced by crystallization of the product from a MeOH\/water solvent system. The following procedure used HPLC-grade MeOH and water. The dried extraction solids were dissolved by adding 4 L of MeOH per 1 kg of 15F-Ery A and mixing gently (e.g., 60 rpm in a 20L flask in rotavapor system) for 30-45 min. The solution was filtered with a 0.2 \u03bcm PVDF membrane (Millipore Millipak-100 Gamma Gold or equivalent) to remove fine particulates. The filtered solids are washed with an additional 1 L of MeOH per 1 kg of 15F-Ery A and the combined filtrates are transferred to a suitable crystallization vessel capable of sufficient agitation to maintain a well-mixed system. The starting material solids added \u02dc1 L of volume per 1 kg of 15F-Ery A to bring the initial crystallization solution to 6 L per 1 kg of 15F-Ery A. The crystallization was started by adding 3.33 L of water per 1 kg of 15F-Ery A over 60 min (55.6 mL\/min) to achieve a 6:4 MeOH\/water ratio. Crystal formation was initiated by adding a seed crystal slurry (0.5 g 15F-EryA crystals in 5 mL of 30% (v\/v) MeOH) and holding for 1 hr. Initiation of crystallization was assessed by visual observation of increased turbidity. After the hold time, 8.33 L of water per 1 kg of 15F-Ery A were added over 4 hrs (34.7 mL\/min) to achieve the final 3:7 MeOH\/water ratio. The crystallization proceeded to completion over the next 12-16 hrs. The high purity 15F-EryA crystals were harvested by filtration (Whatman#2 filter paper or equivalent) and the filtrate collected as the mother liquor. The filtered crystals were washed with 2 L of 30% (v\/v) MeOH and the filtrate was collected as the crystal wash. The washed crystals were transferred to a drying container and dried in a vacuum oven (40\u00b0 C. and 5-20 mBar) to constant weight. The dried crystals were transferred to a new container as the final product. The crystallizer and all equipment were rinsed with 100% MeOH to remove residual product and collected as the equipment rinse.

There was also a statistically significant (p<0.05) reduction in the HR at 390 min postdose after treatment with the high dose (30 mg\/kg) of compound (III).","The changes in blood pressure and HR, relative to the vehicle control, do not appear to be test article related, since the effect is not dose-dependent, the time is not consistent with a Tof \u02dc0.5 hr, and the blood pressure and HR values from 90 to 390 min are similar to corresponding pre-dose baseline values for each respective dose level studied. The changes in blood pressure and HR observed most likely reflect daily variation from one study day to another.","The effects of intravenous administration of vehicle and compound (III), at dose levels of 11 and 15 mg\/kg, on QTc in male beagle dogs are shown in .","No significant effects on the PR interval were detected during or after intravenous compound (III) administration at doses of 11 and 15 mg\/kg, when compared to the vehicle dose. Administration of the high dose level (30 mg\/kg) of compound (III) resulted in an increase in the PR interval, relative to the vehicle control from 150 to 390 min. The increase in PR interval was statistically significant (p<0.05) at the 390-min time point. There was no effect on the QRS duration after treatment with the 11 mg\/kg dose of compound (III). Significant (p<0.05) decreases in QRS duration, relative to the vehicle control, were detected after intravenous infusion of compound (III) at doses of 15 and 30 mg\/kg. However, QRS duration was also lower at both of the pre-drug baseline values (at \u221210 and \u22125 min) on these dose days, when compared to the baseline values observed on the vehicle dose day. The reason for the consistently lower QRS duration on the 15 and 30 mg\/kg dose days is not readily apparent, since a consistent effect on HR was not observed for the dogs on this dose day. The QRS duration values for these dose groups are still well within the range considered to be normal for beagle dogs.","The RR interval remained relatively unchanged during the study period in the vehicle and compound (III) treatment groups. A significant (p<0.05) decrease in the 11 mg\/kg dose group at 150 min, a significant (p<0.05) increase in the 15 mg\/kg dose group at 390 min, and a significant (p<0.05) increase in the 30 mg\/kg dose group at 390 min were detected; however, these changes were thought to be spurious, given the transient nature of the changes and the lack of dose or time dependency.","There were no significant effects on the QT interval, relative to the vehicle control, during or after intravenous administration of compound (III) at doses of 11, 15, or 30 mg\/kg. The QT interval was corrected for variations in the HR using the QTcF correction method. Compound (III), at doses of 11 and 15 mg\/kg, had no significant effects on QTcF over the course of the study. There was a lengthening of the QTcF interval from 35 to 90 min postdose after treatment with 30 mg\/kg compound (III), when compared to the time-matched vehicle control. There were no abnormalities in waveform morphology or ECG rhythm during or after administration of compound (III) at doses of 11 or 15 mg\/kg.","Similar experiments were performed with compound (II). The effect of intravenous administration of vehicle and compound (II) at a dose level of 15 mg\/kg, on QTc in male beagle dogs is shown in .","In one experiment, hepatotoxicity was estimated by overnight incubation of compounds at 3, 10, 30, 100, or 300 \u03bcM with cultured rat or human hepG2 hepatocytes, followed by staining of the cells with resazurin to measure viability or with Nile Red to measure steatosis. The minimal drug concentration at which changes in dye binding were observed was noted as the minimal effective concentration. The compound of formula (VIII) wherein Z=3-quinolyl affected metabolic stability and steatosis in human HepG2 hepatocytes at 30 \u03bcM. No effects were observed with the compound of formula (VIII) wherein Z=6-quinoxalyl or compound (III) at 100 \u03bcM.","In a second experiment, the hepatotoxicity of compound (III) was estimated using cryopreserved human hepatocytes pooled from four donors, measuring leakage of cellular lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Each donor was selected for the study based on the activity of cytochrome P450 (phase I) and uridine diphosphoglucuronosyl transferases (phase II). Hepatocytes were initially prepared from human livers by collagenase perfusion and subsequently cryogenically frozen. Viable cryopreserved hepatocytes were enriched in accordance with BD Biosciences Discovery Labware SOP HP-10. Hepatocytes were rapidly thawed, pooled and incubated in Williams' E medium at a density of 2\u00d710cells\/ml at 37\u00b0 C. in an incubator for 30 min. After incubation, the viable cells were separated with 24% Percoll gradient and resuspended in WME at a density of 1\u00d710cells\/ml. Initial viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion. Hepatocytes were incubated in a 24-well plate and each well contained 0.25\u00d710cells in 0.5 ml of WME medium. Three wells were used for determination of total LDH activity (cells+media) and the background activity (incubation media only) at the 0 time point. Briefly, a 100 \u03bcl aliquot of cell suspensions from these wells was immediately taken and rapidly centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15 seconds. The supernatants were transferred to microcentrifuge tubes and stored at \u22664\u00b0 C. for measurement of LDH activity present in medium at the 0 time point. Another 100 \u03bcl aliquot of cell suspension from same wells was removed, mixed with 100 \u03bcl of 0.4% Triton and stored at \u22664\u00b0 C. for measurement of total LDH activity.","Hepatocytes in other wells were incubated with test article at the concentrations of 200, 67, 22, 7.4, 2.5 and 0.82 \u03bcM. Six concentrations of test article, a single concentration of positive control tamoxifen, and solvent vehicle controls were tested in triplicate. Hepatocytes were exposed to the test substance and the positive control for 4 hours. After incubation, 100 \u03bcl aliquots of cell suspensions were taken and rapidly centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15 seconds. The supernatants were transferred to microcentrifuge tubes and stored at \u22664\u00b0 C. for measurement of LDH activity in incubation medium. The positive control used for hepatocyte toxicity was 100 \u03bcM tamoxifen. The solvent for tamoxifen delivery was DMSO (final concentration: 0.1%).","LDH activity in both total (medium+cells) and medium was determined by monitoring the enzymatic formation of NADH from NAD in the presence of L-lactic acid [1]. Briefly, post-centrifugation supernatants were diluted 1:40 with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4). A 100 \u03bcl aliquot was mixed with 100 \u03bcl LDH reagent containing 7.5 mM NAD, 50 mM L-lactic acid in 250 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.9) in a 96-well plate. The increase in fluorescence due to the formation of NADH were kinetically monitored at Ext. 360 nm, Em. 460 nm, using a Fluorescence plate reader. The percent LDH leakage from cells was calculated by comparing incubation medium values with total LDH activity (see Equation below). The cell viability at each concentration of test articles was reported.\n\n% LDH leakage=(LDH activity in medium sample\/total LDH activity)*100\n\nThe data are summarized in Table 17. The LDH leakage from the hepatocytes was slightly increased by approximately 5% in vehicle control group after 240 min of incubation. Treatment of hepatocyte suspensions with positive control tamoxifen at 100 \u03bcM caused 63% increase in LDH leakage. Incubation of the hepatocytes with compound (III) at 0.82, 2.5. 7.4, 22, 67, and 200 \u03bcM for 240 min did not increase LDH leakage, as compared with that in solvent (DMSO) vehicle-treated cells.\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0176","num":"0174"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00017","num":"00017"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 17"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Results of in vitro hepatotoxicity tests on compound (III)."}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"91pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"112pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"14pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":["Concentration","Compound (III)",{}]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"91pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["(\u03bcM)","*LDH leakage (%)","Viability (%)"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"28pt","align":"right"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["0.5","mM Citrate buffer","5.5 \u00b1 0.75","94 \u00b1 0.75"]},{"entry":["0.82",{},"6.1 \u00b1 0.63","94 \u00b1 0.63"]},{"entry":["2.5",{},"3.9 \u00b1 2.8","96 \u00b1 2.8"]},{"entry":["7.4",{},"\u200910 \u00b1 2.9","90 \u00b1 2.9"]},{"entry":["22",{},"\u200912 \u00b1 0.74","88 \u00b1 0.74"]},{"entry":["67",{},"6.7 \u00b1 1.3","93 \u00b1 1.3"]},{"entry":["200",{},"7.6 \u00b1 4.2","92 \u00b1 4.2"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"91pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Positive control",{},{}]},{"entry":["DMSO","\u200912 \u00b1 4.0","88 \u00b1 4.0"]},{"entry":["Tamoxifen (100 \u03bcM)","\u200963 \u00b1 1.0","37 \u00b1 1.0"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"The pharmacokinetics of compounds of formula (VIII) and compounds of formula (II) and (III) were measured in the mouse.

These cells have an opening with a nominal area of 1.77 cmand a receptor compartment with a volume ranging between 12 to 14 ml. Each diffusion cell was assembled by placing a disk shaped section of excised human skin (obtained from elective surgery) over the orifice of the receptor (bottom) compartment. A Teflon\u00ae O-ring was placed on top of the skin before the donor cap was added (top compartment). This diffusion area was then secured in place by a pinch clamp, ensuring an adequate seal between the donor and receptor compartments. The joint between the donor and receptor compartments of each cell was wrapped with Parafilm\u00ae (American Can Company) to prevent evaporation of the receptor phase. Each cell was then filled with the receptor phase consisting of phosphate buffered saline with 0.1% sodium azide and 4% bovine serum albumin (w\/w\/w) at 32\u00b0 C. Any air bubbles present under the tissue were removed prior to dosing. The receptor phase was continuously stirred using a Teflon magnetic stir bar and an inoculating loop cut to 6.0 cm from the top of the loop.

The samples were removed through the sampling port using a syringe fitted with Teflon tubing on the needle and transferred into plastic scintillation vials. After the first collection (4 hours), the receptor compartment was refilled with fresh receptor phase maintained at 32\u00b0 C.
