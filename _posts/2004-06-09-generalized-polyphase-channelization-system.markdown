The Government has certain rights in the invention.","The invention relates to the field of communications and signal processing systems. More particularly, the present invention relates to channelization of wide band signals for the preferred use in frequency division multiple accessing communication systems.","The present and future generations of satellites need to operate with small earth terminals such as mobile vehicle or hand held terminals. Such satellites need to be user oriented in that the user terminal needs to be relatively less complex, using low power, having low weight and low cost. Such requirement may be achieved at the cost of increasing the complexity, such as with space borne equipment and the central earth stations. Present day technology involves such processing on board the satellite. An example of such a system is mobile messaging service via satellites. In such a system, a forward link takes messages from an earth station to the satellite, which retransmits to the mobiles over spot beams. The return link begins at the mobiles, goes up to the satellite and terminates at the earth station. In such a system, the types of transmitter and receivers in the forward and reverse links may be different. Thus the optimum uplink and downlink designs to and from the mobiles and the earth stations may be very different requiring frequency translation achieved by channelization.","In the case of a multiple access communications system, the uplink uses frequency division multiple access (FDMA) signaling with low cost and low complexity terminals while the downlink uses time division multiple access (TDMA) signaling to maximize the satellite radiated power without intermodulation noise. In such systems, the small earth terminals do not need the capability of transmitting at very high burst rate and stringent satellite frame synchronization capabilities necessary for TDMA transmitter. In another multiple access system, uplink is based on random access technique while the downlink uses TDMA. In terms of modulation, all such multiple access systems make use of digital techniques with inherent advantages in terms of power efficiency, flexibility, error correction and detection coding and encryption. The feasibility of mixed mode multiple accessing techniques requires efficient means of translation between the two formats of multiple access system. Although analog techniques are in principle straightforward, in terms of implementation considerations of size, weight, cost, and flexibility, direct digital method are expected to achieve higher performance. Digital techniques can also fully exploit advances in VLSI and ASIC technologies to achieve these speed and costs objectives. Such translation may involve conversion of an FDMA signal into a TDM multiplexed signal, which may then go through a digital switch to various TDMA carriers being transmitted over the spot beams. Such digital translation techniques are also useful in the switching of FDMA carriers to different spot beams with out requiring arrays of analog bandpass filters and converters. There are several techniques for direct digital translation and switching using a channelization method where a wide band signal is channelized and individual channels are respectively processed.","Optimum system design in such cases may involve different multiple accessing techniques on the uplink and downlink. The feasibility of mixed mode multiple accessing techniques requires an efficient means of translation between the two formats of multiple accessing communication systems. There are several digital techniques available for translation, that is channelization, namely, an analytical signal method, a polyphase Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) method, a frequency domain FFT filtering method, weight, overlap and add (WOLA) method, and a tree filter multistage bank method. The analytical signal method, frequency domain FFT filtering method, and the multistage filtering method are computationally complex, the weight, overlap and add method involves processing of the input signal in blocks. Among these prior methods, the polyphase DFT method is the most efficient in terms of computational efficiencies and processes the input signal on a sample-by-sample basis.","In terms of computational efficiency and the ease of sample-by-sample processing, the polyphase DFT approach is the most attractive as the number of computations required per sample of the input signal processing increases linearly with logK where K is the number of channels. However, the polyphase channelizer that possesses this computational advantage is only applicable to the case where K is equal to the decimation factor M or an integer multiple. There are many significant applications where K is not equal to M or an integer multiple and it is desirable to achieve the same computational advantage as for the case of K equal to M.","The conventional polyphase DFT communication channelizer includes an analyzer for channelization and a synthesizer for dechannelization. The conventional polyphase DFT analyzer includes a front end complex downconverter for downconverting an input wideband signal into a complex input fed into an input clockwise commutator for round robin sampling for providing M channelized outputs. The M channelized outputs are fed into a filter bank of K filters to provide K filtered outputs to an FFT, the FFT outputs constitute the K channelized outputs. The input to the analyzer is the sampled version of the multiplexed signal comprising K channel signals. This polyphase DFT analyzer is computationally efficient where M=K providing a homogenous mapping between the M commutator output the K number of filters in the filter bank. That is, the polyphase analyzer includes a commutator followed by a bank of polyphase filters having filter outputs that are processed by the FFT processor. The FFT processor outputs are the desired K channels. All of the channel signals have equal one-sided bandwidth of B Hz. The sampled input is an analytic complex signal that may be obtained by a Hilbert transform operation on the real IF bandpass signal. In the polyphase analyzer for the case of K=M, all of the K channels share a common polyphase filter bank. The ipolyphase branch filter has a impulse response (m) given by (m)=h(mM\u2212i) for i=0, 1, . . . , M\u22121, where h is the impulse response of the desired analyzer prototype low pass filter.","Similarly, the polyphase synthesizer includes an inverse FFT processor, followed by a set of polyphase filters whose outputs are combined by a commutator to yield the desired synthesized multiplexed signal. The inverse FFT providing M inverse transformed outputs to a bank of filters having M filter outputs feeding a commutator for combining the M filter outputs into a complex output. The commutator provides the complex output that is then upconverted by an upconverter for forming a wideband output. In the polyphase synthesizer, all of the K channels share a polyphase filter bank with the ipolyphase filter impulse response q(m) given by q(m)=f(mM+i) for i=0, 1, . . . , M\u22121 where f is the desired synthesizer prototype low pass filter impulse response. The total number of real multiplications required per second per channel are given by a Mmultiplication equation. In the Mmultiplication equation, the terms \u03b4and \u03b4are constants, the term B is the bandwidth, and the term w is the channel center frequency spacing.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["M","PDFT"]},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mn":"2","mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mi":"w","mo":["[",")"],"mrow":{"mfrac":{"mrow":[{"mo":["[","]"],"mrow":{"mfrac":{"mn":["2","3"]},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mi":"log","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mrow":{"mn":"1","mo":"\/","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mn":"10","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"msub":[{"mi":"\u03b4","mn":"1"},{"mi":"\u03b4","mn":"2"}]}}}}}}},{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":"w","mo":"-","mrow":{"mn":"2","mo":"\u2062","mi":"B"}}}]},"mo":"+","mrow":{"mn":"4","mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"msub":{"mi":"log","mn":"2"},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"K"}}}}}}},"mo":"]"}}}},"However, the standard polyphase analyzer and synthesizer architecture is applicable to the case when the number of channels K is equal to the decimation factor M. When some user signals require larger frequency bands compared to other user signals, in principle, the user signal requiring larger frequency band may be allocated more than one adjacent channels out of K number of channels each of the same bandwidth. However, the filter roll off near the edges of the channels introduces band gaps among adjacent channels thus causing band gaps in the frequency band of the user allocated multiple channels which in turn causes distortion in the user signal. To avoid the problem of band gaps in the frequency band of the user with multiple channel allocation, it is desirable to introduce some overlap among the frequency response of adjacent channels. The said overlap is achieved by selecting the number of channels K greater than the decimation factor M. The selection of K greater than M thus provides signal fidelity to users assigned with multiple of the K channels. In the case when K>M, it is desirable to have similar computational and sample-by-sample processing advantages of the conventional polyphase architecture. Hence, it desirable to have a computationally efficient polyphase channelization system with a sample-by-sample processing architecture for the complex case where the number of channels K is not integrally related to the decimation factor M of the channelizer. Various modifications for the case when K is not integrally related to M, do not have the sample-by-sample processing and computational advantages of the conventional polyphase DFT method where essentially one filter operating at a single channel rate filters all the channels. In the case when some users require assignment of multiple channels, there is significant band gap and consequential distortion in the channelized signals when K is selected equal to M. These and other disadvantages are solved or reduced using the invention.","An object of the invention is to provide an analyzer for channelizing an input complex signal into channel signals.","Another object of the invention is to provide a channelizer having an analyzer for channelizing a complex input signal into channel signals and having a synthesizer for dechannelizing the channel signals into a complex output signal.","Yet another object of the invention is to provide a channelizer having an analyzer for channelizing a wideband input signal into channel signals and having a synthesizer for dechannelizing the channel signals into a wideband output signal.","Still another object of the invention is to provide a multiple access communication system having an analyzer for channelizing a wideband input signal into channel signals and having a synthesizer for dechannelizing the channel signals into a wideband output signal.","A further object of the invention is to provide an analyzer for channelizing an input complex signal decimated by a decimation factor M into K channel signals occupying K frequency bands where K is greater than M.","Yet a further object of the invention is to provide an analyzer for channelizing an input complex signal decimated by a decimation factor M into K channel signals respectively occupying K frequency bands where K is greater than M using a bank of M filter blocks and a bank of \u03b2 K-point FFT processors each of which are for providing K frequency components.","Still a further object of the invention is to provide a channelizer having an analyzer for channelizing an input complex signal decimated by a decimation factor M into K channel signals respectively occupying K frequency bands where K is greater than M using a bank of N filter blocks feeding a bank of \u03b2 K-point FFT processors each of which are for providing K frequency components for enabling a user signal to be channelized over a plurality of frequency bands with reduced distortion and with computation efficiency.","The present invention is directed to an analyzer for channelizing a complex input into K channel signals by a decimation factor M using a bank of filter blocks and a bank of FFT processors. The invention provides a computationally efficient and sample-by-sample processing architecture for the case when the number of channels K is greater than the decimation factor M. In a preferred form, a channelizer includes the analyzer and a compatible synthesizer. The analyzer and synthesizer can be used together in a multiple access communication system. The synthesizer is used to dechannelize the channelized signal into complex output signal. The number of channels K may be greater than the decimation factor M so that a user signal can be spread over multiple channel signals with improved signal fidelity while retaining computational efficiency. The required number of computations is computationally efficient and increases linearly with log(K) when K is greater than M. For broadband signals such computational requirements may be one of the dominant factors in determining the overall cost, weight, and power requirements of the satellite system, and as such, the invention has application to broadband multiple access systems such as the time division multiple access system.","The generalized polyphase analyzer includes an input clockwise commutator having round robin sampling with a decimation factor M to provide M sampled outputs. The M sampled outputs are fed into a set of M time-varying branch filter blocks each of which including a jclockwise commutator followed by a set of \u03b2 number of time-varying polyphase filters and a ring switch for providing \u03b2 filtered outputs. The (M)\u00d7(\u03b2) filtered outputs of the time-varying filter blocks are then processed by a bank of \u03b2 K-point FFT processors. The (M)\u00d7(\u03b2) filtered outputs feed the bank of \u03b2 K-point FFT processors for generating (K)\u00d7(\u03b2) forward transformed signals that are combined using a post processing subsystem for generating the K channels signals in generalized approach. The weighted sums of the bank of \u03b2 FFT processors constitute the channelizer outputs having frequency components in respective frequency bands.","A compatible generalized synthesizer architecture flows from the channelizer architecture. The synthesizer includes a K-point inverse FFT processor for receiving the channelized signals and for providing K inverse transformed outputs. The K-point inverse FFT processor is followed by a bank of K time-varying filter blocks for providing K filter outputs that are fed to a commutator for generating the complex output signal. The sequencing of filter weight vectors is determined by the ratio of K and M. The complex output signal can be upconverted into a wideband signal for broadband multiple access signaling.","Using the polyphase channelizer, a user signal can be channelized to occupy one or more frequency bands for desired signal allocation diversity with improved signal fidelity even when the user signal extends over frequency bandgaps that separate the occupied frequency bands. The generalized polyphase channelization system processes the sampled complex signal on a sample-by-sample basis and is computationally efficient even for the case when the number of channels K is not integrally related to the decimation factor M as the total required number of computations increases linearly with log(K). These and other advantages will become more apparent from the following detailed description of the preferred embodiment.","An embodiment of the invention is described with reference to the figures using reference designations as shown in the figures.

The input commutator  is a well known conventional component. A rate fs clock signal  drives a Mod M counter for providing sampling signals to the input commutator  for sampling the complex signal at a decimation factor M and for providing x(m) through x(m) sampled outputs. The sampling may be, for example, round robin sampling, and the number of channels K may be greater than the decimation factor M.

In the expanded complex output signal equation, the term f(j) for any integer j denotes the jcomponent of the impulse response f of the prototype low pass filter for any integer j. The prototype low pass filter impulse response f specifies the desired shape of the frequency response about the center frequencies of the K channels achieved by the channelizer synthesizer. The prototype low pass filter is a finite impulse response filter in the preferred embodiment and has only a finite number of terms f(j). Let Ldenote the length of the impulse response vector so that f(j) is equal to zero for j values outside the interval L\u22121\u2267j\u22670, and such that Lmay be factorized into the product M\u00d7L, for some integer L where M is the decimation factor. Such a factorization can always be achieved by including a sufficient number of zero components at the end of the impulse response vector f, if necessary, without modifying the desired filter response. The impulse response vectors of the synthesizer time-varying filter blocks , , through and denoted by g(m), g(m), through g(m) in  are defined in terms of the segments of the impulse response vector f denoted by , , . . . , and obtained by the  vector equation  =[f(\u03b7) f(M+\u03b7), . . . ,f((L\u22121)M+\u03b7)]for \u03b7=0, 1, . . . , (M\u22121). The relationship between the time-varying impulse response vectors g(m), g(m), through g(m) in  and the vectors  for \u03b7=1,2, . . . , K\u22121 will become clear from the following description. For the case when the coefficients f(j) of the impulse response of the synthesizer prototype filter are zero for j values outside the interval L\u22121\u2267j\u22670, the complex output equation may be expanded as {circumflex over (x)}=f(n)y(n,0)+f(n+M)y(n,\u22121)+ . . . +f(n+(L\u22121)M)y(n,\u2212L+1).

From the fact that y(n,m) is periodic with respect to the index n with a period of K for any fixed value of m, that is, y(n+\u03bbK,m)=y(n,m) for any integer \u03bb, the synthesizer output signal equation may be rewritten in terms of the  array coefficients in  synthesizer output equations, such as, {circumflex over (x)}(n)= Y(n,0) for n=0, 1, . . . , (M\u22121), and, {circumflex over (x)}(M+n)= Y(M+n,1) for n=0, 1, . . . ,(K\u22121\u2212M), and the sequence, {circumflex over (x)}(K)= Y(0, 1), {circumflex over (x)}(K+1)=g Y(1,1) and so on. As the index n of vector varies from 0 to (M\u22121), and the first argument of Y varies over the range 0 to (K\u22121), the synthesizer output signal may be expressed in the compact form, that is, {circumflex over (x)}(jM+n)= Y([jM+n],j) where j=0, 1, . . . , and n=0, 1, . . . , (M\u22121), and where [jM+n]denotes the nonnegative integer obtained as remainder in the integer division of (jM+n) by K. With F=lcm(M,K) where lcm(M,K) denotes the least common multiple (lcm) of M and K, then define Kand Mby K=F\/M and M=F\/K. To obtain [jM+n]for all possible values of j and n, the equation [jM+n]=p is solved for p=0, 1, . . . , K\u22121 and for all possible values of j and n where the value of n is computed modulo M. In particular, for the case of p equal to 0 all possible solutions j and n are obtained for the equation jM+n=rK for all possible integers r.

The generalized polyphase channelizer enables application where the number of channels K is greater than the decimation factor M while retaining the computational efficiency of increasing linearly with log(K). The generalized polyphase channelizer is particularly useful for wideband and space based systems where the computational requirements is an important factor in determining the feasibility of the overall system design in terms of power, weight, size, and cost requirements. The invention should have broad market covering fields of digital signal processing and communications especially for systems involving broadband signals. Those skilled in the art can make enhancements, improvements, and modifications to the invention, and these enhancements, improvements, and modifications may nonetheless fall within the spirit and scope of the following claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 2","sup":"th "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 7"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
