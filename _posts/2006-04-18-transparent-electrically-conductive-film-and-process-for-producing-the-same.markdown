More particularly, the present invention is concerned with a transparent, electrically conductive film having an electromagnetic wave shielding function and which permits a user to see through the interior of, for example, a microwave oven or a measuring instrument or a display surface of, for example, a CRT or a plasma display panel.","As conventional processes for producing an electrically conductive film which can shield electromagnetic waves while maintaining satisfactory light transparency there are known, for example, a process in which a transparent, electrically conductive film such as, for example, indium-tin oxide film (ITO film) is formed as a thin film on the surface of a transparent glass or plastic substrate by vapor deposition or sputtering or a process in which a thin metal film is formed throughout the whole surface of a transparent glass or plastic substrate by metal plating or vapor deposition and is then processed for example by photolithography to form a fine mesh of the thin metal film.","The above transparent, electrically conductive film having ITO film on a transparent substrate is superior in light transparency, but is inferior in electrical conductivity and cannot afford satisfactory electromagnetic wave shielding properties in comparison with the transparent, electrically conductive film having a mesh-like thin metal film. On the other hand, in the process involving forming a thin metal film on a transparent substrate and processing it into mesh-like, since most of the thin metal film is removed, this is wasteful and results in an increase of the production cost, although there is attained high electrical conductivity.","In an effort to solve the above-mentioned problems, for example in JP 62-57297A and JP 2-52499A there is proposed a process wherein electrically conductive ink or ink containing an electroless plating catalyst is printed in the shape of a pattern consisting of thin lines onto a base material such as a transparent film or glass and thereafter metal is plated onto the ink layer. According to this process, however, it is difficult to prepare a pattern using thin lines not larger than 30 \u03bcm in line width, and a large line width results in deterioration of light transparency; besides, when the transparent, electrically conductive film formed by this process is used as an electromagnetic wave shielding material for display, it is inferior in image visibility.","Further, when the transparent, electrically conductive film is used as an electromagnetic wave shielding material for PDP, it is laminated to, for example, an infrared absorbing film with use of an adhesive. In this case, in the transparent, electrically conductive film formed by the above process, the ink layer after printing is thick and concaves and convexes on the print surface are large, so when the adhesive is applied to the surface of one film and this film is laminated to the other film, there easily occurs inclusion of air bubbles and image visibility is deteriorated in the presence of such air bubbles.","On the other hand, in JP 2000-137442A there is proposed a process involving laminating a transparent base material and metal foil to each other with use of an adhesive and thereafter making the metal foil mesh-like by photolithography. According to this an adhesive and thereafter making the metal foil mesh-like by photolithography. According to this process, thin lines not larger than 20 \u03bcm in line width permits the attainment of high light transparency, but a warp caused by the adhesive is apt to occur. Moreover, as is the case with the process referred to previously, since the metal foil thickness is not smaller than 10 \u03bcm, surface concaves and convexes become large and there occurs inclusion of air bubbles upon lamination to another member.","It is an object of the present invention to provide a transparent, electrically conductive film which, while maintaining the light transparency of a transparent film, has excellent electrical conductivity and can be utilized for electromagnetic wave shielding. More particularly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a transparent, electrically conductive film free from inclusion of air bubbles when laminated to another base material, as well as a process for producing such a film.","Having made extensive studies for solving the above-mentioned problems, the present inventors invented a transparent, electrically conductive film of the following configuration. According to the present invention there is provided a process for producing a transparent, electrically conductive film, comprising the steps of forming a multitude of concaves and convexes having an average height of not larger than 0.1 \u03bcm on both sides or one side of a transparent film, forming a resist layer having a pattern shape opposite to that of the electrically conductive portion of the electrically conductive film on the transparent film on its concave-convex side, applying a catalyst for plating onto the resist layer-formed face, separating the resist layer, forming a metal layer by plating, and blackening the metal layer, the metal layer having a width W to height T ratio, W\/T, of 1\u2266W\/T\u2266500.","It is preferable that the concaves and convexes on both sides or one side of the transparent film be formed by incorporating a filler in the transparent film. In this connection, it is preferable that the difference in refractive index of light between the filler and the transparent film be not larger than 0.15. Preferably, the transparent film is a polyethylene terephthalate film and the filler is silica or alumina.","According to the present invention it is possible to provide an electrically conductive film which, while maintaining the light transparency of a transparent film, has excellent electrical conductivity and can be utilized for electromagnetic wave shielding. Further, it is possible to provide a transparent, electrically conductive film free from separation of a metal layer and inclusion of air bubbles when laminated to another base material and which can be produced in high yield and inexpensively through a reduced number of manufacturing steps.","In the drawings, the reference numeral  denotes a transparent film,  a metal layer,  a resist layer,  a catalyst for plating, W stands for the width of the metal layer, and T stands for the height of the metal layer .","Embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail hereinunder with reference to the drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 2","FIGS. 3 to 5"],"b":["1","2","3"]},"The transparent, electrically conductive film embodying the present invention comprises a transparent film  having a large number of concaves and convexes with an average height of not larger than 0.1 \u03bcm and a metal layer formed in a pattern shape on the transparent film  (see ). A process for producing the transparent, electrically conductive film according to the present invention comprises the steps of forming a large number of concaves and convexes having an average height of not larger than 0.1 \u03bcm on the surface of a transparent film , forming on the transparent film  a resist layer  having a pattern shape opposite to that of a metal layer  to be formed (), then applying a catalyst for plating onto the resist layer -formed face (), separating the resist layer (), forming a metal layer  by plating, and blackening the metal layer .","As examples of the transparent film  used in the present invention there are mentioned films of polyester resins such as polyethylene terephthalate, polybutylene terephthalate, polyethylene naphthalate, polyethylene terephthalate-isophthalate copolymer, and terephthalic acid-cyclohexanedimethanol-ethylene glycol copolymer, polyamide resins such as nylon 6, polyolelfin resins such as polypropylene and polymethylpentene, acrylic resins such as polyacrylate, polymethacrylate, and polymethyl methacrylate, styrene resins such as ABS resin, cellulose resins such as triacetyl cellulose, as well as imide resins and polycarbonates. Film, sheet or board comprising at least one layer of resin selected from these resins is used as the transparent film. These shapes are generically called \u201cfilm\u201d herein. Usually, such polyester films as polyethylene terephthalate film and polyethylene naphthalate film are preferred because they are superior in transparency and heat resistance and are low in cost, with polyethylene terephthalate being most suitable.","The transparent film  may be a copolymer resin containing any of the above resins as a principal component, or a mixture (including alloy), or a laminate consisting of plural layers. The transparent film  may be a stretched film or an unstretched film, but a uniaxially or biaxially stretched film is preferred for the purpose of improving the strength of the film. The thickness of the transparent film  is usually 12 to 1000 \u03bcm, preferably 50 to 700 \u03bcm, most preferably 100 to 500 \u03bcm. If the thickness of the transparent film  is smaller than 12 \u03bcm, the mechanical strength will be insufficient, with consequent likelihood of occurrence of warping and slackening. If it exceeds 1000 \u03bcm, the light transparency of the film will be deteriorated or excessive performance will result, which is wasteful in point of cost.","On the surface of the transparent film  there are formed a metal layer  by plating and a large number of concaves and convexes having an average height of not larger than 0.1 \u03bcm for enhancing the adhesion to the transparent film  and for preventing separation of the metal layer. Such concaves and convexes can be formed by scraping the surface of the transparent film , for example, by etching with use of alkali or chromic acid or by sandblasting. Incorporation of a filler in the film resin may also be adopted. Above all, the method of incorporating a filler in the film resin is preferred because the number of additional steps is small.","As a method for forming the filler-containing resin into a film there is mentioned, for example, a biaxial stretching method. As another example there is mentioned a coating method. A preferred method involves casting and stretching a filler-containing resin onto a film not containing a filler. As the filler, one having an average particle diameter of not larger than 0.5 \u03bcm is preferred. If the particle diameter of the filler is smaller than 0.2 \u03bcm, concaves and convexes will not be formed to a satisfactory extent, with consequent likelihood of deteriorated adhesion of the metal layer. If the particle diameter of the filler exceeds 0.5 \u03bcm, the light transparency of the film will be deteriorated and so will be the visibility as an electromagnetic wave shielding material for display.","The material of the filler may be such an organic material as polymethacrylic ester, polyarylate, polystyrene, or polyethylene, or may be such an inorganic material as mica, talc, alumina, calcium carbonate, glass, silica, kaolin, or aluminosilicate, provided it is preferable that the difference in refractive index of light between the resin which constitutes the transparent film  and the filler be not larger than 0.15. If the difference in refractive index of light exceeds 0.15, there is a fear that the light transparency may be deteriorated. A preferred transparent film \u2014filler combination is the use of polyethylene terephthalate as the transparent film and silica or alumina as the filler.","As examples of the method for forming the resist layer in the present invention there are mentioned printing and photolithography. As examples of printing methods there are mentioned lithographic offset printing, intaglio offset printing, gravure printing, screen printing, and flexographic printing.","According to photolithography, a resist is applied by coating or dipping onto the surface of the transparent film , or a photosensitive resist is formed uniformly throughout the surface of the transparent film by lamination of a dry film. Thereafter, exposure and development are performed using a photomask of a predetermined pattern, followed by a curing treatment if necessary. As a result, a resist pattern opposite to the pattern of the metal layer is formed on the transparent film (). The photosensitive resist used in the present invention is not specially limited. A conventional known photosensitive composition may be used, provided it is preferable to select one which has a sufficient resolving power and is easy to be peeled off.","The plating performed in the present invention may be carried out by electroless plating or electroplating, or a combination of the two. The metal layer  formed in the above manner may be blackened by oxidation or sulfuration.","With reference to electroless plating as an example, a concrete description will now be given about the plating process which is performed for forming the metal layer  in the present invention. First, an organic or inorganic material serving as a catalyst  for plating is applied to the surface of the transparent film  formed with the resist layer  (). As examples of the catalyst  for plating there are mentioned chlorides, sulfates, nitrates, organic salts and ammonium salts of iron, copper, nickel, cobalt, and palladium. The method for application of the plating catalyst is not specially limited. For example, there may be adopted a coating or dipping method.","The next process is a process of peeling off the resist layer . How to peel off the resist layer  is not specially limited. There may be adopted a peeling or removing method suitable for the resist used. By peeling off the resist layer  it is possible to obtain a transparent film with the catalyst for plating applied thereto in a desired pattern shape. By subjecting the transparent film to electroless plating it is possible to form the metal layer  and make the pattern into an electromagnetic wave shielding pattern.","For electroless plating there may be adopted a conventional method using copper or nickel, or an alloy thereof. By subsequent heat treatment it is possible to enhance the strength of adhesion to the film, or by oxidation or sulfuration to effect blackening it is possible to change the adhesiveness or color.","In the present invention, if necessary, another metal layer may be formed for example by electroplating onto the metal layer  thus formed by electroless plating. For electroplating there may be used a commonly-used metal such as copper or nickel, or an alloy thereof. The transparent film may be further subjected to electroless plating to enhance the electrical conductivity, or the metal layer  may be subjected to oxidation or sulfuration to effect blackening thereof, thereby causing a change in electrical conductivity or in color.","The pattern of the metal layer  in the present invention may take a stripe- or mesh-like shape. For example, it may be made mesh-like by combining plural such polygonal or circular shapes as triangular, quadrangular, hexagonal and octagonal shapes. The width W of the metal layer  is preferably 5-50 \u03bcm and the line-to-line space is preferably 100-700 \u03bcm. The metal layer may be biased to eliminate moir\u00e9. If the width W of the metal layer  is smaller than 5 \u03bcm, the metal layer will be deficient in electrical conductivity and there is a fear that it may be impossible to effect electromagnetic wave shielding to a satisfactory extent. If the metal layer width W exceeds 50 \u03bcm, it is likely that the light transparency will be deteriorated. Further, if the line-to-line space is smaller than 100 \u03bcm, there is a fear of light transparency being deteriorated, and if the space in question exceeds 700 \u03bcm, there is a fear of electrical conductivity being deteriorated.","The height T of the metal layer  is preferably 0.1-15 \u03bcm. If the metal layer  satisfies the condition of 1\u2266W\/T\u2266500 (width W, height T, of the metal layer ), it is possible to prevent the inclusion of air bubbles when the transparent film is laminated to another base material. If the W\/T ratio is less than 1, there will occur the inclusion of air bubbles upon lamination to another base material, with consequent fear of light transparency being deteriorated, and if the W\/T ratio exceeds 500, the metal layer itself may cause deterioration of light transparency or peeling of the metal layer may become easier to occur.","A further film may be laminated to the transparent, electrically conductive film of the present invention, and in case of using the transparent, electrically conductive film as an electromagnetic wave shielding material for display, a near infrared absorbing layer, a reflection preventing layer, a hard coating layer, an antifouling layer, or an antiglare layer, may be formed on the film.","The present invention will be described below in more detail by way of examples, but the invention is not limited to the following examples. Transparent, electrically conducive films produced by the following working and comparative examples were evaluated in the following manner.","(1) Concaves\/Convexes of Film and Height T of Metal Layer","A part of film was cut out and a thin piece thereof was cut out in a sectional direction with a microtome, then was observed and measured using a laser microscope (LEXT OLS3000, a product of Olympus Co., Ltd.).","(2) Width W of Metal Layer","The width of a metal layer of a transparent, electrically conductive film was measured from a surface of the same layer with use of a laser microscope (LEXT OLS3000, a product of Olympus Co., Ltd.).","(3) Electrical Conductivity","Measured using LORESTA AP (4-pin probe method) (a product of Mitsubishi Chemical Co., Ltd.).","(4) Transmittance","The transmittance of light (visible light) having a wavelength of 400 to 700 nm was measured using a spectromicroscope (MCPD2000, a product of Otsuka Electronics Co., Ltd.).","A layer containing silica (refractive index 1.46) with an average particle diameter of 0.1 \u03bcm was laminated to a surface of a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) film (light transmittance 92%, refractive index 1.55) having a thickness of 100 \u03bcm to afford a transparent film having concaves and convexes with an average height of 0.05 \u03bcm.
