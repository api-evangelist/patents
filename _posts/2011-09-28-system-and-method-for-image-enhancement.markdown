{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured, used, and\/or licensed by or for the United States Government.","This invention relates in general to a method of image processing, and more specifically relates to image enhancement.","Image processing is a form of signal processing for which the input is an image, such as a photograph or video frame, and the output is either image or a set of characteristics or parameters related to the image. Forms of image processing include face detection, feature detection, medical image processing, computer vision (extraction of information from an image by a computer), microscope image processing, etc.","Image resolution relates to the detail that an image possesses. For satellite images, the resolution generally correlates to the area represented by each pixel. Generally speaking, an image is considered to be more accurate and detailed as the area represented by each pixel is decreased. As used herein, the term images include digital images, film images, and\/or other types of images. Cameras taking pictures from great distances, such as aerial photos, may not obtain detailed information about the subject matter. Consequently, subtle or detail information are not present in the images.","When an image is captured by a monochrome camera, a single charge-coupled device (CCD) or complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) sensor is used to form an image via the light intensity projected onto the sensor.","In U.S. Pat. No. 7,536,012, to Meyers et al., entitled \u201cEntangled Quantum Communications and Quantum Imaging,\u201d there is disclosed, inter alia, a Quantum Imaging System (see Col. 8, line 50, et seq.) in which the sender sends an image of an image mask using entangled photons and coincidence measurements to a receiver. The system differs from the conventional quantum imaging set-up in that polarization beam splitters are placed in the path of the photons to provide two channels for each of the sender and the receiver, as shown in  of the '012 patent. On the sender's side, a photon beam is split by a beam splitter into first and second sub-beams. The first sub-beam is passed through a mask  which creates the image which is directed through a beam splitter  to bucket detectors , , which are operatively connected to a coincidence circuit. The second sub-beam is transmitted to the receiver without ever passing through the mask . In the embodiment of  of the '012 Patent, the receiver receives the second sub-beam and an image of the mask is constructed based upon photon coincident measurements composited from two photon detectors  and , also referred to a bucket detectors. The image of a mask is transmitted via coincidences and the photons transmitting the image have never encountered the image mask. Because of the somewhat puzzling nature or circumstances of the transmission, the process has been dubbed by some as \u201cGhost Imaging,\u201d while others have explained the effects as resulting from the quantum properties of light.","The present invention provides a method and system for the enhancement of images using the quantum properties of light. An embodiment of the present invention increases the image quality of an object or scene as seen by a detector. When a low quality detector is aimed at an object, a high quality image is generated using the quantum properties of light. A low quality detector picks up quantum information on the object shape and its temporal relations to reference fields. The reference fields may be recorded by the same imager (CCD, camera, etc.) that acts as a bucket detector (that is, it does not necessarily contain spatial information).","Current imaging methods are limited to the quality of the detector looking at the object being imaged. A preferred embodiment generates an improved quality image of the object without the object being imaged in high resolution directly. The preferred method may be used in connection with photographs taken during turbulent conditions.","A preferred embodiment comprises at least one processor, at least one memory operatively associated with the at least one processor, the at least one processor operating to perform the following steps not necessarily in the order recited:","(a) providing a series of frames of a given region of interest;","(b) determining the value of each pixel at each location within each frame to form a first array of pixel values for each frame;","(c) determining the overall intensity of each frame;","(d) determining the product of the overall intensity and the array of pixel values for each frame;","(e) determining the sum of the products by adding together the products of the overall frame intensity and first array of pixel values for each frame;","(f) determining the average of the sum of products by dividing the sum of products by the number of frames in the series of frames;","(g) determining the average value of each pixel at each pixel location for the series of frames to form a second array of average pixel values;","(h) determining the average overall frame intensity for the series of frames;","(i) determining a second product of the second array of average pixel values and the average overall frame intensity;","(j) subtracting the second product from the first product to provide an improved image of the region of interest.","An alternate embodiment comprises computing the average overall intensity of a plurality of frames and arranging the frames into two sets. A first set contains the frames having frame intensities greater than the average overall intensity for all frames; the average overall intensity being the summation of the intensities for frames divided by the number of frames. The second set containing frames having an overall intensity less than the average overall intensity. Each of the first and second sets is processed by repeating steps (a) through (i). The result obtained using the second set of frames is then subtracted from the result obtained using the first set of frames to create the image.","The embodiments herein and the various features and advantageous details thereof are explained more fully with reference to the non-limiting embodiments that are illustrated in the accompanying drawings and detailed in the following description. Descriptions of well-known components and processing techniques are omitted so as to not unnecessarily obscure the embodiments herein. The examples used herein are intended merely to facilitate an understanding of ways in which the embodiments herein may be practiced and to further enable those of skill in the art to practice the embodiments herein. Accordingly, the examples should not be construed as limiting the scope of the embodiments herein.","Rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout. As used herein the term \u201cand\/or\u201d includes any and all combinations of one or more of the associated listed items.","The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to limit the full scope of the invention. As used herein, the singular forms \u201ca\u201d, \u201can\u201d and \u201cthe\u201d are intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. It will be further understood that the terms \u201ccomprises\u201d and\/or \u201ccomprising,\u201d when used in this specification, specify the presence of stated features, integers, steps, operations, elements, and\/or components, but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, integers, steps, operations, elements, components, and\/or groups thereof.","Unless otherwise defined, all terms (including technical and scientific terms) used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. It will be further understood that terms, such as those defined in commonly used dictionaries, should be interpreted as having a meaning that is consistent with their meaning in the context of the relevant art and will not be interpreted in an idealized or overly formal sense unless expressly so defined herein.","The current invention utilizes the ability to increase the image quality of an object as seen by a detector using methods relating to the Quantum nature of light. When a low quality detector is aimed at an object, then a high quality image may be generated based on the quantum properties of light. The high quality image is generated even in the presence of turbulence which might otherwise be disruptive to image clarity. Scattering of quantum particles such as photons off the object carries information of the object shape even when the quantum particles such as photons do not go directly into the camera or detector. An additional low quality bucket detector (i.e. detector lacking spatial information) records quantum information on the object shape and its temporal relations to collocated reference fields. The reference fields are recorded by the same type of imager (CCD, Camera, etc.) that looks at the object and which act like bucket detectors in U.S. Pat. No. 7,536,012, hereby incorporated by reference.","Current Imaging methods are limited to the quality of the detector looking at the object being imaged. This invention enables an image quality improvement by using Ghost Imaging Inspired methods to generate a high quality image of the object without the object being imaged in high resolution directly. A preferred embodiment enables high quality imaging when only low quality images of the object are imaged directly.","Referring now to , in accordance with a preferred methodology, in Box  a series of frames are inputted into the memory or input of a processor or image processor. As used herein the terminology \u201cprocessor\u201d or \u201cimage processor\u201d as used in the following claims includes a computer, multiprocessor, CPU, minicomputer, microprocessor or any machine similar to a computer or processor which is capable of processing algorithms.

In Box , the frame data or value of each pixel at each pixel location is determined for a frame. In Box , the overall intensity of the frame is determined. The overall intensity correlates to a \u201cbucket value\u201d determination in that overall intensity value does not comprise spatial information. Instead, it correlates to the summation of the light intensity of a frame. In the case of a picture, the overall intensity correlates to the sum of the reflected illumination. In the case of an electronic display formed by pixels, the overall intensity is the summation each pixel value at each pixel location within a given frame. At Box , the values in Box  are multiplied by the value determined in Box . Box  represents the Frame Data\u00d7Intensity Product for the frame.

At Box , the products of Box  (Frame Data\u00d7Intensity Product) are repeated for each frame in a selected plurality of frames. As an example, one hundred frames may be selected. At Box , the summation of the Frame Data\u00d7Intensity Products for the plurality of frames determined in Box  is divided by the number of frames (such as for example one hundred) to determine the Frame Data\u00d7Intensity Product Average for the plurality of frames.

In Box A, the average overall intensity for the first set of frames is determined. This is similar to the determination of Box A except that Box A is a determination for a frame and Box A is an average for a plurality of frames.

A traffic enforcement camera (also road safety camera, road rule camera, photo radar, speed camera, Gatso\u2122) is an automated ticketing machine. It may include a camera which may be mounted besides, on, or over a highway or installed in an enforcement vehicle to detect traffic regulation violations, including speeding, vehicles going through a red traffic light, unauthorized use of a bus lane, for recording vehicles inside a congestion charge area and others. The latest automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) systems can be used for the detection of average speeds and use optical character recognition on images to read the license plates on vehicles. There are a number of possible factors that affect the ANPR software performance. One of these important factors is poor image resolution, usually because the plate is too far away but sometimes resulting from the use of a low-quality camera. In the case of camera recording a video (a sequence of images), this invention can process the recorded images to improve image quality of the license plate on vehicle. The enhanced license plate images are used to improve the performance of ANPR software.

Events involving a large crowd, especially the types of events including circuses, sporting events, theatrical events, concerts, rallies, parades, etc., the security task is to prevent, where possible, crimes including theft, vandalism or assault through the deployment of trained and licensed security personnel. Camera monitoring is an important component in this type of event security and management. The invention can be used to improve image details of a human face, nomenclature on a jersey, or a moving object\/vehicle, etc., from a distance, or from the periphery of the event location.
