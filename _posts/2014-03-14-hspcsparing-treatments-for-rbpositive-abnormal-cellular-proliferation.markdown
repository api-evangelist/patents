The entirety of each of these applications is hereby incorporated by reference for all purposes.","The U.S. Government has rights in this invention by virtue of support under Grant No. 5R44AI084284 awarded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.","This invention is in the area of improved compounds for and methods of treating selected RB-positive cancers and other Rb-positive abnormal cellular proliferative disorders while minimizing the deleterious effects on healthy cells, for example healthy Hematopoietic Stem Cells and Progenitor Cells (HSPCs), associated with current treatment modalities. In one aspect, improved treatment of select RB-positive cancers is disclosed using specific compounds disclosed herein. In certain embodiments, the compounds described herein act as highly selective and, in certain embodiments, short, transiently-acting cyclin-dependent kinase 4\/6 (CDK 4\/6) inhibitors when administered to subjects.","The regulation of the cell cycle is governed and controlled by specific proteins, which are activated and deactivated mainly through phosphorylation\/dephosphorylation processes in a precisely timed manner. The key proteins that coordinate the initiation, progression, and completion of cell-cycle program are cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs). Cyclin-dependent kinases belong to the serine\u2014threonine protein kinase family. They are heterodimeric complexes composed of a catalytic kinase subunit and a regulatory cyclin subunit. CDK activity is controlled by association with their corresponding regulatory subunits (cyclins) and CDK inhibitor proteins (Cip & Kip proteins, INK4s), by their phosphorylation state, and by ubiquitin-mediated proteolytic degradation (see D. G. Johnson, C. L. Walker, Annu Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol 39 (1999) 295-312; D. O. Morgan, Annu Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 13 (1997) 261-291; C. J. Sherr, Science 274 (1996) 1672-1677; T. Shimamura et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 16 (2006) 3751-3754).","There are four CDKs that are significantly involved in cellular proliferation: CDK1, which predominantly regulates the transition from G2 to M phase, and CDK2, CDK4, and CDK6, which regulate the transition from G1 to S phase (Malumbres M, Barbacid M. Cell cycle, CDKs and cancer: a changing paradigm. Nat. Rev. Cancer 2009; 9(3):153-166). In early to mid G1 phase, when the cell is responsive to mitogenic stimuli, activation of CDK4-cyclin D and CDK6-cyclin D induces phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (pRb). Phosphorylation of pRb releases the transcription factor E2F, which enters the nucleus to activate transcription of other cyclins which promote further progression of the cell cycle (see J. A. Diehl, Cancer Biol. Ther. 1 (2002) 226-231; C. J. Sherr, Cell 73 (1993) 1059-1065). CDK4 and CDK6 are closely related proteins with basically indistinguishable biochemical properties (see M. Malumbres, M. Barbacid, Trends Biochem. Sci. 30 (2005) 630-641).","A number of CDK 4\/6 inhibitors have been identified, including specific pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidines, 2-anilinopyrimidines, diaryl ureas, benzoyl-2,4-diaminothiazoles, indolo[6,7-a]pyrrolo[3,4-c]carbazoles, and oxindoles (see P. S. Sharma, R. Sharma, R. Tyagi, Curr. Cancer Drug Targets 8 (2008) 53-75). For example, WO 03\/062236 identifies a series of 2-(pyridin-2-ylamino-pyrido[2,3]pyrimidin-7-ones for the treatment of Rb positive cancers that show selectivity for CDK4\/6, including 6-acetyl-8-cyclopentyl-5-methyl-2-(5-piperazin-1-yl-pyridin-2-ylammino)-8H-pyrido-[2,3-d]-pyrimidin-7-one (PD0332991), which is currently being tested by Pfizer in late stage clinical trials as an anti-neoplastic agent against estrogen-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer. VanderWel et al. describe an iodine-containing pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine-7-one (CKIA) as a potent and selective CDK4 inhibitor (see VanderWel et al., J. Med. Chem. 48 (2005) 2371-2387). WO 99\/15500 filed by Glaxo Group Ltd discloses protein kinase and serine\/threonine kinase inhibitors. WO 2010\/020675 filed by Novartis AG describes pyrrolopyrimidine compounds as CDK inhibitors. WO 2011\/101409 also filed by Novartis describes pyrrolopyrimidines with CDK 4\/6 inhibitory activity. WO 2005\/052147 filed by Novartis and WO 2006\/074985 filed by Janssen Pharma disclose additional CDK4 inhibitors. WO 2012\/061156 filed by Tavares and assigned to G1 Therapeutics describes CDK inhibitors. WO 2013\/148748 filed by Francis Tavares and assigned to G1 Therapeutics describes Lactam Kinase Inhibitors.","While selective CDK4\/6 inhibitors are generally designed to target CDK4\/6-replication dependent cancers, the very fact that they inhibit CDK4\/6 activity may also result in deleterious effects to CDK4\/6-dependent healthy cells, for example their growth inhibition. CDK4\/6 activity is necessary for the production of healthy blood cells by the bone marrow, as healthy hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) require the activity of CDK4\/6 for proliferation (see Roberts et al. Multiple Roles of Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4\/6 Inhibitors in Cancer Therapy. JNCI 2012; 104(6):476-487). Healthy hematopoietic stem cells give rise to progenitor cells which in turn give rise to all the differentiated components of blood as shown in  (e.g., lymphocytes, erythrocytes, platelets, granulocytes, monocytes). Healthy hematopoietic cells display a gradient dependency on CDK4\/6 activity for proliferation during myeloid\/erythroid differentiation (see Johnson et al. Mitigation of hematological radiation toxicity in mice through pharmacological quiescence induced by CDK4\/6 inhibition. J Clin. Invest. 2010; 120(7): 2528-2536). Accordingly, the least differentiated cells (e.g., healthy hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), multi-potent progenitors (MPPs), and common myeloid progenitors (CMP)) appear to be the most dependent on CDK4\/6 activity for proliferation, and therefore the most deleteriously affected by the use of a CDK4\/6 inhibitor to treat a CDK4\/6 replication dependent cancer or other proliferative disorder.","Accordingly, there is an ongoing need for improved compounds, methods, and regimes to treat patients with select Rb-positive cancers and abnormal cellular proliferative disorders while minimizing the treatment's effect on healthy cells such as HSPCs.","Improved compounds, methods, and compositions are provided to treat select Rb-positive abnormal cellular proliferation including an Rb-positive cancer while minimizing the treatment's deleterious effects on healthy cells, such as healthy HSPCs and other CDK4\/6-replication dependent healthy cells by administration of an effective amount of a compound described herein.","In one embodiment of the invention, a compound is selected from the compounds of Formula I, II, III, IV, or V as described herein, or a pharmaceutically acceptable composition, salt, isotopic analog, or prodrug thereof.

In one embodiment, the Rb-positive abnormal cellular proliferation disorder is non-cancerous.","In certain embodiments, a compound described herein, when used to treat a select Rb-positive cellular proliferation disorder, such as a cancer, allows for a rapid reentry of healthy cells into the normal cell-cycle and a fast reconstitution of damaged tissue and progeny cells such as hematological cells. In this aspect, the compounds described herein when used to treat Rb-positive cancers eliminate, reduce, and\/or minimize the drug holidays and dose delays associated with the current anti-neoplastic use of CDK4\/6 inhibitors, allowing for the quick recovery of damaged blood cells through the replication and differentiation of progenitor and parent cells. Specifically, the invention includes administering to a patient having a cancer such as an Rb-positive cancer an effective amount of a compound described herein, wherein the compound has a pharmacokinetic and enzymatic half-life that provides for a transient, reversible G1 arrest of CDK4\/6-replication dependent cells. The compound can be any of those described in this application. Non-limiting examples of active compounds are described in Table 1, or a pharmaceutically acceptable composition, salt, isotopic analog, or prodrug thereof as provided below.","In one embodiment, a compound described herein may be useful in an improved method for treating a cancer such as an Rb-positive cancer, wherein such methods have reduced or minimized effects on CDK4\/6-replication dependent healthy cells due in part because they (i) utilize compounds that exhibit a pharmacokinetic and enzymatic half-life which provide for a relatively short, transient and reversible G1-arresting effect on CDK4\/6-replication dependent healthy cells and (ii) allow for a rapid, reentry into the cell cycle for the healthy cells following the cessation of administration or dissipation of therapeutically effective levels in the subject. Using a compound described herein allows for, for example, a reduction in the replication delay of the HSPCs due to CDK4\/6 inhibition and\/or accelerated hematopoietic cell lineage recovery following cessation of CDK4\/6 inhibitory activity and\/or reduced hematological deficiency because the utilized compound is short-acting, and reduces the length of off-cycle periods or drug holidays associated with current CDK4\/6 inhibitor treatment modalities which reduces or minimizes the facilitation of tumor drug resistance. In certain embodiments, the use of a compound described herein allows for the continuous treatment of the subject over a longer time period without the need for an off-cycle or drug holiday.","The timely resumption of CDK4\/6-replication dependent healthy cell proliferation is necessary for tissue repair, and an overly long period of healthy cell cell-cycle arrest, for example HSPC cell-cycle arrest, is undesirable. Despite reports indicating that the selective CDK4\/6 inhibitor PD0332991 is an effective inhibitor of Rb-positive breast cancers, it has been discovered that such inhibitor may not be the most ideal compound for use as a chemotherapeutic due to the excessive myelosuppressive effects of the compound. For example, PD0332991 has a relatively long-acting intra-cellular effect (see Roberts et al. Multiple Roles of Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4\/6 Inhibitors in Cancer Therapy. JCNI 2012; 104(6):476-487 ()), extending the transiency of G1 arrest of healthy cells such as HSPCs leading to dose limiting myelosuppression. Such a long acting effect delays, for example, the proliferation of HSPC cell lineages necessary to reconstitute the hematological cell lines that have been growth inhibited due to a treatment which may inhibit CDK4\/6 activity, and thus, Rb phosphorylation in Rb competent cells. While desirable for its anti-neoplastic effects, the long-acting G1 arrest provided by PD0332991 requires an extended off-cycle period in order to reconstitute the erythroid, platelet, and myeloid cells (monocyte and granulocyte) adversely effected by acute HSPC G1-arrest in order to limit myelosuppressive and allow a hematologic replication period. The use of a compound described herein as anti-neoplastic agent for the treatment of select Rb-positive cancers may eliminate, reduce, or minimize the required length of off-cycle periods or drug holidays, allowing for a longer effective CDK4\/6 inhibitory time period on the cancer over the course of an anti-neoplastic regime.","Thus in one embodiment, the invention includes administering a compound described herein, including one selected from Table 1 in an effective amount to a host suffering from a Rb-positive cancer in a treatment regime, wherein (either alone or in any combination thereof, each of which is considered specifically and independently described): i) a substantial portion of the CDK4\/6-replication dependent healthy cells (e.g. at least 80% or greater), for example HSPCs, return to or approach pre-treatment baseline cell cycle activity (i.e., reenter the cell-cycle) in less than 24 hours, 30 hours or 36 hours from the last administration of a compound described herein in humans; ii) a substantial portion of the CDK4\/6-replication dependent healthy cells, for example HSPCs, reenter the cell-cycle synchronously in less than 24 hours, 30 hours, or 36 hours from the last administration of a compound described herein; (iii) the dissipation of the compound's inhibitory effect on CDK4\/6-replication dependent healthy cells, for example HSPCs, occurs in less than 24 hours, 30 hours, or 36 hours from the administration of the compound; (iv) a substantial portion of the CDK4\/6-replication dependent healthy cells, for example HSPCs, return to or approach pre-treatment baseline cell cycle activity (i.e., reenter the cell-cycle) in less than 24 hours, 30 hours, or 36 hours from the dissipation of the compound's CDK4\/6 inhibitory effect; or (vi) a substantial portion of the CDK4\/6-replicatin dependent healthy cells, for example HSPCs, return to or approach pre-treatment baseline cell cycle activity (i.e. reenter the cell-cycle) within less than about 24 hours, about 30 hours, or about 36 hours from the point in which the administered compound's concentration level in the subject's blood drops below a therapeutic effective concentration.","In a central embodiment of the invention, a compound described herein can be administered in a concerted regimen with another agent such as a non-DNA-damaging, targeted anti-neoplastic agent or a hematopoietic growth factor agent for beneficial, additive, or synergistic effect against the abnormal cellular proliferation. It has been recently reported that the untimely administration of hematopoietic growth factors can have serious side effects. For example, the use of the EPO family of growth factors has been associated with arterial hypertension, cerebral convulsions, hypertensive encephalopathy, thromboembolism, iron deficiency, influenza like syndromes and venous thrombosis. The G-CSF family of growth factors has been associated with spleen enlargement and rupture, respiratory distress syndrome, allergic reactions and sickle cell complications. By combining the administration of a compound described herein and methods of the present invention with the timely administration of hematopoietic growth factors, for example, at the time point wherein the affected cells are no longer under growth arrest, it is possible for the health care practitioner to decrease the amount of the growth factor to minimize the unwanted adverse effects while achieving the desired therapeutic benefit. In one embodiment, the growth factor is administered upon cessation of the effect of the inhibitory effect of the compound on the CDK4\/6 replication dependent healthy cells, for example HSPCs. Thus, in this embodiment, the use of a selective CDK4\/6 inhibitor described herein in an anti-neoplastic therapeutic regime may allow the subject to receive a reduced amount of growth factor because the targeted hematopoietic cells will have reentered the cell cycle quicker than when other CDK4\/6 inhibitors, for example PD0332991. In addition, allowing rapid cell-cycle reentry following G1 arrest by using a compound described herein provides for the ability to time the administration of hematopoietic growth factors to assist in the reconstitution of hematopoietic cell lines to maximize the growth factor effect. As such, in one embodiment, the use of a compound or method described herein is combined with the use of a hematopoietic growth factor including, but not limited to, granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), thrombopoietin, interleukin (IL)-12, steel factor, and erythropoietin (EPO), or a derivative thereof. In one embodiment, the CDK4\/6 inhibitor is administered prior to administration of the hematopoietic growth factor. In one embodiment, the hematopoietic growth factor administration is timed so that the CDK4\/6 inhibitor's effect on HSPCs has dissipated.","In one embodiment, the use of a compound described herein is combined in a therapeutic regime with at least one other chemotherapeutic agent, and can be one that does not rely on proliferation or advancement through the cell-cycle for anti-proliferative activity. Such agent may include, but is not limited to, tamoxifen, midazolam, letrozole, bortezomib, anastrozole, goserelin, an mTOR inhibitor, a PI3 kinase inhibitors, dual mTOR-PI3K inhibitors, MEK inhibitors, RAS inhibitors, ALK inhibitors, HSP inhibitors (for example, HSP70 and HSP 90 inhibitors, or a combination thereof). Examples of mTOR inhibitors include but are not limited to rapamycin and its analogs, everolimus (Afinitor), temsirolimus, ridaforolimus, sirolimus, and deforolimus. Examples of P13 kinase inhibitors include but are not limited to Wortmannin, demethoxyviridin, perifosine, idelalisib, PX-866, IPI-145, BAY 80-6946, BEZ235, RP6503, TGR 1202 (RP5264), MLN1117 (INK1117), Pictilisib, Buparlisib, SAR245408 (XL147), SAR245409 (XL765), Palomid 529, ZSTK474, PWT33597, RP6530, CUDC-907, and AEZS-136. Examples of MEK inhibitors include but are not limited to Tametinib, Selumetinib, MEK162, GDC-0973 (XL518), and PD0325901. Examples of RAS inhibitors include but are not limited to Reolysin and siG12D LODER. Examples of ALK inhibitors include but are not limited to Crizotinib, AP26113, and LDK378. HSP inhibitors include but are not limited to Geldanamycin or 17-N-Allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17AAG), and Radicicol.","In certain embodiments, a compound described herein is administered to the subject prior to treatment with another chemotherapeutic agent, during treatment with another chemotherapeutic agent, after administration of another chemotherapeutic agent, or a combination thereof.

In one embodiment, the CDK4\/6-replication dependent healthy cells are HSPCs. In one embodiment, the use of a CDK4\/6 inhibitor described herein results in the G1-arresting effect dissipating so that the subject's CDK4\/6-replication dependent healthy cells return to or approach their pre-administration baseline cell-cycle activity within less than about 24 hours, 30 hours, 36 hours, 40 hours, or within less than about 48 hours from the point in which the CDK4\/6 inhibitor's concentration level in the subject's blood drops below a therapeutic effective concentration. In one embodiment, the G1-arresting effect dissipates so that the subject's CDK4\/6-replication dependent healthy cells return to their pre-administration baseline cell-cycle activity within about within less than about 24 hours, 30 hours, 36 hours, 40 hours, or 48 hours of the from the point in which the CDK4\/6 inhibitor's concentration level in the subject's blood drops below a therapeutic effective concentration.","In one embodiment, a compound described herein and useful in the described methods may be synchronous in its off-effect, that is, upon dissipation of the G1 arresting effect, CDK4\/6-replication dependent healthy cells exposed to a compound described herein reenter the cell-cycle in a similarly timed fashion. CDK4\/6-replication dependent healthy cells that reenter the cell-cycle do so such that the normal proportion of cells in G1 and S are reestablished quickly and efficiently, within less than about 24 hours, 30 hours, 36 hours, 40 hours, or within about 48 hours of the from the point in which the compound's concentration level in the subject's blood drops below a therapeutic effective concentration.","The rapid cell-cycle reentry associated with the compound's rapid off-effect advantageously allow for a larger number of CDK4\/6-replication dependent healthy cells to begin replicating upon dissipation of the G1 arrest compared with other CDK4\/6 inhibitors such as PD0332991. Accordingly, CDK4\/6-replication dependent healthy cells, such as HSPCs, can quickly begin to replicate during an off-cycle period or during administration periods.","The use of a compound as described herein in a therapeutic regime targeting CDK4\/6-replication dependent cancers can result in reduced anemia, reduced lymphopenia, reduced thrombocytopenia, or reduced neutropenia compared to that typically expected after, common after, or associated with treatment with currently available antineoplastic chemotherapeutic agents.

the use of compounds with desired isotopic substitutions of atoms, at amounts above the natural abundance of the isotope, i.e., enriched. Isotopes are atoms having the same atomic number but different mass numbers, i.e., the same number of protons but a different number of neutrons. By way of general example and without limitation, isotopes of hydrogen, for example, deuterium (H) and tritium (H) may be used anywhere in described structures. Alternatively or in addition, isotopes of carbon, e.g., C and C, may be used. A preferred isotopic substitution is deuterium for hydrogen at one or more locations on the molecule to improve the performance of the drug. The deuterium can be bound in a location of bond breakage during metabolism (an \u03b1-deuterium kinetic isotope effect) or next to or near the site of bond breakage (a \u03b2-deuterium kinetic isotope effect).","Substitution with isotopes such as deuterium can afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, such as, for example, increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements. Substitution of deuterium for hydrogen at a site of metabolic break down can reduce the rate of or eliminate the metabolism at that bond. At any position of the compound that a hydrogen atom may be present, the hydrogen atom can be any isotope of hydrogen, including protium (H), deuterium (H) and tritium (H). Thus, reference herein to a compound encompasses all potential isotopic forms unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.","The term \u201cisotopically-labeled\u201d analog refers to an analog that is a \u201cdeuterated analog\u201d, a \u201cC-labeled analog,\u201d or a \u201cdeuterated\/C-labeled analog.\u201d The term \u201cdeuterated analog\u201d means a compound described herein, whereby a H-isotope, i.e., hydrogen\/protium (H), is substituted by a H-isotope, i.e., deuterium (H). Deuterium substitution can be partial or complete. Partial deuterium substitution means that at least one hydrogen is substituted by at least one deuterium. In certain embodiments, the isotope is 90, 95 or 99% or more enriched in an isotope at any location of interest. In some embodiments it is deuterium that is 90, 95 or 99% enriched at a desired location.","Further specific compounds that fall within the present invention and that can be used in the disclosed methods of treatment and compositions include the structures of Formula I, II, III, IV, or V listed in Table 1 below.","Rb-Positive Cancers and Proliferative Disorders","In particular, the active compounds described herein can be used to treat a subject suffering from a Rb-positive cancer or other Rb-positive abnormal cellular proliferative disorder. In some embodiments, the cancer or cellular proliferation disorder is a CDK4\/6-replication dependent cancer or cellular proliferation disorder, which refers to a cancer or cellular proliferation disorder that requires the activity of CDK4\/6 for replication or proliferation, or which may be growth inhibited through the activity of a selective CDK4\/6 inhibitor. Cancers and disorders of such type can be characterized by (e.g., that has cells that exhibit) the presence of a functional Retinoblastoma protein. Such cancers and disorders are classified as being Rb-positive. Rb-positive abnormal cellular proliferation disorders, and variations of this term as used herein, refer to disorders or diseases caused by uncontrolled or abnormal cellular division which are characterized by the presence of a functional Retinoblastoma protein, which can include cancers. In one aspect of the present invention, the compounds and methods described herein can be used to treat a non-cancerous Rb-positive abnormal cellular proliferation disorder. Examples of such disorders may include non-malignant lymphoproliferation, non-malignant breast neoplasms, psoriasis, arthritis, dermatitis, pre-cancerous colon lesions or pulps, angiogenesis disorders, immune mediated and non-immune mediated inflammatory diseases, arthritis, age-related macular degeneration, diabetes, and other non-cancerous or benign cellular proliferation disorders.","Targeted cancers suitable for administration of a compound described herein may include Rb-positive: estrogen-receptor positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer, late-line metastatic breast cancer, liposarcoma, non-small cell lung cancer, liver cancer, ovarian cancer, glioblastoma, refractory solid tumors, retinoblastoma positive breast cancer as well as retinoblastoma positive endometrial, vaginal and ovarian cancers and lung and bronchial cancers, adenocarcinoma of the colon, adenocarcinoma of the rectum, central nervous system germ cell tumors, teratomas, estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer, estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer, familial testicular germ cell tumors, HER2-negative breast cancer, HER2-positive breast cancer, male breast cancer, ovarian immature teratomas, ovarian mature teratoma, ovarian monodermal and highly specialized teratomas, progesterone receptor-negative breast cancer, progesterone receptor-positive breast cancer, recurrent breast cancer, recurrent colon cancer, recurrent extragonadal germ cell tumors, recurrent extragonadal non-seminomatous germ cell tumor, recurrent extragonadal seminomas, recurrent malignant testicular germ cell tumors, recurrent melanomas, recurrent ovarian germ cell tumors, recurrent rectal cancer, stage III extragonadal non-seminomatous germ cell tumors, stage III extragonadal seminomas, stage III malignant testicular germ cell tumors, stage III ovarian germ cell tumors, stage IV breast cancers, stage IV colon cancers, stage IV extragonadal non-seminomatous germ cell tumors, stage IV extragonadal seminoma, stage IV melanomas, stage IV ovarian germ cell tumors, stage IV rectal cancers, testicular immature teratomas, testicular mature teratomas.

Mesothelioma, leiomyosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, squamous cell carcinoma; epidermoid carcinoma, malignant skin adnexal tumors, adenocarcinoma, hepatoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, hypernephroma, cholangiocarcinoma, transitional cell carcinoma, choriocarcinoma, seminoma, embryonal cell carcinoma, glioma anaplastic; glioblastoma multiforme, neuroblastoma, medulloblastoma, malignant meningioma, malignant schwannoma, neurofibrosarcoma, parathyroid carcinoma, medullary carcinoma of thyroid, bronchial carcinoid, pheochromocytoma, Islet cell carcinoma, malignant carcinoid, malignant paraganglioma, melanoma, Merkel cell neoplasm, cystosarcoma phylloide, salivary cancers, thymic carcinomas, bladder cancer, and Wilms tumor.","The presence or normal functioning of the retinoblastoma (Rb) tumor suppressor protein (Rb-positive) can be determined through any of the standard assays known to one of ordinary skill in the art, including but not limited to Western Blot, ELISA (enzyme linked immunoadsorbent assay), IHC (immunohistochemistry), and FACS (fluorescent activated cell sorting). The selection of the assay will depend upon the tissue, cell line or surrogate tissue sample that is utilized e.g., for example Western Blot and ELISA may be used with any or all types of tissues, cell lines or surrogate tissues, whereas the IHC method would be more appropriate wherein the tissue utilized in the methods of the present invention was a tumor biopsy. FACs analysis would be most applicable to samples that were single cell suspensions such as cell lines and isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. See for example, US 20070212736 \u201cFunctional Immunohistochemical Cell Cycle Analysis as a Prognostic Indicator for Cancer\u201d. Alternatively, molecular genetic testing may be used for determination of retinoblastoma gene status. Molecular genetic testing for retinoblastoma includes the following as described in Lohmann and Gallie \u201cRetinoblastoma. Gene Reviews\u201d (2010) or Parsam et al. \u201cA comprehensive, sensitive and economical approach for the detection of mutations in the RB  gene in retinoblastoma\u201d Journal of Genetics, 88(4), 517-527 (2009).","In some embodiments, the cancer to be treated is selected from estrogen-receptor positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer, late-line metastatic breast cancer, liposarcoma, non-small cell lung cancer, liver cancer, ovarian cancer, glioblastoma, refractory solid tumors, retinoblastoma positive breast cancer as well as retinoblastoma positive endometrial, vaginal and ovarian cancers and lung and bronchial cancers.","CDK-Replication Dependent Cells and Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitors","Tissue-specific stem cells and subsets of other resident proliferating cells are capable of self-renewal, meaning that they are capable of replacing themselves throughout the adult mammalian lifespan through regulated replication. Additionally, stem cells divide asymmetrically to produce \u201cprogeny\u201d or \u201cprogenitor\u201d cells that in turn produce various components of a given organ. For example, in the hematopoietic system, the hematopoietic stem cells give rise to progenitor cells which in turn give rise to all the differentiated components of blood (e.g., white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets) (see ).","It has been found that certain proliferating cells, such as HSPCs, require the enzymatic activity of the proliferative kinases cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) and\/or cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (CDK6) for cellular replication. In contrast, the majority of proliferating cells in adult mammals (e.g., the more differentiated blood-forming cells in the bone marrow) do not require the activity of CDK4 and\/or CDK6 (i.e., CDK4\/6). These differentiated cells can proliferate in the absence of CDK4\/6 activity by using other proliferative kinases, such as cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) or cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1).","The present invention includes methods of treating certain cancers, in particular Rb-positive cancers, while minimizing the deleterious effects on CDK4\/6-replication dependent healthy cells in a subject, and in particular, hematopoietic cells and\/or progenitor cells (HSPCs), by the administration of a compound described herein to treat a specific Rb-positive cancer.","In one embodiment, the use of a compound described herein as a chemotherapeutic allows for an accelerated hematological recovery and reduced hematological deficiency risk due to HSPC replication delay compared to the use of other CDK4\/6 inhibitors, for example, PD0332991.

By having a limited-term transient effect, the use of such compounds as chemotherapeutics allows for the faster reentry of the CDK4\/6-replication dependent healthy cells into the cell cycle following cessation of the treatment compared to, for example, longer acting CDK4\/6 inhibitors such as PD0332991. The quicker dissipation of the G1 arresting effect on CDK4\/6-replication dependent healthy cells makes such compounds preferable over longer acting CDK4\/6 inhibitors in situations where: 1) the subject will be exposed to closely spaced treatments, wherein the use of a longer acting CDK4\/6 inhibitor would prohibit the cycling of the CDK4\/6-replication dependent healthy cells between exposures; 2) continuous or long-term treatment regimens wherein the long-term G1 arrest of CDK4\/6-replication dependent healthy cells is a side effect of growth inhibition of the targeted cancer, and the subject would benefit from the CDK4\/6-replication dependent healthy cells quickly reentering the cell-cycle following cessation of the treatment regime, between dosing of the inhibitor in a continuous regime, or between breaks in treatment in order to limit replication delay, thus reducing, limiting, or ameliorating further healthy cell damage, for example bone marrow suppression, upon cessation of the treatment.

Such cycling allows CDK4\/6-replication dependent cells to regenerate damaged blood cell lineages between regular, repeated treatments, and reduces the risk associated with long term CDK4\/6 inhibition. This cycling between a state of G1-arrest and a state of replication is not feasible in limited time-spaced, repeated agent exposures using longer acting CDK4\/6 inhibitors such as PD0332991, as the lingering G1-arresting effect of the compound prohibit significant and meaningful reentry into the cell-cycle by the CDK4\/6-replication dependent cells before the next exposure to the CDK4\/6 inhibitor, or delay the healthy cells from entering the cell cycle and reconstituting damaged tissues or cells following treatment cessation.","In one embodiment, the use of a compound described herein provides for a rapid, reentry into the cell cycle by CDK4\/6-replication dependent healthy cells, for example HSPCs, so that the cells return to pre-treatment baseline cell cycle activity within less than about 40 hours, 36 hours, 30 hours, 28 hours, 24 hours or less.

In another embodiment, the compound is used in combination with a bispecific T-cell Engager (BiTE), which is an antibody designed to simultaneously bind to specific antigens on endogenous T cells and Rb-positive cancer cells as described herein, linking the two types of cells.","In one embodiment, the additional therapy is a monoclonal antibody (MAb). Some MAbs stimulate an immune response that destroys cancer cells. Similar to the antibodies produced naturally by B cells, these MAbs \u201ccoat\u201d the cancer cell surface, triggering its destruction by the immune system. For example, bevacizumab targets vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a protein secreted by tumor cells and other cells in the tumor's microenvironment that promotes the development of tumor blood vessels. When bound to bevacizumab, VEGF cannot interact with its cellular receptor, preventing the signaling that leads to the growth of new blood vessels. Similarly, cetuximab and panitumumab target the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and trastuzumab targets the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2). MAbs that bind to cell surface growth factor receptors prevent the targeted receptors from sending their normal growth-promoting signals. They may also trigger apoptosis and activate the immune system to destroy tumor cells. Another group of cancer therapeutic MAbs are the immunoconjugates. These MAbs, which are sometimes called immunotoxins or antibody-drug conjugates, consist of an antibody attached to a cell-killing substance, such as a plant or bacterial toxin, a chemotherapy drug, or a radioactive molecule. The antibody latches onto its specific antigen on the surface of a cancer cell, and the cell-killing substance is taken up by the cell. FDA-approved conjugated MAbs that work this way include ado-trastuzumab emtansine, which targets the HER-2 molecule to deliver the drug DM1, which inhibits cell proliferation, to HER-2 expressing metastatic breast cancer cells.","Immunotherapies with T cells engineered to recognize cancer cells via bispecific antibodies (bsAbs) or chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) are approaches with potential to ablate both dividing and non\/slow-dividing subpopulations of cancer cells.","Bispecific antibodies, by simultaneously recognizing target antigen and an activating receptor on the surface of an immune effector cell, offer an opportunity to redirect immune effector cells to kill cancer cells. The other approach is the generation of chimeric antigen receptors by fusing extracellular antibodies to intracellular signaling domains. Chimeric antigen receptor-engineered T cells are able to specifically kill tumor cells in a MHC-independent way.","In some embodiments, the compound can be administered to the subject in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents. If convenient, the compounds described herein can be administered at the same time as another chemotherapeutic agent, in order to simplify the treatment regimen.

Dose-dense chemotherapy is a chemotherapy treatment plan in which drugs are given with less time between treatments than in a standard chemotherapy treatment plan. Chemotherapy dose intensity represents unit dose of chemotherapy administered per unit time. Dose intensity can be increased or decreased through altering dose administered, time interval of administration, or both.","In one embodiment of the invention, the compounds described herein can be administered in a concerted regimen with another agent such as a non-DNA-damaging, targeted anti-neoplastic agent or a hematopoietic growth factor agent. It has been recently been reported that the untimely administration of hematopoietic growth factors can have serious side effects. For example, the use of the EPO family of growth factors has been associated with arterial hypertension, cerebral convulsions, hypertensive encephalopathy, thromboembolism, iron deficiency, influenza like syndromes and venous thrombosis. The G-CSF family of growth factors has been associated with spleen enlargement and rupture, respiratory distress syndrome, allergic reactions and sickle cell complications. By combining the administration of the short-lived selective compounds described herein and methods of the present invention with the timely administration of hematopoietic growth factors, for example, at the time point wherein the affected cells are no longer under growth arrest, it is possible for the health care practitioner to decrease the amount of the growth factor to minimize the unwanted adverse effects while achieving the desired therapeutic benefit. In one embodiment, the growth factor is administered upon cessation of the effect of the compound on the CDK4\/6 replication dependent healthy cells, for example HSPCs. Thus, in this embodiment, the use of a selective compound described herein in an anti-neoplastic therapeutic regime may allow the subject to receive a reduced amount of growth factor because the targeted hematopoietic cells will have reentered the cell cycle quicker than when other CDK4\/6 inhibitors, for example PD0332991. In addition, rapid cell-cycle reentry following G1 arrest using a compound described herein provides for the ability to time the administration of hematopoietic growth factors to assist in the reconstitution of hematopoietic cell lines to maximize the growth factor effect, that is, when the growth factors will be most effective. As such, in one embodiment, the use of the compounds or methods described herein is combined with the use of hematopoietic growth factors including, but not limited to, granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF, for example, sold as Neupogen (filgrastin), Neulasta (peg-filgrastin), or lenograstin), granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF, for example sold as molgramostim and sargramostim (Leukine)), M-CSF (macrophage colony stimulating factor), thrombopoietin (megakaryocyte growth development factor (MGDF), for example sold as Romiplostim and Eltrombopag) interleukin (IL)-12, interleukin-3, interleukin-11 (adipogenesis inhibiting factor or oprelvekin), SCF (stem cell factor, steel factor, kit-ligand, or KL) and erythropoietin (EPO), and their derivatives (sold as for example epoetin-\u03b1 as Darbopoetin, Epocept, Nanokine, Epofit, Epogin, Eprex and Procrit; epoetin-\u03b2 sold as for example NeoRecormon, Recormon and Micera), epoetin-delta (sold as for example Dynepo), epoetin-omega (sold as for example Epomax), epoetin zeta (sold as for example Silapo and Reacrit) as well as for example Epocept, EPOTrust, Erypro Safe, Repoeitin, Vintor, Epofit, Erykine, Wepox, Espogen, Relipoeitin, Shanpoietin, Zyrop and EPIAO). In one embodiment, the CDK4\/6 inhibitor is administered prior to administration of the hematopoietic growth factor. In one embodiment, the hematopoietic growth factor administration is timed so that the compound's effect on HSPCs has dissipated. In one embodiment, the growth factor is administered at least 20 hours after the administration of a compound described herein.","If desired, multiple doses of a compound described herein can be administered to the subject. Alternatively, the subject can be given a single dose of a compound described herein. For example, a compound can be administered so that CDK4\/6-replication dependent healthy cells are G1 arrested wherein, due to the rapid dissipation of the G1-arresting effect of the compounds, a significant number of healthy cells reenter the cell-cycle and are capable of replicating shortly after exposure, for example, within about 24-48 hours or less, and continue to replicate until a following administration of the compound. In one embodiment, the compound is administered to allow for the cycling of the CDK4\/6-replication dependent healthy cells between G1-arrest and reentry into the cell-cycle to accommodate a repeated-dosing treatment regimen, for example a long term repeated-dosing treatment regime.","In some embodiments, the CDK4\/6-replication dependent healthy cells can be arrested for longer periods, for example, over a period of hours, days, weeks and\/or months, through multiple, limited-time separated administrations of a compound described herein. Because of the rapid reentry into the cell cycle by CDK4\/6-replication dependent healthy cells, for example HSPCs, upon dissipation of the compounds inhibitory intra-cellular effects, the cells are capable of reconstituting the cell lineages faster than CDK4\/6 inhibitors with longer G1 arresting profiles, for example PD0332991.","The reduction in side effects, in particular myelosuppression, afforded by the compounds described herein can allow for dose intensification (e.g., more therapy can be given in a fixed period of time), which will translate to better efficacy. Therefore, the presently disclosed methods can result in regimens that are less toxic and more effective. When appropriate, the small molecules can be formulated for oral, topical, intranasal, inhalation, intravenous or any other desired form of administration.","A compound useful in the methods described herein is a selective CDK4\/6 inhibitor compound that selectively inhibit at least one of CDK4 and CDK6 or through the inhibition of cellular replication of an Rb-positive cancer. In one embodiment, the compounds described herein have an ICfor CDK4 as measured in a CDK4\/CycD1 ICphosphorylation assay that is at least 1500 times or greater lower than the compound's ICs for CDK2 as measured in a CDK2\/CycE ICphosphorylation assay. In one embodiment, the CDK4\/6 inhibitors are at least about 10 times or greater more potent (i.e., have an ICin a CDK4\/CycD1 phosphorylation assay that is at least 10 times or more lower) than PD0332991.","The use of a compound as described herein can induce selective G1 arrest in CDK4\/6-dependent cells (e.g., as measured in a cell-based in vitro assay). In one embodiment, the CDK4\/6 inhibitor is capable of increasing the percentage of CDK4\/6-dependent cells in the G1 phase, while decreasing the percentage of CDK4\/6-dependent cells in the G2\/M phase and S phase. In one embodiment, the compound induces substantially pure (i.e., \u201cclean\u201d) G1 cell cycle arrest in the CDK4\/6-dependent cells, e.g., wherein treatment with the compound induces cell cycle arrest such that the majority of cells are arrested in G1 as defined by standard methods (e.g. propidium iodide (PI) staining or others) with the population of cells in the G2\/M and S phases combined being less than about 30%, about 25%, about 20%, about 15%, about 10%, about 5%, about 3% or less of the total cell population. Methods of assessing the cell phase of a population of cells are known in the art (see, for example, in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2002\/0224522) and include cytometric analysis, microscopic analysis, gradient centrifugation, elutriation, fluorescence techniques including immunofluorescence, and combinations thereof. Cytometric techniques include exposing the cell to a labeling agent or stain, such as DNA-binding dyes, e.g., PI, and analyzing cellular DNA content by flow cytometry. Immunofluorescence techniques include detection of specific cell cycle indicators such as, for example, thymidine analogs (e.g., 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) or an iododeoxyuridine), with fluorescent antibodies.","In some embodiments, the use of a compound described herein result in reduced or substantially free of off-target effects, particularly related to inhibition of kinases other than CDK4 and or CDK6 such as CDK2, as the compounds described herein are poor inhibitors (e.g., >1 uM IC) of CDK2. Furthermore, because of the high selectivity for CDK4\/6, the use of the compounds described herein should not induce cell cycle arrest in CDK4\/6-independent cells. In addition, because of the short transient nature of the G1-arrest effect, the CDK4\/6-replication dependent healthy cells more quickly reenter the cell-cycle than, comparatively, use of PD0332991 provides, resulting in the reduced risk of, in one embodiment, hematological deficiency during long term treatment regimens due to the ability of HSPCs to replicate between treatments.","In one aspect of the invention, a compound disclosed herein can be beneficially administered in combination with any therapeutic regimen entailing radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or other therapeutic agents. In additional embodiments the compounds disclosed herein can be beneficially administered in combination with therapeutic agents targeting auto-immune disorders.","Drug Conjugates","In one embodiment, the activity of an active compound for a purpose described herein can be augmented through conjugation to an agent that targets the diseased or abnormally proliferating cell or otherwise enhances activity, delivery, pharmacokinetics or other beneficial property.","For example, the compound can be administered as an antibody-drug conjugates (ADC). In certain embodiments, a selected compound described herein can be administered in conjugation or combination with an antibody or antibody fragment. Fragments of an antibody can be produced through chemical or genetic mechanisms. The antibody fragment can be an antigen binding fragment. For example, the antigen binding fragment can be selected from an Fab, Fab\u2032, (Fab\u2032)2, or Fv. The antibody fragment can be a Fab. Monovalent F(ab) fragments have one antigen binding site. The antibody can be a divalent (Fab\u2032)2 fragment, which has two antigen binding regions that are linked by disulfide bonds. In one embodiment, the antigen fragment is a (Fab\u2032). Reduction of F(ab\u2032)2 fragments produces two monovalent Fab\u2032 fragments, which have a free sulfhydryl group that is useful for conjugation to other molecules.","A selected compound described herein can be administered in conjugation or combination with a Fv fragment. Fv fragments are the smallest fragment made from enzymatic cleavage of IgG and IgM class antibodies. Fv fragments have the antigen-binding site made of the VH and VC regions, but they lack the CH1 and CL regions. The VH and VL chains are held together in Fv fragments by non-covalent interactions.","In one embodiment, a selected compound as described herein can be administered in combination with an antibody fragment selected from the group consisting of an ScFv, domain antibody, diabody, triabody, tetrabody, Bis-scFv, minibody, Fab2, or Fab3 antibody fragment. In one embodiment, the antibody fragment is a ScFv. Genetic engineering methods allow the production of single chain variable fragments (ScFv), which are Fv type fragments that include the VH and VL domains linked with a flexible peptide When the linker is at least 12 residues long, the ScFv fragments are primarily monomeric. Manipulation of the orientation of the V-domains and the linker length creates different forms of Fv molecules Linkers that are 3-11 residues long yield scFv molecules that are unable to fold into a functional Fv domain. These molecules can associate with a second scFv molecule, to create a bivalent diabody. In one embodiment, the antibody fragment administered in combination with a selected compound described herein is a bivalent diabody. If the linker length is less than three residues, scFv molecules associate into triabodies or tetrabodies. In one embodiment, the antibody fragment is a triabody. In one embodiment, the antibody fragment is a tetrabody. Multivalent scFvs possess greater functional binding affinity to their target antigens than their monovalent counterparts by having binding to two more target antigens, which reduces the off-rate of the antibody fragment. In one embodiment, the antibody fragment is a minibody. Minibodies are scFv-CH3 fusion proteins that assemble into bivalent dimers. In one embodiment, the antibody fragment is a Bis-scFv fragment. Bis-scFv fragments are bispecific. Miniaturized ScFv fragments can be generated that have two different variable domains, allowing these Bis-scFv molecules to concurrently bind to two different epitopes.","In one embodiment, a selected compound described herein is administered in conjugation or combination with a bispecific dimer (Fab2) or trispecific dimer (Fab3). Genetic methods are also used to create bispecific Fab dimers (Fab2) and trispecific Fab trimers (Fab3). These antibody fragments are able to bind 2 (Fab2) or 3 (Fab3) different antigens at once.","In one embodiment, a selected compound described herein is administered in conjugation or combination with an rIgG antibody fragment. rIgG antibody fragments refers to reduced IgG (75,000 daltons) or half-IgG. It is the product of selectively reducing just the hinge-region disulfide bonds. Although several disulfide bonds occur in IgG, those in the hinge-region are most accessible and easiest to reduce, especially with mild reducing agents like 2-mercaptoethylamine (2-MEA). Half-IgG are frequently prepared for the purpose of targeting the exposing hinge-region sulfhydryl groups that can be targeted for conjugation, either antibody immobilization or enzyme labeling.","In other embodiments, a selected active compound described herein can be linked to a radioisotope to increase efficacy, using methods well known in the art. Any radioisotope that is useful against Rb-positive cancer cells can be incorporated into the conjugate, for example, but not limited to, I, I, Ir, P, Sr, Au, Ra, Y, Am, Cf, Co, or Cs.","Of note, the linker chemistry can be important to efficacy and tolerability of the drug conjugates. The thio-ether linked T-DM1 increases the serum stability relative to a disulfide linker version and appears to undergo endosomal degradation, resulting in intra-cellular release of the cytotoxic agent, thereby improving efficacy and tolerability, See, Barginear, M.

The amount and timing of active compound administered will, of course, be dependent on the host being treated, the instructions of the supervising medical specialist, on the time course of the exposure, on the manner of administration, on the pharmacokinetic properties of the particular active compound, and on the judgment of the prescribing physician. Thus, because of host to host variability, the dosages given below are a guideline and the physician can titrate doses of the compound to achieve the treatment that the physician considers appropriate for the host. In considering the degree of treatment desired, the physician can balance a variety of factors such as age and weight of the host, presence of preexisting disease, as well as presence of other diseases. Pharmaceutical formulations can be prepared for any desired route of administration including, but not limited to, oral, intravenous, or aerosol administration, as discussed in greater detail below.","The therapeutically effective dosage of any active compound described herein will be determined by the health care practitioner depending on the condition, size and age of the patient as well as the route of delivery. In one non-limited embodiment, a dosage from about 0.1 to about 200 mg\/kg has therapeutic efficacy, with all weights being calculated based upon the weight of the active compound, including the cases where a salt is employed. In some embodiments, the dosage can be the amount of compound needed to provide a serum concentration of the active compound of up to between about 1 and 5, 10, 20, 30, or 40 \u03bcM. In some embodiments, a dosage from about 10 mg\/kg to about 50 mg\/kg can be employed for oral administration. Typically, a dosage from about 0.5 mg\/kg to 5 mg\/kg can be employed for intramuscular injection. In some embodiments, dosages can be from about 1 \u03bcmol\/kg to about 50 \u03bcmol\/kg, or, optionally, between about 22 \u03bcmol\/kg and about 33 \u03bcmol\/kg of the compound for intravenous or oral administration. An oral dosage form can include any appropriate amount of active material, including for example from 5 mg to, 50, 100, 200, or 500 mg per tablet or other solid dosage form.","In accordance with the presently disclosed methods, pharmaceutically active compounds as described herein can be administered orally as a solid or as a liquid, or can be administered intramuscularly, intravenously, or by inhalation as a solution, suspension, or emulsion. In some embodiments, the compounds or salts also can be administered by inhalation, intravenously, or intramuscularly as a liposomal suspension. When administered through inhalation the active compound or salt can be in the form of a plurality of solid particles or droplets having any desired particle size, and for example, from about 0.01, 0.1 or 0.5 to about 5, 10, 20 or more microns, and optionally from about 1 to about 2 microns. Compounds as disclosed in the present invention have demonstrated good pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics properties, for instance when administered by the oral or intravenous routes.","The pharmaceutical formulations can comprise an active compound described herein or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, in any pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. If a solution is desired, water may be the carrier of choice for water-soluble compounds or salts. With respect to the water-soluble compounds or salts, an organic vehicle, such as glycerol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, or mixtures thereof, can be suitable. In the latter instance, the organic vehicle can contain a substantial amount of water. The solution in either instance can then be sterilized in a suitable manner known to those in the art, and for illustration by filtration through a 0.22-micron filter. Subsequent to sterilization, the solution can be dispensed into appropriate receptacles, such as depyrogenated glass vials. The dispensing is optionally done by an aseptic method. Sterilized closures can then be placed on the vials and, if desired, the vial contents can be lyophilized.","In addition to the active compounds or their salts, the pharmaceutical formulations can contain other additives, such as pH-adjusting additives. In particular, useful pH-adjusting agents include acids, such as hydrochloric acid, bases or buffers, such as sodium lactate, sodium acetate, sodium phosphate, sodium citrate, sodium borate, or sodium gluconate. Further, the formulations can contain antimicrobial preservatives. Useful antimicrobial preservatives include methylparaben, propylparaben, and benzyl alcohol. An antimicrobial preservative is typically employed when the formulations is placed in a vial designed for multi-dose use. The pharmaceutical formulations described herein can be lyophilized using techniques well known in the art.","For oral administration a pharmaceutical composition can take the form of solutions, suspensions, tablets, pills, capsules, powders, and the like. Tablets containing various excipients such as sodium citrate, calcium carbonate and calcium phosphate may be employed along with various disintegrants such as starch (e.g., potato or tapioca starch) and certain complex silicates, together with binding agents such as polyvinylpyrrolidone, sucrose, gelatin and acacia. Additionally, lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate, sodium lauryl sulfate, and talc are often very useful for tableting purposes. Solid compositions of a similar type may be employed as fillers in soft and hard-filled gelatin capsules. Materials in this connection also include lactose or milk sugar as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols. When aqueous suspensions and\/or elixirs are desired for oral administration, the compounds of the presently disclosed host matter can be combined with various sweetening agents, flavoring agents, coloring agents, emulsifying agents and\/or suspending agents, as well as such diluents as water, ethanol, propylene glycol, glycerin and various like combinations thereof.","In yet another embodiment of the host matter described herein, there are provided injectable, stable, sterile formulations comprising an active compound as described herein, or a salt thereof, in a unit dosage form in a sealed container. The compound or salt is provided in the form of a lyophilizate, which is capable of being reconstituted with a suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carrier to form liquid formulation suitable for injection thereof into a host. When the compound or salt is substantially water-insoluble, a sufficient amount of emulsifying agent, which is physiologically acceptable, can be employed in sufficient quantity to emulsify the compound or salt in an aqueous carrier. Particularly useful emulsifying agents include phosphatidyl cholines and lecithin.","Additional embodiments provided herein include liposomal formulations of the active compounds disclosed herein. The technology for forming liposomal suspensions is well known in the art. When the compound is an aqueous-soluble salt, using conventional liposome technology, the same can be incorporated into lipid vesicles. In such an instance, due to the water solubility of the active compound, the active compound can be substantially entrained within the hydrophilic center or core of the liposomes. The lipid layer employed can be of any conventional composition and can either contain cholesterol or can be cholesterol-free. When the active compound of interest is water-insoluble, again employing conventional liposome formation technology, the salt can be substantially entrained within the hydrophobic lipid bilayer that forms the structure of the liposome. In either instance, the liposomes that are produced can be reduced in size, as through the use of standard sonication and homogenization techniques. The liposomal formulations comprising the active compounds disclosed herein can be lyophilized to produce a lyophilizate, which can be reconstituted with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, such as water, to regenerate a liposomal suspension.","Pharmaceutical formulations also are provided which are suitable for administration as an aerosol by inhalation. These formulations comprise a solution or suspension of a desired compound described herein or a salt thereof, or a plurality of solid particles of the compound or salt. The desired formulations can be placed in a small chamber and nebulized. Nebulization can be accomplished by compressed air or by ultrasonic energy to form a plurality of liquid droplets or solid particles comprising the compounds or salts. The liquid droplets or solid particles may for example have a particle size in the range of about 0.5 to about 10 microns, and optionally from about 0.5 to about 5 microns. In one embodiment, the solid particles provide for controlled release through the use of a degradable polymer. The solid particles can be obtained by processing the solid compound or a salt thereof, in any appropriate manner known in the art, such as by micronization. Optionally, the size of the solid particles or droplets can be from about 1 to about 2 microns. In this respect, commercial nebulizers are available to achieve this purpose. The compounds can be administered via an aerosol suspension of respirable particles in a manner set forth in U.S. Pat. No. 5,628,984, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","Pharmaceutical formulations also are provided which provide a controlled release of a compound described herein, including through the use of a degradable polymer, as known in the art.","When the pharmaceutical formulations suitable for administration as an aerosol is in the form of a liquid, the formulations can comprise a water-soluble active compound in a carrier that comprises water. A surfactant can be present, which lowers the surface tension of the formulations sufficiently to result in the formation of droplets within the desired size range when hosted to nebulization.","The term \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable salts\u201d as used herein refers to those salts which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with hosts (e.g., human hosts) without undue toxicity, irritation, allergic response, and the like, commensurate with a reasonable benefit\/risk ratio, and effective for their intended use, as well as the zwitterionic forms, where possible, of the compounds of the presently disclosed host matter.","Thus, the term \u201csalts\u201d refers to the relatively non-toxic, inorganic and organic acid addition salts of the presently disclosed compounds. These salts can be prepared during the final isolation and purification of the compounds or by separately reacting the purified compound in its free base form with a suitable organic or inorganic acid and isolating the salt thus formed. Basic compounds are capable of forming a wide variety of different salts with various inorganic and organic acids. Acid addition salts of the basic compounds are prepared by contacting the free base form with a sufficient amount of the desired acid to produce the salt in the conventional manner. The free base form can be regenerated by contacting the salt form with a base and isolating the free base in the conventional manner. The free base forms may differ from their respective salt forms in certain physical properties such as solubility in polar solvents. Pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salts may be formed with metals or amines, such as alkali and alkaline earth metal hydroxides, or of organic amines. Examples of metals used as cations, include, but are not limited to, sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, and the like. Examples of suitable amines include, but are not limited to, N,N\u2032-dibenzylethylenediamine, chloroprocaine, choline, diethanolamine, ethylenediamine, N-methylglucamine, and procaine. The base addition salts of acidic compounds are prepared by contacting the free acid form with a sufficient amount of the desired base to produce the salt in the conventional manner. The free acid form can be regenerated by contacting the salt form with an acid and isolating the free acid in a conventional manner. The free acid forms may differ from their respective salt forms somewhat in certain physical properties such as solubility in polar solvents.","Salts can be prepared from inorganic acids sulfate, pyrosulfate, bisulfate, sulfite, bisulfite, nitrate, phosphate, monohydrogenphosphate, dihydrogenphosphate, metaphosphate, pyrophosphate, chloride, bromide, iodide such as hydrochloric, nitric, phosphoric, sulfuric, hydrobromic, hydriodic, phosphorus, and the like. Representative salts include the hydrobromide, hydrochloride, sulfate, bisulfate, nitrate, acetate, oxalate, valerate, oleate, palmitate, stearate, laurate, borate, benzoate, lactate, phosphate, tosylate, citrate, maleate, fumarate, succinate, tartrate, naphthylate mesylate, glucoheptonate, lactobionate, laurylsulphonate and isethionate salts, and the like. Salts can also be prepared from organic acids, such as aliphatic mono- and dicarboxylic acids, phenyl-substituted alkanoic acids, hydroxy alkanoic acids, alkanedioic acids, aromatic acids, aliphatic and aromatic sulfonic acids, etc. and the like. Representative salts include acetate, propionate, caprylate, isobutyrate, oxalate, malonate, succinate, suberate, sebacate, fumarate, maleate, mandelate, benzoate, chlorobenzoate, methylbenzoate, dinitrobenzoate, phthalate, benzenesulfonate, toluenesulfonate, phenylacetate, citrate, lactate, maleate, tartrate, methanesulfonate, and the like. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts can include cations based on the alkali and alkaline earth metals, such as sodium, lithium, potassium, calcium, magnesium and the like, as well as non-toxic ammonium, quaternary ammonium, and amine cations including, but not limited to, ammonium, tetramethylammonium, tetraethylammonium, methylamine, dimethylamine, trimethylamine, triethylamine, ethylamine, and the like. Also contemplated are the salts of amino acids such as arginate, gluconate, galacturonate, and the like. See, for example, Berge et al., J. Pharm.

Six mice per group were dosed by oral gavage at 150 mg\/kg of Compound T, Compound Q, Compound GG, or vehicle only. Four hours before animals were sacrificed and the bone marrow was harvested, mice were treated with 100 \u03bcg of EdU by intraperitoneal injection.

Human, mouse, and dog liver microsomes were purchased from Xenotech, and Sprague-Dawley rat liver microsomes were prepared by Absorption Systems. The reaction mixture comprising 0.5 mg\/mL of liver microsomes, 100 mM of potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 5 mM of magnesium chloride, and 1 uM of test compound was prepared. The test compound was added into the reaction mixture at a final concentration of 1 uM. An aliquot of the reaction mixture (without cofactor) was incubated in shaking water bath at 37 deg. C. for 3 minutes. The control compound, testosterone, was run simultaneously with the test compound in a separate reaction. The reaction was initiated by the addition of cofactor (NADPH), and the mixture was then incubated in a shaking water bath at 37 deg. C. Aliquots (100 \u03bcL) were withdrawn at 0, 10, 20, 30, and 60 minutes for the test compound and 0, 10, 30, and 60 minutes for testosterone. Test compound samples were immediately combined with 100 \u03bcL, of ice-cold acetonitrile containing internal standard to terminate the reaction. Testosterone samples were immediately combined with 800 \u03bcL, of ice cold 50\/50 acetonitrile\/dH2O containing 0.1% formic acid and internal standard to terminate the reaction. The samples were assayed using a validated LC-MS\/MS method. Test compound samples were analyzed using the Orbitrap high resolution mass spectrometer to quantify the disappearance of parent test compound and detect the appearance of metabolites. The peak area response ration (PARR) to internal standard was compared to the PARR at time 0 to determine the percent of test compound or positive control remaining at time-point. Half-lives were calculated using GraphPad software, fitting to a single-phase exponential decay equation.","Half-life was calculated based on t1\/2=0.693 k, where k is the elimination rate constant based on the slope plot of natural logarithm percent remaining versus incubation time. When calculated half-life was longer than the duration of the experiment, the half-life was expressed as >the longest incubation time. The calculated half-life is also listed in parentheses. If the calculated half-life is >2\u00d7 the duration of the experiment, no half-life was reported. The timely resumption of cellular proliferation is necessary for tissue repair, and therefore an overly long period of arrest is undesirable in healthy cells such as HSPCs. The characteristics of a CDK4\/6 inhibitor that dictate its arresting duration are its pharmacokinetic (PK) and enzymatic half-lives. Once initiated, a G1-arrest in vivo will be maintained as long as circulating compound remains at an inhibitory level, and as long as the compound engages the enzyme. PD032991, for example, possesses an overall long PK half-life and a fairly slow enzymatic off-rate. In humans, PD0332991 exhibits a PK half-life of 27 hours (see Schwartz, G K et al. (2011) BJC, 104:1862-1868). In humans, a single administration of PD0332991 produces a cell cycle arrest of HSPC lasting approximately one week. This reflects the 6 days to clear the compound (5 half-lives\u00d727 hour half-life), as well as an additional 1.5 to 2 days of inhibition of enzymatic CDK4\/6 function. This calculation suggests that it takes a total of 7+ days for normal bone marrow function to return, during which time new blood production is reduced. These observations may explain the severe granulocytopenia seen with PD0332991 in the clinic.","Further experiments were completed with Compound T and PD0332991 to compare the metabolic stability (half-life) in human, dog, rat, monkey, and mouse liver microsomes. As shown in , when analyzing the stability of the compounds in liver microsomes across species, the determinable half-life of Compound T is shorter in each species compared to that reported for PD0332991. Furthermore, as previously described above and in , it appears that PD0332991 also has an extended enzymatic half-life, as evidenced by the production of a pronounced cell cycle arrest in human cells lasting more than forty hours even after compound is removed from the cell culture media (i.e., in an in vitro wash-out experiment). As further shown in , removal of the compounds described herein from the culture media leads to a rapid resumption of proliferation, consistent with a rapid enzymatic off rate. These differences in enzymatic off rates translate into a marked difference in pharmacodynamic (PD) effect, as shown in . As shown, a single oral dose of PD0332991 produces a 36+ hour growth arrest of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) in murine bone marrow, which is greater than would be explained by the 6 hour PK half-life of PD0332991 in mice. In contrast, the effect of Compound T is much shorter, allowing a rapid re-entry into the cell cycle, providing exquisite in vivo control of HSPC proliferation.","A HER2-driven model (Rb-positive) of breast cancer (Muller W J, Sinn E, Pattengale P K, Wallace R, Leder P.

Mice were enrolled in therapy studies when tumors reached a standard size (50-60 mm3) that permitted easy serial assessment. Tumor-bearing mice were continuously treated with Compound T added to their chow (100 mg\/kg\/d or 150 mg\/kg\/d). MMTV-c-neu (control, n=9; Compound T 100 mg\/kg, n=7; Compound T 150 mg\/kg, n=6) mice were examined weekly to assess tumor development by palpation. Tumor volumes were calculated by the formula, Volume=[(width)\u00d7length]\/2. Tumor-bearing mice were euthanized at the indicated times due to predefined morbidity, tumor ulceration, or a tumor size of more than 1.5 cm in diameter.","As shown in , continuous treatment with Compound T (100 mg\/kg\/d or 150 mg\/kg\/d) led to a marked reduction in tumor volume during a 28 day course of therapy. Several tumors displayed complete tumor regression and no resistance to Compound T was noted during the 28 day course of therapy. These data show that this HER2-driven mouse model is \u2018addicted\u2019 to CDK4\/6 activity for proliferation and Compound T is an effective agent in CDK4\/6 dependent, Rb-positive tumors.","Preclinical characterization of compound T, compound GG, and compound U indicates that they inhibit CDK4 and CDK6 with an ICof 0.7-1.0 nM and 5-6 nM, respectively. In tumor cells with functional Rb protein, these compounds potently inhibit Rb phosphorylation resulting in a G1 arrest. The in vivo efficacy of the CDK4\/6 inhibitors compound T, compound GG, and compound U was tested in the genetically engineered mouse model of luminal breast cancer. Tumors were serially assessed weekly using caliper measurements. Therapeutic intervention began once tumors reached 40-64 mm. Tumor volume was calculated using the formula ((Width)\u00d7Length)\/2. All three compounds were administered orally via medicated diets (100 mg\/kg\/d). Medicated diets were administered for 28 consecutive days and then stopped. RECIST criteria were used to assess objective response rates. The objective response rates were categorized based on the percentage change in tumor volume, using the following categories: CR (complete response)=100% response; PR (partial response)=at least a 30% decrease; SD (stable disease)=no change (not a PR and not a PD); and PD (progressive disease)=20% increase.","As shown in , objective responses were noted in mice treated with compound T, compound GG, and compound U. Treatment groups were well tolerated with no clinical signs of toxicity, no weight loss and no deaths associated with toxicity. The linear regression t-test was used to determine statistical significance of tumor volume growth over time. All three cohorts were statistically significant compared to non-treated cohorts; compound T, p<0.0001; compound GG, p=0.0001; compound U, p<0.0001. As shown in , the number of animals in each objective category was determined. Compound T was found to have a 100% objective response rate (n=7), Compound GG was found to have an 85% objective response rate (n=7), and Compound U was found to have a 100% objective response rate (n=8). In , the tumor volumes from the MMTV-Neu mice treated with compound T, compound GG, and compound U are shown, with tumor volumes being measured every seven days. In , the data for the best response (14 days or later) is shown for each individual tumor. Taken together, these data show that continuous treatment with compound T (100 mg\/kg), compound GG, (100 mg\/kg), or compound U (100 mg\/kg) led to a marked decrease in tumor volume during a 28 day course of therapy.","To test the ability of CDK4\/6 inhibitors to induce a clean G1-arrest, a cell based screening method was used consisting of two CDK4\/6-dependent cell lines (tHS68 and WM2664; Rb-positive) and one CDK4\/6-independent (A2058; Rb-negative) cell line. Twenty-four hours after plating, each cell line was treated with Compound T in a dose dependent manner for 24 hours. At the conclusion of the experiment, cells were harvested, fixed, and stained with propidium iodide (a DNA intercalator), which fluoresces strongly red (emission maximum 637 nm) when excited by 488 nm light. Samples were run on Dako Cyan flow cytometer and >10,000 events were collected for each sample. Data were analyzed using FlowJo 2.2 software developed by TreeStar, Inc.","In , results show that Compound T induces a robust G1 cell cycle arrest, as nearly all cells are found in the G0-G1 phase upon treatment with increasing amounts of Compound T. In , the results show that in CDK4\/6-dependent cell lines, Compound T induced a robust G1 cell cycle arrest with an ECof 80 nM in tHS68 cells with a corresponding reduction in S-phase ranging from 28% at baseline to 6% at the highest concentration shown. Upon treatment with Compound T (300 nM), there was a similar reduction in the S-phase population and an increase in G1-arrested cells in both CDK4\/6-dependent cell lines (tHS68 (Compare ) and WM2664 (Compare )), but not in the CDK4\/6-independent (A2058; Compare ) cell line. The CDK4\/6-independent cell line shows no effect in the presence of inhibitor.","The CDK4\/6-cyclin D complex is essential for progression from G1 to the S-phase of the DNA cell cycle. This complex phosphorylates the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (Rb). To demonstrate the impact of CDK4\/6 inhibition on Rb phosphorylation (pRb), Compound T was exposed to three cell lines, two CDK4\/6 dependent (tHS68, WM2664; Rb-positive) and one CDK4\/6 independent (A2058; Rb-negative). Twenty four hours after seeding, cells were treated with Compound T at 300 nM final concentration for 4, 8, 16, and 24 hours. Samples were lysed and protein was assayed by western blot analysis. Rb phosphorylation was measured at two sites targeted by the CDK4\/6-cyclin D complex, Ser780 and Ser807\/811 using species specific antibodies. Results demonstrate that Compound T blocks Rb phosphorylation in Rb-dependent cell lines by 16 hours post exposure, while having no effect on Rb-independent cells ().","This specification has been described with reference to embodiments of the invention.
