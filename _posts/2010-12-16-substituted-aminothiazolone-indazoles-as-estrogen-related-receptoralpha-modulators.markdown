61\/287,740, filed on Dec. 18, 2009, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.","The present invention relates to certain novel compounds, methods for preparing compounds, compositions, intermediates and derivatives thereof and for treating conditions such as cancer, arthritis, inflammatory airway disease, and metabolic disorders. More particularly, the compounds of the present invention are Estrogen Related Receptor alpha (ERR-\u03b1) modulators useful for treating, ameliorating, preventing or inhibiting the progression of disease states, disorders, and conditions mediated by ERR-\u03b1 activity.","Nuclear receptors are members of a superfamily of transcription factors. The members of this family share structural similarities and regulate a diverse set of biological effects (Olefsky, J. M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001, 276(40), 36863-36864). Ligands activate or repress these transcription factors that control genes involved in metabolism, differentiation and reproduction (Laudet, V. and H. Gronmeyer. The Nuclear Receptor Factbooks. 2002, San Diego: Academic Press). Presently, the human genome project has identified about 48 members for this family and cognate ligands have been identified for about 28 of them (Giguere, V. Endocrine Rev. 1999, 20(5), 689-725). This protein family is composed of modular structural domains that can be interchanged within the members of the family without loss of function. A typical nuclear receptor contains a hypervariable N-terminus, a conserved DNA binding domain (DBD), a hinge region, and a conserved ligand-binding domain (LBD). The function of the DBD is targeting of the receptor to specific DNA sequences (Nuclear Hormone Receptor (NHR) response elements or NREs), and the function of the LBD is recognition of its cognate ligand. Within the sequence of the nuclear receptor there are regions involved in transcriptional activation. The Activation Function 1 (AF-1) domain is situated at the N-terminus and constitutively activates transcription (Rochette-Egly, C. et al. Cell 1997, 90, 97-107; Rochette-Egly, C. et al. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992, 6, 2197-2209), while the Activation Function 2 (AF-2) domain is embedded within the LBD and its transcriptional activation is ligand dependent (Wurtz, J. M. et al. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996, 3, 87-94). Nuclear receptors can exist as monomers, homodimers or heterodimers and bind to direct or inverted nucleotide repeats (Laudet and Gronmeyer, 2002; Aranda, A. and A. Pascual. Physiol. Rev. 2001, 81(3), 1269-1304).","The members of this family exist either in an activated or repressed basal biological state. The basic mechanism of gene activation involves ligand dependent exchange of co-regulatory proteins. These co-regulatory proteins are referred to as co-activators or co-repressors (McKenna, L. J. et al. Endocrine Rev. 1999, 20, 321-344). A nuclear receptor in the repressed state is bound to its DNA response element and is associated with co-repressor proteins that recruit histone de-acetylases (HDACs) (Jones, P. L. and Y. B. Shi. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2003, 274, 237-268). In the presence of an agonist there is an exchange of co-repressors with co-activators that in turn recruit transcription factors that assemble into an ATP dependent chromatin-remodeling complex. Histones are hyper-acetylated, causing the nucleosome to unfold, and repression is alleviated. The AF-2 domain acts as the ligand dependent molecular switch for the exchange of co-regulatory proteins. In the presence of an agonist the AF-2 domain undergoes a conformational transition and presents a surface on the LBD for interaction with co-activator proteins. In the absence of an agonist or in the presence of an antagonist the AF-2 domain presents a surface that promotes interactions with co-repressor proteins. The interaction surfaces on the LBD for both co-activators, and co-repressors overlap and provide a conserved molecular mechanism for gene activation or repression that is shared by the members of this family of transcription factors (Xu, H. E. et al. Nature 2002, 415 (6873), 813-817).","Natural ligands that modulate the biological activity of nuclear receptors have been identified for only approximately one half of known nuclear receptors. Receptors for which no natural ligand has been identified are termed \u201corphan receptors.\u201d The discovery of ligands or compounds that interact with an orphan receptor will accelerate the understanding of the role of the nuclear receptors in physiology and disease and facilitate the pursuit of new therapeutic approaches Estrogen related receptors (ERRs) constitutes a sub-class of these receptors where no ligand has been identified.","ERR-\u03b1 (also known as ERR-1), an orphan receptor, is the first of the three identified members of the estrogen receptor related subfamily of orphan nuclear receptors (ERR-\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3). The ERR subfamily is closely related to the estrogen receptors (ER-\u03b1 and ER-\u03b2). ERR-\u03b1 and ERR-\u03b2 were first isolated by a low stringency hybridization screen (Giguere, V. et al. Nature 1988, 331, 91-94) followed later with the discovery of ERR-\u03b3 (Hong, H. et al. J. Biol. Chem. 1999, 274, 22618-22626). The ERRs and ERs share sequence similarity with the highest homology observed in their DBDs, approximately 60%, and all interact with the classical DNA estrogen response element. Recent biochemical evidence suggested that the ERRs and ERs share target genes, including pS2, lactoferin, aromatase and osteopontin, and share co-regulator proteins (Giguere, V. Trends in Endocrinol. Metab. 2002, 13, 220-225; Vanacker, J. M. et al. EMBO J. 1999, 18, 4270-4279; Kraus, R. J. et al. J. Biol. Chem. 2002, 272, 24286-24834; Hong et al., 1999; Zhang, Z. and C. T. Teng. J. Biol. Chem. 2000, 275, 20387-20846). Therefore, one of the main functions of ERR is to regulate the response of estrogen responsive genes. The effect of the steroid hormone estrogen is primarily mediated in the breast, bone and endometrium. Thus, the identification of compounds that will interact with ERRs should provide a benefit for the treatment of bone related disease, breast cancer and reproduction.","ERR-\u03b1 is shown to be present both in normal and breast cancer tissue (Ariazi, E. A. et al. Cancer Res. 2002, 62, 6510-6518). It has been reported that the main function of ERR-\u03b1 in normal breast tissue is that of a repressor for estrogen responsive genes. In breast cancers or cell lines that are non-estrogen responsive (ER-\u03b1 negative), ERR-\u03b1 has been reported to be in an activated state (Ariazi et al., 2002). Therefore, compounds that will interact with ERR-\u03b1 may be useful agents for the treatment of breast cancer that is ER-\u03b1 negative and non-responsive to classical anti-estrogenic therapy, or may be used as an adjunct agent for anti-estrogen responsive breast cancers. These agents may act as antagonists by reducing the biological activity of ERR-\u03b1 in these particular tissues.","Many post-menopausal women experience osteoporosis, a condition that is a result of the reduction of estrogen production. Reduction of estrogen levels results in an increase of bone loss (Turner, R. T. et al. Endocrine Rev. 1994, 15(3), 275-300). An anabolic effect on bone development has been observed on the administration of estrogens to postmenopausal patients with osteoporosis (Pacifici, R. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1996, 11(8), 1043-1051) but the molecular mechanism is unknown since ER-a and ER-b knock-out animals have minor skeletal defects, where the action of estrogens is typically mediated (Korach, K. S. Science 1994, 266, 1524-1527; Windahl, S. H. et al. J. Clin. Invest. 1999, 104(7), 895-901). Expression of ERR-\u03b1 in bone is regulated by estrogen (Bonnelye, E. et al. Mol. Endocrin. 1997, 11, 905-916; Bonnelye, E. et al. J. Cell Biol. 2001, 153, 971-984). ERR-\u03b1 is maintained throughout osteoblast differentiation stages. Over-expression of ERR-\u03b1 in rat calvaria osteoblasts, an accepted model of bone differentiation, results in an increase of bone nodule formation, while treatment of rat calvaria osteoblasts with ERR-\u03b1 antisense results in a decrease of bone nodule formation. ERR-\u03b1 also regulates osteopontin, a protein believed to be involved in bone matrix formation. Therefore compounds that will modulate ERR-\u03b1 by increasing its activity can have an anabolic effect for the regeneration of bone density and provide a benefit over current approaches that prevent bone loss, but have no anabolic effect. Such compounds can enhance the activity of the receptor by two possible mechanisms: i) enhancing the association of the receptor with proteins that enhance its activity or improve the stability of the receptor; and ii) increasing the intracellular concentrations of the receptor and consequently increasing its activity. Conversely, with respect to bone diseases that are a result of abnormal bone growth, compounds that will interact with ERR-\u03b1 and decrease its biological activity may provide a benefit for the treatment of these diseases by retarding bone growth. Antagonism of the association of the receptor with co-activator proteins decreases the activity of the receptor.","ERR-\u03b1 is also present in cardiac, adipose, and muscle tissue and forms a transcriptional active complex with the PGC-1 co-activator family, co-activators implicated with energy homeostasis, mitochondria biogenesis, hepatic gluconeogenesis and in the regulation of genes involved in fatty acid beta-oxidation (Kamei, Y. et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 2003, 100(21), 12378-12383). ERR-\u03b1 regulates the expression of the medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase promoter (MCAD). Medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase is a gene involved in the initial reaction in fatty acid beta-oxidation. It is believed that in the adipose tissue ERR-\u03b1 regulates energy expenditure through the regulation of MCAD (Sladek, R. et al. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997, 17, 5400-5409; Vega, R. B. and D. P. Kelly. J. Biol. Chem. 1997, 272, 31693-31699). In antisense experiments in rat calvaria osteoblasts, in addition to the inhibition of bone nodule formation, there was an increase in adipocyte differentiation markers including aP2 and PPAR-\u03b3 (Bonnelye, E. et al. Endocrinology 2002, 143, 3658-3670). Recently an ERR-\u03b1 knockout model has been described that exhibited reduced fat mass relative to the wild type and DNA chip analysis data indicated alteration of the expression levels of genes involved in adipogenesis and energy metabolism (Luo, J. et al. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003, 23(22), 7947-7956). More recently it has been shown that ERR-\u03b1 regulates the expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase, a gene that has a protective mechanism against arteriosclerosis (Sumi, D. and L. J. Ignarro. Proc Natl. Acad. Sci. 2003, 100, 14451-14456). The biochemical evidence supports the involvement of ERR-\u03b1 in metabolic homeostasis and differentiation of cells into adipocytes. Therefore, compounds interacting with ERR-\u03b1 can affect energy homeostasis and may therefore provide a benefit for the treatment of obesity and metabolic syndrome related disease indications, including arteriosclerosis and diabetes (Grundy, S.

In particular, the invention also provides a method for treating or inhibiting the progression of breast cancer, arthritis, inflammatory airway disease, or metabolic disorders, and associated symptoms or complications thereof in a subject, wherein the method comprises administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of the invention.","The present invention includes within its scope prodrugs of the compounds of this invention. In general, such prodrugs will be functional derivatives of the compounds which are readily convertible in vivo into the required compound. Thus, in the methods of treatment of the present invention, the term \u201cadministering\u201d shall encompass the treatment of the various disorders described with the compound specifically disclosed or with a compound which may not be specifically disclosed, but which converts to the specified compound in vivo after administration to the subject. Conventional procedures for the selection and preparation of suitable prodrug derivatives are described, for example, in \u201c\u201d, ed. H. Bundgaard, Elsevier, 1985.","Some of the crystalline forms for the compounds may exist as polymorphs and as such are intended to be included in the present invention. In addition, some of the compounds may form solvates with water (i.e., hydrates) or common organic solvents, and such solvates are intended to be encompassed within the scope of this invention.","Where the processes for the preparation of the compounds according to the invention give rise to mixtures of stereoisomers, these isomers may be separated by conventional techniques such as preparative chromatography. The compounds may be prepared in racemic form or as individual enantiomers or diasteromers by either stereospecific synthesis or by resolution.

The compounds may also be resolved by formation of stereoisomeric esters or amides, followed by chromatographic separation and removal of the chiral auxiliary. Alternatively, the compounds may be resolved using a chiral HPLC column. It is to be understood that all stereoisomers, racemic mixtures, diastereomers, cis-trans isomers, and enantiomers thereof are encompassed within the scope of the present invention.","E) Use","1. Dosages","Those of skill in the treatment of disorders, diseases, or conditions mediated by ERR-\u03b1 can determine the effective daily amount from the test results presented hereinafter and other information. The exact dosage and frequency of administration depends on the particular compound of invention used, the particular condition being treated, the severity of the condition being treated, the age, weight and general physical condition of the particular patient as well as other medication the patient may be taking, as is well known to those skilled in the art. Furthermore, it is evident that said effective daily amount may be lowered or increased depending on the response of the treated patient and\/or depending on the evaluation of the physician prescribing the compounds of the instant invention. The effective daily amount ranges mentioned herein are therefore only guidelines in practicing the present invention.","Preferably, the method for the treatment of the ERR-\u03b1 disorders described in the present invention using any of the compounds as defined herein, the dosage form will contain a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier containing between from about 0.1 mg to about 5000 mg; particularly from about 0.5 mg to about 1000 mg; and, more particularly, from about 1 mg to about 100 mg of the compound, and may be constituted into any form suitable for the mode of administration selected. The dosages, however, may be varied depending upon the requirement of the subjects, the severity of the condition being treated and the compound being employed. The use of either daily administration or post-periodic dosing may be employed.","The pharmaceutical compositions herein will contain, per unit dosage unit, e.g., tablet, capsule, powder, injection, suppository, teaspoonful and the like, of from about 0.001 mg\/kg\/day to about 10 mg\/kg\/day (particularly from about 0.01 mg\/kg\/day to about 1 mg\/kg\/day; and, more particularly, from about 0.1 mg\/kg\/day to about 0.5 mg\/kg\/day) and may be given at a dosage of from about 0.001 mg\/kg\/day to about 30 mg\/kg\/day (particularly from about 0.01 mg\/kg\/day to about 2 mg\/kg\/day, more particularly from about 0.1 mg\/kg\/day to about 1 mg\/kg\/day and even more particularly from about 0.5 mg\/kg\/day to about 1 mg\/kg\/day).","Preferably these compositions are in unit dosage forms from such as tablets, pills, capsules, dry powders for reconstitution or inhalation, granules, lozenges, sterile parenteral solutions or suspensions, metered aerosol or liquid sprays, drops, ampoules, autoinjector devices or suppositories for administration by oral, intranasal, sublingual, intraocular, transdermal, parenteral, rectal, vaginal, dry powder inhaler or other inhalation or insufflation means. Alternatively, the composition may be presented in a form suitable for once-weekly or once-monthly administration; for example, an insoluble salt of the active compound, such as the decanoate salt, may be adapted to provide a depot preparation for intramuscular injection.","For preparing solid pharmaceutical compositions such as tablets, the principal active ingredient is mixed with a pharmaceutical carrier, e.g. conventional tableting ingredients such as diluents, binders, adhesives, disintegrants, lubricants, antiadherents and gildants. Suitable diluents include, but are not limited to, starch (i.e. corn, wheat, or potato starch, which may be hydrolized), lactose (granulated, spray dried or anhydrous), sucrose, sucrose-based diluents (confectioner's sugar; sucrose plus about 7 to 10 weight percent invert sugar; sucrose plus about 3 weight percent modified dextrins; sucrose plus invert sugar, about 4 weight percent invert sugar, about 0.1 to 0.2 weight percent cornstarch and magnesium stearate), dextrose, inositol, mannitol, sorbitol, microcrystalline cellulose (i.e. AVICEL\u2122 microcrystalline cellulose available from FMC Corp.), dicalcium phosphate, calcium sulfate dihydrate, calcium lactate trihydrate and the like. Suitable binders and adhesives include, but are not limited to acacia gum, guar gum, tragacanth gum, sucrose, gelatin, glucose, starch, and cellulosics (i.e. methylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, ethylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose, and the like), water soluble or dispersible binders (i.e. alginic acid and salts thereof, magnesium aluminum silicate, hydroxyethylcellulose [i.e. TYLOSE\u2122 available from Hoechst Celanese], polyethylene glycol, polysaccharide acids, bentonites, polyvinylpyrrolidone, polymethacrylates and pregelatinized starch) and the like. Suitable disintegrants include, but are not limited to, starches (corn, potato, etc.), sodium starch glycolates, pregelatinized starches, clays (magnesium aluminum silicate), celluloses (such as crosslinked sodium carboxymethylcellulose and microcrystalline cellulose), alginates, pregelatinized starches (i.e. corn starch, etc.), gums (i.e. agar, guar, locust bean, karaya, pectin, and tragacanth gum), cross-linked polyvinylpyrrolidone and the like. Suitable lubricants and antiadherents include, but are not limited to, stearates (magnesium, calcium and sodium), stearic acid, talc waxes, stearowet, boric acid, sodium chloride, DL-leucine, carbowax 4000, carbowax 6000, sodium oleate, sodium benzoate, sodium acetate, sodium lauryl sulfate, magnesium lauryl sulfate and the like.

Grace\/Davison, and AEROSIL\u2122 silica available from Degussa) and the like. Sweeteners and flavorants may be added to chewable solid dosage forms to improve the palatability of the oral dosage form. Additionally, colorants and coatings may be added or applied to the solid dosage form for ease of identification of the drug or for aesthetic purposes. These carriers are formulated with the pharmaceutical active to provide an accurate, appropriate dose of the pharmaceutical active with a therapeutic release profile.","Generally these carriers are mixed with the pharmaceutical active to form a solid preformulation composition containing a homogeneous mixture of the pharmaceutical active form of the present invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. Generally the preformulation will be formed by one of three common methods: (a) wet granulation, (b) dry granulation and (c) dry blending. When referring to these preformulation compositions as homogeneous, it is meant that the active ingredient is dispersed evenly throughout the composition so that the composition may be readily subdivided into equally effective dosage forms such as tablets, pills and capsules. This solid preformulation composition is then subdivided into unit dosage forms of the type described above containing from about 0.1 mg to about 500 mg of the active ingredient of the present invention. The tablets or pills containing the novel compositions may also be formulated in multilayer tablets or pills to provide a sustained or provide dual-release products. For example, a dual release tablet or pill can comprise an inner dosage and an outer dosage component, the latter being in the form of an envelope over the former. The two components can be separated by an enteric layer, which serves to resist disintegration in the stomach and permits the inner component to pass intact into the duodenum or to be delayed in release. A variety of materials can be used for such enteric layers or coatings, such materials including a number of polymeric materials such as shellac, cellulose acetate (i.e. cellulose acetate phthalate, cellulose acetate trimellitate), polyvinyl acetate phthalate, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose phthalate, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose acetate succinate, methacrylate and ethylacrylate copolymers, methacrylate and methyl methacrylate copolymers and the like. Sustained release tablets may also be made by film coating or wet granulation using slightly soluble or insoluble substances in solution (which for a wet granulation acts as the binding agents) or low melting solids a molten form (which in a wet granulation may incorporate the active ingredient). These materials include natural and synthetic polymers waxes, hydrogenated oils, fatty acids and alcohols (i.e. beeswax, carnauba wax, cetyl alcohol, cetylstearyl alcohol, and the like), esters of fatty acids metallic soaps, and other acceptable materials that can be used to granulate, coat, entrap or otherwise limit the solubility of an active ingredient to achieve a prolonged or sustained release product.","The liquid forms in which the novel compositions of the present invention may be incorporated for administration orally or by injection include, but are not limited to aqueous solutions, suitably flavored syrups, aqueous or oil suspensions, and flavored emulsions with edible oils such as cottonseed oil, sesame oil, coconut oil or peanut oil, as well as elixirs and similar pharmaceutical vehicles. Suitable suspending agents for aqueous suspensions, include synthetic and natural gums such as, acacia, agar, alginate (i.e. propylene alginate, sodium alginate and the like), guar, karaya, locust bean, pectin, tragacanth, and xanthan gum, cellulosics such as sodium carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, hydroxymethylcellulose, hydroxyethylcellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, and combinations thereof, synthetic polymers such as polyvinyl pyrrolidone, carbomer (i.e. carboxypolymethylene), and polyethylene glycol; clays such as bentonite, hectorite, attapulgite or sepiolite; and other pharmaceutically acceptable suspending agents such as lecithin, gelatin or the like. Suitable surfactants include but are not limited to sodium docusate, sodium lauryl sulfate, polysorbate, octoxynol-9, nonoxynol-10, polysorbate 20, polysorbate 40, polysorbate 60, polysorbate 80, polyoxamer 188, polyoxamer 235 and combinations thereof. Suitable deflocculating or dispersing agent include pharmaceutical grade lecithins. Suitable flocculating agent include but are not limited to simple neutral electrolytes (i.e. sodium chloride, potassium, chloride, and the like), highly charged insoluble polymers and polyelectrolyte species, water soluble divalent or trivalent ions (i.e. calcium salts, alums or sulfates, citrates and phosphates (which can be used jointly in formulations as pH buffers and flocculating agents). Suitable preservatives include but are not limited to parabens (i.e. methyl, ethyl, n-propyl and n-butyl), sorbic acid, thimerosal, quaternary ammonium salts, benzyl alcohol, benzoic acid, chlorhexidine gluconate, phenylethanol and the like. There are many liquid vehicles that may be used in liquid pharmaceutical dosage forms, however, the liquid vehicle that is used in a particular dosage form must be compatible with the suspending agent(s). For example, nonpolar liquid vehicles such as fatty esters and oils liquid vehicles are best used with suspending agents such as low HLB (Hydrophile-Lipophile Balance) surfactants, stearalkonium hectorite, water insoluble resins, water insoluble film forming polymers and the like. Conversely, polar liquids such as water, alcohols, polyols and glycols are best used with suspending agents such as higher HLB surfactants, clays silicates, gums, water soluble cellulosics, water soluble polymers and the like. For parenteral administration, sterile suspensions and solutions are desired. Liquid forms useful for parenteral administration include sterile solutions, emulsions and suspensions. Isotonic preparations which generally contain suitable preservatives are employed when intravenous administration is desired.","Furthermore, compounds of the present invention can be administered in an intranasal dosage form via topical use of suitable intranasal vehicles or via transdermal skin patches, the composition of which are well known to those of ordinary skill in that art. To be administered in the form of a transdermal delivery system, the administration of a therapeutic dose will, of course, be continuous rather than intermittent throughout the dosage regimen.","Compounds of the present invention can also be administered in the form of liposome delivery systems, such as small unilamellar vesicles, large unilamellar vesicles, multilamellar vesicles and the like. Liposomes can be formed from a variety of phospholipids, such as cholesterol, stearylamine, phosphatidylcholines and the like.","The daily dose of a pharmaceutical composition of the present invention may be varied over a wide range from about 0.1 mg to about 5000 mg; preferably, the dose will be in the range of from about 1 mg to about 100 mg per day for an average human. For oral administration, the compositions are preferably provided in the form of tablets containing, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.5, 5.0, 10.0, 15.0, 25.0, 50.0, 100, 150, 200, 250 or 500 milligrams of the active ingredient for the symptomatic adjustment of the dosage to the subject to be treated. Advantageously, a compound of the present invention may be administered in a single daily dose or the total daily dosage may be administered in divided doses of two, three or four times daily.","It is also apparent to one skilled in the art that the therapeutically effective dose for active compounds of the invention or a pharmaceutical composition thereof will vary according to the desired effect. Therefore, optimal dosages to be administered may be readily determined by those skilled in the art, and will vary with the particular compound used, the mode of administration, the strength of the preparation, and the advancement of the disease condition. In addition, factors associated with the particular subject being treated, including subject age, weight, diet and time of administration, will result in the need to adjust the dose to an appropriate therapeutic level. The above dosages are thus exemplary of the average case. There can, of course, be individual instances where higher or lower dosage ranges are merited, and such are within the scope of this invention.","Compounds of this invention may be administered in any of the foregoing compositions and dosage regimens or by means of those compositions and dosage regimens established in the art whenever use of the compounds of the invention as ERR-\u03b1 modulators is required for a subject in need thereof.","2.

fa\/fa is a monogenic model of frank diabetes due to a mutation on the fa gene truncating the leptin receptor and preventing its interaction with its peptide hormone. This mutation results in a hyperphagic phenotype and the rodent develops obesity, hyperlipidemia, fasting hyperglycemia and insulin resistance. Zucker fa\/fa male rats were received at four weeks of age and allowed to acclimate for one week. At five weeks of age the animals were single housed in cages in a temperature-controlled room with 12-hour light\/dark cycle. The rats were allowed ad libitum access to water and food and throughout the study were maintained on a Purina 5008 diet. Animals were sorted based primarily on fed insulin levels and circulating triglycerides. Animals were dosed orally once a day in the morning for 4 days. The vehicle used was either 20% HP\u03b2CD (Hydroxypropyl Beta Cyclodextrin) or 15% Vitamin E\/30% PEG-400 (Polyethylene Glycol 400). Fed insulin and triglycerides were measured using blood collected from the tail vein at day 5.
