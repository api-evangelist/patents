title: Push registry application programming interface for capturing events
abstract: A mobile communications device, method, and medium are provided for capturing and handling a wide range of communication events. A registrar populates a push registry with information corresponding to an event handler. The registrar associates the event handler with a trigger event and stores the association in the push registry. An event receiver identifies an occurrence of the trigger event and calls an application management system (AMS) so that the AMS can initiate the event handler. Event filters, which can include user-definable filters, are applied to communication events according to filter definitions associated with the event handler.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Many currently available Java mobile communications devices include an Application Management System (AMS) that allows for lifecycle management of Java applications. In addition to allowing for manual initiation of applications, the AMS allows for initiating (e.g., launching) applications based on specific triggers defined through the Java PushRegistry Application Programming Interface (API). The triggers presently supported by the PushRegistry API are limited to time-based alarms, arrival of user datagram protocol (UDP) packets, and arrival of short message service (SMS) messages. Thus, current mobile platforms fail to allow for push-to-x (PTX) events and other traditional services such as voice calls to interact with the AMS and trigger service-related applications.","Embodiments of the invention are defined by the claims below, not this summary. A high-level overview of embodiments of the invention are provided here for that reason, to provide an overview of the disclosure.","In a first aspect, a set of computer-executable instructions provides an exemplary method for capturing events and handling captured events on a first mobile communications device. According to an embodiment of the method, each of a plurality of event handlers is registered. In embodiments, registering an event handler includes populating a push registry with a unique set of attributes corresponding to the event handler and storing an association between an identification of the event handler and a trigger event. An occurrence of a first communication event is identified and the push registry is referenced to determine that the first communication event corresponds to a first trigger event, which is associated with a first event handler. The exemplary method further includes initiating the first event handler.","In a second aspect, a set of computer-executable instructions provides another exemplary method for capturing events and handling captured events on a first mobile communications device. In an exemplary embodiment, the method includes receiving a registration request from a first event handler. The registration request comprises a trigger event definition, which specifies a first set of communication events that the first event handler is adapted to handle. In an embodiment, the method also includes receiving a definition of a first event filter, which corresponds to a subset of the first set of communication events. The exemplary method further includes associating an identification of the first event handler with the trigger event definition and the first event filter definition. An occurrence of a first communication event is identified and a determination is made that the occurrence of the first communication event satisfies the trigger event definition. Embodiments of the method also include determining whether the occurrence of the first communication event satisfies the event filter definition and, if so, initiating the first event handler.","In another aspect, a mobile communications device is provided that includes an event receiver that detects an occurrence of a communication event. The mobile communications device also includes a registrar that manages a push registry. In embodiments, the push registry includes an association between an event handler and a trigger event. In response to the detection of the occurrence of the communication event, the registrar references the push registry to determine whether the communication event corresponds to the trigger event. Embodiments of the mobile communications device further include an application management system (AMS) that initiates the event handler in response to receiving an alert from the registrar indicating the occurrence of the trigger event.","Embodiments of the present invention provide systems and methods for capturing and handling a wide variety of communication events. By expanding the push registry syntax and providing enhanced call\/session management flows, traditional services such as voice calls and modern services such as push-to-x events can cause automatic initiation of software modules to handle the events.","Throughout this disclosure, several acronyms and shorthand notations are used to aid the understanding of certain concepts pertaining to the associated system and services.

Similarly, UI module  can be adapted to facilitate presentation of graphical user interfaces that include video displays of callers participating in a video call, options for changing the state of the mobile device with respect to a call, screensavers, and the like.","Registrar  facilitates registering one or more of the set  of event handlers , , , , , and  by populating the push registry  with information associated with the event handlers , , , , , and . As illustrated in , the set  of event handlers includes a number of event handler categories , , and . Each category , , and  corresponds to a subset of the set  of event handlers that includes one or more event handlers , , , , , and . Each event handler , , , , ,  is adapted to handle one or more communication events associated with a particular type of communication or multimedia session. In the illustrated example, the set  of event handlers includes call event handlers , push-to-x event handlers , and push-to-talk event handlers . In embodiments, any number of other categories , ,  of event handlers can be included in the set  of event handlers. As used herein, an event handler , , , , ,  is adapted to handle an event if the event handler , , , , ,  is designed (e.g., by a developer or service provider) and\/or configured (e.g., attributes associated with the event handler are dynamically selected, set, modified, etc. by a user, service provider, or the like) to provide some type of experience in response to an identification of an occurrence of the event. According to various embodiments of the present invention, event receivers , , and  can identify occurrences of events in a number of ways such as, for example, detecting a communication or message associated with a particular port, receiving a notification of the occurrence of the event from an external source such as a network element, another mobile device, a client module within the same mobile device, and the like. In response to the identification of the occurrence of the event, an event handler , , , , ,  adapted to handle the event can be automatically initiated, modified, or called to provide a user experience, provide a computational service, or provide some aspect of a communication service. According to various embodiments, event handlers , , , , ,  can be applications, portions of applications, application programming interfaces (APIs), program modules, scripts, or the like.","As an example, call event handlers  and  are adapted to handle communication events associated with a call session such as a voice call, a video call, a multimedia call, or the like. For example, call event handlers  and  can include applications that handle incoming calls, hold events, redial events, attempted calls, failed attempts to establish calls, and the like. In embodiments, call event handlers  and  can include applications that facilitate different types of call experiences such as, for example, conference calls, video calls, multimedia calls, and hearing-impaired calls. According to various embodiments, call event handlers can be adapted to handle call events that originate at the mobile device, on a home network, on a foreign network, or even at another mobile device or network associated with another mobile device.","For instance, in one embodiment, event handler  can be adapted to handle a hold event initiated at the mobile device on which the event handler  resides. That is, if a user of the mobile device is participating in a voice call and wishes to put the other party on hold, the user can provide input such as by pressing a button, selecting a region of a touchscreen, or the like, and that input, which would constitute a trigger event, as described more fully below, would result in an automatic initiation of event handler . Event handler  can be designed to change the state of the call to a state in which the other party is put on hold. Similarly, in an embodiment, call event handler  can be adapted to handle hold events that originate on the other mobile device that is involved in the call session. Thus, if the other party puts the user of the mobile device on hold, a notification of that change in call state can be identified by an event receiver , and call event handler  can automatically launch to handle the change in call state.","To illustrate an aspect of the functionality provided by embodiments of the invention, suppose, for instance, that the other party's mobile network provides unpleasant \u201celevator music\u201d during hold states, and that the user of the mobile device would much prefer to listen to music from his own collection of songs stored on the mobile device while the user is on hold. Call event handler  can be configured by the developers of the application and\/or by user selection of configuration options, to automatically initiate and play (or cause to be played such as by calling a media player) music from a storage module on the mobile device during the hold state. Furthermore, call event handler  can be configured to handle an event characterized by a change in the call state from hold to active, wherein call event handler  automatically discontinuous providing the media experience to the user in response to the change in call state back to an active call. This illustrative example of an implementation of call event handlers  and  is merely an example, and it should be appreciated that any number of other types of event handlers , , , , ,  can be registered on the mobile device.","With continued reference to , as part of the process of registering an event handler , , , , , , registrar  associates the event handler , , , , ,  with one or more trigger events and stores that association in the push registry . A trigger event is an event that an event handler , , , , ,  is adapted to handle. Thus, in response to identification of an occurrence of a trigger event, the associated event handler  can be automatically initiated and can provide some type of experience in response to the trigger event. According to embodiments of the invention, trigger events can include any type of communication event that can be detected by the mobile device. For example, trigger events can include incoming voice calls, incoming multimedia calls, incoming push-to-talk messages, incoming push-to-x messages, any number of various events associated with existing calls, and the like.","In embodiments, a trigger event definition can specify one or more of a set of communication event types. In some embodiments, a trigger event definition includes a subset of the set of communication event types, while in other embodiments, a trigger event definition can include the entire set of communication event types. Trigger events are defined through the registrar  and the push registry . The registrar  and push registry  are represented by the Java PushRegistry API. Prior to the invention disclosed herein, trigger events supported by the PushRegistry API were limited to time-based alarms, arrival of TCP\/UDP packets, and arrival of SMS messages. The present invention includes PushRegistry API design extensions to allow for additional trigger events to be visible to the PushRegistry API. In an embodiment, the PushRegistry syntax is modified to support the tel:, sip:, ptt:, and ptx: strings as well as to support generic call\/session states such as, for example, call originated, call arrival, control requested, control received, control released, call answered, call terminated, call forward, call abandoned, call no-answer, digits collected, call on hold, and the like.","According to embodiments of the invention, registrar  responds to a registration request from an event handler , , , , ,  by ascertaining attributes associated with the event handler , , , , , . Attributes can include, for example, the name of the event handler , , , , , ; the types of communication events that the event handler , , , , ,  is adapted to handle; port numbers associated with the event handler , , , , , ; filter lists associated with the event handler , , , , , ; trigger events associated with the event handler , , , , , ; and the like. In some embodiments, the event handler , , , , ,  is configured to provide these attributes to registrar  as part of a registration request. In other embodiments, registrar  ascertains the attributes by referencing a descriptor file (e.g., a Java Application Descriptor (JAD)) associated with the event handler , , , , , . Registrar  populates push registry , which can include a table, database, or other data structure, with the attributes associated with the event handler , , , , , .","As used herein, filter lists can include definitions of event filters that place restrictions on the types of communication events that are to be pushed to a particular event handler , , , , , . Previously, communication events could only be filtered according to characteristics of the IP address associated with an incoming communication event. The present invention provides for filtering according to any number of other characteristics, informational elements, identifiers, and the like. For example, in an embodiment, filter definitions can include identifiers associated with originators of incoming call events. The identifiers can include phone numbers, contact names, geographical locations, and the like. Thus, for instance, in an embodiment of the invention, a filter associated with a call event handler ,  can be defined to specify a set of contact names from whom incoming calls can be handled by the call event handler , . As another example, other embodiments of the invention can include filters that are defined such that only incoming calls from a particular geographical region are handled by the call event handler , . In further embodiments, filters can also be associated with call receivers , ,  so that incoming communication events such as incoming calls, push-to-talk events, push-to-view events, and the like are filtered first at the call receiver , ,  and again before the communication events are passed to the event handler , , , , ,  such as by AMS , registrar , or some other module, which may or may not be illustrated in .","Therefore, for example, in embodiments, a voice call receiver  might have an associated filter that is defined such that voice call receiver  only accepts voice call events originating from devices in Kansas. Additionally, a conference call event handler  can have an associated filter defined such that the conference call event handler  only handles incoming communication events associated with conference calls involving more than two parties. Thus, in this example, because incoming voice call events are first filtered at voice call receiver  to exclude any communication events not originating in Kansas, and are filtered again by AMS , the conference call handler will only end up handling incoming voice conference call events originating in Kansas.","Additionally, user-definable filters can be included in a filter list. According to embodiments of the invention, registrar  can place a flag or reference in the push registry  and can associate that flag or reference with an event handler , , , , , . Thus, when registrar  encounters the flag or reference during registration or at some later time, registrar  works with UI module  to provide a user interface to the user that can prompt the user for configuration settings. That is, UI module  can provide a user interface that presents a list of options from which the user can select to configure a user-definable filter. As an example, a call event handler ,  can be associated with a user-definable filter that allows a user to select the names of particular contacts from which calls can be handled.","As is further illustrated in , registrar  communicates with an application management system (AMS) . In embodiments, registrar  and push registry  are part of AMS , whereas in other embodiments, registrar  and registry  can be conceptually separate. AMS  can be used to perform a variety of different functions on the mobile communications device such as launching MIDlets and other applications. In embodiments, AMS  allows for lifecycle management of applications and event handlers , , , , , . Additionally, mobile device call\/session managers can be configured so that every applicable call\/session state is notified to AMS .","As  further illustrates, a set  of event receivers , ,  can be implemented for detecting events, receiving incoming messages, and the like. In embodiments, any number of the event receivers , , and  can be included in AMS , while in other embodiments, event receivers , , and  can be maintained separately. In further embodiments, event receivers , , and  can be integrated into one program module or application. The exemplary event receivers , , and  illustrated in  are merely examples of event receivers , , and , and any number of other types of event receivers , , and  can be included as well. Event receivers , , and  can identify occurrences of communication events by detecting traffic on a particular port, by receiving a notification of the occurrence of the communication event, by receiving a message, or by any other method suitable for identifying occurrences of communication events associated with the mobile device.","Turning now to , a block schematic diagram is shown that illustrates an exemplary implementation  of the invention. As illustrated in , a call event receiver  includes an event capture module  and filters  and . As illustrated, a call event  is received (e.g., detected) by event capture module . Event capture module  can be adapted to identify (e.g., capture) occurrences of communication events by listening for traffic on a particular port, by interpreting notifications of events, and the like. Event capture module  can be further configured to identify the type of communication event being received, as well as any number of other attributes associated with a detected event. After identifying the type of communication event that characterizes call event , call event  is processed through filters  and . Filters  and , as discussed above, can restrict the types of communication events that are captured or used to push a particular functionality. If, or to the extent that, call event  satisfies filter definitions specified by filters  and , call event receiver  notifies registrar  about the call event . In some embodiments, call event receiver  ascertains a number of characteristics of call event  and provides those characteristics to registrar .","Registrar  references push registry  to determine whether call event  corresponds to an event trigger associated with a call event handler , , . Thus, as illustrated, registrar  could determine that call event  is a hold event originated during a voice call session and can further determine that hold event handler  is adapted to handle events of the same type as call event . Upon determining that hold event handler  is registered to be automatically initiated in response to identification of an occurrence of call event , registrar  notifies AMS  of the occurrence of call event  and AMS  initiates hold event handler . As  further illustrates, hold event handler  can access media content from a media storage module  on the mobile device for presentation to the user.","To recapitulate, we have described a mobile device, operating environment, and methods for capturing a wide range of types of communication events and for handling captured events. Turning to , a flow diagram is provided, showing an illustrative method  of capturing events and handling captured events on a first mobile communications device. At a first illustrative step, step , the method includes registering a number of event handlers. According to embodiments of the invention, registering event handlers can include populating a push registry with a unique set of attributes corresponding to each of the event handlers. In embodiments, registering an event handler can also include associating an identification of the event handler with a trigger event, wherein the association is stored in the push registry.","As described above with reference to various embodiments of the present invention, an event handler can include an application that provides a user experience automatically in response to the identification of the occurrence of the trigger event. In embodiments, the application can be associated with any number of types of events such as a voice call event, a video call event, a multimedia call event, and a push-to-x event. In some embodiments, the first trigger event definition can include a set of communication events and the unique set of attributes corresponding to the first event handler can include an identification of a filter that defines a restriction on the type of communication events that the first event handler is configured to handle. In an embodiment, for example, the filter includes a specification of a characteristic associated with events of the type of the first communication event. In another embodiment, the identification of the filter can include a reference to a user-definable filter associated with the first event handler. In that case, the exemplary method can further include applying the user-definable filter by providing a user interface having a set of options from which a user can select. The options can include one or more restrictions on the type of communication events that the first event handler is adapted to handle.","At step , an event receiver identifies the occurrence of a first communication event. According to embodiments of the invention, identifying the occurrence of the first communication event includes receiving a notification of the occurrence from a network element associated with a home network providing service to the mobile communications device. In other embodiments, identification of the occurrence of the first communication event can include receiving a notification of the occurrence from a network element associated with a foreign network providing service to a second mobile communications device. In further embodiments, identification of the occurrence of the first communication event can include detecting an arrival of a message or other communication from the second mobile communications device.","At step , a registrar references a push registry to determine whether the first communication event corresponds to a first trigger event, the first trigger event being associated with a first event handler. Thus, at step , the registrar determines that the first communication event corresponds to a first trigger event and at a final illustrative step , the first event handler is initiated.","Turning now to , a flow diagram showing an illustrative method  of capturing events and handling captured events on a mobile communications device is shown. At a first illustrative step, step , a registrar receives a registration request from a first event handler. In embodiments of the invention, the registration request includes a trigger event definition specifying a first set of communication events that the first event handler is adapted to handle. At step , the registrar receives a definition of a first event filter. According to some embodiments, the first event filter corresponds to a subset of the first set of communication events, and in other embodiments, the first event filter corresponds to all of the members of the first set of communication events.","As shown at step  of , the registrar associates an identification of the first event handler with the trigger event definition and the first event filter definition and at step  an event receiver identifies an occurrence of a first communication event. As further illustrated at step  of , the illustrative method includes determining that the occurrence of the first communication event satisfies the trigger event definition and at step , the illustrative method includes determining whether the occurrence of the first communication event satisfies the event filter definition. At a final illustrative step, step , an application management system (AMS) initiates the first event handler if the occurrence of the first communication event satisfies the event filter definition.","Many different arrangements of the various components depicted, as well as components not shown, are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention.
