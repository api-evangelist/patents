Field of the Invention","The present invention relates generally to an apparatus and method for configuring telephony, and more particularly, to an apparatus and method for configuring High-Definition (HD) video telephony between computer devices.","2. Description of the Related Art","The development of mobile networks and portable terminals has led to the decrease of cellular phone communication fees, resulting in the rapid growth of the cell phone market.","Additional services other than voice communication have also been developed, which has led to the current era of video communication.","Use for such a mobile service has expanded in scope to in-home, and techniques such as Universal Plug and Play Telephony (UPnP) allowing use of cell phone functions by using a Computer Engineering (CE) device such as a TeleVision (TV) in premises, have emerged.","The UPnP telephony is a technique for interworking the CE device with a telephony device, with which technique a user can send or receive a call by using the TV in the house, regardless of a type of the telephony device.","The UPnP telephony is advantageous in that it can be used by interworking with not only a mobile telephony service, but also an existing telephony technique such as Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) and Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN). In addition, since the UPnP telephony also has the same UPnP device architecture as the Digital Living Network Alliance (DLNA), which is a standard for media sharing in the premises, it is likely to be adopted as a next-generation standard of the DLNA.","Techniques for covering similar areas to the UPnP telephony include Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)-based Gm* which is under standardization in Telecommunications and Internet converged Services and Protocols for Advanced Networking (TISPAN) and Cordless Advanced Technology\u2014internet and quality (CAT-iq) for premises cordless phone connection.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["101","102","103","104"]},"Herein, the telephony terminal  and the electronic device  are located in a space in which they can communicate with the control point  by using the UPnP protocol.","The telephony service provider  provides both a telephony service and an interface for transmitting and receiving calls to the telephony terminal .","The control point  is a logical software module for controlling a UPnP telephony server  and a UPnP telephony client  by using a UPnP action. Although the control point  may be provided in a device such as a Personal Computer (PC) or a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA), separately from the telephony terminal  and the electronic device , it may also be provided in a physical device such as the terminal telephony  or the electronic device , in which case the control point  may directly control the UPnP telephony server  or the UPnP telephony client  without using a UPnP action.","The control point  determines a media, protocol, and transmission format to be used for call transmission and reception by using capability information of a call data transmission agent, which is transmitted from the UPnP telephony server  and is included in the UPnP telephony server  or the UPnP telephony client . The control point  generates a profile in which the determined media, protocol, and transmission format are defined, and transmits the profile to the UPnP telephony server  or the UPnP telephony client , thereby setting the environment of the call data transmission agent included in the telephony terminal  or the electronic device .","The telephony terminal  is a physical device, such as a CE device, a telephone, a PC including VoIP configured with software, or a mobile communication terminal interworking over a communication network. The telephony terminal  includes the UPnP telephony server  configured with software, and controls call transmission and reception by using the telephony service provider  for providing a telephony service and an interface provided by the telephony service provider .","The electronic device  is a physical device, such as a CE device, a PC or a TV capable of inputting and outputting voice or an image of a user, or a mobile communication terminal or a video phone, and includes the UPnP telephony client  configured with software. As such, a user can conveniently transmit and receive a call in home by using a home network system.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},"In , Bob and Alice perform cell phone video communications by using CE devices, such as TVs, as video and voice input\/output devices in their homes. The TV includes a video input device such as a camcorder, and an image input through the camcorder is transmitted to a third-generation (3G)\/Long Term Evolution (LTE) network through a cell phone. A cell phone  of Alice, which has received the image, transmits the received image to a TV  to display the image of Bob. In the same manner, an image of Alice is transmitted to a TV  of Bob.","When a conventional technology based on UPnP telephony is used, image traffics transmitted over the 3G\/LTE network has limited quality based on an allowed bandwidth between mobile phones.","The image traffic is specialized for use in cell phones and thus has low image resolution, and the bandwidth of the 3G\/LTE network is not large, thus rendering likely a phenomenon such as image disconnection.","Since a TV has a larger display size than a cell phone, image enlargement is required to see a low-definition image on the TV. When the low-definition image is enlarged, the image may be distorted or blurred.","Conventionally, only a video stream is supported to the extent supported by a telephony server, regardless of the maximum performance of a telephony client to be used by the user.","In case of communication between a TV and a cell phone, a user of the cell phone can see a video call screen, but a user of the TV inconveniently sees an enlarged low-definition image.","Such a problem is aggravated when both users use TVs. Even if the problem were solved, transmission of an HD image would be impossible without an improvement to the 3G\/LTE network that transmits a video stream of the video communication.","Moreover, the foregoing image distortion may be experienced when both users perform communication by using TVs having embedded UPnP telephony technologies.","When a field of a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is extended to find out information of a home network to which a peer cell phone belongs and to partially set a function of a peer TV, phones of both users, which have embedded SIP User Agents (UAs) therein, may transmit information by using an additional field of the SIP. However, when only a conventional mobile network is supported, the information cannot be transmitted. Further, if a field is newly defined in an SIP body, a conventional SIP server would filter and remove the field.","Accordingly, an aspect of the present invention is to provide an apparatus and method for providing the same user experience as in conventional telephony, which receives a call through a cellular phone and selects a device for performing communication, and concurrently providing HD video communication.","According to an aspect of the present invention, there is provided an apparatus for configuring an HD call connection between computer devices, the apparatus including a Short Messaging Service (SMS)\u2014transceiving module for receiving an SMS device list information request message for requesting telephony device list information regarding a home network of a first device from the first device, discovering a device in the home network according to the received SMS device list information request message to generate the telephony device list information, transmitting an SMS device list information response message including the generated telephony device list information to the first device, receiving an SMS call connection request message for requesting a call connection from the first device, and transmitting an SMS call connection response message with respect to the SMS call connection request message to the first device, and a Control Point (CP) for selecting a telephony device for receiving the call, transmitting a request for call start to the selected telephony device, and receiving a response for call start from the selected telephony device.","According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided an apparatus for configuring an HD call connection between computer devices, the apparatus including an SMS transmission\/reception module for generating an SMS device list information request message for requesting telephony device list information regarding a home network of a second device to transmit the generated SMS device list information request message to the second device, receiving an SMS device list information response message comprising the telephony device list information from the second device, transmitting an SMS call connection request message for requesting a call connection to the second device, and an SMS call connection response message with respect to the SMS call connection request message from the second device, and a CP for processing a call connection between a telephony device of the first device and its telephony device as a single session.","Hereinafter, embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the following description and the accompanying drawings, well-known functions and structures will not be described if they unnecessarily obscure the subject matter of the present invention. Further, a detailed description of known functions and configurations incorporated herein will be omitted for the sake of clarity and conciseness.","A home network generally includes an IP-based private network and controls various devices of any type, used in home, such as a PC, an intelligent product, and a wireless device, by connecting them over a single network through a common virtual computing environment referred to as middleware.","The middleware connects various digital devices in a peer-to-peer manner to allow communication therebetween. Examples are Home Audio\/Video Interoperability (HAVI), UPnP, Java Intelligent Network Infra-structure (Jini), and Home Wide Web (HWW).","In a computing environment established through the UPnP middleware, each device is allocated an address from a server according to a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) or an address selected by an automatic IP designation function, and performs communication with another device and search\/inquiry on the network.","An UPnP network is a home network technique that is most widely used at present, and defines a UPnP device and service and a protocol therebetween. The UPnP network includes a Controlled Device (CD) which is a home network device connected to and controlled by an IP-based home network, and a Control Point (CP) which is a device for controlling the CD and requesting and receiving an event. The CD performs a predefined function according to a request of the CP, such that the CD transmits an event to the CP which requests the event if the state of the CD is changed.","Operating processes in respective steps between devices of the conventional UPnP network include advertisement, discovery, description, control, and eventing processes.","In the advertisement process, a new CD is connected to a home network such that the new CD advertises itself to other devices on the home network. In the discovery process, a new CP is connected to a home network, such that the new CP searches CDs operating on the home network. In the description process, to control a CD, a CP recognizes a newly added device function in detail by parsing a service description Extensible Markup Language (XML) file or a device description XML file through an IP address of the CD, obtained in the discovery process. In the control process, when a CP desires to provide a particular service through a CD, the CP transmits an action request for requesting the service to the CD by using a Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) according to a UPnP device architecture and receiving a response message (result, variable value) to the action request. The eventing process involves checking a change state of information of the CD that provides the service according to a control command transmitted from the CP.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},"A user connects to a cellular phone or a VoIP terminal by using a TV having embedded UPnP telephony therein and performs communication with a communication peer, and the communication peer also receives a call through a TV using UPnP telephony.","In this situation, an Alice's TV  or an Alice's phone  recognizes through a configuration protocol that a telephony device is connected to a peer's phone. When it becomes certain that both users are using telephony, Alice's TV  or phone  requests information for accessing the peer's TV and, upon receiving the access information, directly connects to Bob's TV  by using the access information.","When those two phones perform communication over a 3G\/LTE network, information of a home network to which the peer's phone belongs can be acquired through a configuration protocol by using a data network. However, when Alice's TV  or phone , which does not know information for accessing the peer, desires to connect to the peer over the data network, it has to know an Identification (ID) of the peer and at present, there is no way to transmit the ID.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},"A user performs communication with a peer by connecting to a cell phone or a VoIP terminal using a TV having embedded UPnP telephony therein, but the peer performs communication through his or her terminal without using UPnP telephony.","In this situation, when Bob's cell phone  and Alice's TV  are connected with a broadband network through WiFi, an HD image may be transmitted by using the same method as disclosed in .","In this case, the cell phone may receive and transmit an image of a better quality than an image suitable to be reproduced therein.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},"It is assumed that in the UPnP telephony system, each user uses a TV and a VoIP phone to which UPnP telephony is applied.","In , two users currently perform video communication by using a VoIP phone #  and a VoIP phone # .","Although the VoIP phone #  and the VoIP phone #  include UPnP telephony CPs in , the telephony CPs are logical modules and thus may also be implemented in a TV #  or a TV # .

In step , the VoIP phone #  prepares for connection to the TV # .","In steps  through , the TV #  may indicate a method for connecting to the TV #  by using two methods.","First, the TV #  may generate access information, such as an IP and a port, which allows access to the TV # , or registers information for accessing the TV #  in an external server and provides information about the external server.","The first method may be performed through the external server such as a Simple Traversal of User Data Protocol (UDP) over Network Access Translations (NATs) (STUN) server.
