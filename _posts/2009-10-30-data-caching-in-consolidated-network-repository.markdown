title: Data caching in consolidated network repository
abstract: System(s) and method(s) are provided for caching data in a consolidated network repository of information available to mobile and non-mobile networks, and network management systems. Data can be cached in response to request(s) for a data element or request(s) for an update to a data element and in accordance with a cache retention protocol that establishes a versioning protocol and a set of timers that determine a period to elapse prior to removal of a version of the cached data element. Updates to a cached data element can be effected if an integrity assessment determines that recordation of an updated version of the data element preserves operational integrity of one or more network components or services. The assessment is based on integrity logic that establishes a set of rules that evaluate operational integrity of a requested update to a data element. Retention protocol and integrity logic are configurable.

No. 61\/159,674, filed on Mar. 12, 2009, and entitled \u201cCONSOLIDATED NETWORK REPOSITORY (CNR).\u201d The entirety of the above-referenced U.S. Provisional Application is incorporated herein by reference.","The subject disclosure relates generally to communication networks and, more specifically, to retaining data element(s) in cache storage associated with a consolidated network repository of information available to mobile and non-mobile networks.","Growth of wireless communication networks generally results in deployment of infrastructure that is primarily market based. Disparate markets have disparate service needs\u2014e.g., metropolitan areas can have dramatically different service requirements than rural areas\u2014and thus a telecommunication network can have a heterogeneous, location-specific telecommunication network that spans various radio technologies and services. In addition, as radio technologies advance, services provided wirelessly can rely on non-mobile networks, which further increases infrastructure heterogeneity of the telecommunication network. Moreover, as wireless communication becomes ubiquitous, subscriber mobility results in consumption of services and associated network data across a range of network systems and capabilities. Accordingly, reliable and efficient access to network data is a key component to perceived quality of service by subscribers and customer retention.","Data caching, or temporary storage of information in a computer memory, is a common mechanism to improve performance of a computing device by avoiding (i) time-consuming input\/output (I\/O) operation(s) to extract the information from a repository, typically different from the computer memory, or (ii) costly or inefficient reproduction, such as re-computation, of the information. Thus, data caching can be readily employed in various components of a wireless network. Yet, conventional implementations of data caching typically operate in a specific portions of network infrastructure and are application specific. Such features of typical data caching, the heterogeneous nature of wireless network deployments, a dramatic mobility of a large segment of subscribers generally result in modest to negligible performance improvements to data access in current wireless networks.","The following presents a simplified summary of the subject disclosure in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects thereof. This summary is not an extensive overview of the various embodiments of the subject disclosure. It is intended to neither identify key or critical elements nor delineate any scope. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts of the subject disclosure in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.","One or more embodiments provide system(s) and method(s) for caching data in a consolidated network repository of information available to mobile and non-mobile networks, and network management systems. Data can be cached in response to request(s) for a data element or request(s) for an update to a data element and in accordance with a cache retention protocol. Request(s) for a data element of an update to a data element can be received from a set of external networks, mobile or otherwise, that interface a protocol layer. The protocol layer includes various signaling protocols associated with various network components and services, and application data. The protocol layer delivers the request(s) to a data management layer in a format compatible with the source (network component, application server, etc.) of the request(s). The data management layer format the request in accordance with a predetermined signaling protocol and allows caching, as well as other data storage functionality in accordance with the predetermined protocol. Data management layer is functionally coupled to a consolidate storage layer, which is a distributed, heterogeneous data storage. The consolidated storage layer includes all or substantially all network data that can be access or generated by network components or application servers that can access the protocol layer or interface layer. In addition, consolidated storage layer also can include data related to network management systems, and components therein; such systems functionally coupled to the data manager layer.","With respect to caching, the cache retention establishes a versioning protocol and a set of timers that determine a period to elapse prior to removal of a version of the cached data element. In addition, a master record of a data element can be updated with a most recent version of cached data element if a retention timer expires. Updates to a cached data element can be effected if an integrity assessment determines that recordation of an updated version of the data element preserves operational integrity of one or more network components or services. The assessment is based on integrity logic that establishes a set of rules that evaluate operational integrity of a requested update to a data element. Retention protocol and integrity logic are configurable; a network component can supply a configuration or such configuration can be effected autonomously.","Aspects, features, or advantages of the subject disclosure can be exploited in substantially any or any wireless communication network (second-generation (2G), third-generation (3G), or fourth-generation (4G) network and variant thereof) and non-wireless communication network (broadband network, a cable network, a conventional Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), etc.). In addition, such aspects, features, or advantages can be realized irrespective of telecommunication radio technology or wireline technology. Examples of such radio technologies or wireless networks include Femtocell technology, Wi-Fi, Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX); Enhanced General Packet Radio Service (Enhanced GPRS); Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Long Term Evolution (LTE); 3GPP Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS); Third Generation Partnership Project 2 (3GPP2) Ultra Mobile Broadband (UMB); High Speed Packet Access (HSPA); High Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA); High Speed Uplink Packet Access (HSUPA); Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) Enhanced Data Rate for GSM Evolution (EDGE) RAN or GERAN; UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network (UTRAN); or LTE Advanced. Examples of wireline technology include fiber-optic backbone networks, digital subscriber line (DSL) networks, T1\/E1-based networks, Ethernet backbone networks, etc. Aspects of the subject disclosure also can be advantageously exploited in legacy telecommunication technologies.","To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends, the subject disclosure, then, comprises the features hereinafter fully described. The following description and the annexed drawings set forth in detail certain illustrative aspects of the subject disclosure. However, these aspects are indicative of but a few of the various ways in which the principles of the subject disclosure can be employed.

It may be evident, however, that the subject disclosure may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing the subject disclosure.","As used in this application, the terms \u201ccomponent,\u201d \u201csystem,\u201d \u201cplatform,\u201d \u201clayer,\u201d \u201cnode,\u201d \u201cselector,\u201d \u201cinterface,\u201d and the like are intended to refer to a computer-related entity or an entity related to an operational apparatus with one or more specific functionalities, wherein the entity can be either hardware, a combination of hardware and software, software, or software in execution.

As further yet another example, interface(s) can include input\/output (I\/O) components as well as associated processor, application, or Application Programming Interface (API) components. While the foregoing examples are directed to aspects of a component, the exemplified aspects or features also apply to a system, platform, interface, node, coder, decoder, and the like.","In addition, the term \u201cor\u201d is intended to mean an inclusive \u201cor\u201d rather than an exclusive \u201cor.\u201d That is, unless specified otherwise, or clear from context, \u201cX employs A or B\u201d is intended to mean any of the natural inclusive permutations. That is, if X employs A; X employs B; or X employs both A and B, then \u201cX employs A or B\u201d is satisfied under any of the foregoing instances. Moreover, articles \u201ca\u201d and \u201can\u201d as used in the subject specification and annexed drawings should generally be construed to mean \u201cone or more\u201d unless specified otherwise or clear from context to be directed to a singular form.","Moreover, terms like \u201cuser equipment,\u201d \u201cmobile station,\u201d \u201cmobile,\u201d subscriber station,\u201d \u201csubscriber equipment,\u201d \u201caccess terminal,\u201d \u201chandset,\u201d and similar terminology, refer to a wireless device utilized by a subscriber or user of a wireless communication service to receive or convey data, control, voice, video, sound, gaming, or substantially any data-stream or signaling-stream. The foregoing terms are utilized interchangeably in the subject specification and related drawings.","Furthermore, the terms \u201cuser,\u201d \u201csubscriber,\u201d \u201ccustomer,\u201d \u201cconsumer,\u201d \u201cprosumer,\u201d \u201cagent,\u201d and the like are employed interchangeably throughout the subject specification, unless context warrants particular distinction(s) among the terms. It should be appreciated that such terms can refer to human entities or automated components supported through artificial intelligence (e.g., a capacity to make inference based on complex mathematical formalisms) which can provide simulated vision, sound recognition and so forth.","As described in greater detail below, system(s) and method(s) are provided for caching data in a consolidated network repository of information available to mobile and non-mobile networks, and network management systems. Data can be cached in response to request(s) for a data element or request(s) for an update to a data element and in accordance with a cache retention protocol. Request(s) for a data element of an update to a data element can be received from a set of external networks, mobile or otherwise, that interface a protocol layer. The protocol layer includes various signaling protocols associated with various network components and services, and application data. The protocol layer delivers the request(s) to a data management layer in a format compatible with the source (network component, application server, etc.) of the request(s). The data management layer format the request in accordance with a predetermined signaling protocol and allows caching, as well as other data storage functionality in accordance with the predetermined protocol. Data management layer is functionally coupled to a consolidate storage layer, which is a distributed, heterogeneous data storage. The consolidated storage layer includes all or substantially all network data that can be access or generated by network components or application servers that can access the protocol layer or interface layer. In addition, consolidated storage layer also can include data related to network management systems, and components therein; such systems functionally coupled to the data manager layer.","With respect to caching, the cache retention establishes a versioning protocol and a set of timers that determine a period to elapse prior to removal of a version of the cached data element. In addition, a master record of a data element can be updated with a most recent version of cached data element if a retention timer expires. Updates to a cached data element can be effected if an integrity assessment determines that recordation of an updated version of the data element preserves operational integrity of one or more network components or services. The assessment is based on integrity logic that establishes a set of rules that evaluate operational integrity of a requested update to a data element. Retention protocol and integrity logic are configurable; a network component can supply a configuration or such configuration can be effected autonomously.","With reference to the drawings,  is a block diagram of a consolidated network repository in which data can be stored temporarily in a data cache in accordance with aspects described herein. Consolidated network repository  is functionally coupled to external network(s) , which can include a set of one or more non-mobile network(s)  and a set of one or more mobile networks . Non-mobile network(s)  can include substantially any wireline network, such as broadband network(s), cable network(s), conventional Public Switched Telephone Network(s) (PSTN(s)), or packet-based wireline network(s), e.g., Internet Protocol Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) network; in an aspect, non-mobile network(s)  can be deployed within a common architecture that can provide real-time service(s) (e.g., Common Architecture for Real-Time Services (CARTS)). Mobile network(s)  can include one or more telecommunication networks, and various components therein, that operate in accordance with one or more radio technologies, e.g., 2G technology, 3G technology, and all-packet networks (e.g., Evolved Packet Core (EPC) such as those based on 4G technology. Link(s)  enable access of external network(s) , and sets of networks therein, to consolidated network repository  and information therein. Link(s)  can include conventional links and reference links, which are specific to the external network that is functionally connected to interface layer .","In addition, for mobile network(s) , provisioning system(s), such as Operational Support Systems\/Business Support Systems (OSS\/BSS) , and network management system(s), e.g., Element Management System(s) , can be functionally coupled to and exchange information (e.g., data and signaling) with the consolidated network repository . OSS\/BSS  can include a set of back-end (e.g., information technology (IT)) systems -, and associated applications, that can provision various services enabled through one or more of mobile network(s) ; as an example, such services can include Consumer Voice-over-IP (CVoIP), Business VoIP (BVoIP), and mobility provisioning. Network management system(s), e.g., EMS , and associated applications, can provide service such as activation, security, mediation, and billing services.","Consolidated network repository  is a distributed repository of information and associated management components that form a single logical network node that can support various network-based data storage functionality related to external network(s)  and application(s) therein. To support such functionality, consolidated network repository  includes three operational layers: (i) Interface layer , (ii) data management layer , and (iii) consolidated storage layer . Interface layer .\u2014This layer is also termed herein frontend interface layer  and is the boundary between consolidated network repository  and external network(s) , and application(s) or service(s) therein, that require data storage and management thereof provided by consolidated network repository . Interface layer  is a data-less or substantially data-less operational layer in that it conveys all received data, or data payloads, associated with request for data or updates thereof to data management layer  for processing. Interface layer  also can provide a set of interfaces that match existing network data interfaces, which can allow efficient data integration of consolidated network repository  with external network(s) . The set of interfaces can be configurable and extensible; thus, providing sustainable flexibility to accommodate modifications to communication protocols employed by deployed network data interfaces. It is noted that interface layer  provides the set for interfaces, which are mapped to existing database interfaces, without any major or substantive changes to the architecture or logic of external network(s)  because interface layer , via protocol store(s) , can support existing standard protocols for data interfaces. In addition, interface layer  also can receive and convey data in accordance with current repository guidelines of a telecommunication carrier that administers consolidated network repository . The set of interfaces provided by interface layer  can be embodied in a set of protocol driver components , or protocol driver(s) , that can implement, e.g., execute, communication of data in accordance with one or more protocol(s); such protocol(s) can be implemented by protocol driver(s)  through execution of code instructions retained in protocol store(s) . It should be noted that extensibility of interface layer  can be accomplished through introduction of additional protocol driver(s)  and related inclusion of protocol features in protocol store(s) .","In an aspect, such data integration afforded by interface layer  can have effective logical features of legacy support for existing database systems in that interface layer  exchanges network data or application data with external network(s) through a single data manager, embodied in data management layer , which can receive data in accordance with disparate protocols. As an example, interface layer  can logically appear as a Home Location Register (HLR) to the wireless domain, e.g., set of network component(s) the enable telecommunication, of a mobile network functionally connected to interface layer . As another example, for a non-mobile network such as the IMS core network, consolidate network repository can logically appear as a 3GPP Home Subscriber Server (HSS). As yet another example, consolidated network repository  can logically appear as an application data repository to a Schema Evolution through an extensible, Reusable and Flexible framework (SERF) layer. In another aspect, in view of its extensibility, interface layer  also can provide long-term support for subscriber-specific data originated or terminated in network services and network applications.","Data management layer .\u2014This layer interfaces external network services or applications through interface layer . Data management layer  can receive request(s) for data, or update(s) thereof, from and return associated responses to interface layer . Data management layer  also can submit request(s) for data element(s) (subscriber profile(s), billing configuration(s), authentication credential(s) for subscriber(s), support data for application(s), etc.) to consolidated storage layer . In addition, data management layer  also can receive response(s) from the consolidated storage layer . Data management layer  can receive such request(s) for data access and have location or routing information of database(s) that retains the requested data without effecting any frontend processing based on physical location of a subscriber associated to the request(s), network service or application that originates the request(s), or location of related data stored in database(s) within consolidated network repository . In an aspect, data driver component  can manage routing information associated with received request(s) for data or updates thereof.","Data management layer  also can afford exchange of data amongst interface layer  and consolidated storage layer  in accordance with a common schema or protocol. In an aspect, data driver component  can convert, or adapt, data request(s) received in accordance with a first protocol to a second, pre-determined protocol format, such as to Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP). Thus, data management layer  can incorporate data communication schemas of various network management component(s), e.g., HLR or HSS, and application servers (ASs) into the common data schema. As an example, the first protocol can include Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP); Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP), in which case data driver component  acts as a pass-through functional element; Radius; Diameter; Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) Device Management (DM) protocol; GSM Mobile Application Part GSM-MAP protocol; Signaling System No. 7 protocol; SQL protocols; Technical Report 069 (TR-069) protocol, also referred to as Customer Premise Equipment (CPE) Wide Area Network (WAN) Management Protocol or CWMP); etc.","Additionally, data management layer  can provide various data storage functionality such as but not limited to indexing of data and data routing; in example system , data driver component  can effect such data storage functionality. In addition, data management layer  can implement subscriber management, e.g., registration, provisioning, activation, billing . . . , via subscriber management component , which can interface data management component  directly to OSS\/BSS  and EMS , and related application(s) available to such systems. Interfaces  and  can functionally connect OSS\/BSS  and EMS , respectively, to data management layer . Providing such lower-level interfaces to the consolidated network repository  allows for simpler provisioning, a greater level of redundancy and overall resilience to the consolidated network repository  architecture. Moreover, data management layer  also can provide data caching functionality, via caching component , in accordance with aspects described hereinafter. Data caching can reduce traffic or signaling directed to consolidate storage layer  and increase performance of response to received request(s) for data or updated thereof.","Consolidated storage layer .\u2014This layer is also referred to herein as backend repository , and includes the physical storage location, e.g., data stores -(M is a natural number greater or equal than unity) for all or substantially all of network data (e.g., data related to external network(s) ) and application data. In an aspect, data stores -can be distributed across various coverage regions (e.g., wireless marketplaces) of an external network (e.g., a wireless network), and thus provide for localized storage within the constraints of multiple and different localized implementations. For each data store , with \u03bb=1, 2 . . . M, consolidated storage layer  includes a data manager component , also referred to as data manager , that can administer access to data and generate responses to data queries originating in upper layer(s), e.g., data management layer . As opposed to a localized storage paradigm, such distributed storage feature allows fast and efficient access to the localized data based at least in part on location information of a data client component (e.g., a network server or an application server) without hindering performance of access to data by remote users. Limitation(s) enforced on existing network-based storage systems (e.g., HLR, Visitor Location Register (VLR), HSS . . . ) such as the number of subscribers per repository can be enforced by localized data managers (e.g., -) within consolidate storage layer .","In an aspect, one or more of data stores -can be commissioned in a conventional mated-pair configuration in which each of the one or more data stores -comprises two memories, or storage devices, that replicate the stored data. Mated-pair deployment provides internal redundancy and in case one memory in the pair is unavailable, associated data manager, e.g., data manager , manages access to memory that remains available. In addition, data retained in consolidated storage layer  can be replicated amongst a plurality of two or more data stores -; such replication can afford substantial data redundancy and data resilience, particular in instance(s) of catastrophic data unavailability. Since the plurality of two or more data stores -can be deployed in disparate coverage areas of a related external network, such data replication can provide geographical redundancy.","Component(s) or node(s) within each layer of the consolidated network repository  can be located within the same wide area network (WAN) which enables peer-to-peer communication. This feature allows the different layered nodes to communicate with each other and perform tasks such as load balancing and data location optimization. For example, if a subscriber that operates a mobile device within mobile network(s)  moves from a first location to a second location, consolidated network repository  can detect such mobility and, in response, automatically transfer the subscriber's data to a data store (e.g., ) that supplies data to network component(s) (e.g., VLR) associated with the second location. Time constraints, such as predetermined number of days (e.g., a week, a month) in a new location, can be configured to prevent data transfers across a plurality of data stores -as a result of temporary move(s) of a subscriber to a the new location.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","120","210","210","120","210","214","214","122","225","218","216","216","124","210","220","214","220","225","214","218","216","225","210","220","218","214","100","220","214","214","218","220","214","218"],"sub":["1","Q","\u03ba","\u03ba","\u03ba"]},"In an aspect, the set of servers -can be grouped, physically or logically, into sub-sets, e.g., {, . . . } and {, . . . } with 1\u2266J\u2266Q, each corresponding to a coverage region of external network(s) .

Bus  can be embodied in at least one of a memory bus, a system bus, an address bus, a message bus, a reference link, or any other conduit, protocol, or mechanism for data or information exchange among component(s). The information can include at least one of code instructions, code structure(s), data structures, or the like.

In an aspect, content manager , also referred herein as content manager component , can effect such determination; to at least that end, content manager  can probe, e.g., poll, content(s) of data cache . If the requested data element is determined to be available, caching component  can deliver the requested data element through at least one of signaling  or content(s) . In the alternative, if the element is determined not to be available within the data cache , caching component , via, for example, content manager , can deliver a directive to retrieve the data element from consolidated storage layer . In aspect, caching component  can deliver such directive to indexing component ; the directive can be part of signaling . Indexing component  can identify a storage location, e.g., a logical address such as an IP address, in which the requested data element resides and deliver a request for the data element, and associated location, to routing component , which conveys the request to consolidated storage layer . Routing component  can convey the request as part of signaling . A data manager component (e.g., ) that administers data in the location identified by indexing component  can receive the request delivered by routing component ; the data manager attempts to retrieve the requested data element from data storage (e.g., ). If retrieval is successful, the data manager (not shown in ) delivers the requested data element; conversely, it delivers failure signaling. The requested data delivered by the data manager can be part of content(s)  while failure signaling can be included in signaling . Routing component  receives the requested data element from consolidated storage layer (not shown in ) and transmits the requested data element to indexing component , which delivers such data to caching component . In turn, caching component  can supply the received data element to data adaptation layer , which can format the data element in accordance with a communication protocol employed by network component(s) that originated the request(s) for data and can relay the date element to interface layer  in response to the request(s) for data. Interface layer  communicates the data element to one or more network components that originate the request(s), and such network component(s) can supply the data element to an end user (e.g., a mobile device). It should be appreciated that the date element can be routed amongst network components as part of delivery to the end user. For example, a STP can receive the data element from interface layer  and route the date element to a VLR, which can retain the data element for a predetermined period and supply the data element to a MSC, which in turn can convey the data element to a radio access network (RAN) component for delivery to a mobile device of the end user.","Prior to delivery of data in response to the request(s) for data communicated by interface layer  (not shown), caching component  can record the data element in data cache . Caching component , via, for example, content manager , can record a data element received from consolidated storage layer in accordance with a cache retention protocol, which can be stored in memory element . Cache retention protocol , and features thereof, can be configured by a telecommunication carrier administrator, via a network management component, such as a Network Operations Center (NOC), that can be part of OSS\/BSS  or EMS . Such configuration can be accomplished remotely through links  or , which can enable a remote access terminal to access memory . In addition, configuration of cache retention protocol also can be implemented autonomously by an intelligent component (not shown) within caching component ; in an aspect autonomous implementation can be effected through AI techniques indicated herein. In an aspect, configuration of cache retention protocol can include receiving at least a portion of the protocol as code instructions that are part of a script (e.g., an XML-based script, a Perl script, etc.) or program module.","Cache retention protocol can dictate at least one of versioning protocol of the cached data or time interval(s), or timer(s), to retain the data element or version associated therewith. In an aspect, versioning protocol can dictate recordation of a version of the data element for each instance in which the data element requested by at least one of a network component or application server is retrieved from consolidated storage layer. As an example, a set of K versions -of data are illustrated as part of memory element(s) , wherein K is a natural number greater or equal than unity. As a feature of versioning protocol, retention protocol can dictate removal of one or more prior versions of a recorded data element if a new version of the data is recorded in data cache . In another aspect, the timer(s), or retention time interval(s), can be universal: the value of the timer is independent of aspects of the date element, such as data element size, type, or the like. In addition or in the alternative, magnitude of retention time interval(s) can be based at least in part on such aspects of the data element: For instance, small-size data element(s) can be retained for a longer period since such elements can occupy smaller portion of the data cache. Accordingly, through configuration of retention time interval(s), efficiency of cached data can be adjusted in accordance with predetermined performance criteria. In yet another aspect, a retention time interval(s) can determine a period that has to elapse prior to recordation of the latest version of a data element, e.g., data VK , as a master record of the data element within consolidated storage layer ; content manager  can retain the master record in the consolidated storage layer .","With respect to received request(s) to update data element(s), data driver component  can determine if the data element(s) to be updated are available in data cache , e.g., within memory element . Availability of the data element can be based on at least one of physical availability or logical availability. Physical availability is determined by an extant recordation (e.g., ) of the data element in the data cache , e.g., caching component  has previously cached a version of the data element. This determination can be implemented by polling the data cache. In the alternative, logical availability can be determined by at least one of (a) avoidance of data collision(s) amongst a recorded version of the data element that is accessed or scheduled to be accessed by a network component or application server and the updated version of the data element, (b) enforcement of location-based consistency of the data element(s); or (c) enforcement of time-based consistency of the data element(s), e.g., an update that retrogrades a previous update renders the data element(s) logically unavailable. If the data element(s) to be updated is physically unavailable, data driver component , e.g., via routing component , routes the update request, and any update payload therein, to consolidated storage layer. In the alternative, if the data element(s) to be updated are logically unavailable, data driver component  can implement a retry cycle in an attempt to reach a collision-free condition in which the data element(s) become logically available. In addition, if the data element(s) to be updated are unavailable, the requested update can be declined and a source of the update request can be notified accordingly. If a determination is made that data element(s) to be updated is available, data driver component , via, for example, data adaptation layer , can submit a directive to record in data cache  an updated version of the data element(s) in accordance at least in part with at least one of payload associated with the update request or a cache retention protocol.","Since various network elements (e.g., network component(s) or application server(s)) at various regions in the network can supply an update or update request for a data element, caching component  also can include an integrity component  that assesses operational consistency of received request(s) for update(s) to a data element. Such an assessment is based at least in part on configurable integrity logic retained in logic store , and can mitigate, at least in part, recordation in data cache  of updates of the data element that can affect adversely operational features of a network service or application traffic supplied to a subscriber. In an aspect, integrity logic can be configured by a telecommunication carrier that exploits consolidated network repository . In an aspect, configuration of the integrity logic can include receiving at least a portion of the protocol as code instructions that are part of a script (e.g., an XML-based script, a Perl script, etc.) or program module. The following scenario illustrates application of assessment of operational consistency: If a provisioning server classifies a business subscriber as a consumer subscriber and submits a related update to a subscriber profile, another received update to the subscriber profile that augments a QoS indicator for traffic associated with the consumer can be assessed as non-viable if the augmented QoS indicator is incompatible with the consumer subscriber re-classification.","Integrity logic retained in logic store  can include a set of rules that when applied to a requested data update, e.g., executed, by integrity component  can determine an integrity score, which can be numeric or logic, for the requested update. An integrity score above a pre-determined threshold indicates integral operation. In such case, a request to update a data element can be implemented by caching component , e.g., through content manager ; wherein the implementation includes generation of an updated version of the data element and recordation of the updated data element in data cache  in accordance at least in part to a cache retention protocol. For integrity score(s) below threshold, caching component  can implement exception handling, which can include delivery of a notification of non-integral update request and recordation of the below-threshold integrity score in an update log. In an aspect, to establish an integrity score, the set of rules can correlate various values amongst data elements that can depend on requested updated value(s) of a data element that is to be updated.","In an aspect of the subject disclosure, integrity logic similar or substantially the same as the previously discussed logic can be utilized by one or more data managers (e.g., -) to control request(s) for data that, if fulfilled, can affect master record(s) of data element(s) retained in consolidated storage layer . For instance, deny or discard requested updates, or changes, to a data element as deemed appropriate based on integrity logic (e.g., score of request for update is above threshold for integral update).","It should be appreciated that request(s) or directive delivered by caching component  or routing component  can be formatted in accordance with the common signaling protocol (e.g., LDAP) to which data adaptation layer  formats request(s) received from interface layer .","Various aspects of the subject disclosure can be automated through artificial intelligence (AI) methods to infer (e.g., reason and draw a conclusion based upon a set of metrics, arguments, or known outcomes in controlled scenarios), for example, features of cache retention protocol such as retention timer(s) or data transfer amongst various data stores within the consolidated storage layer. Artificial intelligence techniques typically apply advanced mathematical algorithms\u2014e.g., decision trees, neural networks, regression analysis, principal component analysis (PCA) for feature and pattern extraction, cluster analysis, genetic algorithm, or reinforced learning\u2014to a data set; e.g., historical data on access to specific groups or types of data element(s), or subscriber mobility and associated visitation patterns to various locations within a telecommunication carrier network. In particular, one of numerous methodologies can be employed for learning from data and then drawing inferences from the models so constructed. For example, Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and related prototypical dependency models can be employed. General probabilistic graphical models, such as Dempster-Shafer networks and Bayesian networks like those created by structure search using a Bayesian model score or approximation also can be utilized. In addition, linear classifiers, such as support vector machines (SVMs), non-linear classifiers like methods referred to as \u201cneural network\u201d methodologies, fuzzy logic methodologies also can be employed.","In view of the example system(s) described above, example method(s) that can be implemented in accordance with the disclosed subject matter can be better appreciated with reference to flowcharts in .
