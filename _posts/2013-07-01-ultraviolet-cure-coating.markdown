More specifically, coating compositions are provided that include multiple curing modalities to improve cure times and coating performance for several applications illustratively camouflage paints.","Materials that can be used to provide electro-optical signature reduction, termed low observable coatings, are desirable for use in military vehicles to provide resistance to visibility in both the visual and\/or infrared spectrums. Prior camouflage Chemical Agent Resistant Coatings (CARC) were developed to address low visibility needs in the visual and near infrared (IR) bands. For example, the three color woodland pattern and the desert tan match the visual effects of the background, and in the near IR the green color matches the sharp reflectance rise of chlorophyll present in all green foliage. In 1985, CARC became the standard camouflage coating for the Army as: MIL-C-46168, based on a two component urethane consisting of a aliphatic diisocyanate and a saturated polyester.","Unfortunately, the original CARC materials were deemed unsuitable for continued use due to poor performance and high volatile organic content (VOC) resulting from the use of the materials used in the formulation of CARC. In response, a water dispersible CARC was formulated as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,691,410. While this material addressed the environmental concerns, it has become increasingly clear that the long dry times required for cure of these CARC materials is a detriment to their wide scale use.","As such, new compositions suitable for use in low observable coatings are needed.","The following summary of the invention is provided to facilitate an understanding of some of the innovative features unique to the present invention and is not intended to be a full description. A full appreciation of the various aspects of the invention can be gained by taking the entire specification, claims, drawings, and abstract as a whole.","Compositions suitable for coating a substrate such as those used in military, hunting, or other application for which low visibility is desired are provided. The water dispersible low observable coatings provided herein are environmentally acceptable, rapid curing, and provide superior performance. A water dispersible low observable curable composition includes an aqueously dispersed hydroxyl functional polyurethane resin, an aqueously dispersed urethane acrylate resin; and one or more low solar absorbing pigments. In some embodiments, the acrylate resin present at less than 50% total resin weight. Preferred pigments include those that are cobalt free, do not absorb significant UV radiation during cure, and provide reduced surface temperature resulting in low IR signature. Illustrative pigments include chromium oxide green, magnesium ferrite, red iron oxide (FeO), black iron oxide (FeO), zinc ferrite (ZnFeO), or combinations thereof.","The following description of particular embodiment(s) is merely exemplary in nature and is in no way intended to limit the scope of the invention, its application, or uses, which may, of course, vary. The invention is described with relation to the non-limiting definitions and terminology included herein. These definitions and terminology are not designed to function as a limitation on the scope or practice of the invention but are presented for illustrative and descriptive purposes only. While the compositions are described as using specific materials in a particular order, it is appreciated that described materials or order may be interchangeable such that the description of the invention includes multiple parts or steps arranged in many ways as is readily appreciated by one of skill in the art.","A low observable coating composition is provided that allows rapid curing. In certain desirable embodiments the coating compositions of the present invention provide hard, chemically resistant coated surfaces that are useful for low optical detection applications such as military vehicles. Thus, the invention has utility as a low observable coating.","Generally, the composition includes an aqueously dispersed hydroxyl functional polyurethane resin, an aqueously dispersed urethane acrylate resin, and one or more low solar absorbing pigments.","Preferably, the aqueously dispersed hydroxyl functional polyurethane resin is a polyurethane resin with hydroxyl functionality that is dispersible in water. Illustrative examples of an aqueously dispersed hydroxyl functional polyurethane resin include those based on high molecular weight polyols known from standard polyurethane chemistry, illustratively those with molecular weights of 400 to 6,000 Da, optionally 400 to 3,000 Da. Numerous examples of such molecules are known in the art, illustratively as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,194,487. Specific examples of polyols useful for the formation of an aqueously dispersed hydroxyl functional polyurethane include: polyhydroxy polyesters obtained from polyhydric alcohols to which trihydric alcohols may be added and polybasic carboxylic acids; polylactones such as polymers of \u03b5-caprolactone initiated with a polyhydric alcohol; polycarbonates containing hydroxyl groups; polyethers; polyether esters containing isocyanate-reactive group; polythioethers; polyacetals; polyester amides and polyamides. In some embodiments, hydroxyl functional polyurethane dispersions are the ambient cure resin sold as Bayhydrol XP-7110E or Bayhydrol XP-2591 from Bayer Material Science, Pittsburgh, Pa.","An aqueously dispersed hydroxyl functional polyurethane resin is optionally combined with a first crosslinking agent. A crosslinking agent is optionally a water dispersible polyisocyanate. An aqueously dispersed hydroxyl functional polyurethane resin optionally has a hydroxy functionality of at least 1.8, optionally 1.8 to 8, optionally 2 to 6, or optionally 2.5 to 6; a total content of urethane and urea groups of 9% to 20% by weight, optionally about 10% to 17% by weight; and an average hydroxy equivalent weight (which may be calculated by an end group analysis) of about 100 to 5000, optionally 500 to 4000, or optionally 1000 to 3000. A water dispersible aliphatic polyisocyanate material is optionally based on hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI) where the isocyanate functional group (NCO) content ranges from 18.95 to 19.45 percent and which has an equivalent weight average of 220 Da. Illustrative polyurethane resins include, but are not limited to, the polyurethane resins described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,194,487.","The hydroxy functional polyurethanes are formed by reacting one or more organic polyisocyanates with one or more high molecular weight polyols, optionally low molecular weight isocyanate-reactive compounds, wherein at least one of isocyanate-reactive compounds contains anionic or potential anionic groups and isocyanate-reactive compounds containing nonionic hydrophilic groups.","A low observable coating composition also includes an aqueously dispersed urethane acrylate resin. Illustrative examples of a urethane acrylate resin suitable for aqueous dispersion include, but are not limited to, those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,041,708 and 7,396,875, and particularly U.S. Patent Application Publication No: 2012\/0041145.","An aqueously dispersed urethane acrylate resin is optionally formed of (A) one or more compounds of monohydroxy-functional alcohols containing (meth)acrylate groups, (B) polyester polyols obtainable from aliphatic diols having 2 to 4 carbon atoms between the two OH functions and\/or aliphatic triols or aromatic di- and\/or tricarboxylic acids, and (C) one or more compounds having at least one group which is reactive towards isocyanate, and additionally groups which are nonionic, ionic or capable of the formation of ionic groups, which have a dispersing action for the polyurethane dispersion.","Component A optionally includes monohydroxy-functional alcohols containing (meth)acrylate groups. Such monohydroxy-functional alcohols containing (meth)acrylate groups are, for example, 2-hydroxyethyl (meth)acrylate, caprolactone-lengthened modifications of 2-hydroxyethyl (meth)acrylate, such as Pemcure\u00ae (Cognis, DE), 2-hydroxypropyl (meth)acrylate, 4-hydroxybutyl (meth)acrylate, 3-hydroxy-2,2-dimethylpropyl (meth)acrylate and the di-, tri- or penta(meth)acrylates, which are on average monohydroxy-functional, of polyhydric alcohols, such as trimethylolpropane, glycerol, pentaerythritol, ditrimethylolpropane, dipentaerythritol and ethoxylated, propoxylated or alkoxylated trimethylolpropane, glycerol, pentaerythritol, ditrimethylolpropane, dipentaerythritol or technical grade mixtures thereof.","Component B is optionally formed from hydroxyfunctional polyesters that are built up from aliphatic diols having 2 to 4 carbon atoms between the two OH functions, illustratively, 1,2-ethanediol, 1,2-propanediol, 1,3-propanediol, neopentyl glycol, 2-ethyl-2-butylpropanediol, 1,3-butanediol, 1,2- and 1,4-cyclohexanediol and\/or 1,4-butanediol.

Optionally amounts of component A are such that the content of double bonds that can undergo free radical copolymerization is between 0.5 and 6.0, optionally between 1.0 and 5.5, optionally between 1.5 and 5.0 mol\/kg of non-aqueous constituents of the dispersion.","Component B is included at 5-75, optionally 10-50, and optionally 15-40 weight percent of the overall material.","Urethane acrylate resin is optionally provided with a second crosslinking agent. A second crosslinking agent optionally includes one or more polyisocyanates chosen from the group of aromatic, araliphatic, aliphatic or cycloaliphatic polyisocyanates or mixtures of such polyisocyanates. Suitable polyisocyanates are, for example, 1,3-cyclohexane-diisocyanate, 1-methyl-2,4-diisocyanato-cyclohexane, 1-methyl-2,6-diisocyanato-cyclohexane, tetramethylene-diisocyanate, 4,4\u2032-diisocyanatodiphenylmethane, 2,4\u2032-diisocyanatodiphenylmethane, 2,4-diisocyanatotoluene, 2,6-diisocyanatotoluene, \u03b1,\u03b1,\u03b1,\u03b1\u2032-tetramethyl-m- or -p-xylylene-diisocyanate, 1,6-hexamethylene-diisocyanate, 1-isocyanato-3,3,5-trimethyl-5-isocyanatomethylcyclohexane (isophorone-diisocyanate or IPDI), 4,4\u2032-diisocyanato-dicyclohexylmethane, 4-isocyanatomethyl-1,8-octane-diisocyanate (triisocyanatononane, TIN) (EP-A 928 799) and mixtures thereof. Homologues and oligomers of these polyisocyanates listed with biuret, carbodiimide, isocyanurate, allophanate, iminooxadiazinedione and\/or uretdione groups, mixtures thereof with one another and mixtures with the polyisocyanates listed above are likewise suitable. 1,6-Hexamethylene-diisocyanate, 1-isocyanato-3,3,5-trimethyl-5-isocyanatomethylcyclohexane (isophorone-diisocyanate or IPDI) and 4,4\u2032-diisocyanato-dicyclohexylmethane and mixtures thereof with one another are preferred. Homologues and oligomers of 1-isocyanato-3,3,5-trimethyl-5-isocyanatomethylcyclohexane (isophorone-diisocyanate or IPDI) and 4,4\u2032-diisocyanato-dicyclohexylmethane with biuret, carbodiimide, isocyanurate, allophanate, iminooxadiazinedione and\/or uretdione groups, mixtures thereof with one another and mixtures with the preferred polyisocyanates listed above are likewise preferred.","Other materials are optionally included in an aqueously dispersed urethane acrylate resin such as those described in U.S. Patent Publication No. 2012\/0041145.","An optional aqueously dispersed urethane acrylate resin that can optionally be used in the present invention is sold under the name of Bayhydrol XP 2690 and is available from Bayer Materials Sciences, Pittsburgh, Pa.","In some embodiments, the urethane acrylate resin is present at less than 50% by weight of the total resin (e.g. total weight of the hydroxyl functional polyurethane resin and the aqueously dispersed urethane acrylate resin), optionally between 10% and 50% or any value or range therebetween. The urethane acrylate resin is optionally present at from 20% to 45%, optionally from 35% to 40% by weight of the total resin. It was unexpectedly discovered that the presence of a relatively low amount of acrylate resin promotes curing of the entire composition upon exposure to UV light even though the UV curable portion of the material is in the minority. Prior to experimental curing, it was believed that the presence of the acrylate resin would enhance the hardness of the material after the UV curing time, but full or otherwise functional hardness would not be achieved until proper curing of the ambient cure material by full reaction with the a crosslinker such as a polyisocyanate. Of greater surprise was the realization that promoting the cure of the hydroxyl functionalized material such as by the addition of heat, without UV light, resulted in a material that failed to cure even though the ambient cure resin material is at a relative majority. The material resulting from heat curing absent UV light was of such poor hardness and incomplete cure that hardness or solvent resistant testing (traditional test for cure level) were not able to be performed.","A low observable coating composition includes one or more (e.g. a plurality) of low solar absorbing pigments. It was discovered that not all pigments are suitable for inclusion in a coating composition as claimed herein. A low solar absorbing pigment has properties that do not interfere with radiation in the UV spectrum thus allowing the UV radiation to be available to activate the photo-initiation process necessary for cure of the UV curable urethane acrylate resin. Thus, a low solar absorbing pigment must meet two criteria for use. First, the material must be low solar absorbing to impart low observability to the resulting coating material in the visual and near IR bands. Second, the pigment must not interfere with activation of the photoinitiator required for UV cure.","Illustrative examples of low solar absorbing pigments include, but are not limited to, certain metal oxides including one or more guest components that preserve the crystalline structure, charge, and cation sites of the host component lattice structure. Illustrative examples of metal oxides include, but are not limited to, those that have a corundum-hematite crystalline structure, illustratively iron or chromium. A guest component is illustratively aluminum, antimony, bismuth, boron, chrome, cobalt, gallium, indium, iron, lanthanum, lithium, magnesium, manganese, molybdenum, neodymium, nickel, niobium, silicon, tin, titanium, vanadium, zinc, or combinations thereof. These and other examples of low solar absorbing pigments are described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,454,848.","A low solar absorbing pigment is a pigment that will provide chroma, hue and saturation for a camouflage green, black, tan, or other desired color. For example, chrome oxides are optionally used in a camouflage green to simulate the chlorophyll reflectance curve detected in the near-infrared region. Iron oxides may be used to impart a visual brown color to the resulting composition. Illustrative specific examples of a low solar absorbing pigment may be described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,454,848. Illustrative specific examples of pigments include, but are not limited to, chromium oxide, magnesium ferrite (MgFeO), red iron oxide (FeO), black iron oxide (FeO), zinc ferrite (ZnFeO), and combinations thereof. Specific examples of low solar absorbing pigments include, but are not limited to, chromium oxide (e.g. Chromium Oxide Green (GX-1005 or G-8599), zinc ferrite (e.g. Tan-20-A), red iron oxide (FeO) (e.g. Red Iron Oxide 2199-D), black iron oxide (FeO) (e.g. V-775 Cool color IR Black), and combinations thereof.","The resulting pigmentation can be optionally changed or altered to account for specific camouflage applications and\/or scenarios as desired. Exact chroma, hue, saturation and other characteristics of the respective colors may be found in the military specification entitled: Coating Aliphatic Polyurethanes, Chemical Agent Resistant MIL-C-46168D (ME), 21 May 1987, listed in Section 1.2.1 Colors, and more definitely in Table V titled Pigmentation; and throughout MIL-DTL-64159 and particularly Tables I and III-VI.","A low solar absorbing pigment is present in an amount sufficient to provide low observability to an article coated with the composition. Illustratively, a low solar absorbing pigment is preset at 0.1 to 40 wt percent of the composition. It is appreciated that the amount of low solar absorbing pigment is dependent on the desired final color or other spectral characteristics of the resulting composition.","A water dispersible low observable curable composition may include one or more additional materials to adjust the flow, settling, adhesion, dispersion, defoaming, photoinitiation, or other characteristic of the composition.","A photoinitiator is optionally any molecule sufficient to effect free radical polymerization of (meth)acrylate double bonds for polymerization induced by radiation chemistry. Illustrative examples include, but are not limited to, those suitable for promoting curing at a wavelength of less than 400 nm, such as mediated by UV, electron, x- or gamma rays. UV radiation is particularly preferred in the presence of one or more photoinitiators. A distinction is made in principle between two types of photoinitiators: the unimolecular (type I); and the bimolecular (type II). Suitable (type I) systems are aromatic ketone compounds, such as e.g. benzophenones in combination with tertiary amines, alkylbenzophenones, 4,4\u2032-bis(dimethylamino)benzophenone (Michler's ketone), anthrone and halogenated benzophenones or mixtures of the types mentioned. (Type II) initiators, such as benzoin and its derivatives, benzil ketals, acylphosphine oxides, 2,4,6-trimethyl-benzoyl-diphenylphosphine oxide, bisacylphosphine oxides, phenylglyoxylic acid esters, camphorquinone, \u03b1-aminoalkylphenones, \u03b1,\u03b1-dialkoxyacetophenones and \u03b1-hydroxyalkylphenones are also suitable. Photoinitiators that are readily incorporated into aqueous coating compositions are preferred. Such products include, but are not limited to, Irgacure\u00ae 500 (a mixture of benzophenone and (1-hydroxycyclohexyl)phenyl ketone, Ciba, Lampertheim, DE), Irgacure\u00ae 819 DW (phenyl-bis-(2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl)-phosphine oxide, Ciba, Lampertheim, DE) and Esacure\u00ae KIP EM (oligo-[2-hydroxy-2-methyl-1-[4-(1-methylvinyl)-phenyl]-propanone], Lamberti, Aldizzate, Italy). Mixtures of these compounds can also be employed. A photoinitiator is optionally present at 0.5-2.0 weight percent, optionally from 1-3 weight percent.","A water dispersible low observable curable composition optionally includes a supplementary crosslinking agent as a part (ii) that is optionally a water dispersible polyisocyanate in addition to any isocyanate material included in either an aqueously dispersed hydroxyl functional polyurethane resin or an aqueously dispersed urethane acrylate resin. Illustrative examples of a supplementary polyisocyanate include, but are not limited to, the polyisocyanates described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,200,489. A supplementary crosslinking agent is optionally present from 4 to 55 weight percent.","A water dispersible low observable curable composition optionally includes one or more flattening agents such as polymeric beads. Illustrative examples of polymeric beads include beads made of polyurea or polyurethane, optionally with a median particle size of 18 \u03bcm. Beads are optionally spherical vesiculated type materials with enhanced matting properties and are extremely chemical resistant. A flattening agent is optionally present at from 5-15% weight percent, optionally 5-10 weight percent, optionally 7-9 weight percent.","A water dispersible low observable curable composition optionally includes one or more pigment dispersing aids. A pigment dispersing aide is optionally preset at from 0.1 to 1 weight percent or other amount as is suitable. Illustrative examples of a pigment dispersing aid include, but are not limited to, the polymeric dispersants such as those sold under the tradename SOLSPERSE 20000 sold by Lubrizol Advanced Materials Inc., Wickliffe, Ohio, and Troysol AFP from Troy Corp., Florham Park, N.J.","A water dispersible low observable curable composition optionally includes one or more defoaming agents. A defoaming agent is suitable for use as an agent for aqueous dispersions. A defoaming agent is optionally a silicone or silicone free system. When present, a defoaming agent is optionally included at 0.1 to 1.0 percent by weight percent, optionally 0.1 to 0.5 weight percent, optionally 0.1 to 0.3 weight percents Illustrative examples include, but are not limited to, the defoaming agents sold as BYK 023 available from BYK USA Inc., Wallingford, Conn.","The coatings can optionally contain other additives and raw materials including, but not limited to, catalysts, surfactants, adhesion and crosslinking agents, flow and wetting agents, solvents (e.g. water etc.), thickening agents, suspension agents, strength enhancing agents and so forth. The coatings can be applied to any substrate such as metal, plastic, wood, glass, etc. Additives are included at levels understood by those of skill in the art to impart the desired characteristics.","An overall illustrative composition according to some embodiments is depicted in Table 1.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"126pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":[{},"TABLE 1"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"Ingredient","wt. %"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"hydroxyl functional polyurethane","\u200910-50"]},{"entry":[{},"urethane acrylate resin","\u200910-50"]},{"entry":[{},"Photo-initiator","0.5-2.0"]},{"entry":[{},"Defoaming agent","\u2002\u20090-1.0"]},{"entry":[{},"Pigment Dispersing Aid","0.5-2.0"]},{"entry":[{},"low solar absorbing pigment","0.1-40"]},{"entry":[{},"Antisettling agent","\u2002\u20090-1"]},{"entry":[{},"HDPE emulsion","\u2002\u20092-15"]},{"entry":[{},"Matting Agent","\u2002\u20090-15"]},{"entry":[{},"Flow and Wetting Agent","\u2002\u20090-1"]},{"entry":[{},"Adhesion and Crosslinking Agent","\u2002\u20090-4"]},{"entry":[{},"Water","\u2002\u20095-50."]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}}},"It is appreciated that other additives may be present as is determined beneficial by one of skill in the art.","Various aspects of the present invention are illustrated by the following non-limiting examples.

The ambient cure CARC was too soft to measure pencil hardness and exhibited low pendulum hardness values. The paint was easily removed from the surface when rubbed with MEK. Also, the sample failed the water immersion test exhibiting severe blistering. Although UV4 also showed soft pencil hardness, it was at least 3 pencil units harder than the CARC and the pendulum hardness was twice that of the ambient cure CARC. Also UV4 exhibited excellent MEK resistance and no blisters or change in hardness after the water immersion test. As expected, when both materials are allowed to sit for 7 days at room temperature they both see further development in properties. Particularly, hardness continues to improve over time. After the 7 day period, both coatings become indistinguishable with the exception that UV4 exhibited slightly higher hardness. Interestingly, gloss does not seem to be affected by the cure time and remained consistent for both formulations.","Artificial Weathering of CARC and UV4.","The formulations of prior used CARC and the material of UV4 are tested by artificial weathering.

UV4 exhibits similar pendulum hardness as the control after 14 days. Asif et al. report that pendulum hardness is related to crosslink density and inter-chain interactions within polyurethane networks.

However, the CARC samples prepared for the DMA experiment were not exposed to UV light and instead allowed to cure according to the standard ambient cure process. A minimum of 2 days was required for the CARC coatings to have adequate film properties to be removed from the substrate a free films.","Storage modulus (E\u2032) is associated with energy stored in the material as a result of the applied strain and is related to the material stiffness. E\u2032 can provide information related to molecular weight, degree of cure and crosslink density. (Asif, 2005, Skrovanekek, D. 1988) The DMA data show a marked difference between the UV cure coatings and ambient cure CARC particularly after 2 days following coating application. The three UV cure formulations UV2, UV3, and UV4) show a higher E\u2032 compared to ambient cure CARC indicating a higher crosslink density and greater degree of cure than the CARC sample. After 7 days following coating application, E\u2032 for all four coatings exhibit similar values but the greatest change is seen in the standard CARC coating which showed a significant improvement in E\u2032 across in both the glassy and rubbery plateau regions. This is direct confirmation that the ambient cure CARC requires 7 days for full development of crosslink density and that the UV cure formulations achieve crosslink density and greater degree of cure much sooner following coating application. Even after 7 days, E\u2032 is lower for the ambient cure CARC in the glassy region of the curve.","Tan delta (tan \u03b4), the ratio of loss modulus to storage modulus (E\u2033\/E\u2032), is shown in . The temperature associated with the peak magnitude of tan \u03b4 is defined as the glass transition temperature T. Height and width of tan \u03b4 peaks are related to structural homogeneity and crosslink density. (Koleske, 2012) The tan \u03b4 curves shown in  reflect significant differences between the four coatings 2 days following coating application. The UV cure coatings exhibited increasing T, reduction in peak magnitude and increased broadening with respect to increasing UV component in the formulation. The T's for UV2, UV3, and UV4 were 46.2\u00b0 C., 54.5\u00b0 C. and 60.2\u00b0 C. respectively. As the relative degree of crosslinking increases in a sample, the free volume and mobility of chain ends decrease resulting in an increase in T. (Skrovanek, 1988) Thus, crosslinking increases in the UV cure coatings as a function of increasing UV component after 2 days following coating application. Tan \u03b4 peak broadening was also observed with increasing UV activated chemistry. Broad Tregions are generally indicative of molecular heterogeneity arising from contributions of multiple reactions. (Skrovanek, 1988) Introduction of crosslinks also reduces tan \u03b4 (peak magnitude) and increases peak width. (Kolske, 2012) Tan \u03b4 of UV4 in particular indicates a greater degree of crosslinking compared to standard CARC indicating a more advanced state of cure at a time of 2 days following sample preparation. Standard water dispersible CARC following 2 days of ambient cure time is clearly under cured as reflected in the 2 distinct transitions at 14.5\u00b0 C. and 55.8\u00b0 C. Prior work by Crawford and Escarsega showed that tan \u03b4 for standard CARC exhibited a single well defined peak with a Tof 73\u00b0 F. measured 10 days post cure.

These studies were performed using a Nexus 870 (Thermo-Nicolet) FTIR modified with a Gateway ATR accessory (Specac). The bench was allowed to purge with dry nitrogen for 10 minutes prior to collecting a background spectrum of the ZnSe crystal mounted in the accessory. Polymer films were cast onto the crystal by placing a drop at one end of the crystal, tilting the top plate of the accessory nearly normal to the benchtop, and allowing the drop to run across the surface of the entire crystal. Excess polymer was wiped from the trough plate assembly and the plate was quickly placed onto the ATR accessory through the sliding window in the FTIR sample compartment. The spectrum was the summation of 32 scans collected between 650 and 4000 cmat 2 cmresolution.","These data are collected using compositions representative of Formulations A-X that were cast from a blend of ambient cure polyol material, isocyanate, and UV-curable component. The spectra collected were normalized to the C\u2014H stretch at 2928 cm. As seen in , a decrease in the C\u2550C stretching band at 810 cmat different UV-exposure times indicates a reaction between the acrylate end-groups and the photoinitiator near the interface of the thin polymer film and the crystal surface indicating that the UV initiated cure is proceeding. There is an obvious decrease in the intensity of the acrylate C\u2550C peak after only 30 seconds of exposure time. The intensity of the C\u2550C peak does not decrease significantly with longer exposure times and does not completely disappear from the spectrum exposed for 10 minutes to UV radiation. Without being limited to one particular theory, the remaining acrylate functionality may be due to a decrease in mobility of the acrylate terminus and\/or photoninitiator as the cross-linking reaction proceeds. Likewise, the concentration of photoinitiator in the region probed by ATR-FTIR may also be depleted. Depth profile experiments performed by van der Berg also showed residual C\u2550C using ATR-FTIR for UV curable polyurethanes exposed to 10 minutes of UVA irradiation. (van der Berg, 2008) Yang et. al used real time FTIR to show that C\u2550C conversion increases rapidly within the first 1-2 minutes of the coatings exposure to UV light. (Yang, 2010) Both papers confirm our findings of acrylate double bond conversion as a result of UV cure.","Reflectance","All camouflage coatings use a mixture of mixed metal oxides to impart color and provide camouflage properties. The current 383 camouflage green uses a combination of chrome oxide and cobalt spinel to both replicate foliage background in the visible (400 nm-700 nm) and in the near IR spectra (750 nm-900 nm). The standard black formulation utilizes a combination of black iron oxide and\/or carbon black to impart color. The reflectance spectra for these coatings are shown in . Standard black has very low reflectance of approximately 4% across the entire spectrum. Standard green 383 has low reflectance (\u02dc15%) in the region of 1300-1700 nm. Additionally, cobalt spinel is a foreign import with significant cost increases (>300%) in recent years, and cobalt it is in free form has been identified as a hazardous air pollutant (HAP) by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) warranting initiatives to reduce or eliminate it.","The long term stability of camouflage coatings is directly related to the degree of exposure to sunlight, temperature extremes and humidity. The amount of solar absorption that a surface is subject to is directly related to the reflectivity of the coating system in both the visible and the near IR region of the spectrum. To lower the solar absorption in the non visible IR, pigment and nanometer scale additives to the color formulations have been developed. The low reflectance values of the standard pigmented coatings shown in  indicate the high solar loading that coatings with these pigments impart.","Reflectance values for the UV4 formulation, utilizing LSA pigments for both black and green are also shown in . The UV cure formulations exhibited significantly higher reflectance values in the near IR region of 700 to 1000 nm where half of the solar loading occurs. Reflectance values in that region increased from approximately 50% to 64% for the green formulations and from 4% up to 20% for the black pigmented coating as measured by a Varian 5000 Spectrophotometer with an integrated sphere. Use of LSA pigmentation for the dark coatings resulted in reflectance values that approximate a much lighter visual color such as the 686A TAN in the near IR as can be seen in , and therefore, reduce the solar loading of the dark pigmented paint. Thermal measurements taken on coated panels under heat lamps showed a reduction of 12\u00b0 F.-15\u00b0 F. of the LSA pigmented coatings compared to standard pigmented control panels. This is a significant reduction of surface temperature based only on the pigmentation of the CARC system. As an added benefit, the LSA pigments enable a successful rapid cure (UV activated) coating because the high reflectance properties of the LSA pigments do not interfere with UV radiation during the cure process, thus allowing the UV radiation to initiate the photo cure process leading to a rapid crosslinking of the coating and the subsequent physical properties. The LSA pigments are essential to the rapid cure properties of the UV cure formulation and additionally result in low solar loading for dark pigmented coatings while also addressing elimination of cobalt in paint as directed by the EPA.","It is appreciated that all reagents are obtainable by sources known in the art unless otherwise specified.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0097","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":["Asif, A., Huang, C.
