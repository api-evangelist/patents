No. 13\/665,449 filed Oct. 31, 2012, the disclosure of which is expressly incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","This disclosure relates to image denoising systems and methods.","Video images and still picture images may be taken at, e.g., social events and other functions. Depending on the quality of the device capturing the video, as well as other environmental conditions such as low light conditions, the image quality may be degraded by the presence of noise. Noise (e.g., image noise), may broadly be described to include but not limited to, e.g., random variations of brightness or color information in the image that is not present in the actual object captured in the image. Noise may be particularly evident on the facial regions of those in the images. While some denoising techniques (e.g., neighborhood filtering) may be used to reduce the presence of image noise, the end result may be facial images that are too \u201cflat\u201d and may not look realistic.","In one implementation, a method, performed by one or more computing devices, comprises identifying, by a computing device, a first portion of a facial image in a first image, wherein the first portion includes noise. A corresponding portion of the facial image is identified in a second image, wherein the corresponding portion includes less noise than the first portion. A noise level across the first portion and the corresponding portion is determined. At least a portion of the noise from the first portion is smoothed based upon, at least in part, the noise level. At least a portion of face specific details from the corresponding portion is added to the first portion.","In one implementation, a method, performed by one or more computing devices, comprises identifying, by a computing device, a first portion of a facial image in a first image, wherein the first portion includes noise.

At least a portion of the one or more faces in the plurality of images may be aligned using one or more facial landmarks. Adding at least the portion of face specific details from the corresponding portion to the first portion may include decomposing at least the corresponding portion to a base layer and a detail layer. A detail patch of at least one of the first portion and the corresponding portion may be modeled with a non-parametric Markov random field.

A corresponding portion of the facial image may be identified  in a second image, wherein the corresponding portion includes less noise than the first portion.

In some embodiments, the images may be stored internally via storage device  and\/or may be uploaded (e.g., automatically and\/or manually) from client electronic device  to be stored remotely at the above-noted data store at storage device  using known techniques. The images may be organized and\/or shared on a social network website via social network application . As will be appreciated, one or more of the images (e.g., image ) that include user  may have been taken under adequate environmental conditions such that the face of user  in the images are considered to have little or no noise (i.e., the facial portion of the images is considered \u201cclean\u201d and natural looking). One or more of the images (e.g., image ) that include user  may have been taken under less adequate environmental conditions (e.g., low light) such that the face of user  in these images are considered to have more noise and appear less natural.","In some embodiments, to help denoise or \u201cclean up\u201d image to appear more natural like image , denoise process  may detect  one or more faces in a plurality of images, wherein the plurality of images may include at least one of the first image (e.g., ) and the second image (e.g., ). According to some embodiments, denoising process  may detect  images and\/or from storage device  (e.g., organized in an album of a social network account associated with user  via social network application ). Additionally\/alternatively, denoising process  may detect  images and\/or from storage device  directly from client electronic device  (e.g., via client application ).","Denoise process  may include a face detection Application Programming Interface (API) known to those skilled in the art to detect some or all of the images of various users that may be included in the album (and\/or storage device ). In some embodiments, denoise process  may cluster  one or more faces using the face detection API. For example, denoise process  may cluster  all the faces detected to be user  and may cluster  all the faces detected to be another user in the album and\/or storage device . An example of the clustering  of a user is illustrated in .","In some embodiments, denoise process  may assume the largest face cluster is the album owner's face (e.g., user ), and may discard any other face clusters from other users. In some embodiments, e.g., where there is not at least a second image that includes user  or an insufficient number of images that include user , one or more images that include a user other than user  (e.g., users with similar facial features) may also be used in the clustering process. Denoise process  may segment the face region by, e.g., a Grabcut algorithm or other appropriate algorithm. In some embodiments, denoise process  may use the respective bounding box(es) as an initial foreground, and iteratively segment the face region. As will be discussed in greater detail below, at least a portion of the one or more faces in the plurality of images may be aligned  by denoise process  using one or more facial landmarks. For example, denoise process  may align  all faces to a single randomly choose template by, e.g., using an affine transform, and using respective facial landmarks between the image and the template as an alignment correspondence.","As will be discussed in greater detail below, denoising process  may identify  a first portion (e.g., patch, pixel, etc.) of a facial image in a first image (e.g., image ), wherein the first portion may include noise as discussed above. As will also be discussed in greater detail below, denoising process  may identify  a corresponding portion (e.g., patch, pixel, etc.) of the facial image in a second image (e.g., image ), wherein the corresponding portion includes less noise than the first portion (e.g., in image ).","One or more filter parameters of the first portion may be determined  by denoising process  based upon, at least in part, the first portion and the corresponding portion. The one or more filter parameters may include, for example, a noise level associated, at least in part, with the first portion and the corresponding portion.","In some embodiments, denoising process  may determine  the noise level for some or every face image G. For example, denoising process  may model the noise by\n\n\u2003\u2003(1)\n","where n is a noise layer and Gis the clean image. In some embodiments, the noise level may be defined as, e.g., Var(n), and assume n is zero mean and Var(n) is constant within a single face image. In the example, the independency between noise and image content may be assumed, and so Var(G)=Var(n)+Var(G).","Generally, directly computing the noise level for general cases may be difficult, since distinguish noise from the image content may be difficult. In the example, since the above-described images may be restricted to user's faces which should share relatively the same image content (i.e., the user's face may be assumed to be relatively unchanged between images), denoising process  may determine  the noise (e.g., relative noise) level between each image pair. For instance, denoising process  may determine the relative noise levels between all image pairs, and form an example fully connected graph where each node may represent an image Gand each edge may represent the relative noise Rbetween Gand G. Denoising process  may determine the absolute noise level Nusing, e.g., least squares optimization.","To determine R, denoising process  may find the top k corresponding patches pon Gfor each patch pon Gand determine the relative noise level of this patch by, e.g.,",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":"r","mrow":{"mi":["i","j","p"],"mo":[",",","]}},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mfrac":{"mn":"1","mi":"k"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":[{"mi":"l","mo":"=","mn":"1"},{"mi":["l","k"],"mo":"="}]},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["w","ij"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"Var","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"msub":{"mi":["p","i"]}}},{"mi":"Var","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"msub":{"mi":["p","jl"]}}}],"mo":"-"}}}}}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"2"}}]}}}}},"where p is, e.g., 16-by-16.

Based on the estimated noise level, denoising process  may adaptively smooth  or filter Gif it is noisy. Smoothing  may include the use of, e.g., a bilateral filter, with example empirical formula space sigma as \u03c3=2\u221aNand range sigma \u03c3=8\u221aN.","As can be appreciated by those skilled in the art, bilateral filtering (e.g., smoothing) may remove the noise from the noisy \u201ctarget\u201d face, but may also remove important face specific details, and may produce unrealistic, over-flat faces. The smoothed image may be referred to as a target image. To enrich the visual appearance, denoising process  may add  at least a portion of face specific details from the above-noted corresponding portion to the first portion (e.g., of the target image). For example, denoising process  may synthesize the face specific detail from the clean face images and add  it to the filtered target.","Adding  at least the portion of face specific details from the corresponding portion to the first portion (e.g., of the target image) may include decomposing  at least the corresponding portion to a base layer and a detail layer. For example, denoising process  may decompose  some or all clean images (e.g., in the above-noted album) to one or more base layers and one or more detail layers using the above-noted bilateral filter with an example fixed \u03c3=14 and \u03c3=38. The base layer(s) may be the output of the bilateral filter, and the detail layer(s) may be the difference between original input. In some embodiments, denoising process  may collect some or all clean details as one or more inputs for the detail synthesis.","In some embodiments, e.g., for a patch at location i on the target image, denoted as t, denoising process  may synthesize the associated detail patch t.

In some embodiments, denoising process  may iterate the above procedure multiple times to obtain one or more final detail layers.","In the above example(s), assume that the faces are roughly aligned.

In some embodiments, a lower local gradient, which may represent flat regions, may result into weighting function w(E) of narrow bandwidth, and so denoising process  may reject patches of higher energy. Thus, in some embodiments, denoising process  may only merge flat regions with patches of higher confidence, which may result in less artifacts. In the example, denoising process  may set the window size to be 16-by-16.","Referring again to the above discussed noise level determination , denoising process  may pick up the top k corresponding patches to estimate the relative noise level. In some embodiments, denoising process  may iterate the above procedure, e.g., 3 times, within the above-noted image pair, and pick up the patches of the k least energy. Denoising process  may use Eq. 14 to determine the weight for each patch, and may set the search window (not shown) size to be, e.g., 22-by-22 throughout.","In some embodiments, denoising process  may involve multi-level details. For example, for noise level determination , denoising process  may use the algorithm as described for solving Eq. 12. For texture synthesis, denoising process  may derive, e.g., 3 base-detail image pairs from each input image, where each pair may be created using one or more different filtering parameters. For instance, an album with L input images may have, e.g., 3L base-detail pairs. In some embodiments, denoising process  may treat each base-detail pair independently. In particular, the base layer at ilevel Bmay be\n\n(,\u03c3=2\u03c3,\u03c3=2\u03c3)\u2003\u2003(15)\n","where BF is bilateral filter, and B=G the original image. The corresponding idetail layer is D=G\u2212B. In the example, denoising process  may use 3 levels, and set \u03c3=14 and \u03c3=38.","To improve the patch search and identification \/, denoising process  may apply a domain adaptation between the input base images and the target image. For example, denoising process  may use the target image G as the reference and do histogram matching on input base images B. In Eq. 12, the umay come from the 3 base images Band the tmay come from the three detail images D. In noise level determination , denoising process  may use a linear transform for domain adaptation, and may use histogram matching in texture synthesis, since, e.g., linear transforms may help denoising process  to estimate noise gain for the noise level determination.","Those skilled in the art will appreciate that any of the above-described processes may take place at any time. For example, in response to client electronic device  capturing an image, denoising process  via client application  executing on client electronic device  may, e.g., automatically upload the image to computer , where denoising process  may identify  the first portion of the facial image in the image, identify  the corresponding portion of the facial image in one or more other images (e.g., in one or more online albums), determine  one or more filter parameters of the first portion, smooth  at least a portion of the noise from the first portion, and add  at least a portion of face specific details from the corresponding portion to the first portion. Additionally\/alternatively, denoising process  may (e.g., automatically) perform the processes in response to uploading the image to, e.g., client computer . Additionally\/alternatively, denoising process  may perform the processes in response to denoising process  receiving a user input via a user interface (not shown) of client application  executing on client electronic device . The user interface may also enable user  to select which images (e.g., in an album) that denoising process  may use in the above-described processes. As such, the action that causes denoising process  to perform the processes should be taken as an example only and not to limit the scope of the disclosure. In some embodiments, after the image has been denoised, denoising process  may, e.g., via social network application , share the resulting picture with user  and\/or other users.","While above examples are used for denoising facial portions of an image, those skilled in the art will appreciate that other portions may be denoised, such as landmarks, background, etc., without departing from the scope of the disclosure. As such, the use of denoising facial portions of an image should be taken as an example only and not to other wise limit the scope of the disclosure.","As will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, the present disclosure may be embodied as a method, system, or computer program product.
