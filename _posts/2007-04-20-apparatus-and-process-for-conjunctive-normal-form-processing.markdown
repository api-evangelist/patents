Field of the Invention","The present invention is directed to a system and method for systems-related problem formulation, analysis and solution. More specifically, the instant invention is directed to a system and method for formulating, analyzing and solving system-related problems based on functional descriptions of such systems.","2. Background of the Related Art","Methods for solving systems-related problems are well known in the art. These include methods based on Genrich Altschuller's \u201cTheory of Inventive Problem Solving\u201d, known generally by its Russian acronym, \u201cTRIZ\u201d.","Methodologies based on classical TRIZ are difficult to apply because they do not readily identify the problems to be solved for complex systems. Certain patents attempt to solve such shortcomings. U.S. Pat. No. 5,581,663, for example, provides a graph based implementation which provides some problem identification functionality for complex systems.","Prior art systems such as that disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,581,663 read system description and\/or problem situation description in the form shown in Table 1.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"175pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":[{},"TABLE 1"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"(Statement1) is required for (Statement2)."]},{"entry":[{},"(Statement1) causes (Statement3)."]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}},"br":{}},"Originally, graphs included only three types of links, namely, \u201cis required for\u201d, \u201ccauses\u201d, and \u201celiminates\u201d links. Subsequently, other solutions introduced other link types while generally remaining within the graph model.","After building graphs from user input (i.e., user text), prior art systems apply certain structural checks to the graphs such as incoming links compatibility, loop identification, \u201cunconnected islands\u201d identification, and the like, as will be readily understood by those of skill in the art. Upon concluding such structural checks, these systems formulate verbose renderings for each node of the graph; that is, they constructed word-based formulations for each graph node. This formulation takes into account the types of links of each node as well as the nodes in the immediate vicinity.

This invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein; rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art.","As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, the present invention may be embodied as a method, data processing system, or computer program product. Accordingly, the present invention may take the form of an entirely hardware embodiment, an entirely software embodiment or an embodiment combining software and hardware aspects. Furthermore, the present invention may take the form of a computer program product on a computer-usable storage medium having computer-usable program code means embodied in the medium. Any suitable computer readable medium may be utilized including hard disks, CD-ROMs, optical storage devices, a transmission media such as those supporting the Internet or an intranet, or magnetic storage devices.","As used herein, program modules, software modules and like references indicate logical program units and do not necessarily indicate structurally discreet structures. The modules disclosed herein may be combined and\/or further separated without departing from the inventive aspects of the present invention. Furthermore, the invention may be practiced in distributed computing environments wherein modules reside and\/or are executed on several processing devices. In such a distributed computing environment, program modules may be located in both local and remote memory storage devices.","The logical flow of preferred embodiments of the present invention is depicted in , and attention is directed to those figures in connection with the following discussion.","In a preferred embodiment of the present invention the problem system is modeled as an unsatisfiable boolean formula in conjunctive normal form (abbreviated \u201cCNF\u201d), as described in greater detail below. The solutions are sought as relaxations of the original formula. If removing a term from the CNF makes the remainder CNF satisfiable, then this removed term is regarded as a solution and undergoes the wording formulation in negated form. To facilitate entering the boolean formula, the end-user syntax is augmented with the keywords: \u201calways\u201d, \u201cnever\u201d, \u201cmust achieve\u201d and \u201cmust eliminate,\u201d which are absent from previously known systems and methods. The present invention also allows for expressing alternatives using the \u201cor\u201d keyword, also absent from previously known systems and methods.","Embodiments of the present invention need not begin analysis of systems with descriptions in CNF, but must convert non-CNF descriptions to CNF (that is, users need not input problems in CNF form, as certain embodiments of the present invention will convert input to CNF form). The use of CNF has several advantages, including: the input statements can be almost literally converted into the pieces of the CNF when utilizing the user language syntax previously describe, and Robinson's Resolution technique described below is specifically targeted to systems expressed in CNF.","As a first step, the system constructs a boolean representation for a problem to be analyzed and solved. In this step, each statement of the overall problem as provided by a user. The system analyzes the representations thus provided and extracts therefrom linked boolean \u201cfunctions\u201d (also called \u201cboolean variables\u201d) which combine to provide a relation between the truth of each such function or variable. By way of example, the user input statement \u201cBacteria in the air causes damage of medication\u201d may be analyzed to yield two boolean variables, namely: \u201cbacteria in air\u201d and \u201cdamage of medication\u201d. Thus, [Bacteria in the air]=1 would mean that bacteria is actually present in the air, while [Bacteria in the air]=0 would mean that they are in fact absent. In that regard, the user input statement above yields the relation between the truth values of these two variables. This relation may be stated using traditional if-then constructs such as: \u201cif [Bacteria in the air]=1 then [Damage of medication] must be 1.\u201d","Alternatively, the relation may be stated in boolean form as: \u201c^[Bacteria in the air]|[Damage of medication]\u201d, where the caret symbol (\u201c^\u201d) signifies a not condition (i.e., the opposite of the boolean statement) and the pipe symbol (\u201c|\u201d) signifies a logical \u201cor\u201d. The alternative statement of the relation may be worded as \u201cALWAYS TRUE THAT: EITHER NOT [Bacteria in the air] OR (OTHERWISE) [Damage of medication].\u201d Using the boolean statement form, the system of the present invention may represent several link types as depicted in Table 8, below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00009","num":"00009"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"112pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 8"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Link","Formula","Interpretation"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["[A] is required","(A | {circumflex over (\u2009)}B)","must do [A], or would not get [B]"]},{"entry":"for [B]."},{"entry":["[A] causes [B].","({circumflex over (\u2009)}A | B)","[A] must be absent, or would get [B]"]},{"entry":["[A] eliminates [B].","(A | B)","must do [A], or would get [B]"]},{"entry":["[A] impedes [B].","({circumflex over (\u2009)}A | {circumflex over (\u2009)}B)","[A] must be absent, or would not"]},{"entry":[{},{},"get [B]"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}},"br":{}},"As will be readily understood by those of skill in the art, a system may be modeled by a series of related formulas which must be solved simultaneously in order to solve the \u201cproblem\u201d of the system.

This conclusion may be confirmed through well known analysis methodologies such as Robinson's Resolution.","Searching for Solutions and Constructing the Wordings","As the foregoing discussion illustrates, a \u201cproblem\u201d, if modeled correctly, will necessarily result in an unsatisfiable set of boolean equations. This represents the user's belief that the problem at hand cannot be resolved in any \u201cnormal\u201d or \u201cknown\u201d or \u201cavailable\u201d ways. Thus, the search for an \u201cinnovative\u201d solutions is warranted. The \u201cinnovative\u201d solutions, in turn, would necessarily involve \u201cviolations\u201d of some of the equations thus producing the directions that would be \u201cunexpected\u201d by the user. The present invention discloses an algorithm that builds these \u201cviolations\u201d as will be discussed in greater detail presently.","Because the formulation of a system \u201cproblem\u201d is built in the conjunctive normal form (\u201cCNF\u201d), embodiments of the present invention analyze the CNF system of formulas in an attempt to \u201crelax\u201d the system by dropping a term of CNF (i.e., dropping at least one formula from the system). If the resulting set of equations, i.e., the set with a term removed, proves to be satisfiable, then the dropped formula represents the constraint that needs to be \u201cviolated\u201d. This term is thus used to formulate an appropriate wording of a system problem's solution. If, on the other hand, the resulting set of equations remains unsatisfiable, then the removed formula is considered irrelevant to the system problem. Such irrelevant formulas result in no wording and are ignored for purposes of solving the system \u201cproblem\u201d represented by the set of equations.","The method thus described may be summarized as shown in Table 13, below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00014","num":"00014"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"203pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":[{},"TABLE 13"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Parse user input, create the boolean representation R."]},{"entry":[{},"Check that R is unsatisfiable."]},{"entry":[{},"For every term T in R"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"189pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Drop term (formula or equation) T from R resulting in R\u2032"]},{"entry":[{},"If R\u2032 is satisfiable then"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"175pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"Formulate a wording from term T"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"189pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"End If"]},{"entry":[{},"Put the term T back into R\u2032 thus recreating original R."]},{"entry":[{},"Continue with the next term."]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"203pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"End For"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}}},"In executing the step of \u201cformulate a wording from term T\u201d in the method of Table 13, the present invention must determine which wording to use from among several possible wordings. To choose the correct one, the present invention analyzes the cause-effect and means-goals relations expressed by the user and inherently embodied in the system of equations. Every equation may be considered designate one variable in it to be a \u201ctarget,\u201d that is, an effect experienced by or in the system being modeled.","Referring to the set of equations depicted in Table 12, one will recognize the variables in the right-hand column each may be considered an effect experienced by or in the system at issue. These particular variables constitute the \u201ctargets\u201d in the equations. One of skill in the art will readily understand that the designation of a variable as a \u201ctarget\u201d does not impact the manner in which the variable is treated for any boolean purposes; the \u201ctarget\u201d designation is only considered at the present stage of word form formulation. One of skill in the art will also readily understand that there has been no \u201ctarget\u201d designation in the final equation of the equation set depicted in Table 12, as this term had been added only to signify the desired ultimate outcome, and so no formulation is desired for it.","The wording for each term will be the negated form of the term; that is, if a term is positive, the system of the present invention will generate a negative plain language expression of the term, otherwise it will generate a positive plain language expression of the term. Thus, by way of example, if a target term is \u201c^[A]\u201d (negative), the system of the present invention will generate a wording such as \u201cfind a way to ACHIEVE [A]\u201d. Similarly, if a non-target term reads as \u201c[B]\u201d (positive), then the system of the present invention will generate a wording such as \u201c. . . that would not require [B].\u201d Such a statement may be called a \u201cstatement of system omitted condition\u201d because it states a condition that is not required by the system, i.e., a condition omitted from the system. Finally, if a non-target term reads as \u201c^[C]\u201d (negative), then the system of the present invention will generate a wording such as \u201c. . . under the condition of [C].\u201d Such a statement may be called a \u201cstatement system condition\u201d because it states a condition of the system that is (or is assumed to be) present.","The method of formulating appropriate wording thus

the real world example of: \u201cDuring the internal surgery, sponges are used to stop the blood and other body fluids from running through the area. When the surgery is done, the sponges need to be removed. However, doctors and the surgical team staff are unable to see the sponges well inside the patient after they are covered with the body fluids. They also miscount the number of sponges as they take them out. Thus, while they think that all of the sponges are accounted for, some may actually still be inside of the patient. If they are left inside, they usually cause medical problems later.\u201d","Embodiments of the instant invention may model the system thus described as shown in Table 24,

This algorithm removes a single CNF term at a time; it does not drop multiple CNF terms at any single step.","Certain system-problems cannot be solved by such an approach, and so other preferred embodiments of the present invention extended the algorithm of Table 13 to also search for pairs, triples, etc. of terms to drop. These \u201ccomplex relaxations\u201d (i.e., relaxations created by concurrently dropping multiple CNF terms) can be defined as the subsets of the CNF terms with the following properties: (A) dropping these terms from the original unsatisfiable CNF would result in the new CNF that will be satisfiable; and (B) no proper subset of a complex relaxation would produce a satisfiable CNF.","One method of constricting such complex relaxations of the instant invention starts with the single-term subsets (as in the method disclosed in Table 13). Those CNF terms satisfy property (A) (i.e., they represent simple relaxations), and such CNF terms are stored for use in further analysis of subsequent iterations of the present method. The next iteration generates all the two-term subsets and eliminate those containing any of the previously stored sets. This comparison with previously stored sets ensures that the new subsets satisfy property (B).

Such GUI would then essentially replace the step of syntactical processing of the user input described above.
