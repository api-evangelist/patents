No. 61\/077,972, filed Jul. 3, 2008, and is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","Not applicable.","Not applicable.","Nucleoside drugs have been used clinically for decades for the treatment of viral infections and proliferative disorders such as cancer. Most nucleoside drugs (analogues) are classified as antimetabolites. After they enter cells, nucleoside analogues are phosphorylated successively to nucleotide 5\u2032-mono-phosphates, 5\u2032-di-phosphates, and 5\u2032-tri-phosphates. In some cases, nucleotide tri-phosphates, e.g., 3\u2032-azido-3\u2032-deoxythymidine tri-phosphate (AZT, an anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) drug) and arabinosylcytosine tri-phosphate (cytarabine, an anticancer drug), are the active chemical entities that inhibit DNA or RNA synthesis through competitive inhibition of polymerases and subsequent incorporation of modified nucleotides into DNA or RNA sequences. In a few cases, nucleoside analogues exert effects as their 5\u2032-monophosphate or 5\u2032-diphosphate. For instance, 5-fluoro-2\u2032-deoxyuridine 5\u2032-mono-phosphate (an anticancer drug) and 2\u2032,2\u2032-difluoro-2\u2032-deoxycytidine 5\u2032-di-phosphate (an anticancer drug) have been shown to inhibit thymidylate synthase and ribonucleotide reductase, respectively. Although unphosphorylated nucleoside analogues themselves may act as adenosine kinases inhibitors and adenosine receptor ligands, currently, clinically-useful nucleoside drugs primarily depend on cellular activation by nucleoside and nucleotide kinases.","Viral infections are a major threat to human health and account for many serious infectious diseases. The most notable viruses are the blood-borne viruses (BBV), which include hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) and HIV, which are all linked by their mode of transmission, i.e., through blood or bodily fluids.","The Flaviviridae is a group of positive single-stranded RNA viruses with a genome size from 9-15 kilobases (kb). The Flaviviridae consist of various genera including and includes Dengue, Japanese Tick-Borne, and Yellow Fever viruses. Apart from these major groups, there are some additional that are unclassified. include only one species, the Hepatitis C virus, which is composed of many genotypes and subtypes.","Hepatitis C virus is a major cause of viral hepatitis and has infected more than 200 million people worldwide. Hepatitis C virus has a positive-strand RNA genome enclosed in a nucleocapsid and lipid envelope. The HCV genome is approximately 9.6 kb in length and encodes a polyprotein of about 3,000 amino acids (Dymock et al. & 2000, 11, 79). Current treatment for HCV infection is restricted to immunotherapy with interferon-\u03b1 alone or in combination with ribavirin, a nucleoside analogue. However, this treatment is effective in only about half the patient population. Recently, several PCT patent applications (WO 99\/43691, WO 01\/32153, WO 01\/60315, WO 01\/79246, WO 01\/90121, WO 01\/92282, WO 02\/18404, WO 02\/057287, and WO 02\/057425) have described nucleoside analogues as anti-HCV agents in in vitro assays.","Hepatitis B virus has acutely infected almost a third of the human population, and about 5% of the infected are chronic carriers of the virus (Delaney W E et al., & 2001, 12, 1-35). Chronic HBV infection causes liver damage that frequently progresses to cirrhosis and\/or liver cancer later in life. Despite the availability and widespread use of effective vaccines and chemotherapy, the number of chronic HBV carriers approaches 400 million worldwide.","Human immunodeficiency virus causes progressive degeneration of the immune system, leading to the development of AIDS. A number of drugs have been used clinically to treat AIDS, including reverse transcriptase inhibitors and protease inhibitors. Currently, combination therapies are used widely for the treatment of AIDS in order to reduce drug resistance. Despite the progress in the development of anti-HIV drugs, AIDS is still one of the leading epidemic diseases.","Apart from the BBV's discussed above, certain other acute viral infections also pose a great threat to human life, including infections of Herpes Simplex virus (HSV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), influenza viruses, West Nile virus, Coronaviruses, causing for example, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Variola virus (causing smallpox), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), virus (VZV), and Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Accordingly, the broad range of associated infectious diseases and the propensity for viral mutation highlight the continued need for the development of different antiviral drugs.","Bacterial infections have long been the source of many infectious diseases. The widespread use of antibiotics has produced many new strains of life-threatening antibiotic resistant bacteria. Fungal infections are another type of infectious disease, some of which are also life-threatening. There is an ever increasing demand for the treatment of bacterial and fungal infections. As such, antimicrobial drugs based on new mechanisms of action are especially important.","Proliferative disorders (for example, cancer) are some of the most life-threatening diseases today and have been investigated intensively for decades. Cancer is currently the second leading cause of death in the United States, and over 500,000 people die annually from this proliferative disorder. All of the various nucleated cell types of the body can be transformed into benign or malignant tumour cells. Transformation of normal cells into cancer cells is a complex process and is not understood fully. Cancer treatment includes primarily surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. While chemotherapy can be used to treat many types of cancer, surgery and radiation therapy are limited to certain cancers at certain sites of the body. There are a number of anticancer drugs widely used clinically. Among them are alkylating agents, such as cisplatin, and antimetabolites, such as 5-fluorouracil and gemcitabine. Although surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy are available to treat cancer patients, there is no cure for cancer at the present time. Cancer research remains one of the most important focuses of medical and pharmaceutical organizations.","Numerous examples exist in the literature for the synthesis of a variety of modified nucleosides (Chemistry of Nucleosides and Nucleotides, Vol. 1 (1988), Vol. 2 (1991), Vol. 3 (1994), edited by Leroy B. Townsend, Plenum Press). However, there are certain classes of nucleoside compounds that have not been explored fully for their antiviral and anti-proliferative activities. One such class is the bicyclic nucleosides.","Similarly, cycloalkyl-substituted bicyclic nitrogenous base analogues are being employed as protein kinase inhibitors to combat uncontrolled cell growth, such as is described in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2007\/0203143.","In one aspect of the present disclosure, a compound is provided according to the structure of formula

In one embodiment, a DNA and\/or RNA synthesis inhibitor includes a bicyclic nucleoside and\/or nucleotide, having activity as a polymerase inhibiting agent.","While the present disclosure may be embodied in many different forms, several specific embodiments are discussed herein with the understanding that the present disclosure is to be considered only as an exemplification of the principles of the invention, and does not limit the invention to the embodiments illustrated. For example, where the invention is illustrated herein with particular reference to a compound having inhibitory activity against an HCV NS5B polymerase, it will be understood that other polymerases can, if desired, be substituted in whole or in part for the HCV polymerase herein described.","Although not wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that a microbial and\/or a proliferative disease or disorder may be treated, attenuated, and\/or prevented through manipulation of polymerase activity by using a compound herein described. For example, one microbial polymerase target, NS5B, an HCV protein, is released from a polyprotein and is involved in the synthesis of double-stranded RNA from a single-stranded viral RNA genome. It is believed that the replication and\/or reproduction of HCV virus may be inhibited or prevented through the inhibition of NS5B and suppress or prevent the formation of the double-stranded HCV RNA. Alternatively, it is also believed that a nucleoside analogue also may be incorporated into the extending RNA strand to act as a chain-terminator and\/or lead to null mutations. Furthermore, it is believed that a nucleoside analogue or a derived metabolite also may be incorporated into the extending RNA, which may cause mutagenic damage to the viral genome.","It is also believed that proliferative disorders including, for example, acute myelogenous leukemia, cholangiocarcinoma, chronic myelogenous leukemia, lymphoma, melanoma, multiple myeloma, osteosarcoma, gastric sarcoma, glioma, bladder, breast, cervical, colorectal, lung, liver, ovarian, pancreatic, prostrate, or stomach cancer, and non-cancerous diseases associated with excessive and\/or inappropriate cell growth, including endothelial cell growth associated with restenosis such as coronary, carotid, and cerebral lesions, may also be inhibited and\/or prevented through the manipulation of polymerase activity by the compounds described herein, such as D- and\/or L-nucleosides and nucleotides of formula I below. Further, decreases in proliferation rates of highly proliferative and\/or cancerous cells may be achieved in a manner similar to those described above, namely, that antiproliferative nucleoside analogues may be incorporated into the RNA and\/or replicating genomes of highly proliferative and\/or cancerous cells causing, for example, chain-terminator, frame shift, and\/or null mutations that disrupt downstream effector mechanisms required for cell proliferation and metabolic homeostasis.","Such compounds may be screened for antiproliferative and\/or polymerase inhibitory activity by in vitro or in vivo methods known to those skilled in the art in addition to the methods set forth herein","Still further, and not wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that one or more criteria are desirable for a nucleoside antiviral and\/or antiproliferative drug, including, for example, that the nucleoside analogue anabolises to a nucleotide in cells, and\/or that the anabolised nucleotide selectively targets viral proteins and\/or proliferative mechanisms including, for example, peptide- and\/or nucleic acid-based enzymes. It is believed that in order to be phosphorylated in cells and selectively target preferred enzymes, nucleoside analogues may have favourable modifications on their sugar and base moieties. To obtain such favourable nucleoside analogues, a general approach is to generate diverse nucleoside analogues by modifying the base or the sugar or by modifying both base and sugar moieties. Numerous examples exist in the literature for the synthesis of a variety of modified nucleosides, including, for example, Vol. 1 (1988), Vol. 2 (1991), Vol. 3 (1994), edited by L. B. Townsend, Plenum Press; by H. Vorbr\u00fcggen and C. Ruh-Pohlenz, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 2001; and by Y. Mizuno, Elsevier, 1986. The resulting modified compounds can then be assayed for desired activity as discussed more fully herein.","While nucleosides incorporating a variety of sugar moieties have been found useful for the inhibition of viral polymerases, in the case of the Flaviviridae, and in particular HCV, 2\u2032-C-methyl ribonucleosides have been found to be useful (see Eldrup, A.

Hosts that can be treated may include a unicellular organism, including a cell line, or a multicellular organism such as an animal, which may have one or more host-specific and\/or invasive proteins encoded within their genomes and functioning in parallel with host proliferative mechanisms or in collaboration with host mechanism in effect to form new virions, for example, or to alter normal host proliferative patterns. For example, a host includes infected cells, cells transfected with all or part of a genome encoding a polymerase, such as the HCV genome, or an animal having a proliferative disorder or a microbial infection such as a viral infection caused by an RNA virus, including, for example, a virus belonging to group Flaviviridae, for instance or HCV, or a DNA or retrovirus such as HBV or HIV.","In one embodiment, a method of the present disclosure treats a viral infection caused by an RNA virus of the group Flaviviridae and in particular HCV. An illustrative process for treating a host animal having a condition associated with a pathological microbial infection or a proliferative disorder includes administering to the effected host a compound described herein in a therapeutic-effective amount. An example of a therapy includes repeated administration of a therapeutic-effective amount of one or more compounds to achieve a desired therapeutic outcome, such as eliminating and\/or reducing a viral load in a host to a level below that prior to the administration of the compound. Another example of a therapy may include repeated administration of sub-therapeutic-effective amounts that, over time, accumulate to a therapeutic-effective amount. In a further example, a single dose of an effective amount of one or more compounds and\/or salts, esters, solvates, hydrates and prodrugs thereof to achieve a desired therapeutic outcome is envisioned.","In one embodiment, a compound may be used for treating a host animal, such as a mouse, rat, pig, cow, rabbit, dog, cat, horse, bird, lizard, fish, or primates such as a monkey, chimpanzee, or human that has a condition associated with pathological polymerase activity, such as a microbial infection and\/or a proliferative disorder.","As used herein, the terms \u201ctherapeutically effective amount\u201d or \u201ctherapeutically effective dose\u201d (and variations thereof) mean an amount of a compound of formula I which, when administered to a host animal according to a desired dosing regimen, provides a desired therapeutic activity for therapeutic treatment and\/or prophylactic treatment, such as, for example, at least partially attaining the desired effect, and\/or delaying the onset of, and\/or inhibiting the progression of, and\/or preventing, halting or reversing altogether the onset or progression of the particular disease, disorder, and\/or condition being treated. Dosing may be in a single or divided dose and may occur at intervals of minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, or years or continuously over any one of these periods, but it is recognized that once daily dosing is a desirable because of the ease of adherence to the regimen by the patient, especially when the duration of dosing is more than a few days. The half-life of the drug is an important pharmacokinetic parameter in deciding the dosing frequency. The time needed to achieve steady-state drug concentrations, as well as the time needed to establish new steady-state concentrations after a change in dosage regimen, is a function of the elimination half-life of the active therapeutic entity. For once daily dosing a plasma t1\/2 of >6 hours is generally required in order to minimize Cmax\/Cmin fluctuations. In the present description, it has been exemplified that compound 9 has a plasma half-life of 4-7.6 hours in preclinical animal species. Furthermore the intracellular half-life of the active anabolite of compound 9, compound 25, is 38 hours in primary human heptocytes. The long intracellular half-life of the active triphosphate anabolite, coupled with its plasma half-life, generally suggest that compound 9 can be administered, if desired, once daily for therapeutic treatment and\/or prophylactic treatment of a disease in a patient, including, for example, an infection or microbial infection such as an infection of liver cells including chronic hepatitis C.","Suitable dosages lie within the range of about 0.1 ng per kg of body weight to about 10 g per kg of body weight, or in the range of about 1 \u03bcg to about 10 g per kg of body weight, or in the range of about 10 \u03bcg to about 30 \u03bcg per kg of body weight, or in the range of about 15 \u03bcg to about 25 \u03bcg per kg of body weight, or in the range of about 1 mg to about 10 g per kg of body weight, or in the range of about 1 mg to about 500 mg per kg of body weight, or in the range of about 1 mg to about 250 mg per kg of body weight, or in the range of about 1 mg to about 100 mg per kg of body weight per dosage, or up to about 50 mg per body weight per dosage, or greater or less amounts per body weight per dosage.","While not intended to limit the scope of the invention, when administered to an animal, such as a human, the composition may be administered at a dose, for example, a therapeutic-effective amount, to achieve a peak plasma of active molecule of about 0.1 nM to about 100 nM, 0.1 \u03bcM to about 100 \u03bcM, or about 0.5 \u03bcM to about 75 \u03bcM, or about 1 \u03bcM to about 50 \u03bcM, or greater than or equal to about 0.1 \u03bcM, or greater than or equal to about 0.5 \u03bcM or greater than or equal to about 1 \u03bcM, and\/or intracellular concentration of about 0.1 pmol\/million cells to about 100 pmol\/million cells, 100 pmol\/million cells to about 1000 pmol\/million cells, or about 1000 pmol\/million cells to about 10000 pmol\/million cells, or greater than or equal to about 10 pmol\/million cells, or greater than or equal to about 50 pmol\/million cells or greater than or equal to about 100 pmol\/million cells, and may be adjusted over time according to individual need and condition. The peak plasma and\/or intracellular concentration of active molecule achieved depends on several factors familiar to those skilled in the art including, for example, route of administration, rates of absorption, protein binding, compound conversion, compound anabolism, compound catabolism, incorporation of a compound into a genome, and excretion and inactivation rates.","Suitable dosage amounts and dosing regimens may be selected in accordance with a variety of factors, including one or more particular conditions being treated, the severity of the one or more conditions, the genetic profile, age, health, sex, diet, and weight of the subject, the route of administration alone or in combination with pharmacological considerations including the activity, efficacy, bioavailability, pharmacokinetic, and toxicological profiles of the particular compound employed, whether a drug delivery system is utilised and whether the drug is administered as part of a drug combination. Therefore, the dosage regimen to be employed may vary widely and may necessarily deviate from the dosage regimens set forth herein.","In one embodiment, an active ingredient of the present disclosure may be administered in a single dose or a series of doses. While it is possible for the active ingredient to be administered alone, for example, as a fraction of a formulation scheme and\/or a purified compound from a batch reaction, it may be desirable to present it as a composition, such as a pharmaceutical composition. Formulation of such compositions is well known to those skilled in the art. For example, a candidate pharmaceutical composition may contain one or more carriers, diluents, and\/or excipients, and any combination thereof, whereby such carriers are inactive pharmaceutical ingredients. Examples include conventional solvents, dispersion media, fillers, solid carriers, coatings, antifungal agents, antibacterial agents, antiviral agents, dermal penetration agents, surfactants, isotonic agents, absorption agents, adjuvants, analgesics, stabilisers, preservatives, drugs, and the like. It will be understood that the compositions of the invention may also include other supplementary physiologically active agents. These carriers, diluents and excipients make up a pharmaceutical carrier system for the compound of formula I.","A candidate carrier that is to be administered to an animal is \u201cpharmaceutically-acceptable\u201d in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the composition and suitably tolerated by the host. Compositions may be adapted according to the desired route of administration. For example, compositions herein may be formulated for oral, rectal, nasal, topical (including buccal and sublingual), transdermal, vaginal, injection\/injectable, and\/or parental (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous, and intradermal) administration. Other suitable administration routes are incorporated herein. The compositions may be presented conveniently in unit dosage forms and may be prepared by any methods known in the pharmaceutical arts. Examples of suitable drug formulations and\/or forms are discussed in, for example, Hoover, John E. Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Co., Eston, Pa.; 18edition (1995); and Liberman, H. A. and Lachman, L. Eds., Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Marcel Decker, New York, N.Y., 1980. Illustrative methods include the step of bringing one or more active ingredients into association with a carrier that constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. In general, the compositions may be prepared by bringing into association uniformly and intimately one or more active ingredients with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product.","Compositions suitable for oral administration may be presented as discrete units such as capsules, sachets, or tablets each containing a predetermined amount of the active ingredient; as a powder or granules; as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous or non-aqueous liquid; or as an oil-in-water liquid emulsion or a water-in-oil liquid emulsion. The active ingredient may also be presented as a bolus, electuary, or paste.","A tablet may be made by compression or moulding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active ingredient in a free-flowing form such as a powder or granules, optionally mixed with a binder (for example, inert diluent, preservative disintegrant (for example, sodium starch glycolate, cross-linked polyvinyl pyrrolidone, cross-linked sodium carboxymethyl cellulose), a surface-active, or a dispersing agent). Moulded tablets may be made by moulding in a suitable machine known to a skilled artisan a mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent. The tablets may optionally be coated and\/or scored and may be formulated so as to provide slow and\/or controlled release of the active ingredient therein using, for example, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose in varying proportions to provide one or more desired release profiles. Tablets may be provided optionally with an enteric coating to provide release in parts of the gut other than the stomach.","Compositions suitable for topical administration in the mouth include lozenges including the active ingredient in a flavoured or unflavored base, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth gum; pastilles including the active ingredient in an inert base, such as gelatine and glycerin, and\/or sucrose and acacia gum; and mouthwashes including the active ingredient in a suitable liquid carrier with or without flavouring and\/or additional ingredients.","Compositions suitable for topical administration to the skin may comprise the compounds dissolved or suspended in any suitable carrier and\/or base and may be in the form of lotions, gel, creams, pastes, ointments, and the like. Suitable carriers include mineral oil, propylene glycol, polyoxyethylene, polyoxypropylene, emulsifying wax, sorbitan monostearate, polysorbate 60, cetyl esters wax, cetearyl alcohol, 2-octyldodecanol, benzyl alcohol, and water. Transdermal patches may also be used to administer compositions that include one or more compounds of the invention. Compositions for rectal administration may be presented as a suppository with a suitable base including, for example, cocoa butter, glycerin, gelatine, and\/or polyethylene glycol, among others. Compositions suitable for vaginal administration may be presented as pessaries, tampons, creams, gels, pastes, foams, and\/or spray formulations containing compositions containing one or more active ingredient compounds of the present disclosure in addition to one or more carriers known in the art.","Compositions suitable for parenteral administration include, for example, aqueous and non-aqueous isotonic sterile injection solutions which may contain anti-oxidants, buffers, bactericides, and\/or solutes that render the composition isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient; and aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions which may include, for example, suspending agents and thickening agents. Parenteral compositions may be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose sealed containers, for example, ampoules and vials, and may be stored in a freeze-dried (lyophilised) condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example, water for injections, immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions may be prepared from sterile powders, granules and tablets of the kind described previously. In addition, compositions and formulations may be delivered by a dry powder inhaler in the form of a dry powder or delivered by a mist inhaler in the form of a mist.","It should be understood that in addition to the active ingredients mentioned above, compositions herein may include other agents as appropriate for the type of composition in question. For example, compositions suitable for oral administration may include, for example, binders, colorants, sweeteners, thickeners, flavouring agents, disintegrating agents, coating agents, preservatives, lubricants, and\/or time delay agents. Suitable sweeteners include, for example, sucrose, lactose, glucose, aspartame, and\/or saccharine. Suitable disintegrating agents include, for example, cornstarch, methylcellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, xanthan gum, bentonite, alginic acid, and\/or agar. Suitable flavouring agents include, for example, peppermint oil, oil of wintergreen, cherry, orange, or raspberry flavouring. Suitable coating agents include, for example, polymers or copolymers of acrylic acid, and\/or methacrylic acid, and\/or their esters, waxes, fatty alcohols, zein, shellac, or gluten. Suitable preservatives include, for example, sodium benzoate, vitamin E, alpha-tocopherol, ascorbic acid, methyl paraben, propyl paraben, or sodium bisulfite. Suitable lubricants include, for example, magnesium stearate, stearic acid, sodium oleate, sodium chloride, or talc. Suitable time delay agents include, for example, glyceryl monostearate, or glyceryl distearate.","In addition, other compounds useful in this invention that are sufficiently basic or acidic acids may also form salts. In some cases, the salts can be used as an aid in isolation, purification, resolution, or delivery of the compounds described herein. Further, compounds of the present disclosure may be administered in the form of a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt. However, non-pharmaceutically-acceptable salts also fall within the scope of the present disclosure used, for example, as intermediates in the preparation of pharmaceutically-acceptable salts or other compounds.","Suitable pharmaceutically-acceptable salts include, but are not limited to salts of pharmaceutically-acceptable inorganic acids, including, for example, hydrochloric, sulfuric, phosphoric, nitric, carbonic, boric, sulfamic, and hydrobromic acids, or salts of pharmaceutically-acceptable organic acids such as acetic, propionic, butyric, tartaric, maleic, hydroxymaleic, fumaric, maleic, citric, lactic, mucic, gluconic, benzoic, succinic, oxalic, phenylacetic, methanesulfonic, toluenesulfonic, benezenesulfonic, salicyclic sulfanilic, aspartic, glutamic, edetic, stearic, palmitic, oleic, lauric, pantothenic, tannic, ascorbic, and valeric acids.","Base salts include, but are not limited to, those formed with pharmaceutically-acceptable cations, including alkali metal and alkaline earth metal salts, such as sodium, potassium, lithium, calcium, magnesium, ammonium, and alkylammonium. In particular, the present disclosure includes within its scope cationic salts, for example, sodium or potassium salts, or alkyl esters (for example, methyl and ethyl) of the phosphate group.","Salts of the instant compound may be a pharmaceutically suitable (i.e., pharmaceutically acceptable) salt including, but not limited to, acid addition salts formed by mixing a solution of the instant compound with a solution of a pharmaceutically acceptable acid. The pharmaceutically acceptable acid may be hydrochloric acid, methanesulphonic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, succinic acid, acetic acid, benzoic acid, oxalic acid, citric acid, tartaric acid, carbonic acid or phosphoric acid.

as well as in the form of racemic or non-racemic mixtures thereof. The optical isomers can be obtained by resolution of the racemic mixtures according to conventional processes well known in the art, for example, by formation of diastereoisomeric salts by treatment with an optically active acid or base. Examples of appropriate acids are tartaric, diacetyltartaric, dibenzoyltartaric, ditoluoyltartaric and camphorsulfonic acid and then separation of the mixture of diastereoisomers by crystallization followed by liberation of the optically active bases from these salts. A different process for separation of optical isomers involves the use of a chiral chromatography column optimally chosen to maximise the separation of the enantiomers.","Still another available method involves synthesis of covalent diastereomeric molecules, for example, esters, amides, acetals, ketals, and the like, by reacting compounds of formula I with an optically active acid in an activated form, an optically active diol, or an optically active isocyanate. The synthesised diastereoisomers can be separated by conventional means such as chromatography, distillation, crystallization or sublimation, and then hydrolyzed to deliver the enantiomerically pure compound. In some cases, hydrolysis to the parent optically active drug is not necessary prior to dosing the patient since the compound can behave as a prodrug. The optically active compounds of formula I can likewise be obtained by utilizing optically active starting materials.","In addition to the optical isomers or potential optical isomers discussed above, other types of isomers are specifically intended to be included in this disclosure. Examples include cis isomers, trans isomers, E isomers, Z isomers, syn-isomers, anti-isomers, tautomers and the like. Aryl, heterocyclyl, or heteroaryl tautomers, heteroatom isomers and ortho, meta, or para substitution isomers are also included as isomers. Solvates or solvent addition compounds such as hydrates or alcoholates are also specifically included both as chemicals of this disclosure and in, for example, formulations or pharmaceutical compositions for delivery.","Equivalents of the general formulas set forth above for the disclosed compounds and derivatives as well as the intermediates are compounds otherwise corresponding thereto and having the same general properties such as tautomers thereof and compounds wherein one or more of the various R groups are simple variations of the substituents as defined therein, for example, wherein R is a higher alkyl group than that indicated. In addition, where a substituent is designated as, or can be, hydrogen, the exact chemical nature of a substituent which is other than hydrogen at that position, for example, a halogen, hydroxy, amino, and the like functional group, is not critical so long as it does not adversely affect the overall activity and\/or synthesis procedure. For example, two hydroxyl groups, two amino groups, two thiol groups or a mixture of two hydrogen-heteroatom groups on the same carbon are known not to be stable without protection or as a derivative.","Basic nitrogen-containing groups may be quarternized with such agents as lower alkyl halide, such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, and butyl chlorides, bromides and iodides; dialkyl sulfates like dimethyl and diethyl sulfate; and others.","In some embodiments, the compounds disclosed herein, such as the nucleosides and nucleotides, also include the prodrug derivatives thereof, which are covalently modified latent forms of the therapeutically-active compound.","The term \u201cprodrug\u201d is used in its broadest sense and encompasses those compounds that when administered in a biological system are converted or activated in vivo to therapeutically-active compounds by, for example, a spontaneous chemical reaction, a metabolic chemical reaction, an enzyme catalysed chemical reaction, and\/or photolysis. Illustratively, a prodrug can be activated either by cellular enzymes or by chemical cleavage such as hydrolysis to release (liberate) the nucleoside, nucleotide or nucleotide mimic after the prodrug enters cells. Examples of prodrugs include compounds that can be oxidised, reduced, esterified, deesterified, alkylated, dealkylated, acylated, deacylated, aminated, deaminated, phosphorylated, dephosphorylated, photolyzed, and\/or hydrolysed. Enzymes that may be capable of enzymatic conversion or activation of a prodrug to a therapeutically-active compound include, for example, amidases, cholinesterases, esterases, lipases, nucleases, oxidases, phospholipases, phosphases, and\/or reductases. Such prodrug modification may improve or enhance, for example, drug absorption, solubility, lipophilicity, bioavailability, efficacy, and\/or drug delivery into cells.","Prodrug derivatives of the compounds of the present disclosure may be prepared by modification of the sugar moiety or of the phosphate or phosphate mimic to include a prodrug substituent. A prodrug may also include a labile protecting group on the functional moiety or therapeutically-active compound as described herein. In addition to those described herein, prodrug derivatives of nucleosides, nucleotides and nucleotide phosphate mimics and methods of making the prodrugs appropriate for use in the present disclosure are described, inter alia, in PCT Publications WO 2003\/072757 and WO 2003\/073989 and U.S. Patent application publication US20020361177.","Prodrugs are compounds that are pharmacologically inert but are converted by enzyme or chemical action to an active form of the drug (i.e., an active pharmaceutical ingredient) at or near the predetermined target site. In other words, prodrugs are inactive compounds that yield an active compound upon metabolism in the body, which may or may not be enzymatically controlled. Prodrugs may also be broadly classified into two groups: bioprecursor and carrier prodrugs. Prodrugs may also be subclassified according to the nature of their action. Bioprecursor prodrugs are compounds that already contain the embryo of the active species within their structure, whereby the active species are produced upon metabolism. For example, the first prodrug, antibacterial prontosil, is metabolized in vivo to its active metabolite sulphanilamide. Carrier prodrugs are formed by combining the active drug with a carrier species forming a compound having desirable chemical and biological characteristics, whereby the link is an ester or amide so that the carrier prodrug is easily metabolized upon absorption or delivery to the target site. For example, lipophilic moieties may be incorporated to improve transport through membranes. Carrier prodrugs linked by a functional group to carrier are referred to as bipartate prodrugs. Prodrugs where the carrier is linked to the drug by a separate structure are referred to as tripartate prodrugs, whereby the carrier is removed by an enzyme-controlled metabolic process, and whereby the linking structure is removed by an enzyme system or by a chemical reaction. (Thomas G, Medicinal Chemistry: An Introduction, 2000, John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. pp. 12, 17, 243 and 364-372)(See also, Wermuth C G, 2003, The Practice of Medicinal Chemistry, 2nd Ed., 33:561-582). Hydroxy-protecting group refers to any suitable group, such as tert-butyloxy-carbonyl (t-BOC) and t-butyl-dimethyl-silyl (TBS). Other hydroxy protecting groups are shown in Hanson J R, 1999, , Sheffield Academic Press, 2:8-35, which is incorporated herein by reference.","Illustratively, when administered to a host, a prodrug is generally administered as a pharmaceutically-acceptable prodrug that is metabolised to form the therapeutically-active compound and the prodrug moiety or substituent through, for example, hydrolysis or oxidation by enzymatic activity or by acid or base solvolysis. A \u201cprodrug moiety\u201d or \u201cprodrug substituent\u201d refers to the labile group that is removed from the therapeutically-active compound through a metabolic, hydrolytic, and\/or enzymatic process. However, non-pharmaceutically-acceptable prodrugs also fall within the scope of the present disclosure and may be use used, for example, in in vitro assays to improve solubility and\/or as intermediates in the preparation of pharmaceutically-acceptable prodrugs or other compounds.","Illustrative prodrugs moieties include, but are not limited to residues of: proteins; antibiotics; D- and L-amino acids which may be attached to a phosphate moiety or a phosphate mimic moiety via a carbon atom (phosphonates), a nitrogen atom (phosphoamidates), or an oxygen atom (phosphoesters) or may be attached to the sugar moiety through any one or more of the R-Rgroups; peptides (preferably up to 10 amino acids) attached to a phosphate moiety or a phosphate mimic moiety via a carbon atom (phosphonates), a nitrogen atom (phosphoamidates), or an oxygen atom (phosphoesters), or may be attached to the sugar moiety through any one or more of the R-Rgroups; drug moieties attached to a phosphate moiety or a phosphate mimic moiety via a carbon atom (phosphonates), a nitrogen atom (phosphoamidates), or an oxygen atom (phosphoesters), or may be attached to the sugar moiety through any one or more of the R-Rgroups; as well as including steroids; vitamins; polyamines; carbohydrates; polyethylene glycols (PEGs); cyclosaligenyls; substituted 4 to 8-membered rings, with or without heteroatom substitutions, 1,3-phosphoramidate attachments to a terminal phosphate or phosphate mimic moiety (\u03b3 or \u03b2) or connecting between an \u03b1,\u03b2 or \u03b2,\u03b3 of a phosphate moiety or phosphate mimic moiety, and so on. Phosphoesters and phosphoamidates are particularly preferred prodrug moieties.","In one embodiment, the prodrug of a nucleoside 5\u2032-mono-phosphate mimic can mask the negative charges of the phosphate mimic moiety entirely or partially, or mask the negative charges of the di-phosphate mimic or tri-phosphate mimic moiety or phosphate moiety in order to, for example, enhance drug absorption and\/or drug delivery into cells.","In another embodiment one or more prodrug substituents or moieties may be attached to one or more X, X and X positions on a nucleoside mono-phosphate mimic or to one or more X\u2014Xpositions on a nucleoside di- or tri-phosphate mimic. Illustrative prodrug substituents in positions X, X or X position include 2,3-O-diacylglyceryloxy, 2,3-O-dialkylglyceryloxy, 1-O-alkyl-2-O-acylglyceryloxy, 1-O-acyl-2-O-alkylglyceryloxy, 1-S-alkyl-2-O-acyl-1-thioglyceryloxy, acyloxymethoxy, S-acyl-2-thioethoxy, S-pivaloyl-2-thioethoxy, acyloxymethoxy, pivaloyloxymethoxy, alkoxycarbonyloxymethoxy, S-alkyldithio-S\u2032-ethyoxy acyloxymethoxy, S-acyl-2-thioethoxy, S-pivaloyl-2-thioethoxy, pivaloyloxymethoxy, alkoxycarbonyloxymethoxy, and S-alkyldithio-S\u2032-ethyoxy.","In a further embodiment, the prodrug substituent is a substituent on a hydroxyl group of the sugar moiety (that is, for instance, any one of R-R). Illustratively, the modification results in the formation of an ester and in this regard the preferred prodrug substituents are C-Cacyl groups for example, acetyl, propionyl, pivaloyl, etc. Also preferred are substituted C-Cacyl moieties, for example, fluoroacetyl, difluoroacetyl, etc. More preferably the substituted C-Cacyl group is represented as a residue of an L or D amino acid consisting of alanine, asparagine, cysteine, glutamine, glycine, isoleucine, leucine, methionine, phenylalanine, proline, serine, threonine, tryptophan, tyrosine, valine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, arginine, histidine, and lysine. Most preferably the prodrug substituent is an amino acid residue of D or L-valine.","The pharmaceutically suitable oral carrier systems (also referred to as drug delivery systems, which are modern technology, distributed with or as a part of a drug product that allows for the uniform release or targeting of drugs to the body) preferably include FDA-approved and\/or USP-approved inactive ingredients. Under 21 CFR 210.3(b)(8), an inactive ingredient is any component of a drug product other than the active ingredient. According to 21 CFR 210.3(b)(7), an active ingredient is any component of a drug product intended to furnish pharmacological activity or other direct effect in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or to affect the structure or any function of the body of humans or other animals. Active ingredients include those components of the product that may undergo chemical change during the manufacture of the drug product and be present in the drug product in a modified form intended to furnish the specified activity or effect.

To Compound 1, trifluoroacetic acid was added, followed by distilled HO and then the mixture was incubated at 60\u00b0 C. for 8 h to render Compound E.","The compounds of the present disclosure may be tested for biological activity using well known procedures. For example, antiviral assays may be conducted according to published, widely used protocols. In order to obtain the therapeutic index, compound-induced cytotoxicity to host cells may also measured in parallel with antiviral activities. To determine the mode of action of antiviral nucleosides the corresponding nucleoside tri-phosphates may be subjected to enzyme-based assays for the inhibition of viral polymerases according to known protocols (Ranjith-Kumar et al. 2001, 75, 8615; Dhanak et al. 2002, 277, 38322-38327). Some compounds of the present disclosure showed Kvalues of less than 1 \u03bcM against HCV NS5B.","Since the replicon RNA replication mimics the replication of HCV RNA in infected hepatocytes, compounds that have the inhibitory effects in replicon assays are potentially useful as anti-HCV drugs. The HCV replicon-containing cell lines (Randall and Rice, 2001, 14, 743) may be used for the identification of potential anti-HCV compounds. Among them is a widely used subgenomic replicon system developed by Lohmann et al. (1999, 285, 110; 2000, 81, 1631; 2001, 75, 1437, 2002, 76, 4008). Some compounds of the present disclosure showed potent anti-HCV activity with ECvalues of low \u03bcM and below 1 \u03bcM.","Immortalized cell lines derived from hepatocytes, such as the Huh7 cells used in replicon-containing cell lines, are known to have diminished metabolic activity. Therefore the assessment of the intrahepatocyte levels of therapeutically active entities that are generated intracellularly by anabolic or catabolic processes requires assessment in primary hepatocytes. Some compounds of the present disclosure showed higher levels of intracellular triphosphate anabolite in primary hepatocytes compared with replicon-containing cells.","Widely used protocols developed by Korba et al. (1992, 19, 55), and Pai et al. (1996, 40, 380) may be useful for the determination of in vitro anti-HBV activity.","Anti-HIV assays can be conducted according to the protocols developed by Schinazi et al. (1990, 34, 1061; 1992, 36, 2423; 1993, 37, 875) or other widely used protocols (Kimpton et al. 1992, 66, 2232; Chan et al. 2001, 44, 1866). Illustrative nucleoside tri-phosphates of the present disclosure may act as potent inhibitors of the non-structural position 5B (NS5B), which is HCV's RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Accordingly, such compounds may be suited to treat HCV and\/or inhibit or prevent replication of HCV in a host. Also, compounds of the present disclosure may exhibit profiles of activity and may provide the artisan with an alternative to treating viruses that exhibit drug resistance to conventional drugs. Other compounds of the present disclosure may also reduce toxicity and tolerability levels relative to existing therapies and those in development, and\/or improve pharmacokinetic properties.","Accordingly, nucleosides, nucleotide, nucleotide mimics, and\/or their prodrugs of the present disclosure can be useful for the inhibition of a variety of enzymes including, but not limited to, DNA or RNA polymerases, helicases, ribonucleotide reductases, protein kinases, and telomerases and for the modulation of G-proteins, P2 purinergic receptors and the allosteric sites of a variety of enzymes. Illustratively, the nucleosides, nucleotides, nucleotide mimics and\/or prodrugs of the present disclosure are used to treat viral infections caused by the RNA viruses of the group Flaviviridae and, in particular, HCV.","Also, the nucleosides, nucleotide mimics and\/or their prodrugs and derivatives thereof that display cytotoxicity to fast-dividing cancer cells may be useful for the treatment of proliferative disorders, including, but not limited to, lung cancer, liver cancer, prostate cancer, colon cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, melanoma, and leukemia.","As the ligands of P2 receptors and G-proteins, as well as the inhibitors of protein kinases, the nucleosides, nucleotides, nucleotide mimics and\/or their prodrugs of the present disclosure may also be useful for the treatment of a wide range of other diseases and disorders such as inflammatory diseases, autoimmune diseases, Type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases.","To address the issue of drug resistance, combination therapies are widely used in the treatment of infectious diseases and\/or proliferative disorders. One or more nucleosides, nucleotides, nucleotide mimics, prodrugs, and\/or pharmaceutically-acceptable salts, esters, solvates, hydrates and prodrugs of the present disclosure may also be therapeutically administered as a single formulation, such as a single tablet or a solution for injection, with one or more chemical entities, or alternatively may be administered in separate formulations in combination with one or more other active chemical entities, to form a combination therapy. The other active chemical entities may include a small molecule, a polypeptide, and\/or a polynucleotide, and combinations, salts, esters, solvates, hydrates and prodrugs and\/or other derivatives thereof. When administered as separate formulations, the individual compounds may be co-administered at substantially the same time, for example, administering two individual tablets, or administered separately at different times and\/or at different frequencies. Illustratively, the dose administered to a host for each compound is generally determined by the desired blood level concentration of drug over a predetermined amount of time to achieve a therapeutic affect in the host, as know in the art and further described herein. For instance, compounds of this disclosure may be useful when used in combination with other agents known to exert antiviral and\/or antiproliferative effect. For example, combination with immunomodulatory\/antiviral agents such as an interferon and\/or an interferon derivative such as interferon alpha 2B (such as Intron\u00ae A interferon available from Schering Corp., Kenilworth, N.J.), pegylated interferon alpha 2A (such as Pegasys\u00ae available from Hoffmann-LaRoche, Nutley, N.J.), pegylated interferon alpha 2B (such as Peg-Intron\u2122 available from Schering Corp., Kenilworth, N.J.), consensus interferon (such as interferon alphacon-1, or Infergen\u00ae available from Valeant Pharmaceuticals, Costa Mesa, Calif.), interferon alpha 2A, recombinant interferon alpha 2A (such as Roferon interferon available from Hoffmann-LaRoche, Nutley, N.J.), or lymphoblastoid interferon tau, and other large or small molecules known to modulate host immune responses may be beneficial in the treatment of a viral infection.","Similarly, combinations of compounds of this disclosure with inosine mono-phosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) inhibitors, antiviral nucleosides, and\/or antiviral non-nucleosides could augment the activity of the nucleosides or nucleotides disclosed herein when administered alone. Other illustrative combinations useful in present disclosure include combinations with, for example, a cyclosporine such as, cyclosporin A; a cytokine, such as, interleukin 2, interleukin 6, or interleukin 12; a type 1 helper T cell response enhancer; interfering RNA; anti-sense RNA; an imidazoquinolone, such as resimiquimod or Imiqimod; an inosine 5\u2032-monophosphate dehydrogenase inhibitor; ribavirin; amantadine; rimantadine; and\/or a metalloprotease, serine protease, polymerase, or a helicase inhibitory agent; and combinations thereof. In one embodiment, one or more compounds of the present disclosure are used in combination with one or more compounds having anti-HCV activity including, for example, a HCV helicase inhibitor, a HCV metalloprotease inhibitor, a HCV polymerase inhibitor, a HCV NS4B protein inhibitor, a HCV NS5A protein inhibitor, a HCV serine protease inhibitor, and\/or a HCV entry, assembly, or egress protein inhibitor.","The present disclosure also relates to kits or packages adapted for administration of the particular dosage regimen, to ease mixing and\/or administration of a composition disclosed herein. Illustratively, a month's supply of tablets can be packaged in a tablet dispenser such as a DIALPAK\u00ae tablet dispenser supplied by Ortho, Inc., which contains a dial member at the center of a circle that points to a day of the week so that when a pill is removed from the dispenser, the dial can be rotated so that it points to the next day of the week. This design is intended to avoid the inadvertent taking of two pills in one day and is also designed to let the owner of the device know when a day has been skipped. A further illustration includes supplying a month's supply of powder that is packaged with a separate month's supply of diluent and a re-usable plastic dosing cup. One skilled in the art will appreciate that such kits may contain many different variations of the above components, such as, for example, kits that are packaged in a unit dose form or as daily, weekly or yearly kits.","Another aspect of the present disclosure is a method of inhibiting the function of the HCV replicon by contacting the HCV replicon with a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt, ester, solvate, hydrate or prodrug thereof.","Based upon the proceeding schemes and\/or procedures and the following Examples, substituted pyrrolo-triazines attached

This RNA, termed a replicon, encodes all of the HCV non-structural proteins (HCV NS2 to NS5B, inclusively) that catalyze the replication of the RNA replicon. Replicon copy number per cell is about 1000 to 5000. The replicon is stably maintained as an episome in dividing cells, and therefore it is important to keep the cells in a sub-confluent state and to ensure selection for the replicon by culturing the cells in medium supplemented with 0.25 mg\/ml G418. The entire structural region of the HCV genome is replaced with a neomycin resistance gene; hence this cell line produces no infectious virus. Moreover, the gene is fused to the neogene with an FMDV-2A autoprocessing peptide that allows for expression of both mature luciferase and neomycin phosphotransferase from one cistron. Luciferase levels are directly proportional to the HCV RNA levels, and the cell system allows for the evaluation of the potency of HCV inhibitors in cell culture.","The assay outline includes the following steps on Day 1: (1) Plate cells at a density of 10,000 cells\/well of a 96 well plate and incubate 37\u00b0 C.; (2) Make compound dilutions; (3) Add compound dilutions to cells; (4) Incubate for 72 h. The assay includes the following steps on Day 4: (1) Perform Cell titer blue assay for cytotoxicity (the assay is based on the reduction of resazurin (cell titer blue) into a fluorescent product, resorufin, in metabolically active cells, and the assay can be duplexed with the assay used for HCV replicon luciferase reporter assay); (2) Perform luciferase assay with the Bright-Glo luciferase substrate (Promega) and read luminescence; (3) Process results.","Under this outline, the cell culture includes MP-1 cells (Huh7 cells maintaining an HCV subgenomic replicon containing the luciferase-FMDV 2A-neomycin phosphotransferase fusion gene).

If required, cells are passaged 1:3 to maintain the culture sub-confluent. Visible colonies are formed three to four weeks post-transfection and G418 selection. G418 resistant colonies may be picked and expanded into second generation cell lines, or pooled into a population culture that constitutes the cells harboring serially passaged HCV Replicon RNA. The passage of mutations that are stable and confer resistance to a specific inhibitor are confirmed by measuring ECwith the second generation of replicon cells.","The NS5b chain termination assay uses stepwise addition of each nucleotide complementary to the overhang of a hairpin template, with the first nucleotide radioactive, i.e. the direct labelling method. If a test compound is a chain terminator, the system is able to clearly show its incorporation into the chain, and no further extension is observed.","Under this protocol, the contents of two separate vials are prepared. Vial A contains 1.5 \u03bcl 10\u00d7 buffer, 1.5 \u03bcl enzyme, 1.0 \u03bcl oligo and 5.0 \u03bcl for a total volume of approximately 9 \u03bcl. Vial B contains NTPs of 6 \u03bcl. The contents of Vial A is mixed with the contents of Vial B to provide a total volume of 15 \u03bcl, followed by incubation at 30\u00b0 C. for 60 min. The aliquot is mixed with RNA loading buffer, heated at 70\u00b0 C. for 15 min and run onto a 20% acrylamide gel with 7.2 M urea. The final concentration of NS5b is 1 \u03bcM, and the final concentration of NTP\/cpd is 2 \u03bcM.","Poly r(U) RNA template (Sigma) is employed for the HCV NS5b polymerase inhibition assay using a NS5b\u039455 (genotype 1b) purified enzyme. The kinetic constant, K, is determined for the Poly r(U) template and ATP using a non-linear, least squares fit of initial rates as a function of substrate concentration assuming Michaelis-Menten kinetics.","Standard RdRp assays consist of 20 \u03bcg\/mL Poly r(U) RNA template and 100 nM HCV NS5b\u039455 (genotype 1b) in a 50 \u03bcL reaction mixture containing 20 mM Tris-HCl, 5 mM MgCl, 5 mM MnCl, 3 mM DTT, 72 \u03bcM ATP, and 0.019 \u03bcM [\u03b1-P]ATP. Elongation reactions are initiated by the addition of ATP, and proceed for 60 min at 25\u00b0 C. Reactions are quenched by the addition of 0.2 M EDTA, and product formation is collected by filtration through Multiscreen plates (Millipore). Quantification of product formation was performed using TopCount (Perkin Elmer). The inhibitor concentration at which the enzyme catalysed rate is reduced by half (IC) is determined using a computer program for curve fitting. ICconcentrations for nucleoside 5\u2032-triphosphate compounds of the present disclosure are expected to range from <10 nM to >100 \u03bcM. Under these conditions, the ICfor Compound 25 is 0.37 \u03bcM.","HCV NS5b Polymerase KDetermination Assay","A modified method of the NS5b Polymerase inhibition assay was used to determine the Kand the mode of action for NS5b inhibitor compounds. The enzyme and template were fixed at 100 nM and 20 g\/mL and all other reaction conditions were identical to the NS5b polymerase inhibition assay. The velocity of NS5b reactions were monitored at different ATP and inhibitor concentrations. The ATP concentration ranged from 0.1 \u03bcM to 1000 \u03bcM, and the concentration of the inhibitor ranged from 0.003 fold to 7 fold of the ICvalue. Velocities obtained at each ATP and inhibitor concentration were analyzed using Graph Pad Prism to identify the mode of inhibition and Kfor inhibitor compounds. Under these conditions, the Ki for Compound 25 is 0.08 \u03bcM.","In vitro anabolism of Compound 9 in replicon cells and primary human hepatocytes produces the triphosphate species Compound 25.

The Huh-7 human hepatoma liver cells (JCRB0403 http:\/\/cellbank.nibio.go.jp\/) are maintained in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Huh-7 cell clones carrying a HCV subgenomic replicon (Lohmann et al., 1999. Science 285: 110-113) are maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 0.25 mg\/ml G418. The cell lines are grown at 37\u00b0 C. in a 5% CO-95% air atmosphere. Plated primary human hepatocytes (6-well Collagen\/No Overlay) were purchased from Cellz Direct (NC, USA) and maintained in InVitroGro Medium (Celsius, In Vitro Technologies, MD USA) under the same incubation conditions.","For intracellular anabolism studies, Huh-7 cells are trypsinized, harvested, re-suspended in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, counted and seeded at a density of 0.7\u00d710cells per well in a six-well plate and incubated for a period of 24 hr at 37\u00b0 C. in 5% COatmosphere. Media is removed and replaced with fresh DMEM+10% FBS containing 10 \u03bcM Compound 9 for a period of 24 hr at 37\u00b0 C. The cell monolayer is then quickly washed three times with drug-free medium to remove extracellular Compound 9 and each well is incubated with fresh DMEM+10% FBS for a specified time period (i.e. 6-wells at 0, 2, 4, 8, 24 and 48 hr). At the end of the incubation period, the medium is aspirated from the well and the cell monolayer is washed with cold phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.4. The washed cell monolayer is treated with 1.0 ml ice-cold 70% methanol:water, scraped and harvested into a centrifuge tube and then sonicated for 1 min at 4\u00b0 C. The resulting cell lysate is stored overnight at \u221280\u00b0 C. and subsequently used to extract the metabolites of Compound 9. Isolation of Compound 9 and the intracellular metabolites of Compound 9 from plated primary human hepatocytes uses similar experimental conditions, except that InVitroGro Medium is used as the cell culture medium.","Sample Analysis for intracellular nucleoside metabolites: The cell lysate samples are thawed on ice, and subjected to two freeze\/thaw cycles in a dry ice\/acetone bath. Cells extracts are vortexed and centrifuged at 16000 g for 5 min at 4\u00b0 C. and 40 \u03bcL of supernatant is injected for analysis using a API4000 triple quadrupole system. The Shimadzu LC autosampler is set at 4\u00b0 C. to minimize evaporation. Compound 9 mono-, di- and triphosphate (Compound 25) are separated using a pH gradient on a Biobasic AX, 3.0\u00d750 mm column maintained at 40\u00b0 C. The mobile phase consists of solvent A (10 mM ammonium acetate in 30:70 ACN\/H20 containing 0.008% glacial Acetic Acid) and solvent B (1 mM ammonium acetate in 30:70 ACN\/H20 containing 0.225% ammonia hydroxide). The elution is performed using a linear gradient of buffer B from 10 to 100% in 2.5 minutes, and then held under isocratic condition for 3.0 minutes at a composition of 100% B at a constant flow rate of 0.5 ml\/minute. The mass spectrometer is operated in positive ion electrospray mode utilizing a multiple reaction monitoring scan functionality at m\/z m\/z 361.1->227.1, 441.1->227.1 and 521.1->227.1 for Compound 9 mono-, di- and triphosphate, respectively. The respective metabolites are identified and quantified by comparing their chromatographic profiles and peak area response with those of authentic standards.","The pharmacokinetic properties of Compound 9 were determined in male Sprague-Dawley rats, beagle dogs and cynomolgus monkeys (n=3 in each species) with an oral dose of 5 mg\/kg and iv dose of 2 mg\/kg. PK parameters were analyzed using the WinNonlin noncompartmental model.","As shown in the Table No. 5 below, following 24 hours incubation of Huh-7-HCV subgenomic replicon cells with 10 \u03bcM initial concentration of Compound 9, the intracellular concentration of Compound 25 reached 5.7 pmol\/million cells. Unexpectedly, primary human hepatocytes generate much higher (\u02dc60-fold) intracellular levels of the triphosphate of Compound 9 under the same experimental conditions.","Compounds whose plasma half-life is >2 hours, and whose intracellular therapeutically active anabolite has a half-life of >10 hours are expected to have a greater potential to be administered once daily therapeutically. The decay half-life (t1\/2) of Compound 25 displays a biphasic profile in both replicon cells and primary human hepatocytes: a rapid decay t1\/2 (0.59 vs 3.4 hrs), followed by a prolonged slow depletion with a t1\/2\u226738 hrs in both replicon cells and primary human hepatocytes.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0385","num":"0399"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00006","num":"00006"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE NO. 5"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Intracellular accumulation of Compound 25 and its decay half-lives"},{"entry":"in replicon cells vs in human primary hepatocytes"},{"entry":"(24 hours following incubation with"},{"entry":"Compound 9 at the initial concentration of 10 \u03bcM)"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"126pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},{},"Human"]},{"entry":["Compound 25","Huh-7 cells","Hepatocytes"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"126pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"char","char":"."}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Intracellular Triphosphate Concentration","5.7","339"]},{"entry":"(pmol\/million cells, 24 hr incubation)"},{"entry":["Triphosphate decay half-life, Initial phase","0.59","3.4"]},{"entry":"(\u03b1, h)"},{"entry":["Triphosphate decay half-life,","45","38"]},{"entry":"Elimination phase (\u03b2, h)"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"As shown below in Table No. 6, cross-species PK of Compound 9 showed an elimination t1\/2 ranging 4-7.6 hours, with a oral bioavailability of 33-96%.
