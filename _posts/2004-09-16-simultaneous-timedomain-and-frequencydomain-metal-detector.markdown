title: Simultaneous time-domain and frequency-domain metal detector
abstract: A metal detector capable of operating in both a time-domain mode and a frequency-domain mode includes a transmitter component and a receiver component. The transmitter component includes a transmitter coil that can receive both an AC and DC current source for frequency-and time-domain operation respectively. The AC signal is impressed on the DC signal such that while the transmitter coil is charging, frequency-domain sensing is occurring and when the transmitter coil is switched off, time-domain sensing is occurring. The receiver component uses a primary field bucking method to ensure that both time-and frequency-domain modes can operate with the receiver coil.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENTAL INTEREST","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. provisional application No. 60\/505,061, filed on Sep. 23, 2003, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","This invention was made with U.S. Government support under Army contract no. DAAB-15-00-C-1008. The U.S. Government has certain rights in this invention.","There are an estimated 100 million mines and countless millions of acres of land contaminated with unexploded ordnance (UXO) worldwide. Thus, there is a need for sensor systems and methods that can detect and identify large and small metal objects buried in soil. Such objects often are mines and UXOs.","A commonly used sensor for mine and UXO detection is the electromagnetic induction (EMI) metal detector. Conventional EMI metal detectors use either frequency-domain (FD) or time-domain (TD or pulse) eddy current methods and can detect small metal targets (such as plastic-cased low-metal content mines) at shallow depths and large metal targets (such as metal-cased high-metal content mines and UXOs) at both shallow and deep depths under a wide range of environmental and soil conditions. However, metal non-mine (i.e., clutter) objects commonly found in the environment pose a major problem in identifying mines and UXO. That is because these clutter objects create false alarms when detected by a metal detector. For time-efficient and cost-effective land clearing, the detected metal targets must be classified as to their threat potential: mine, UXO or clutter. Preferably, these metal targets need to be classified in real-time or near real-time.","There are two major issues with EMI metal detectors. The first issue is the detection of metal and the second issue is metal discrimination. In the case of detection, both time-domain (TD) and frequency-domain (FD) metal detectors are capable of detecting metal objects in the ground. However, when water, and in particular salt water, environments are encountered, TD metal detectors are preferred over FD metal detectors due to the large EMI response of the water that can mask the typically small metal signature. Therefore, FD metal detectors are not used in underwater or wet environments.","Both TD and FD metal detectors are used for metal discrimination. However, each metal detector type has operating limits when metal discrimination measurements are needed. Typically, TD metal detectors can operate over a high bandwidth compared to FD metal detectors, thus, high bandwidth targets are best resolved with TD metal detectors. In the mid bandwidth range, FD metal detectors can operate with higher power efficiency than TD metal detectors. Metal targets with a mid bandwidth response are best measured with FD metal detectors. In the low bandwidth range, TD metal detectors can operate more efficiently compared to FD metal detectors.","Since there are advantages to both types of EMI metal detectors, it would be advantageous to be able to combine the time-domain and frequency-domain methods into one metal detector in an efficient manner to take advantage of the best features of both technologies.","A metal detector capable of operating in both a time-domain mode and a frequency-domain mode includes a transmitter component and a receiver component. The transmitter component includes a transmitter coil that can generate both an AC and pulsed DC current or voltage source for frequency-and time-domain operation respectively. The AC signal is impressed on the pulsed DC signal such that while the transmitter coil is charging, frequency-domain sensing is occurring and when the transmitter coil is switched off (pulsed), time-domain sensing is occurring. The receiver component is in a balanced configuration with respect to the transmitter to ensure that both time-and frequency-domain modes can operate with the magnetic field receiver.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","12","10","10","10","12","14"]},"A data acquisition and control unit  controls the operation of the metal detector including switching the transmitter coil (pulse transmitter)  on\/off and processing data detected by the receiver coil .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["18","12","12","14"]},"A data acquisition and control unit  controls the operation of the metal detector including the transmitter coil (frequency generator)  and processing data detected by the receiver coil .","The present invention combines the operation of a time-domain metal detector and a frequency-domain metal detector into a single device  operating in each mode nearly simultaneously.  is a block diagram of the basic device  according to an embodiment. Simultaneous time-domain and frequency domain metal detector  includes a metal detector receiver  and a metal detector transmitter .","Transmitter  includes a function generator  that generates a waveform having both a direct current component for time-domain operation and an oscillatory wave current component for frequency-domain operation. The waveform components are summed via a summing amplifier  into a single composite transmitter current signal . A transistor switch  within the transmitter  is closed to allow composite current signal  to flow through a transmitter coil  for a length of time to charge the transmitter coil during this time period. The switch  is then turned off abruptly to stop the flow of current signal  through the transmitter coil . An example waveform for composite current signal  as applied to transmitter coil  is depicted in , described below.","After the current  to the transmitter coil  is turned off, induced eddy currents in a nearby metal object  are sensed by a receiver coil  of receiver . That is, for a period of time after the transmitter current signal  is turned off, receiver  operates in the time-domain mode to sense the eddy currents from metal objects. In other words, the period when the transmitter coil  is charging is not used in the time-domain mode to sense metal objects. Instead, during this charging period the oscillatory wave current component impressed on the transmitter coil current signal induces fields used by receiver  for frequency-domain mode metal detection. That is, during the charging period, receiver  operates in the frequency-domain mode to detect metal targets. Thus, the metal detector  is either sensing metal objects in a time-domain mode after transmitter coil charging or a frequency-domain mode while transmitter coil charging, all based on a time-domain mode duty cycle.","The receiver coil  has been configured in a balanced or gradiometer configuration in  for illustrative purposes. A balanced configuration is necessary for both time-domain and frequency-domain modes of operation because the primary frequency-domain signal is as much as 100,000 times the frequency-domain signal from the metal object . The primary frequency-domain signal must be removed or \u2018bucked\u2019 out of the receiver coil  or its associated electronics so as to detect the small metal target signal. Other methods, however, could achieve the purpose of a balanced receiver coil configuration to remove the effect of the primary frequency-domain magnetic field generated by the transmitter and could be implemented without departing from the scope of the present invention.","In the time-domain sensing mode in receiver , signals sensed by the receiver coil  are passed through first a wideband differential preamplifier  and then a multi-stage wideband amplifier  to increase the signal strength corresponding to the sensed metal object. The amplified signal is then sent to a high speed digital-to-analog converter  that is under the control of a microcomputer . An operator interface  is coupled with an output indicator  to provide an audible and\/or visual indication of sensed metal to the user.","In the frequency-domain mode of receiver , the large primary excitation magnetic field used to excite the metal target must be bucked-out from the receiver coil sensed signal since the metal target magnetic field is many orders of magnitude less than the primary field. The balanced coil configuration accomplishes this task. Synchronous detection  is used to detect the signal from receiver coil and the metal object. The synchronous detection  is also coupled with the output indicator  and microcomputer . Digital synchronous detection is also known in the art and can be implemented directly in a microcomputer  after the signal is digitized by a high speed digital-to-analog converter .","As depicted in , function generator  includes a Sine Wave Generator to generate a direct current (DC) signal for time-domain operation, and a DC Voltage or Current Source to generate an oscillatory wave current (AC) signal for frequency-domain operation. Summing amplifier  combines signals and into composite current signal . Other methods of generating composite signal  could be used, including, but not limited to, a digital to analog converter controlled by a computing device amplified by a suitable electronic circuit such as transistors or IC amplifier or switching amplifier.","A sensing circuit  comprised of a waveform monitor  and a switch control logic  is added to sense when the peak of the AC signal is reached so that a transistor switch  can be activated at the peak current in the transmitter coil. The transistor switch  is used to switch the current off in the transmitter coil  so that a time-domain signal can be observed from the metal target. Typically, the coil charging period is long enough so that many cycles of the AC signal can be implemented for good signal detection by the receiver coil .","To further illustrate the invention, shows a conventional time-domain metal detector waveform and timing. Typically, during the charge period no metal detection is performed. When the transmitter coil is abruptly shut off, time-domain metal detection can occur following a brief decay period. This process is repeated over and over.","As shown in , the present invention uses the coil charging time period (time-domain mode \u201cdown time\u201d) to operate in the frequency domain mode. An AC signal is impressed on the charging transmitter coil current thus allowing the metal detector  to sense metal in a frequency-domain mode while the time-domain mode is charging. The metal detector  thus alternates between time-and frequency-domain modes of operation.","The single frequency sine wave shown in the can be other AC signals such as multiple frequencies, different frequencies on successive pulses, triangle waveform or a chirp signal (changing frequency with time).","While operating in frequency-domain mode the metal detector provides a low power, high sensitivity search mode that achieves good classification for targets having a moderate frequency response as well as good detection for targets buried deeply. While operating in time-domain mode the metal detector provides good ground response in difficult soil conditions. Time-domain mode also provides good classification for targets having high and\/or low frequency responses and can detect shallow voids and void\/metal effects. The end result is a single device that combines the best characteristics of time-domain and frequency-domain search methods.","It is to be understood that the foregoing is illustrative of the present invention and is not to be construed as limited to the specific embodiments disclosed, and that modifications to the disclosed embodiments, as well as other embodiments, are intended to be included within the scope of the appended claims. The invention is defined by the following claims, with equivalents of the claims to be included therein."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 5","i":"a "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 5","i":"b "}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
