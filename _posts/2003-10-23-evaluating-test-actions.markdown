Field of the Invention","The field of the invention is data processing, or, more specifically, methods, systems, and products for administering devices.","2. Description of Related Art","Conventional networks contain various devices. A user often uses the various devices, or adjusts the particular settings of the devices in dependence upon the user's current condition. That is, a user's current condition often motivates the user to change the settings of devices so that the devices operate in a manner that more positively benefits the user's current condition. For example, a user with a headache may be disturbed by a powerful light. The user may dim the light, or turn the light off, so that the light no longer disturbs the user. Conventional networked devices, however, require user intervention to individually administer the specific device in response to user condition. It would be advantageous if there were a method of administering devices in dependence upon user condition that did not require user intervention.","Exemplary embodiments of the present invention include methods for evaluating a test action for a user. Such methods include creating, within a network, a user metric vector in dependence upon a plurality of disparate user metrics, selecting a test action in dependence upon the user metric vector, executing the test action within the network, and determining a user reaction. Many embodiments also include adding the test action to a user's action list in dependence upon the user reaction. Other embodiments often include deleting the test action from an test action list in dependence upon the user reaction.","In many embodiments, selecting a test action in dependence upon the user metric vector includes retrieving an action ID from a test action list. In some embodiments, selecting a test action in dependence upon the user metric vector includes selecting an action ID in dependence upon devices in the domain.","In many embodiments, determining a user reaction includes receiving a user instruction. In some embodiments, determining a user reaction includes inferring a user reaction.","The foregoing and other objects, features and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following more particular descriptions of exemplary embodiments of the invention as illustrated in the accompanying drawings wherein like reference numbers generally represent like parts of exemplary embodiments of the invention.","The present invention is described to a large extent in this specification in terms of methods for administering devices. Persons skilled in the art, however, will recognize that any computer system that includes suitable programming means for operating in accordance with the disclosed methods also falls well within the scope of the present invention. Suitable programming means include any means for directing a computer system to execute the steps of the method of the invention, including for example, systems comprised of processing units and arithmetic-logic circuits coupled to computer memory, which systems have the capability of storing in computer memory, which computer memory includes electronic circuits configured to store data and program instructions, programmed steps of the method of the invention for execution by a processing unit.","The invention also may be embodied in a computer program product, such as a diskette or other recording medium, for use with any suitable data processing system. Embodiments of a computer program product may be implemented by use of any recording medium for machine-readable information, including magnetic media, optical media, or other suitable media. Persons skilled in the art will immediately recognize that any computer system having suitable programming means will be capable of executing the steps of the method of the invention as embodied in a program product. Persons skilled in the art will recognize immediately that, although most of the exemplary embodiments described in this specification are oriented to software installed and executing on computer hardware, nevertheless, alternative embodiments implemented as firmware or as hardware are well within the scope of the present invention.","\u201c802.11\u201d refers to a family of specifications developed by the IEEE for wireless LAN technology. 802.11 specifies an over-the-air interface between a wireless client and a base station or between two wireless clients.","\u201cAPI\u201d is an abbreviation for \u201capplication programming interface.\u201d An API is a set of routines, protocols, and tools for building software applications.","\u201cBluetooth\u201d refers to an industrial specification for a short-range radio technology for RF couplings among client devices and between client devices and resources on a LAN or other network. An administrative body called the Bluetooth Special Interest Group tests and qualifies devices as Bluetooth compliant. The Bluetooth specification consists of a \u2018Foundation Core,\u2019 which provides design specifications, and a \u2018Foundation Profile,\u2019 which provides interoperability guidelines.","\u201cCoupled for data communications\u201d means any form of data communications, wireless, 802.11b, Bluetooth, infrared, radio, internet protocols, HTTP protocols, email protocols, networked, direct connections, dedicated phone lines, dial-ups, serial connections with RS-232 (E1A232) or Universal Serial Buses, hard-wired parallel port connections, network connections according to the Power Line Protocol, and other forms of connection for data communications as will occur to those of skill in the art. Couplings for data communications include networked couplings for data communications. Examples of networks useful with various embodiments of the invention include cable networks, intranets, extranets, internets, local area networks, wide area networks, and other network arrangements as will occur to those of skill in the art. The use of any networked coupling among television channels, cable channels, video providers, telecommunications sources, and the like, is well within the scope of the present invention.","\u201cDriver\u201d means a program that controls a device. A device (printer, disk drive, keyboard) typically has a driver. A driver acts as translator between the device and software programs that use the device. Each device has a set of specialized commands that its driver knows. Software programs generally access devices by using generic commands. The driver, therefore, accepts generic commands from a program and then translates them into specialized commands for the device.","\u201cDTMF\u201d is an abbreviation for Dual Tone Multi-Frequency. DTMF systems transmit signals across existing power lines, telephone lines, or wirelessly by assigning a tone of a particular frequency to each key of a touch-tone key pad at the signal's origin and converting the tone to a value at the signal's destination. Many such DTMF systems include a DTMF encoder at the origin that creates the predetermined tone when a particular key of the DTMF keypad is invoked and a DTMF decoder that converts the tone to a value at the destination.","The signal generated by a DTMF encoder is a summation of the amplitudes of two sine waves of different frequencies. In typical DTMF systems, each row of keys on a key pad is assigned a low tone. The first row of a key pad (keys 1, 2, and 3) is typically assigned a low tone of 697 Hz. The second row of a key pad (keys 4, 5, and 6) is typically assigned a low tone of 770 Hz. The third row of a key pad (keys 7, 8, and 9) is typically assigned a low tone of 852 Hz. The fourth row of a key pad (keys *, 0, and #) is typically assigned a low tone of 491 Hz.","Each column of keys on the keypad is assigned a high tone. The first column of a key pad (keys 1, 4, 7, and *) is typically assigned a high tone of 1209 Hz. The second column of a key pad (keys 2, 5, 8, and 0) is typically assigned a high tone of 1336 Hz. The third column of a key pad (keys 3, 6, 9, and #) is typically assigned a high tone of 1477 Hz.","Pressing a key of a DTMF system's key pad results in the summation of the particular key's low tone (assigned by the row in which the key resides) with the particular key's high tone (assigned by the column in which the key resides). For example, pressing \u20181\u2019 on a typical DTMF keypad results in a tone created by adding 1209 Hz and 697 Hz. The particular frequencies of the low tones and high tones have been chosen to reduce harmonics when the high tones and the low tones are added.","Many DTMF systems are currently available. For example, off-the-shelf DTMF systems are available from Silicon Systems, Inc., Arkady Horak-Systems, and Mitel Corp. All such DTMF systems can be advantageously used with various embodiments of the methods for administering devices in accordance with the present invention.","\u201cESN\u201d is an abbreviation for \u201cElectronic Serial Number.\u201d An ESN is a serial number programmed into a device, such as, for example, a coffeepot, to uniquely identify the device.","\u201cField\u201d\u2014In this specification, the terms \u201cfield\u201d and \u201cdata element,\u201d unless the context indicates otherwise, generally are used as synonyms, referring to individual elements of digital data. Aggregates of data elements are referred to as \u201crecords\u201d or \u201cdata structures.\u201d Aggregates of records are referred to as \u201ctables\u201d or \u201cfiles.\u201d Aggregates of files or tables are referred to as \u201cdatabases.\u201d Complex data structures that include member methods, functions, or software routines as well as data elements are referred to as \u201cclasses.\u201d Instances of classes are referred to as \u201cobjects\u201d or \u201cclass objects.\u201d","\u201cHAVi\u201d stands for \u2018Home Audio Video interoperability,\u2019 the name of a vendor-neutral audio-video standard particularly for home entertainment environments. HAVi allows different home entertainment and communication devices (such as VCRs, televisions, stereos, security systems, and video monitors) to be networked together and controlled from one primary device, such as a services gateway, PC, or television. Using IEEE 1394, the \u2018Firewire\u2019 specification, as the interconnection medium, HAVi allows products from different vendors to comply with one another based on defined connection and communication protocols and APIs. Services provided by HAVi's distributed application system include an addressing scheme and message transfer, lookup for discovering resources, posting and receiving local or remote events, and streaming and controlling isochronous data streams.","\u201cHomePlug\u201d stands for The HomePlug Powerline Alliance. HomePlug is a not-for-profit corporation formed to provide a forum for the creation of open specifications for high speed home powerline networking products and services. The HomePlug specification is designed for delivery of Internet communications and multimedia to homes through the home power outlet using powerline networking standards.","The HomePlug protocol allows HomePlug-enabled devices to communicate across powerlines using Radio Frequency signals (RF). The HomPlug protocol uses Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) to split the RF signal into multiple smaller sub-signals that are then transmitted from one HomPlug enabled-device to another HomePlug-enabled device at different frequencies across the powerline.","\u201cHTTP\u201d stands for \u2018HyperText Transport Protocol,\u2019 the standard data communications protocol of the World Wide Web.","\u201cID\u201d abbreviates \u201cidentification\u201d as used by convention in this specification with nouns represented in data elements, so that \u2018user ID\u2019 refers to a user identification and \u2018userID\u2019 is the name of a data element in which is stored a user identification. For a further example of the use of \u2018ID\u2019: \u2018metric ID\u2019 refers to a metric identification and \u2018metricID\u2019 is the name of a data element in which is stored a metric identification.","\u201cIEEE 1394\u201d is an external bus standard that supports data transfer rates of up to 400 Mbps (400 million bits per second). Apple, which originally developed IEEE 1394, uses the trademarked name \u201cFireWire.\u201d Other companies use other names, such as i.link and Lynx, to describe their 1394 products.","A single 1394 port can be used to connect up to 63 external devices. In addition to high speed, 1394 also supports isochronous data transfer\u2014delivering data at a guaranteed rate. This makes it ideal for devices that need to transfer high levels of data in real-time, such as video.","\u201cThe Internet\u201d is a global network connecting millions of computers utilizing the \u2018internet protocol\u2019 or \u2018IP\u2019 as the network layer of their networking protocol stacks. The Internet is decentralized by design. Each computer on the Internet is independent. Operators for each computer on the Internet can choose which Internet services to use and which local services to make available to the global Internet community. There are a variety of ways to access the Internet. Many online services, such as America Online, offer access to some Internet services. It is also possible to gain access through a commercial Internet Service Provider (ISP). An \u201cinternet\u201d (uncapitalized) is any network using IP as the network layer in its network protocol stack.","\u201cJAR\u201d is an abbreviation for \u2018Java archive.\u2019 JAR is a file format used to bundle components used by a Java application. JAR files simplify downloading applets, because many components (.class files, images, sounds, etc.) can be packaged into a single file. JAR also supports data compression, which further decreases download times. By convention, JAR files end with a \u2018.jar\u2019 extension.","\u201cJES\u201d stands for Java Embedded Server. JES is a commercial implementation of OSGi that provides a framework for development, deployment, and installation of applications and services to embedded devices.","\u201cLAN\u201d is an abbreviation for \u201clocal area network.\u201d A LAN is a computer network that spans a relatively small area. Many LANs are confined to a single building or group of buildings. However, one LAN can be connected to other LANs over any distance via telephone lines and radio waves. A system of LANs connected in this way is called a wide-area network (WAN). The Internet is an example of a WAN.","\u201cLonWorks\u201d is a networking platform available from Echelon\u00ae. Lon Works is currently used in various network applications such as appliance control and lighting control. The LonWorks networking platform uses a protocol called \u201cLonTalk\u201d that is embedded within a \u201cNeuron Chip\u201d installed within Lon Works-enabled devices.","The Neuron Chip is a system-on-a-chip with multiple processors, read-write and read-only memory (RAM and ROM), and communication and I\/O subsystems. The read-only memory contains an operating system, the LonTalk protocol, and an I\/O function library. The chip has non-volatile memory for configuration data and for application programs, which can be downloaded over a LonWorks network to the device. The Neuron Chip provides the first  layers of the standard OSI network model. That is, the Neuron Chip provides the physical layer, the data link layer, the network layer, the transport layer, the session layer, and the presentation layer.","The Neuron Chip does not provide the application layer programming. Applications for LonWorks networks are written in a programming language called \u201cNeuron C.\u201d Applications written in Neuron C are typically event-driven, and therefore, result in reduced traffic on the network.","\u201cOSGI\u201d refers to the Open Services Gateway Initiative, an industry organization developing specifications for services gateways, including specifications for delivery of service bundles, software middleware providing compliant data communications and services through services gateways. The Open Services Gateway specification is a java based application layer framework that gives service providers, network operator device makers, and appliance manufacturer's vendor neutral application and device layer APIs and functions.","The \u201cOSI Model\u201d or Open System Interconnection, model defines a networking framework for implementing protocols in seven layers. Control is passed from one layer to the next, starting at the application layer in one network station, proceeding to the bottom layer, over the channel to the next network station and back up the hierarchy.","\u201cSMF\u201d stands for \u201cService Management Framework\u2122\u201d available from IBM\u00ae.

USB also supports Plug-and-Play installation and hot plugging.","\u201cWAP\u201d refers to the Wireless Application Protocol, a protocol for use with handheld wireless devices. Examples of wireless devices useful with WAP include mobile phones, pagers, two-way radios, and hand-held computers. WAP supports many wireless networks, and WAP is supported by many operating systems. Operating systems specifically engineered for handheld devices include PalmOS, EPOC, Windows CE, FLEXOS, OS\/9, and JavaOS. WAP devices that use displays and access the Internet run \u201cmicrobrowsers.\u201d The microbrowsers use small file sizes that can accommodate the low memory constraints of handheld devices and the low-bandwidth constraints of wireless networks.","The \u201cX-10\u201d means the X-10 protocol. Typical X-10 enabled devices communicate across AC powerline wiring, such as existing AC wiring in a home, using an X-10 transmitter and an X-10 receiver. The X-10 transmitter and the X-10 receiver use Radio Frequency (RF) signals to exchange digital information. The X-10 transmitter and the X-10 receiver communicate with short RF bursts which represent digital information. A Binary 1 is represented by a 1 millisecond burst of 120 KHz. and a Binary 0 by the absence of 120 KHz burst followed by the presence of a burst.","In the X-10 protocol, data is sent in data strings called frames. The frame begins with a 4 bit start code designated as \u201c1110.\u201d Following the start code, the frame identifies a particular domain, such as house, with a 4 bit \u201chouse code,\u201d and identifies a device within that domain with a 4 bit \u201cdevices code.\u201d The frame also includes a command string of 8 bits identifying a particular preset command such as \u201con,\u201d \u201coff,\u201d \u201cdim,\u201d \u201cbright,\u201d \u201cstatus on,\u201d \u201cstatus off,\u201d and \u201cstatus request.\u201d",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":"118"},"The domain () of  includes a services gateway (). A services gateway () is, in some exemplary architectures, an OSGi compatible services gateway (). While exemplary embodiments of methods for administering devices are described in this specification using OSGi, many other applications and frameworks, will work to implement the methods of administering devices according to the present invention, and are therefore also well within the scope of the present invention. Commercial implementations of OSGi, such as JES and SMF, are also useful in implementing methods for administering devices.","In the exemplary architecture of , the services gateway () includes a services framework (). The services framework () of  is a hosting platform for running \u2018services.\u2019 Services are the main building blocks for creating applications in the OSGi. An OSGi services framework () is written in Java and therefore, typically runs on a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) ().","The exemplary architecture of  includes a DML (). \u201cDML\u201d () is an abbreviation for Domain Mediation Layer. In many embodiments of the architecture of , the DML () is application software useful in implementing methods of administering devices in accordance with the present invention. In some embodiments of the present invention, the DML is OSGi compliant application software, and is therefore implemented as a service or a group of services packaged as a bundle installed on the services framework (). In this specification, DMLs are often discussed in the context of OSGi. However, the discussion of OSGI is for explanation and not for limitation. In fact, DMLs according to various embodiments of the present invention can be implemented in any programming language, C, C++, COBOL, FORTRAN, BASIC, and so on, as will occur to those of skill in the art, and DMLs developed in languages other than Java are installed directly upon an operating system or operating environment rather than a JVM.","In the exemplary architecture of , the services gateway () is coupled for data communications with a metric sensor (). A metric sensor () is a device that reads an indication of a user's condition, and creates a user metric in response to the indication of the user's condition. An \u201cindication of a user's condition\u201d is a quantifiable aspect of a user's condition and a quantity measuring the aspect. For example, a quantifiable aspect of a user's condition is a body temperature of 99.2 degrees Fahrenheit. Examples of quantifiable aspects of a user's condition include body temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, location, galvanic skin response, and others as will occur to those of skill in the art.","A \u201cuser metric\u201d is a data structure representing an indication of user condition. In many examples of methods for administering devices in accordance with the present invention, a user metric is implemented as a data structure, class, or object that includes a userID field, a metricID field, and a metric value field. A typical userID field identifies the user whose indication of condition is represented by the metric. A typical metricID field identifies the quantifiable aspect of user condition the metric represents, such as, for example, blood pressure, heart rate, location, or galvanic skin response. A typical metric value field stores a quantity measuring the aspect of a user's condition.","Wearable and wireless heart rate monitors, galvanic skin response monitors, eye response monitors, and breathing monitors useful as or easily adaptable for use as metric sensors are currently available from Quibit Systems, Inc. The \u2018Polar\u2019 series of heart rate monitors from Body Trends, Inc., and the magnetoelastic gastric pH sensors from Sentec Corporation are other examples of readily available biomedical sensors useful as or easily adaptable for use as metric sensors.","In order for a conventional sensor, such as a biomedical sensor, to be useful as a metric sensor that transmits multiple metric types in a domain containing multiple users, the sensor advantageously transmits not only a value of the each aspect it measures, but also transmits a user ID and a metricID. The user ID is useful because typical embodiments of the present invention include a DML capable of administering devices on behalf of many users simultaneously. The metricID is useful because a single user may employ more than one metric sensor at the same time or employ a metric sensor capable of monitoring and transmitting data regarding more than one aspect of user condition. All wireless sensors at least transmit a metric value according to some wireless data communications protocol. To the extent that any particular sensor \u2018off-the-shelf\u2019 does not also transmit user ID or metricID, such a sensor is easily adapted, merely by small modifications of its controlling software, also to include in its transmissions user IDs and metricID.","Although it is expected that most DMLs will support metric IDs and user IDs, it is possible, under some circumstances within the scope of the present invention, to use an off-the-shelf sensor as a metric sensor even if the sensor does not provide metric ID and user ID in its output telemetry. Consider an example in which only a single person inhabits a domain having device controlled or administered by a DML tracking only a single metric, such as, for example, heart rate. A DML tracking only one metric for only one user could function without requiring a metric type code in telemetry received from the metric sensor because, of course, only one type of metric is received. In this example, strictly speaking, it would be possible for an off-the-shelf, Bluetooth-enabled heart rate sensor, such as a \u2018Polar\u2019 sensor from Body Trends, to function as a metric sensor. This example is presented only for explanation, because as a practical matter it is expected that most DMLs according to embodiments of the present invention will usefully and advantageously administer more than one type of metric (therefore needing a metric ID code in their telemetry) on behalf of more than one user (therefore needing a user ID in their telemetry).","In many embodiments of the present invention, the metric sensor is advantageously wirelessly coupled for data communications with the services gateway (). In many alternative embodiments, the metric sensor transmits the user metric to the DML through a services gateway using various protocols such as Bluetooth, 802.11, HTTP, WAP, or any other protocol that will occur to those of skill in the art.","In the exemplary architecture of , the domain () includes a device () coupled for data communications with the services gateway () across a LAN (). In many embodiments of the present invention, a domain () will include many devices. A home domain, for example, may include a home network having a television, numerous lights, a refrigerator, a freezer, a coffee pot, a dishwasher, a dryer, a CD player, a DVD player, a personal video recorder, or any other networkable device that will occur to those of skill in the art. For ease of explanation, the exemplary architecture of  illustrates only three devices (), but the use of any number of devices is well within the scope of the present invention.","To administer the device (), the DML must have the device class for the device containing accessor methods that get and set attributes on the device, and in some cases, a communication class that provides the protocols needed to communicate with the device. In some examples of the architecture of , a DML has pre-installed upon it, device classes and communications classes for many devices that the DML supports.","To the extent the DML does not have a preinstalled device class and communications class for a particular device, the DML can obtain the device class and communications class in a number of ways. One way the DML obtains the device class and communications class for the device is by reading the device class and the communications class from the device. This requires the device have enough installed memory to store the device class and communications class. The DML can also obtain the device class and communications class from devices that do not contain the device class or communications class installed upon them. One way the DML obtains the device class and communications class is by reading a device ID from the device, searching the Internet for the device class and communications class, and downloading them. Another way the DML obtains the device class and communications class is by reading a network location from the device downloading, from the network location, the device class and communications class. Three ways have been described for obtaining the device classes and communications classes needed to administer devices in accordance with the present invention. Other methods will also occur to those of skill in the art.","The exemplary architecture of  includes a non-domain entity () that is coupled for data communications with the services gateway () across a WAN (). A \u201cnon-domain entity\u201d is any computing device or network location coupled for data communications to the domain but not within the domain. The phrase \u201cnon-domain entity\u201d is broad and its inclusion in the architecture of  acknowledges that in many embodiments of architecture useful in implementing methods of administering devices in accordance with the present invention, a given domain is coupled for data communications with outside non-domain entities.","An example of a non-domain entity is a web server (outside the domain) of a manufacturer of the device () installed within the domain.

In fact, in this specification, unless context indicates otherwise, the terms \u2018action,\u2019 \u2018action object,\u2019 and \u2018reference to an action object\u2019 are treated more or less as synonyms. In many examples of the method of , an action object calls member methods in a device class to affect current attributes of the physical device. In many examples of the method of , action classes or action objects are deployed in OSGi bundles to a DML on a services gateway.","The method of  includes executing the action (). Executing an action therefore is often carried out in such embodiments by use of a switch( ) statement in the DML. Such a switch( ) statement can be operated in dependence upon the action ID and implemented, for example, as illustrated by the following segment of pseudocode:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0174","num":"0185"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00010","num":"00010"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"189pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"switch (actionID) {"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003Case 1: actionNumber1.take_action( ); break;"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003Case 2: actionNumber2.take_action( ); break;"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003Case 3: actionNumber3.take_action( ); break;"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003Case 4: actionNumber4.take_action( ); break;"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003Case 5: actionNumber5.take_action( ); break;"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\/\/ and so on"]},{"entry":[{},"} \/\/ end switch( )"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}}},"The exemplary switch statement selects a particular device controlling object for execution depending on the action ID. The device controlling objects administered by the switch( ) in this example are concrete action classes named actionNumber, actionNumber, and so on, each having an executable member method named \u2018take_action( ),\u2019 which carries out the actual work implemented by each action class.","In many examples of the method of , executing an action is carried out use of a hash table in a DML. Such a hash table stores references to action object keyed by action ID, as shown in the following pseudocode example. This example begins by a dynamic action list service's creating a hashtable of actions, references to objects of concrete action classes associated with a particular metric ID, using action IDs as keys. In many embodiments it is a dynamic action list service that creates such a hashtable, fills it with references to action objects pertinent to a particular metric ID of the user metric vector outside its corresponding metric range of the user metric space, and returns a reference to the hashtable to a calling vector object.\n\n","Executing a particular action then can be carried out according to the following pseudocode:\n\n","Many examples of the method of  are also implemented through the use of lists. Lists often function in fashion similar to hashtables. Building such a list can be carried out according to the following pseudocode:\n\n","Executing a particular action then can be carried out according to the following pseudocode:\n\n","The three examples just above use switch statements, hash tables, and list objects to explain executing actions according to embodiments of the present invention. The use of switch statements, hash tables, and list objects in these examples are for explanation, not for limitation. In fact, there are many ways of executing actions according to embodiments of the present invention, as will occur to those of skill in the art, and all such ways are well within the scope of the present invention.","In some examples of the method of , executing an action includes identifying a device class for the device. Typical device classes include member methods for administering the device. Typical member methods for administering the device include member methods for getting and setting values of device attributes in physical devices. In the case of a lamp supporting multiple settings for light intensity, for example, a member method get( ) in a device class can gets from the lamp a value for light intensity, and a member method set( ) in a device class sets the light intensity for the lamp.","In many examples of the method of , executing an action includes identifying a communications class for the device. To communicate the member methods of the device class to the physical device, a communications class implements a protocol for communicating with a physical device. Typical communications classes include member methods that construct, transmit, and receive data communications messages in accordance with the protocol implemented by a communication class. The member methods in a communication class transmit and receive data communications messages to and from a physical device. A communications class advantageously separates the protocols used to communicate with the physical device from the actions effecting the device, so that a device class interface comprising get( ) and set( ) methods, for example, can usefully communicate with a physical device by use of any data communications protocol with no need to reprogram the device class and no need to provide one device class for each combination of physical device and protocol.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0183","num":"0206"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 9","FIG. 9","FIG. 9","FIG. 3"],"b":["604","606","605","610","604","606","602","206","602","206","406","406","206"]},"In the method of , creating () a user metric vector () includes associating () the plurality of disparate user metrics () with the user metric vector (). \u2018Associated,\u2019 generally in this disclosure and subject to context, means associated by reference.

In many examples of the method of , a plurality of metric action lists are associated with each metric of the user vector. The action IDs included in a metric action list associated with a particular metric identify actions designed to administer devices in accordance with the particular aspect of user condition represented by that metric. That is, a metric action list is tailored to affecting the user condition represented by the metric. For example, a metric list associated with a body temperature metric may include actions that administer devices such as an air conditioner, a fan, a heater, automated window shades an the like.","In many examples of the method of , creating a user metric vector includes associating a plurality of metric action lists with a single user metric. Some such examples of the method of  include associating one metric action list with the user metric including action IDs for execution when the value of the user metric is above its corresponding metric range and another metric action list including action IDs for execution when the value of the user metric is below its corresponding metric range.

In some embodiments using a strict criteria for determining if a user metric vector is outside a user metric space, if only one metric value is outside its corresponding metric range, then the user metric vector is determined to be outside the metric space. In other embodiments, using less strict criteria for determining if a user metric vector is outside a user metric space, a user metric vector is determined to be outside the user metric space if all of the metric values of the user metric vector are outside their corresponding metric ranges by a certain degree. In various embodiments, the number of metric values that must be outside their corresponding metric ranges, or the degree to which a metric must be outside its corresponding metric range to make a determination that the user metric vector is outside the metric space will vary, all such methods of determining whether a user metric vector is outside a metric space are well within the scope of the present invention.","The second illustrated method of determining () that the user metric vector () is outside the user metric space () illustrated in  includes calculating () a metric vector value () and calculating () a metric space value () and comparing () the metric vector value () to the metric space value (). One way of calculating a metric vector value is by using a predetermined formula to identify a single value that is a function of the metric values of the user metric vector. In one exemplary embodiment of the present invention, calculating a metric vector value includes averaging the metric values of the user metric vector. In another example embodiment, calculating a metric vector value includes prioritizing certain kinds of metrics and using a weighted average based on the priority of the metric to calculate a metric vector value.","In some exemplary embodiments, calculating () a metric space value () includes using a predetermined formula to determine a metric space value that is a function of the minimum and maximum values of each metric range of the user metric space. In one example embodiment, calculating a metric space value includes finding the center point of the minimum and maximum value of the each metric range and then averaging the center points.","The illustrated method includes comparing () the metric space value () and the metric vector value ().

The metric objects outside their metric ranges are, in many examples, identified when the metric objects are compared with their metric ranges to determine if the user metric vector is outside the metric space.","In many examples of the method of , a metric has a plurality of associated metric action lists. Each associated metric action list includes a set of action IDs for execution in dependence upon the degree and direction that the value of the metric is outside the metric range. In some examples of the method of  therefore, identifying () a metric action list () for each user metric () of the user metric vector () having a value that is outside a metric range () of the user metric space () includes identifying a metric list in dependence upon a degree to which the value of each user metric of the user metric vector is outside a metric range of the user metric space.

In many examples of the method of , identifying () at least one action ID () for inclusion in the dynamic action list () in dependence upon the action IDs () retrieved from the metric action lists () includes identifying an action ID retrieved directly from the metric action lists themselves for inclusion in the dynamic action list.

In some examples of the method of , identifying () at least one action ID () for inclusion in the dynamic action list () in dependence upon the action IDs () retrieved from the metric action lists () includes omitting conflicting actions. In many examples of the method of  a dynamic action table is used to identify action IDs that have been predetermined to conflict. For example, an action ID included in one metric action list that identifies a device controlling action to turn on a ceiling fan conflicts with an action ID identifying a device controlling action to turn off the same ceiling fan. Such conflicting action IDs are omitted from the dynamic action list.","In some examples of the method of , identifying () at least one action ID () for inclusion in the dynamic action list () in dependence upon the action IDs () retrieved from the metric action lists () includes omitting superseded actions. A superseded action is an action that when executed administers the same device in the same direction as another superseding action, but administers the device to a lesser degree than the other superseding action. That is, an action is superseded when another action administers the same device to a greater degree such that the execution of superseded action is cloaked be execution of the superseding action. For example, the execution of an action ID that results in changing the value of a current attribute of a ceiling fan from \u201c5\u201d to \u201c4\u201d is superseded by the execution of an action ID that results in changing the same ceiling fan attribute from \u201c5\u201d to \u201c2.\u201d In many examples of the method of , a dynamic action table is used to identify action IDs that have been predetermined to supersede other actions IDs. Many examples of the method of  include omitting the superseded action IDs from the dynamic action list and including the superseding action ID.","In the method of , identifying () at least one action ID () for inclusion in the dynamic action list () in dependence upon the action IDs () retrieved from the metric action lists () includes identifying an action ID for inclusion in the dynamic action list that is not included in any of the identified metric action lists (). In many examples of the method of , an action ID identified by a lookup in the dynamic action table () is not included in any of the identified metric action. In some of these examples, the dynamic action table is populated with action IDs that have been predetermined to affect the same user condition when executed as other action IDs. Such a dynamic action table is indexed to identify an action ID for execution when one or more other action IDs are retrieved from the metric action lists. In this way, dynamic action tables advantageously provide a vehicle for identifying and executing more actions to affect the user's current condition.","For further explanation of identifying action IDs that are not included in any metric action list associated with a user metric outside its corresponding range, the following example is provided. Two user metrics of a user metric vector are above their corresponding metric ranges of the user's metric space. The first metric represents body temperature and has a first action ID in its associated metric action list that when executed results in turning on a ceiling fan. The second metric represents heart rate and has a second action ID in its associated metric list that when executed turns on an air conditioner. A lookup in a dynamic action table in dependence upon the first action ID and the second action ID retrieves a third action ID that is not included in either metric action list of either metric. Executing the third action ID results in turning on the ceiling fan, turning on the air conditioner, and drawing automated window curtains. The added action of drawing automated window curtains is predetermined to affect the same user condition as turning on the air conditioner and the ceiling fan. A lookup on the dynamic action table identifies the third action ID for inclusion in the dynamic action list in dependence upon the first and second action IDs.","The previous sections of this disclosure discuss methods for administering devices in dependence upon user metrics and user metric vectors.

As discussed above, an action typically includes one or more computer programs, subroutines, or member methods that when executed, control one or more devices. The phrase \u2018test action\u2019 means an action that is not currently included in one or more of a user's metric action lists. That is, actions not currently available for execution in dependence upon the user's metrics. Test actions, like all actions in this disclosure, are typically implemented as object oriented classes and manipulated as objects or references to objects. In many examples of the method of , a test action object calls member methods in a device class to affect current attributes of the physical device.","In many examples of the method of , selecting () a test action () in dependence upon the user metric vector () includes retrieving an action ID from a test action list (). A test action list () includes test action IDs indexed by the metric IDs identifying the type of metric the test actions are designed to affect, metric values for those metric IDs, and device IDs identifying the devices the test actions administer. In some examples of the method of , the test action list is pre-installed on the DML (). In other examples, the test action list is downloaded from, for example, an enterprise server or other non-domain entity. A test action list can be implemented as a Java list container, a hash table, or any other data structure that will occur to those of skill in the art.","As discussed above, typically actions and test actions are themselves designed to affect one or more user metrics. In some examples therefore, selecting () a test action () in dependence upon the user metric vector () includes retrieving an action ID from a test action list () in dependence upon one or more metric IDs and metric values of the user metrics () associated with the user's current metric vector. For example, a test action ID identifying an action that turns on a fan may be retrieved from the test action list in dependence upon a user metric vector that includes a body temperature metric greater than 100 degrees Fahrenheit.","Also discussed above, actions and test actions are typically designed to administer one or more devices. In the example of  therefore, selecting () a test action () in dependence upon the user metric vector () also includes selecting an action ID in dependence upon one or more devices installed in the domain. In the method of , a list of device IDs identifying devices registered with the DML and subject to administration by the DML are contained within a DML device list (). A DML device list () can be implemented as a Java list container, a hash table, or any other data structure that will occur to those of skill in the art.","The method of  includes executing () the test action () within the network (). As discussed above, executing an action is carried out by use of switch statements, hash tables, list objects or any other method of executing an action that will occur to those of skill in the art. Three ways of executing an action are described above with reference to  including using switch statements, Java lists, and hash tables. The examples using switch statements, hash tables, and list objects to explain executing actions are provided for explanation, not for limitation. In fact, there are many ways of executing actions according to embodiments of the present invention, as will occur to those of skill in the art, and all such ways are well within the scope of the present invention.","The method of  includes determining () a user reaction (). A user reaction is an indication of user preference for the test action. That is, an indication that the user either positively or negatively reacted to the way executing the action administered one or more devices in the user's domain. In some examples of the method of , determining () a user reaction () includes receiving a user instruction. That is, the user consciously expresses the user's reaction to the test action. In some such examples, receiving a user instruction includes notifying the user of the test action, prompting the user for a user reaction, and receiving the user reaction. Notifying the user of the test action can be implemented by calling the user on the user's mobile phone and playing a recorded description of the action, sending the user a description of the test action as for example an HTML document in an HTTP message or any other method of notifying the user of the test action that will occur to those of skill in the art. Receiving the user response can be implemented by receiving a DTMF signal from the user created by the user depressing one or more keys of a mobile phone to identify a positive or negative reaction to the test action, receiving a user reaction as an HTML document in an HTTP message, or any other method of receiving a user reaction that will occur to those of skill in the art.","Another way of determining () a user reaction () that does not require user intervention includes inferring a user reaction. In such examples a user's negative reaction to the test action is inferred if within a predetermined period of time after the execution of the test action, a particular attribute of the device administered by that action is changed. That is, if within a predetermined period of time a device administered by the test action is changed, it is inferred that the user reacted negatively to the execution of the test action and intentionally administered the device in a different way than executing the action administered the device. If within that same period of time, the attributes of the device administered by the actions remain unchanged it is inferred that the user positively reacted to the execution of the test action.","One way of inferring a user reaction includes calling member methods such as getAttr( ) in device class of the devices administered by the test action some period of time after the execution of the test action to get the current value of the device attribute. In such examples, inferring a user reaction includes comparing the current value of the device attributes with the resultant value of the same attribute set by executing the test action. If the values are the same, it is inferred that the value of the device attribute was not intentionally changed by the user and the user reacted positively to the execution of the test action. If the values are not the same, it is inferred that the user intentionally changed the value of the device attribute and the user reacted negatively to the execution of the test action. The period of time allowed to elapse between the execution of the test action and checking the current attribute value to determine if the user intentionally administered the device is typically long enough to allow the user to experience the test action and if the user reacts negatively, intentionally change the current attribute or setting of the device.","If the user reacted positively to the execution of the test action, the method of  adding () the test action () to a user's action list (). Adding the test action is typically carried out by calling a member method in a metric action list object such as metricActionList.add(testActionID). Typically the test action is added to the metric action list associated with the particular kind of metric the action is designed to administer. By adding the test action to a user's metric action list, the test action is available to be executed for the user using, for example, the methods for administering devices in dependence upon user metrics of FIG.  and FIG. .","If the user reaction to executing the action is negative, the method of  includes deleting () the test action () from the test action list (). By deleting the test action from the test action list, actions that a user reacts to negatively are removed from consideration as new actions for the user. In some examples, deleting the test action form the test action list includes calling a member method in a test action list object such as testActionList.delete(testActionID).","It will be understood from the foregoing description that modifications and changes may be made in various embodiments of the present invention without departing from its true spirit.
