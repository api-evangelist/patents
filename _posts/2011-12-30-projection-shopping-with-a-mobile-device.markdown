{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["1. Field of the Invention","The present invention generally relates to shopping using a mobile device at a physical location.","2. Related Art","Consumers and the general population are utilizing mobile devices, such as smart phones, more than ever before and not just to make and receive calls. The number of users, devices, and device capabilities continue to increase. One of the reasons for this increased use is the ease and\/or convenience of performing tasks with a mobile device. These include accessing content, such as through the Internet or Apps, taking and sharing photos, videos, and music, playing games, listening to music, watching videos, shopping, and performing financial transactions, such as sending and receiving money.","Service providers are thus becoming more and more important for these mobile device users. Merchants, retailers, and marketplaces, such as eBay, Inc. of San Jose, Calif., enable users to shop online through their mobile devices. A payment provider, such as PayPal, Inc. of San Jose, Calif., allows users to complete an online shopping process by enabling users to send and receive payments through the mobile device. Thus, a user can find an item and make the purchase through the mobile device, and then have the purchased item delivered to the user. One difficulty with mobile device shopping, however, is a small screen and keyboard, making it hard for the user to search for items using the device, and the limitation of typically being able to run only one application at a time on the device.","For online transactions, consumers typically place items into a cart on a merchant or retailer website and make a payment directly to the merchant or through a payment provider service. For the former, payment can be made by providing credit card or bank account information. For the latter, the consumer may access an account managed by the payment provider, authorize payment, and have the payment sent to the merchant by the payment provider. The purchased items are then typically shipped to the consumer or the consumer picks up the items at a designated location, such as a store.","Although online shopping may be desirable in many situations, users may still want to make purchases at physical stores or locations. Thus, it is desirable to provide methods and systems that aid the physical shopping experience.","A user with a mobile device can make purchases through the mobile device at a physical location while viewing items on a surface. Information about the items is projected onto the surface.","In one embodiment, a merchant uploads products or services to a service provider site, such as eBay, Inc. of San Jose, Calif., to create an online store for purchases. The user is able to communicate with the service provider site through the user's mobile device. Information about items available for purchase are projected onto a viewable surface proximate to the user. The user's mobile device controls the information on the surface, such as the color, orientation, or size of the item. The user's mobile device may then be used to select and purchase a viewed item.","In another embodiment, when a user logs into the service provider site, such as through the user's mobile device, the service provider determines the location of the user and determines whether the viewable surface and the user are sufficiently close. If the distance is too large, the service provider sends a message to the user's mobile device that the user is too far from the viewable surface. If it is determined that the user is close enough to the viewable surface, the service provider allows the user to continue shopping. The user can then make the purchase through the mobile device or other means and receive the purchased items.","These and other features and advantages of the present disclosure will be more readily apparent from the detailed description of the embodiments set forth below.","Embodiments of the present disclosure and their advantages are best understood by referring to the detailed description that follows. It should be appreciated that like reference numerals are used to identify like elements illustrated in one or more of the figures, wherein showings therein are for purposes of illustrating embodiments of the present disclosure and not for purposes of limiting the same.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102"]},"The merchant may be requested to provider specific information for registration, such as, but not limited to, a merchant name, type of goods\/services offered, address, location(s) of planned sales, phone number, email address, website address (if applicable), social security or tax ID number, a user name for the account, and a password or PIN for the account. The type of information may depend on whether the user already has an account with the service provider. Even if the merchant has an account, the merchant may be requested to register for this particular service, such as by providing specific information and agreeing to certain terms and conditions. Requested information may be entered through the merchant device or other means, including voice or manual key entry. Once all the requested information is received and confirmed, the service provider may create an account for the merchant and\/or offer the service to the merchant.","After registration, the merchant may provide the service provider a list of items available for purchase at step . Items may include services, products, donations, and any other tangible or intangible offering that a user can make a payment for. Item information may include providing descriptions, item identifiers, prices, quantity available, photos\/images, and any other desired information. The merchant may communicate the information in various ways, including through a merchant portal offered by the service provider, email, text, a phone call, fax, or any suitable means. In one embodiment, the merchant may provide any information desired by the merchant and in any format. In other embodiments, the service provider may require specific information and\/or formats. For example, if an item is clothing, the service provider may have specific fields that will be required to be filled in, such as by the merchant selecting from a drop-down menu or the merchant manually entering information through the merchant device, either by voice or key entry.","At step , information about an item for purchase is projected onto a surface viewable by a consumer or user, and the consumer views the projected information. For example, if the item is a piece of clothing, e.g., a shirt, the projected information may include the image, price, size, color, and\/or description of the item. The surface is any suitable surface that an image can be projected on, including a screen or display. For example, the surface may be transparent, such as glass, or it may be opaque. In one embodiment, the surface is a window, such as a store display window or a car window. In another embodiment, the surface includes a photographic or holographic film. An exemplary film is 3M\u2122 Vikuiti\u2122 Rear Projection Film. The surface generally has a larger area than the area of a screen or display of a mobile device.","At step , a connection between the service provider and the user's mobile device is established. In one embodiment, the user installs the ScreenReach (Screach) application onto the user's mobile device, e.g., a smartphone or PDA (or the Screach application is incorporated into a custom written application that is installed on the mobile device). Screach is a unique digital media platform that allows anyone to create real time, two way interactive experiences between a smart device\u2014through the Screach Application\u2014and any content on any screen, or within the mobile device itself. Details of the Screach application may be found at www.screenreach.com.","In the present methods, the Screach application provides the connection between the user's mobile device and the Screach-enabled content of the service provider. Typically, a user approaches the viewable surface and enters the code provided on the surface into the Screach application running on the mobile device. The application confirms that the mobile device and the Screach-enabled content are connected, and the mobile device is transformed into a controller that interacts with the projected information. In one embodiment, once the connection is made, the projected information is also visible on the display of the mobile device.","Next, at step , the user controls the projected information with the mobile device to change what the user sees. Only one user should be able to control the projected information at any time. The service provider receives input from the user through the mobile device and changes the projected information based on the input. In one embodiment, the user is provided a list or other indication of available items for purchase from the merchant connected through the Screach application. The user may then select one or more items from the user's mobile device for viewing on the projected display. The mobile device user responds to or interacts with the projected information, which generates additional inputs for the user. For example, the user provides input by way of selecting from the multiple choices and options provided on the viewable surface, further guiding the service provider to generate and deliver additional interactive media on the viewable surface. The user can view and interact with the projected information on a larger display, i.e., the viewable surface, rather than the small screen of the mobile device.","In one exemplary embodiment, the user may rotate the image of an item to view different sides of the item, change the color of an item, and\/or select the size of the item. In response to this user input, the service provider presents an updated display on the viewable surface with new interactive media that includes a corresponding new set of option buttons and multiple choices, etc. Then the user continues to guide the dynamic interactive media generation by selecting a specific option button, in response to which the mobile device receives a next option of the current interactive media or a new one altogether, and so on.","When the user finds an item he or she wishes to buy, the user selects the item for purchase and purchases the selected item through the user's mobile device. The selection and payment screens are generally not projected onto the viewable surface to maintain privacy, and are viewable only on the user's mobile device. The selection may be accomplished by tapping or checking links or buttons associated with desired items on the user's mobile device. For example, the user may see a \u201cAdd to Cart,\u201d \u201cPurchase,\u201d or similar button associated with each item. The user may select such a button to indicate a desire to purchase that item. This information or purchase request is conveyed electronically to the service provider and\/or the merchant, such as through the mobile device carrier.","The purchase or payment request is then communicated to and processed, at steps  and , by the service provider. As part of the processing, the user may be requested to transmit additional information as needed, such as a user name, email address, phone number, password, PIN, etc. Note that some or all of this information may have been obtained earlier, such as through user entry or automatic transmission by the user device, so that any previously obtained information would not be needed again. This information is used by the service provider to locate the user's account and determine whether the payment can be approved. The determination may include looking at any account limitations or restrictions, such as limits set by the user and\/or the service provider, and fraud analysis, such as using the user location and merchant store location. For example, if the user device and merchant store are located apart from each other (such as separated by over 100 miles), the request may be denied or further authentication by the user may be required.","After processing, the service provider may then transmit a notification to the user and\/or the merchant. If the payment request is denied, the user and\/or the merchant may be notified via text, email, voice, or other means, that the payment was not processed and reasons provided to the user if applicable. The user may resubmit information as needed.","If the payment request is approved, a confirmation may be sent to the merchant device and\/or the user device, such as via text, email, voice, or other means. The payment provider may generate a receipt showing details of the transaction, including an indication that payment was made. The receipt may be stored on the user device and capable of being retrieved and displayed. The user may then take possession of the purchased items, such as by going to the store and showing a receipt on the mobile device, a user ID, or other confirmation of purchase. For example, the merchant may receive a confirmation ID on the merchant device, and when the user shows a corresponding ID on the user device, the merchant may release the item. In the case of a donation, the user may simply be provided an electronic receipt of the donation, which may be printable.","In one embodiment, the viewable surface is a store display window where the store is closed or unmanned. Because the user or consumer interacts with the projected information on the viewable surface, no actual person is needed to assist the user with his selection and purchase. Thus, merchants may take advantage of online transactions to increase sales or purchases, even at unmanned or closed stores.","In another embodiment, a user drives up to drive-through restaurant, and the menu is projected onto the car window. The user selects items off the menu, adds them to his cart, and pays for the items through his mobile device.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["200","202","206","102","106","208"]},"Once the merchant has its store set up with the service provider, the following steps may be performed to allow users to purchase items from the store. The service provider determines whether a user is near the viewable surface. The user location may be determined by the service provider from location information transmitted or received from the user's mobile device. For example, the user may allow the service provider to use location information from the user device or the user may enter a specific location, such as an address, and transmit that location to the service provider.","Once the user location is determined, the service provider determines whether that location is nearby. \u201cNearby\u201d may be defined by the user, the service provider, the merchant, and\/or be dependent on the type of location. For example, the user may select a \u201cnear\u201d distance, such as within 0.1 mile of the viewable surface. The distance may be determined by the service provider and may vary depending on location and other factors, such as the size of the projection screen. For example, a dense area, such as a shopping mall or swap meet, may have a shorter distance than rural or sparsely populated areas. A \u201cnearby\u201d area may be different if the user is in a small coffee shop as opposed to a large museum. A user may be too far away if a projection screen is a smaller size (e.g., a small window in a mall store), even though that same distance may be appropriate for a projection screen that is much larger (e.g., a store front floor-to-ceiling window). Thus, the distance from the user may be determined in any number of ways.","If the distance between the user and viewable surface is too large, the system provider sends a message to the user's mobile device that the user is too far from the viewable surface. If it is determined that the user is close enough to the viewable surface, the service provider allows the user to continue shopping. The user can then control the projected information on the surface, make purchases through the mobile device, and receive the purchased items.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","300","310","340","370","360","370","370"]},"Network , in one embodiment, may be implemented as a single network or a combination of multiple networks. For example, in various embodiments, network  may include the Internet and\/or one or more intranets, landline networks, wireless networks, and\/or other appropriate types of communication networks. In another example, the network may comprise a wireless telecommunications network (e.g., cellular phone network) adapted to communicate with other communication networks, such as the Internet.","Client device , in one embodiment, may be implemented using any appropriate combination of hardware and\/or software configured for wired and\/or wireless communication over network .

It should be appreciated that, in various embodiments, client device  may be referred to as a user device or a customer\/client device without departing from the scope of the present disclosure.","Client device , in one embodiment, may include one or more browser applications  which may be used to provide a user interface to permit user  to browse information available over network . For example, browser application  may be implemented as a web browser to view information available over network . In one implementation, browser application  comprises a software program, such as a graphical user interface (GUI), executable by a processor that is configured to interface and communicate with the one or more merchant devices  and payment provider server  via network . For example, user  is able to access merchant websites to find and purchase items. User , through client device , may also communicate with payment provider server  to create an account and make a payment to the merchant.","As such, client device , in one embodiment, may include other applications  as may be desired in one or more embodiments to provide additional features available to user , including receiving available local items and making payments with payment provider server .
