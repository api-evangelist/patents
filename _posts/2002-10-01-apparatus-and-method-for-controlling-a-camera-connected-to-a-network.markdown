title: Apparatus and method for controlling a camera connected to a network
abstract: A camera control apparatus provides an end user with environment to easily remote-control a video camera via a general network such as the Internet. When the camera control apparatus  receives a file-transfer request described in the format of the network from an external device  connected to the apparatus, it handles a characters in a character string of a file name of the request as camera-control characters. As a result, if the character string includes description corresponding to the format for camera control, the camera control apparatus  controls the camera in accordance with the description to perform image sensing, and transfers the obtained video image as the content of an image file requested by the external device as the file-transfer request originator.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This is a Divisional Application under 37 C.F.R. 1.53(b) U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08\/898,197, filed on Jul. 22, 1997, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,525,761 hereby incorporated by reference.","This invention relates to a camera control apparatus and method and, more particularly to a camera control apparatus and method for remote-controlling a camera via a network.","A camera control system for controlling a camera (e.g., panning, tilting and zooming of the camera) from a remote place is widely known.","In this system, even though camera control is performed via a network, a device for camera control and a client device do not depend on common specification but on unique specifications (e.g., protocol and control information).","However, in recent years, the Internet has been becoming popular with rapidity, and there is an increasing need from end users to see video images sensed by a camera at a remote place via the Internet.","One means to meet this requirement is to periodically store a video image sensed by a camera, in a file, into a storage device of a server connected to the camera, and transfer the file to a terminal (client) that has accessed the server. On the end-user side, a browser, for example, is activated so as to display the video image.","However, this merely displays the video image as sensed, but cannot meet requirements to see, e.g., the image in a view a little shifted to either side, the image in a wider view, or the image expanded within the view.","The conventional camera remote-control technique is based on particular specification, which cannot be applied to use on the Internet.","The present invention has been made in consideration of the above situation, and has its object to provide a camera control apparatus and method which provides an end user with environment to easily remote-control a video camera via a general network such as the Internet.","According to the present invention, the foregoing object is attained by providing a camera control apparatus, connected to a general network, capable of controlling image-sensing condition of a camera, comprising: reception means for receiving a character string descried in a format of file-transfer request used on the network; discrimination means for discriminating a predetermined control character relating to camera control, and a character indicating a control amount accompanying the control character, from a character string at a particular position of the character string received by the reception means; and control means for controlling the camera based on the result of discrimination by the discrimination means, and transferring video image data obtained by the camera to a file-transfer request originator.","Another object of the present invention is to provide a camera control apparatus and method, used in a system where camera image-sensing condition and the like can be remote-controlled in a predetermined network, capable of notifying overlap in reservation of image-sensing programming if occurred.","Another object of the present invention is to provide a camera control apparatus and method which unnecessitates inputting an acceptance code for displaying a video image obtained by programmed image sensing and dynamically generating an HTML document by a CGI program, and which enables to easily display a desired video image obtained by programmed image sensing.","Other features and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the following description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which like reference characters designate the same name or similar parts throughout the figures thereof.","Preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be described in detail in accordance with the accompanying drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["1001","1003","1001","1003","1003","1001","1003","1001"]},"The camera control apparatus  has the following construction.","Numeral  denotes a camera controller which outputs various control signals via the above interface; , a video-image input unit which inputs a video image sensed by the camera  by using an image capture device or the like; , a communication interface unit for the camera control apparatus  to exchange information with another apparatus by using a network adapter or the like. Besides these resources, the camera control apparatus  comprises a command interpreter , which is realized as a program or memory data utilizing the various resources such as a CPU, a storage device and an auxiliary storage device of a computer, an acceptance code generator , a timer , an image memory , and a reservation register .","Numeral  denotes an external device such as a WWW (World Wide Web) server or a WWW browser for communication by the HTTP (Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol) protocol. That is, a WWW browser sends a request in accordance with a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) indicating the storage destination of desired data to a WWW server, which is a storage of document data and image data. In response to the request, the WWW server returns corresponding document data or image data to the WWW browser.","In the present embodiment, the communication interface unit  uses a method realized by the WWW servers. That is, communication is performed by the HTTP protocol, and the camera control apparatus  behaves as if it is a WWW server. This is possible by applying the WWW server's communication method to the present control apparatus.","Generally, when image data is pasted in a WWW document, the request command is described as follows:\n\n","This means that it is requested to transfer image data stored in a file \u201cimage001.gif\u201d in a WWW server \u201cwww.foo.co.jp\u201d. The browser displays the image transferred from the WWW server on its display window image.","The present embodiment performs remote camera control while utilizing the above specification.","That is, in the present embodiment, a character string corresponding to the above file name is interpreted as a command. Specifically, camera-angle destination such as panning, tilting and zooming are represented by alphabets \u201cP\u201d, \u201cT\u201d and \u201cZ\u201d respectively, then, respective control amounts are represented by numerical values.","Assuming that the camera  has a pan angle from \u221250\u00b0 to 50\u00b0, a tilt angle from \u221220\u00b0 to 20\u00b0 and 1 to 8 times zooming, when image sensing is performed with a pan angle of 20\u00b0, a tile angle of 5\u00b0 and twice zooming, and the obtained image is pasted as \u201cgif\u201d format image data, the description is as follows (note that the network address of the present camera control apparatus is www.foo.co.jp):\n\n","The external device , which is a WWW server for the WWW browsers, outputs the above character string in HTML (Hyper-Text Markup Language) description to the camera control apparatus , requiring the image data.","When this request enters the camera control apparatus  via the communication interface unit , the command interpreter  is activated to start interpretation of the request (the above HTML character string) and processing of a response to the request.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0050"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},"First, at step S, the command described as a file name is interpreted. That is, if the head of the request is \u201cP\u201d, the command is recognized as an image-sensing command, then process proceeds to step S.","At this step, the camera  is controlled by the camera controller  based on the designated pan, tilt and zoom values. The obtained image is captured by the video-image input unit , and converted into data of the designated image format, then sent to the external device  requiring the image data, via the communication interface unit . The external device  stores the image data, and transfers the image data to the initial request originator.","At this time, as the communication interface unit  uses the HTTP protocol, content-type information and status information corresponding to the image format are added to the head of the image data. Then, the process ends.","Thus, the obtained video image is displayed in the HTML document as if it is image data stored in a file in the WWW server.","In the command interpretation at step S, if the head of the request is \u201cR\u201d, the command is recognized as a reservation command designating image-sensing time. Then, the process proceeds to step S via the determination of image-sensing condition at step S.","The reservation command starts with \u201cR\u201d; then it continues with integers indicating year, month, day, hour, and minute, each terminated with a period, and with designation of panning, tilting and zooming as image-sensing condition; finally it ends with a name (an extension) indicating the image format. Note that if it has no image-sensing condition, the camera angle at the designated image-sensing time is employed.","For example, if video-image sensing is programmed with image-sensing time of 13:15 on Jul. 6, 1997, a pan angle of 25\u00b0, a tilt angle of 0\u00b0 and a 3 times zooming, in gif format, the reservation is described as follows:\n\n","When the above reservation command is designated, a unique identification number is received as an acceptance code (code indicating that reservation is accepted) from the acceptance code generator  at step S. The acceptance code may be a count value which is incremented by one (+1) at each request generated, or may be a numerical value indicating the designated time (year, month, date and time).","Then, at step S, the acceptance code and information on the designated time, the image-sensing condition and the image format are registered into a storage device (not shown) of the reservation register . At step S, the acceptance code is returned via the communication interface unit  to the external device  which issued the reservation command, further, toward the end user.","Note that at this time, to indicate that the response is an acceptance code, content-type information and status information are added to the head of the code. Then the process ends.","However, if an HTML document including such image-sensing reservation is simply generated but a general WWW browser is used to display the obtained image, the acceptance code instead of image data is returned and an image is not displayed.","However, if image-sensing is reserved with respect to the camera control apparatus  by using a CGI program or the like of the WWW server, in the same manner as that in the WWW browser, and after an acceptance code has been obtained, an HTML document is generated with image-data description designating the acceptance code by an image read command to be described later, image sensing can be performed as programmed when the document is displayed by the WWW browser, and the image data can be displayed.","That is, when the designated time registered in the reservation register  has come, the camera control apparatus  controls the camera  at the registered camera angle to perform the programmed image sensing, and stores the obtained image data in the designated format with an appropriate name, e.g., an acceptance code, as a file name, into the image memory . Thereafter, when an image read command (including an acceptance code) is sent from the external device , image data corresponding to the read command is read from the image memory , and transferred in the designated format to the external device , and the terminal of the end user (WWW browser).","Note that the image read command starts with alphabet \u201cG\u201d, then continues with the acceptance code, and ends with the extension indicating the image format.","The acceptance code is returned to the external device  upon reservation. For example, if \u201c12543\u201d is returned as an acceptance code, to read the image obtained by programmed image sensing, the following description is used:\n\n","Various information is stored into the storage device of the reservation register  in the format of a table, e.g. as shown in . Note that in the present embodiment, the reservation register  uses its own storage device, however, the reservation register  may use the image memory  of the camera control apparatus  or any other storage device.","Note that the character string (\u201cgif\u201d in this case) meaning image formation, added to the end of the image read command must be basically the same as that of the reservation command. If different character string is used in the read command, however, it may be arranged such that the camera control apparatus  converts the image stored in the image memory  with the reservation code into a newly designated format data and transfers the converted data.","Returning to , in the above reservation, the acceptance code is \u201c12543\u201d. That is, in , the reservation data indicates, first, image-sensing time, the acceptance code, image-sensing condition, and an image format.","The image memory  is managed in the format as shown in , where an acceptance code (issued in correspondence with a reservation command, having a meaning equivalent to a file name), an image format, and actual image data are stored. Note that the image memory  may be a storage device of any format, preferably having a sufficient capacity; for example, the image memory  may be a hard disk device, a magneto-optical disk device and the like.","Next, the process procedure of the camera control apparatus of the present embodiment when it has received an image read command will be described.","In the command interpretation at step S, if the head of the command is \u201cG\u201d, the process proceeds to step S, at which it is determined whether or not the command is a reservation command. Since the command is not a reservation command (NO at step S) in this case, the process proceeds to step S. As it is determined at step S that the command is an image read command, the process proceeds to step S, at which corresponding data stored in the image memory  is searched based on the acceptance code included in the image read command.","Then, at step S, it is determined whether or not the data obtained by the above search has the same value of the acceptance code described as the image read command. If YES, the image data is read, and transferred via the communication interface unit  to the external device  requesting the image data.","Also at this time, as the communication interface unit  uses the HTTP protocol, content-type information and status information corresponding to the image format are added to the head of the image data (step S).","At step S, data in the storage area of the image memory , from which the image data has been read out, is deleted. Then the process ends.","If it is determined at step S that image data corresponding to the designated acceptance code is not stored, as the programmed image sensing has not been performed and corresponding image has not been obtained otherwise the image data has been already transferred and deleted from the image memory, error information is returned via the communication interface unit  to the external device  requesting the image data. Then the process ends.","Further, if it determined at step S that the head of the command from the external device  is not \u201cG\u201d, error information indicating that the command is an undefined command is returned via the communication interface unit  to the external device  requesting the image. Then the process ends.","As described above, information exchange is performed between the external device  and the camera control apparatus  of the present embodiment.","Next, the timer , used for performing camera control and storing the result of image-sensing, based on reservation data registered in the reservation register , will be described.","In the timer , at intervals of a predetermined period, e.g., one minute, a timer program is activated. This program is realized by utilizing a timer of a computer or the like.","The operation of the timer program will be described with reference to the flowchart of .","First, at step S, the current time is read from a timer of the camera control apparatus , and the process proceeds to step S.","At step S, reserved contents, i.e., items of programmed image sensing sequentially registered in a respective row of the table of the storage device are read from the reservation register . When it is determined at step S that all the items of programmed image sensing have been read out, the process ends, otherwise, the process proceeds to step S, at which it is determined whether or not the designated time in the reserved data is in the future. If it is determined that the current time is not the designated time yet, the processing at step S and the subsequent steps is repeated.","On the other hand, if it is determined at step S that the current time is the designated time or past the designated time, the process proceeds to step S, at which the camera  is controlled to perform image sensing, by the camera controller , in accordance with the image-sensing condition of the items of the programmed image sensing read from the reservation register . Then, the obtained image is converted into image data of the image format designated by a corresponding item of the programmed image sensing. At step S, the image data is stored, with an acceptance code and image format information, into the image memory . As a result, the image data in the format as shown in  is attached.","Next, at step S, the read items of programmed image sensing are deleted from the reservation register , and the process returns to step S to repeat the processing.","As described above, image sensing is performed as programmed, and the result of the image sensing is stored, thereafter, when an image read command is sent from the external device , the image data is returned in response to the command.","As described above, a live image obtained by controlling a remote camera can be easily pasted in a WWW document by connecting the camera control apparatus of the present embodiment to a network of the www system, and describing a URL where description of image-sensing condition is added to the address of the camera control apparatus, as the source of the image data. Note that if only pasting the image data in a WWW document is performed, the acceptance code generator , the timer , the image memory  and the reservation register  are unnecessary, and step S and the subsequent steps of the processing by the command interpreter  are unnecessary.","Further, by providing the timer , the image memory  and the reservation register , programmed image sensing can be reserved, and later the result of image sensing can be taken into a WWW page and the image can be displayed in the WWW page, by utilizing a CGI program of a WWW server or the like. Especially, if image sensing is tried by controlling a remote camera when the network is overcrowded, image transfer takes much time and cannot smoothly provides image data. However, according to the present embodiment, image sensing in such time is programmed with specific camera angle for a necessary period, and the programmed image sensing is reserved, thereafter, stored image data can be read when the network becomes less crowded, e.g., at midnight.","Especially, image sensing can be performed plural times with the same camera angle at short intervals regardless of the transmission capacity of the network.","Note that the HTTP protocol is used as the interface between the camera control apparatus  and the external device , however, any other communication interface can be used.","Note that the acceptance code is used to identify sensed image data corresponding to the reservation of programmed image sensing, however, it may be arranged such that, instead of using the acceptance code generator, a unique request code is generated on the external device  side (end user side) as a part of a reservation command, then the camera control apparatus  identifies the image data by the correspondence between the request code and the external device .","Further, it may be arranged such that upon notifying the above request code to the image-requesting side, a password is issued, and when the image data is read, the image data can be transferred to the image-requesting side by the reservation code with the password. This avoids at least the inconvenience that a third person sends an image transfer request with accidentally the same reservation code and the file is transferred to the third person then deleted.","Further, image-sensing time is designated in minute unit, however, it may be designated in second or millisecond unit.","In the present embodiment, to indicate the image format, the extension \u201cgif\u201d is employed. It may be arranged such that the image format indicated by the extension \u201cgif\u201d is arbitrarily changed for a JPEG format indicated by an extension \u201cjpg\u201d.","Further, the file name is regarded as a command, however, a parameter description of a URL can be utilized.","For example, panning, tilting, zooming and image format are respectively set to \u201c25\u00b0\u201d, \u201c5\u00b0\u201d, \u201ctwice\u201d and \u201cgif\u201d, image sensing can be programmed by the following description:\n\n","Further, a WWW server may be installed into the camera control apparatus of the present embodiment. In this case, for example, a name \u201ccamctl.exe\u201d is given to the program of the command interpreter  as a CGI program for the WWW server, and the image sensing can be programmed by the following description:\n\n","Furthermore, in the present embodiment, once the image data obtained by programmed image sensing has been transferred, the image data (file) is deleted, however, the image data is not necessarily deleted at this time.","That is, it may be arranged such that the image data, obtained by programmed image sensing and stored as a file, is held for an appropriate period, and when the period has elapsed, the image data is deleted even if the image data has not been transferred. This allows a plurality of end users to obtain the same image.","Further, it may be arranged such that a password is issued to an end user according to circumstances, and the image data is transferred only when the password coincides with that of the image data.","In the above first embodiment, programmed image sensing can be reserved for only one image.","Next, a second embodiment will be described a an example where a plurality of reservation commands are combined into a single file name, and a file extension indicating the image format is added to the file name, so as to reserve programmed image sensing with a plurality of image-sensing times and\/or a plurality of camera angles.","For example, if image sensing is programmed with image-sensing times of 13:15, 13:30 and 13:45 on Jul. 6, 1997, a pan angle of 25\u00b0, a tilt angle of 0\u00b0, 3 times zoom ratio, with intention to read three images in \u201cgif\u201d format later, the reservation is described as follows:\n\n","Note that if the image sensing is performed plural times at the same time or on the same date or at the same camera angle, the corresponding information in the character string may be omitted. For example, the above reservation command may be described as follows:\n\n","Note in the above description, each period means omission of the same numerical value as the initially set numerical value (in this case, year, month, day, hour and minute). This reduces the amount of information by omitting corresponding information such as date.","The basic construction of the second embodiment is substantially the same as that of the first embodiment except the following changes.","That is, in the process procedure of the command interpreter , steps S, S and S are executed in accordance with the command including the above description indicated by \u201c+\u201d.","In accordance with the command interpretation, image data are stored in accordance with acceptance codes \u201c12543-1\u201d, \u201c12543-2\u201d and \u201c12543-3\u201d, as shown in , from the acceptance code in the reservation table as shown in . Note that the acceptance code transferred to the WWW browser is only \u201c12543\u201d. Thereafter, when an image read command is received, image data having the common part of the acceptance codes (\u201c12543\u201d in this case) are found. The image data are re-formatted in the order of the numerals after the hyphen of the common part of the acceptance codes, into a single image data indicating a plurality of images, and the image data is returned via the communication interface unit  to the external device  requesting the image data. The above reformat of plural image data as a single image data is realized by, e.g., combining image data sequentially.","At this time, as the communication interface unit  uses the HTTP protocol, content-type information and status information corresponding to the image format are added to the head of the image data.","At step S according to the second embodiment, the data in the storage areas in the image memory , from which the plurality of image data have been read, are deleted.","The above construction enables to program image sensing, at a plurality of camera angles or image-sensing times at one time, and handles a plurality of image data obtained by the plurality of programmed image sensing as a single image data file comprising a plurality of images, thus unnecessitates management of a plurality of acceptance codes corresponding to the respective images.","Further, if this technique is applied to interval image sensing such as a record of a plant's growth, an image file containing a series of images can be handled as a pseudo moving image.","Note that in this case, the plurality of image data are not combined, but sequentially transferred.","It goes without saying that applications of the present embodiment is similar to the first embodiment.","In the above second embodiment, in case of image sensing at fixed intervals, reservation commands must be combined corresponding to the number of image sensings.","Next, a third embodiment will be described as an example where, in the reservation command, immediately after the designated time end time and interval time are added, and then image-sensing condition such as a camera angle and the image format are designated, to reduce the amount of information to be set. In this embodiment, the end time is designated by numerical values following alphabet \u201ct\u201d, and the interval time is designated by numerical values following alphabet \u201ce\u201d in minute unit.","For example, in a case where image sensing is programmed with image-sensing time of 13:15 and 13:45 on Jul. 6, 1997, a pan angle of 25\u00b0, a tilt angle of 0\u00b0 and 3 times zooming, with intention to read three images later, the reservation command is described as follows:\n\n","As described above, if the image-sensing date or time are the same, the description of these image-sensing date or time can be omitted. In such case, the reservation command is described as follows:\n\n","The basic construction of the third embodiment is substantially the same as that of the first embodiment except the following changes.","That is, in the process procedure by the command interpreter , steps S, S and S are changed in accordance with the above reservation command. Further, step S in the timer program executed by the timer  is changed in accordance with the above reservation command.","Further, in this case, the table format registered in the reservation register  is as shown in .","That is, the end time and interval time of image sensing are added to the record in .","On the other hand, at step S in the command interpretation, if the reservation command has end time and interval time, the reservation is registered as programmed image sensing with the end time, the interval time, with the time of reservation as image-sensing time, and the image format, into the reservation register  with the acceptance code.","Further, if the requested reservation command indicates simple reservation without end time and interval time, the image-sensing time is set as the end time, and the interval time is set to \u201c1\u201d.","At step S, a plurality of image data registered as \u201c12543-1\u201d, \u201c12543-2\u201d . . . , having the same common part of acceptance code, similar to the second embodiment, are read, then re-formatted as a single image data including a plurality of image data, and returned via the communication interface unit  to the external device  requesting the image data.","At the time, as the communication interface unit  uses the HTTP protocol, content-type information and status information corresponding to the image format is added to the head of the image data.","At step S, data in the storage areas in the image memory , from which the plurality of image data have been read, are deleted.","On the other hand, at step S in the timer program, the registered reservation information is updated with information obtained by adding the interval time in the read items of the programmed image sensing, and if the updated image-sensing time is behind the end time, the item of the image-sensing time is deleted from the reservation register .","More specifically, the timer  checks the contents of reservation at intervals of one minute. If the timer  determines that the current time is the image-sensing time in , or the image-sensing time has passed (error is allowable within one minute), the image-sensing condition \u201cP25T0Z3\u201d is forwarded to the camera controller  to perform image sensing. Then one of data as shown in  is stored in the image memory . In , the interval time \u201c15\u201d is added to the image-sensing time \u201c1996.7.6.13.15\u201d, thus the image-sensing time is updated to \u201c1996.7.6.13.30\u201d, as preparation for the next image sensing. As a result, when the image-sensing time has passed the end time, the data in  is deleted.","The above construction enables to easily perform interval image sensing by a short reservation command.","Especially, when interval image sensing is performed for a long period, the second embodiment cannot substantially perform the image sensing due to the lengthiness of the reservation command. However, the third embodiment easily performs such image sensing if the memory capacity for storing image data is sufficient.","The third embodiment reads the result of interval image sensing as a plurality of still image data. Next, an example of reading the result of interval image sensing as moving image data will be described as a fourth embodiment.","Upon reading the result of interval image sensing as moving image data, the file extension is set to \u201cmpg\u201d. For example, the reservation command is as follows:\n\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0132","num":"0142"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 7"]},"That is, a moving-image compressor  such as an MPEG1 compressing unit is added, and the command interpreter  which interprets the file extension \u201cmpg\u201d is provided in place of a command interpreter .","In this embodiment, at step S of the command interpretation process procedure, if the designated image format is a still image format such as \u201cjpg\u201d or \u201cgif\u201d, a plurality of image data registered with the same reservation code are read, then, they are reformatted into a single image data including a plurality of image data, and the image data is returned via the communication interface unit  to the external device  requesting the image data.","At step S, if the designated image format is \u201cmpg\u201d, a plurality of image data registered with the same reservation code are read, then the images are compressed by the moving-image compressor , and the compressed moving image data are returned via the communication interface unit  to the external device  requesting the image data.","At this time, as the communication interface unit  uses the HTTP protocol, content-type information and status information corresponding to the image format are added to the head of the image data.","The above construction compresses image data by using the relation between image frames, and especially in interval image sensing with slight change, compresses image data by a large data amount. This reduces the amount of communication when the image data are read, thus greatly shortens communication time.","In the third embodiment, the same camera angle is designated for interval image sensing. Next, a fifth embodiment will be described as an example where repetitive image sensing by adding a definition of a control variable immediately before the image-sensing time. In the reservation command, the image-sensing condition such as a camera angle and the image format are designated after the image-sensing time, similar to the above embodiments.","The definition of the control variable is described as \u201c$(definition main body)\u201d. The definition main body is described by two ways of representation. One description is designating an initial value, an end value, and an increment.

If the image-sensing time is overlapped with image-sensing time of another reserved programming, the process proceeds to step S, at which information indicating that the reservation cannot be accepted is returned via the communication interface unit  to the external device  requesting the reservation.","If there is no overlapped reservation and it is possible to reserve the programmed image sensing with the designated time, the process proceeds to step S, at which a unique identification number is received as an acceptance code, from the acceptance code generator . The unique identification number may be generated by using a counter incremented by one (+1) at each generation request, otherwise, by using numerical values indicating requested date and time.","At step S, the acceptance code and information on the designated time, the image-sensing condition and the image format are registered in the storage device (not shown) of the reservation register .
