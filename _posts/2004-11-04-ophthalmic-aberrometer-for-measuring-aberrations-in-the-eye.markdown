The government has certain rights in the invention.","The present invention relates to a novel opthalmic aberrometer and method for measuring aberrations in an eye.","A human eye is subject to a variety of optical aberrations. Accurate measurement of optical aberrations is essential for precise correction by customized photo-refractive surgery, by use of customized contact lenses, or by use of customized intra-ocular lenses. Wavefront measurement is a commonly used method to determine optical aberrations of an eye, monitoring penetrating keratoplasty (PKP) healing, or providing quantitative error data.","Shack-Hartmann (SH) wavefront systems are known in the art for measuring ocular aberrations. Starting at the retina, an ideal wavefront is generated which passes through the optical path of the eye. As the wavefront exits the eye, it contains a map of the eye's aberrations for analysis by a lenslet array of a SH sensor. A lenslet array dissects the incoming light into a large number of sub-apertures, and then measures the wavefront slope across each sub-aperture. The sensor information is used to analyze the optical properties of the system which created the wavefront of the eye.","SH wavefront sensors suffer from problems with intensity modulation that introduce scintillation effects and non uniformity of retinal reflection. For example, spot shapes on the Hartmannogram are very irregular, which makes the error of estimation of the spots' centers rather large. To overcome this problem, existing systems collect multiple images over time and average the multiple images or collect an image over a long period of time to smooth out the scintillation effects. However, temporal and spatial errors are introduced into the data with these solutions.","Occluded or damaged corneas produce scatter and\/or scintillation beyond those found in normal eyes. Scatter and scintillation produce amplitude fluctuation in SH lenslet images rendering a wavefront that is known to be inaccurate. Therefore eyes with larger scatter and\/or scintillation are excluded from aberration measurements using existing SH aberrometers. The accuracy and limitations for the SH sensor are discussed by Pedro M. Prieto et al. \u201cAnalysis of the performance of the Hartmann-Shack sensor in the human eye\u201d J. Opt. Soc. Am. Vol. 17 No. 8, August 2000, pgs. 1396-1398.","Existing SH wavefront sensors have a narrow dynamic range and suffer from a lack of high sensitivity. Existing SH wavefront systems only work with relatively clear lenses and corneas. Currently, no wavefront system exists that works well to produce objective data for eyes with scintillation and scatter, over a wide dynamic range, or varying amounts of accommodation.","The present invention relates to an improved system and method for measuring aberrations from eyes.","One aspect of the present invention provides an ophthalmic aberrometer comprising a Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor aligned with an eye under examination through an optical path.

The aberrometer consists of alignment light sources , , positioned on either side of an eye  for providing a fiduciary to the eye. A detector and optics  is aligned with the eye and detects the fiduciary projected onto the front of the eye  by the alignment light sources , . The fiduciary aids in aligning the eye  in the appropriate position in relation to the aberrometer. Measurement light sources ,  are positioned on either side of the eye  for illuminating the eye. The detector and optics  detects the illuminated eye, and the size of the pupil is measured under illuminating conditions that are non-visible to the eye. For example, the light sources , , ,  emit light in the near infrared wavelengths, and the detector  detects in the near infrared range. Alternatively, a single pair of diodes perform the functions of light sources , , , .","A focus dynamic range extender  is positioned on a moveable platform (not shown) whose position changes in the direction as shown by an arrow . An astigmatism dynamic range extender  is positioned between the focus dynamic range extender  and a light source . A light beam  from a light source source  is introduced into an optical path  via a polarizing beam splitter . The wavelength of the light beam is determined by the user and is of any safe wavelength. For example, the wavelength is selected from the near infrared range and those wavelengths visible to the eye under examination. Alternatively, the light beam is in the near infrared range and not visible to the eye under examination. The light beam (also know as the point source of light or point source reference) passes through a point source reference scanner , an astigmatism dynamic range extender , and the focus dynamic range extender , before reaching the retina of the eye . A percentage of the reference light is reflected back from the retina as a wavefront and expanded and relayed by optics  through the focus dynamic range extender , an astigmatism dynamic range extender , off of chromatic beam splitter  which reflects the wavefront and transmits any light from the variable accommodation mechanism comprising a scene generator  and associated optics. The wavefront passes through the point source reference scanner  and the polarized beam splitter  where the polarized light is transmitted to a Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor and a distorted grating wavefront sensor. A Shack Hartmann wavefront sensor comprises a lenslet array and associated optics  and a detector . A distorted grating wavefront sensor comprises a distorted grating and associated optics  and a detector . The wavefront sensors interface with the optical path through, for example, a beam splitter  that splits the light between the two sensors. The amount of light sent to each sensor is determined by the sensor's requirements. The point source reference scanner  is, for example, a rotating wedge. The eye and a wavefront sensor are connected via optical path for example . However, the aberrometer is not limited to the optical path that is illustrated as other optical path layouts will be apparent to persons of ordinary skill in the art.","Referring now to , an alignment fiduciary as seen on the front of the iris of the eye  is illustrated according to one embodiment of the present invention. Light sources (not shown) project an alignment fiduciary onto the front of the subject's eye. A light source emits light in the visible to near infrared wavelengths. In a preferred embodiment, the light source emits near infrared light that is not visible to the human eye. The light source is positioned on the aberrometer at either side of the eye input such that the light source beams overlap only when the subject is the correct distance from the aberrometer thereby forming a fiduciary. The light source projects, for example, a circle with a V shape  the V being inverted in one beam relative to the other . When the beams overlap, they form a circle with a cross in the center (not shown). When the cross is centered on the subject's eye, the subject is positioned correctly relative to the aberrometer.","Referring now to , a diagram of a variable accommodation mechanism is illustrated according to one embodiment of the present invention. A virtual target is created electronically via a scene generator . The virtual target is located at an equivalent distance of between about 20 cm and infinite distance from the eye. A scene generator  projects a scene through a set of lenses ,  that are adjusted relative to one another in the direction indicated by the arrow at . A provided image such as a virtual target appears to be at variable distances from an eye observing the target. An image is passed through chromatic beam splitter  presenting the virtual target to an eye under examination via the optical path. The wavelength of the scene generator is selected by the user. In a preferred embodiment, the wavelength selected is the about green wavelength. Chromatic beam splitter  reflects the reflected reference light from the retina and transmits the bandwidth of the scene generator .","Referring now to , a focus dynamic range extender that compensates for variable amounts of ophthalmic defocus in eyes is illustrated according to one embodiment of the present invention. A prism  with two internal reflecting surfaces ,  is located on a moving stage (not shown). The prism is located between two lenses ,  that form a 1:1 relay in the system using the reference light reflected from the back of the retina . When the prism is translated in the direction indicated by the arrow , the optical path length between the two lenses ,  changes, thus introducing a defocus into the wavefront  returned from the eye. Compensating for the eye's defocus while measuring aberrations extends the dynamic range of the system without sacrificing a wavefront sensor's sensitivity, (the smallest change in the wavefront that the wavefront sensor can measure).","Referring now to , an astigmatism dynamic range extender is illustrated according to one embodiment of the present invention. A pair of cylinder lenses ,  are rotated relative to each other and about the optic axis of the aberrometer as indicated by arrows , . Cylinder lenses ,  have equal but opposite focal length. In a preferred embodiment, lenses ,  are accurately matched. When cylinder lenses ,  are co-aligned, no astigmatism is introduced into the beam. When one lens is rotated relative to the other, the amount of astigmatism introduced into the beam increases. The angle of the astigmatism can be varied by rotating both cylinder lenses in the same direction. An incoming wavefront  is modified by an astigmatism dynamic range extender which introduces a known amount of astigmatism correction such that the outgoing wavefront  will have an astigmatism that is now within the dynamic range of the wavefront measuring sensors. Compensating for the eye's astigmatism while measuring aberrations, extends the dynamic range of the system without sacrificing a wavefront sensor's sensitivity, (the smallest change in the wavefront that the wavefront sensor can measure.)","Referring now to , a dithered point source reference scanner is illustrated according to one embodiment of the present invention. A circular glass wedge  is rotated about an axis as shown by arrow  as a beam of light  is projected though it. The beam of light passes through the dithered point source reference scanner to project a reference point source of light onto the retina. The light for example, is monochromatic light in the about near infrared wavelength. As wedge  rotates, as indicated by arrow , the tilt angle introduced into the transmitted beam  rotates, thereby scanning the reference beam. The wedge  is mounted at a slight angle to the optic axis preventing ghost reflections  from the surface of  from reaching a wavefront sensor (not shown). The beam returned from the eye (not shown) passes back through the rotating wedge , thereby canceling the tilt introduced into the beam. The reflectance from the retina  is measured by a wavefront sensor.","Referring now to , interfacing of a first wavefront sensor and a second wavefront sensor with an optical path of an aberrometer is illustrated according to one embodiment of the present invention. A first wavefront sensor, for example, a distorted grating wavefront sensor comprising imaging lens , grating  with a detector  aligned thereto, interfaces with a second wavefront sensor, for example, a Shack Hartmann wavefront sensor  comprising optical relay and resizing optics  and lenslet array , with a detector aligned thereto , through a beam splitter . The beam splitter  directs a wavefront reflected from an eye under examination (not shown) to the wavefront sensors after passing through a polarizing beam splitter . The split light passes to the distorted grating wavefront sensor through relay optics  and resizing optics  that relays and resizes the system pupil to the front of the grating  to match the grating , objective lens , and detector  parameters. The reflected light from beam splitter  is passed through optical relay and resizing optics  such that the optical image of the pupil is located on lenslet array . Lenslet array  is then focused onto sensor . In a preferred embodiment, the optics , ,  are folding optics that can be placed in various arrangements to package the optical layout.","According to one embodiment of the present invention, a method for measuring eye aberrations is provided. An eye under examination is aligned to an aberrometer with a fiduciary projected onto the eye. A light source projects a fiduciary onto an eye under examination. For example, the fiduciary light source emits light in the about near infrared wavelength. A detector detects the fiduciary projected onto the eye and the eye is aligned with the aberrometer. A point source reference beam illuminates an eye under examination. Dynamic range extender optics are adjusted according to a focus value for the eye under examination and\/or an astigmatism value for the eye under examination. A wavefront is detected and measured by a wavefront sensor and processor. Wave aberrations for the eye under examination are characterized.","The method further comprises providing a virtual target to the eye under examination. The virtual target is generated by a scene generator via a variable accommodation mechanism to measure an eyes ability to accommodate in response to a virtual target whose apparent distance is dynamically changing. A scene generator of the variable accommodation mechanism introduces a virtual target image into the optical path for the eye to focus upon. The position of the virtual target is varied. An eye's ability to accommodate to the different focus lengths is often affected by drugs or injury. Therefore measuring an eyes variable accommodation is a useful measurement for research and treatment.","Referring now to , an image of an eye  and pupil  as seen through a near infrared detector is illustrated according to one embodiment of the present invention. Pupil diameter as illustrated by the double head arrow. The diameter is a value used for reducing the data and comparing subject data according to one embodiment of the present invention. An infrared light source (not shown) illuminates an eye and the illuminated eye is detected with an infrared detector (not shown). For example, the light source comprises an infrared diode that operates in the short wave infrared, such as at about 900 nm. The wavelength is invisible to the subject but readily observable with an infrared detector such as a CCD type of camera with an objective lens. The diameter of the pupil is determined for example by measuring the number of pixels of the detector across which the pupil diameter spans.","Referring now to , a reference beam on the retina is illustrated for a static reference  and a dithering reference  is illustrated according to one embodiment of the present invention. A reference beam passes through a dithered point source reference scanner (not shown) providing a circular doughnut type of image  on a retina. The size of the circular spot is selected to be smaller than the isoplanatic angle of the aberrations in the eye and is rotated fast enough to be faster than the Greenwood frequency of the aberrations in the eye, and to appear as a point element to the detectors used in the wavefront systems. A transmissive dithering point source scanner allows non rotating measurements to be made, for example by eliminating the rotation of the wedge.","A reference spot within the eye pupil obtained with a wavefront sensor having a dithered point source reference, according to one embodiment of the present invention, provides well formed spots. The resulting image lacks the amplitude variations common to Hartmannogramms obtained with a static reference. The image is acquired with a single exposure of about 30 msec thereby eliminating the need to take multiple images and average the images or a single image over a greater time course. The image acquisition rate can be increased by decreasing the exposure time.","Referring now to , the reflected image of a static reference point source provided to an eye under examination is illustrated. Referring now to , a Hartmannogram corresponding the intensity distribution illustrated in  is illustrated. The spot shapes on the Hartmannogram are very irregular, which makes the error of estimations of the spots' centers rather large.","Referring now to , the reflected image of a dithering reference point source provided to an eye under examination is illustrated. Referring now to , a Hartmannogram corresponding to the intensity distribution shown in  is illustrated. The spot shapes on the Hartmannogram are more regular and have a Gaussian distribution with a well defined centroid. This improvement in the energy distribution within the spot increases the accuracy of the estimation of the centroid used in wavefront reconstruction by more than 10 times. A dithered reference reduces the speckle modulation. The Hartmannogramm in  and  were taken with the same exposure, detector, lenslet array and settings.","According to one embodiment of the present invention, wavefront data is collected at a higher rate of acquisition than previously reported since a single image provides improved data. According to one example, data is collected at 70 frames per second providing usable frequency data at over 20 Hz. A high rate of data acquisition provides for improved tracking of the time varying magnitudes of aberrations and to process the data using standard statistic techniques to locate frequency dependent features. According to another embodiment, aberration frequency signatures of between about 3-15 Hz are measured. According to yet another embodiment, frequency signatures of between about 18-30 Hz are measured. According to yet another embodiment, frequency signatures of greater than about 30 Hz are measured. Frequency signatures of aberrations correlate to neurologic and physiologic function or dysfunction. For example changes in heart rate and ocular motor injury are known to correlate with the frequency of aberrations found in the eye.","In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the system and method operates manually. In an alternative embodiment, the present invention operates automatically with various general purpose computers. For example a computer controls detectors, recording outputs and results from the detectors, (both raw and calculated results) as well as dynamic focus extender optics, astigmatism extender optics and variable accommodation optics.","Alternate embodiments will be apparent to those skilled in the art with other types of equipment that record the necessary images may be employed and related statistical and analysis techniques may be used without departing from the scope of the invention as claimed. Further, the embodiments and examples described herein are illustrative only and are not meant as limitations on the claims hereof."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["Additional objects and advantages of the present invention will be apparent in the following detailed description read in conjunction with the accompanying drawing figures.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIG. 11","FIG. 10"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":["FIG. 13","FIG. 12"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
