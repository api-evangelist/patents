title: Anti-armor multipurpose and chemical energy projectiles
abstract: An anti-armor projectile has a tail fin boom having an inner hollow area. A warhead made of high density materials is disposed in the hollow area to serve as a kinetic-energy penetrator that is released upon impact to increase the lethality of the anti-armor projectile.

Field of the Invention","This invention relates to an armor-penetrating tandem-projectile.","2. Description of the Related Art","Certain types of chemical energy (CE) warheads are formed by cone-shaped metallic liners which are later transformed into a metallic liquid jet by an explosive shaping charge carried on board the projectile. The CE warhead must be activated very near the target (about 1\u20132 meters) so that the formed metallic jet does not break up. Also, a spacer\/spike in front of the liner provides a very short time delay needed to form the jet, when an impact fuse is mounted on the tip of that spacer spike. Alternatively, a proximity fuse may be used instead of the impact fuse if the intended target is moving (as in helicopters) or is relatively distant (4,000\u20135,000 meters) and a direct impact is less likely to happen. This last scenario is the actual incentive for the concept of multipurpose (MP) projectiles.","Anti-armor kinetic energy (KE) projectiles are long rods launched at high speed, causing damage due to their kinetic energy (mass and speed). Therefore, they are usually made of high density materials to increase the mass for a given volume.","U.S. Pat. No. 6,109,185 includes several tandem warhead configurations including KE-CE, CE-KE, KE-KE, or CE-CE arrangements. U.S. Pat. No. 4,102,271 discloses a KE-CE combination. U.S. Pat. No. 5,191,169 shows multiple EFP (explosively formed projectile) configurations. U.S. Pat. No. 5,744,746 shows a CE-CE tandem configuration. U.S. Pat. No. 4,497,253 shows a KE-KE configuration.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","10","12","14","12","16","18","16","20","18","22"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIGS. 1 and 2"],"b":["30","32","34","36","38","36","40","38","36","42"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"],"b":["50","52","54","56","57"]},"The present invention is directed to a tandem warhead, in which the tail fin boom is provided with an added warhead. The forward-momentum energy released through impact is used as a mechanism for the added warhead release. The present invention includes a restraining mechanism to restrain the added warhead from spin slipping with respect to the spinning carrier projectile and to restrain the added warhead from backward movement at launch (set back), by resting the rod rear-end on an impact load-carrying end-piece. The restraining mechanism alters upon impact of the projectile to enable forward release of the added warhead through the destruction of the threads on a front screwing nut.","More particularly, the present invention increases the lethality of MP and CE warhead projectiles, by utilizing and converting the tail fin boom into a tube carrying an added high-density KE penetrator rod warhead. The penetrator rod is positioned to impact the target after the detonation of the front main CE or MP warhead. The release mechanism for the added KE penetrator rod is the forward momentum energy released by the stoppage of the main carrier projectile upon impact with the target. Upon impact, the added penetrator slips forward, following into the hole created by the MP\/CE liquid metal jet, imparting more kinetic energy and causing deeper penetration damage to the target.","The present invention can be applied to both categories of projectiles (MP projectiles and fin-stabilized CE projectiles) and can be applied as well to the existing stock of both 120 mm and 105 mm CE and MP munitions. To retrofit the existing stock, the tail boom must be modified, and the fin unit, usually screwed onto the tail fin boom, must be modified to account for the heavier weight of the added KE warhead.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["50","52","54","56","57","58","58","60","62","64","66","60","62","64","66"]},"The present invention provides novel features to enable the functioning of the added warhead. First, the added warhead should not spin relative to the spinning carrier projectile. Such relative spin may cause in-flight dynamic instability for the carrier projectile or cause inaccuracy in target hitting. Second, the added warhead should be supported at its rear end (toward the fins) such that the support part can withstand the inertia force due to the large launch acceleration (set-back force). Third, the added warhead must be restrained from relative axial movement (relative to the main carrier projectile); however, it also must be able to be released freely forward, when the carrier projectile movement is suddenly halted at impact with a target. The present invention provides for these three considerations to be satisfied in the warhead and the carrier projectile. These features are described next for the preferred embodiment.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIGS. 7 and 8"],"b":["60","60","60","68","68","70","72","74","70","70","74","58","70","68"]},"The rod rear end  is also of non-circular cross section (square in the present embodiment of ) to be matched in a corresponding non-circular recess in the fin set piece , as shown in .
