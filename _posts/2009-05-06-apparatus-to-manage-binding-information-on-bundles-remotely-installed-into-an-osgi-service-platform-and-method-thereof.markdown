Field","The following description relates to an open service gateway initiative (OSGi), and more particularly, to a method of managing a bundle that is remotely installed by a controller device, by using an OSGi-based controlled device.","2. Description of the Related Art","With the development of various communication devices, a first communication device may perform a function by cooperating with a plurality of other communication devices via a network so that the original functionality of the first communication device can be extended. Open service gateway initiative (OSGi) may be used to provide such an execution environment.","OSGi is a standard related to technology for dynamically installing new services into a network device and for executing the services. Controller devices that belong to a network may remotely install bundles in a controlled device, in which an OSGi service platform is installed, and may use services provided by the bundles.","Bundles are basic units which perform distribution and management in a network, include at least one OSGi service, and are managed by an OSGi framework. In other words, the OSGi framework provides a standardized execution environment for various applications (bundles). The general concept of OSGi is well known to one of ordinary skill in the art, and is described in various OSGi release documents. However, current OSGi technology does not provide a mechanism to map bundles that are remotely installed into an OSGi service platform to controller devices in which bundles are installed, and to manage the bundles and the controller device.","One general aspect includes an apparatus to manage a bundle that is remotely installed via a network, by using an open service gateway initiative (OSGi)-based controlled device, and a method thereof.","According to another general aspect, there is provided a method of managing a bundle that is remotely installed by a controller device, the method executed by an open service gateway initiative (OSGi)-based controlled device, the method including, in response to a service event indicating that a predetermined service that is provided by the bundle is registered in an OSGi service registry occurring, generating binding information that is used to map the bundle to the controller device, by using the service, and notifying an event on a change of a life cycle of the bundle to the controller device by using the generated binding information.","The generating of the binding information may include adding an identifier of the controller device to a bundle property of the bundle by using the service.","The method may further include, in response to uninstallation of the bundle being requested by the controller device, storing the identifier in a region which is not deleted even though the bundle is uninstalled, wherein the notifying of the event comprises, in response to a bundle event indicating that the bundle has been uninstalled occurring, notifying the bundle event to the controller device by referring to the stored identifier.","The method may further include, in response to an event unsubscription request on the bundle being received from the controller device, deleting the identifier from the bundle property by using the service.","The method may further include in response to detecting that the controller device is disconnected from the network, retrieving bundles comprising the identifier in the bundle property, among bundles of the OSGi framework, and deleting the identifier from bundle properties of the retrieved bundles by using predetermined services that are provided by the retrieved bundles.","The generating of the binding information may include, in response to an identifier of other controller devices being included in an action invocation message or an event subscription request message received from the controller device, together with the identifier of the controller device, adding the identifiers to the bundle property by using the service.","The identifier may be a universal resource identifier (URI) of the controller device.","According to yet another general aspect, there is provided an apparatus to manage a bundle that is remotely installed by a controller device, wherein the apparatus is an open service gateway initiative (OSGi)-based controlled device, including a binding information management unit generating binding information that is used to map the bundle to the controller device, by using a predetermined service in response to a service event indicating that the service that is provided by the bundle is registered in an OSGi service registry occurring, and an event notification unit notifying an event on a change of a life cycle of the bundle to the controller device by using the generated binding information.","The binding information management unit may add an identifier of the controller device to a bundle property of the bundle by using the service.","The apparatus may further include a binding information backup unit to store the identifier in a region which is not deleted even though the bundle is uninstalled in response to uninstallation of the bundle being requested by the controller device, wherein the event notification unit notifies the bundle event to the controller device by referring to the stored identifier in response to a bundle event indicating that the bundle has been uninstalled occurring.","The binding information management unit may delete the identifier from the bundle property by using the service in response to an event unsubscription request on the bundle being received from the controller device.","The apparatus may further include a retrieval unit to retrieve the bundle including the identifier in the bundle property, among bundles of the OSGi framework, in response to detecting that the controller device is disconnected from the network, wherein the binding information management unit deletes the identifier from bundle properties of the retrieved bundles by using predetermined services that are provided by the retrieved bundles.","The binding information management unit may the identifiers to the bundle property by using the service in response to an identifier of other controller devices being included in an action invocation message or an event subscription request message received from the controller device, together with the identifier of the controller device.","The identifier may be a universal resource identifier (URI) of the controller device.","According to still another general aspect, there is provided a computer readable recording medium having recorded thereon a program to perform a bundle management method executed by an open service gateway initiative (OSGi)-based controlled device, including instructions to cause a computer to in response to a service event indicating that a predetermined service that is provided by the bundle is registered in an OSGi service registry occurring, generate binding information that is used to map the bundle to the controller device, by using the service, and notify an event on a change of a life cycle of the bundle to the controller device by using the generated binding information.","Other features and aspects will be apparent from the following detailed description, the drawings, and the claims.","Throughout the drawings and the detailed description, unless otherwise described, the same drawing reference numerals will be understood to refer to the same elements, features, and structures. The relative size and depiction of these elements may be exaggerated for clarity, illustration, and convenience.","The following detailed description is provided to assist the reader in gaining a comprehensive understanding of the methods, apparatuses and\/or systems described herein. Accordingly, various changes, modifications, and equivalents of the systems, apparatuses and\/or methods described herein will be suggested to those of ordinary skill in the art. Also, descriptions of well-known functions and constructions may be omitted for increased clarity and conciseness.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"Often, the controller device that is interested in the bundle may be a controller device in which the bundle is installed. However, other controller devices may need to be notified of a change of a state of the bundle. Thus, a plurality of controller devices may be mapped to one bundle according to a user's determination.","As illustrated in , the controller device installs a bundle into an OSGi framework of a controlled device, remotely via a network ().","The bundle starts due to a request of the controller device ().","A device binding service (DBS), among services provided by the started bundle, is registered in an OSGi service registry (). DBS is a name of a service that is newly suggested in the current embodiment and manages binding information of the bundle installed into the OSGi framework.","In other words, according to an example embodiment, it is assumed that all bundles that are installed into a controlled device by using a controller device include a DBS for managing binding information of a bundle. Thus, when the bundle remotely installed into the controlled device starts, the DBS of the bundle is registered in the OSGi service registry. For the convenience of explanation and without limiting thereto, hereinafter, all bundles may be referred to as remotely-installed bundles.","Referring again to , binding information is generated by using the DBS (). In other words, the DBS that is registered in the OSGi service registry of the controlled device provides an application programming interface (API) to generate binding information. The generation of the binding information may include adding an identifier of the controller device that has installed the bundle in a bundle property by using the API of the DBS.","The bundle property is a file that stores various information pertaining to the bundle. Where an identifier of the controller device is included in the bundle property, the controller device that has installed the bundle may be identified. As such, the identifier of the controller device included in the bundle property of a specific bundle may be binding information that is obtained by mapping the bundle to the controller device corresponding to the identifier.","Hereinafter, it is assumed that the identifier of the controller device included in the bundle property is binding information. However, the binding information may be in various formats in which the bundle and the controller device are mapped to each other. Also, binding information may be stored in regions other than the bundle property.","Referring to , it is assumed that the binding information is generated when the bundle starts. However, the binding information may be generated in other operations according to implementation examples. For example, where a control protocol between the controller device and the controlled device is universal plug and play (UPnP), in response to the controlled device receiving a UPnP control message or a UPnP event subscription request message that requests a specific action, the binding information may be generated.","Where an identifier of another controller device is included in an action invocation message or an event subscription request message, the controlled device generates binding information that is obtained by mapping two controller devices to one bundle. For example, two identifiers may be added to a bundle property of a bundle. A number of controller devices that are mapped to one bundle may be two or more.","An identifier of a controller device may be a universal resource identifier (URI) of the controller device.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},"A bundle event that indicates the bundle stops occurs (). An OSGi framework notifies a bundle event to an event listener whenever a life cycle of the bundle changes.","The controlled device extracts an identifier of the controller device that has installed the bundle remotely from a bundle property of the stopped bundle ().","The controlled device notifies of the bundle event to the controller device by referring to the extracted identifier ().","Accordingly, an OSGi-based controlled device manages binding information that is obtained by mapping a bundle installed into the OSGi framework to an identifier of a controller device that is interested in the bundle, thereby determining to which controller device a bundle event will be notified.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},"A controlled device receives an event unsubscription request on a specific bundle from a controller device ().","The controlled device deletes an identifier of the controller device from a bundle registry of a bundle by using a DBS of the bundle ().",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},"The controlled device receives a bundle uninstallation request from a controller device ().","The controlled device extracts an identifier of the controller device from a bundle property of a bundle requested to be uninstalled ().","The controlled device stores the extracted identifier in a region which is not deleted, even though the bundle is uninstalled (). This procedure is performed to back up the identifier of the controller device before the bundle is uninstalled. Since the bundle property cannot be referred to after the bundle is uninstalled, the identifier of the controller device may be backed up before the bundle is uninstalled. If the identifier of the controller device is not backed up before the bundle is uninstalled, it is difficult to determine which controller device to notify.","Referring again to , the bundle event indicating the bundle is uninstalled occurs ().","The controlled device notifies of the bundle event to the controller device by referring to the identifier of the stored controller device ().",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0064"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},"While  depicts the operations performed where the controller device leaves the network normally,  depicts operations where the controller device is abnormally terminated by not making an event unsubscription request.","Referring to , the controlled device detects that the controller device is disconnected from the network ().","The controlled device retrieves bundles that include an identifier of the controller device in a bundle property, among bundles installed into an OSGi framework ().","The controlled device deletes the identifier of the controller device from bundle properties of the retrieved bundles by using device binding services (DBSs) of the retrieved bundles ().","Accordingly, in response to the controller device leaving the network, the controlled device deletes binding information related to the controller device and thus does not need to transmit an event message where an event related to a life cycle of the bundle occurs.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0071","num":"0070"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":"600"},"Referring to , the controlled device  includes an OSGi framework , a binding information management unit , an event notification unit , a binding information backup unit , a retrieval unit , and a network interface module .","The OSGi framework  is known to one of ordinary skill in the art, has been described in an OSGi standard document, and thus, a description thereof will not be repeated.","The network interface module  processes a control protocol between a controller device and the controlled device . For example, a UPnP may be used as the control protocol between the controller device and the controlled device.","The binding information management unit  generates binding information by using a DBS when a service event indicating that a DBS of a remotely-installed bundle has been registered in an OSGi service registry occurs.","As described above, the binding information may be generated when another action invocation message other than an action invocation message requesting start of the bundle or an event subscription request message is received from the controller device. The binding information may be implemented as an identifier included in a bundle property, and a plurality of controller devices may be mapped to one bundle.","In addition, the binding information management unit  deletes binding information related to the controller device by using a DBS of the bundle where the event unsubscription request on the bundle installed into the OSGi framework  is received from the controller device or the controller device is disconnected from the network.","The event notification unit  notifies a bundle event, i.e., an event related to a change of a life cycle of the bundle, to the controller device by using the binding information.","In response to the controller device requesting uninstallation of the bundle, the binding information backup unit  backs up the binding information in a safe place before the bundle event on uninstallation of the bundle occurs. For example, where the binding information is implemented by adding a URI of the controller device to the bundle property, if the bundle is completely uninstalled, the bundle property cannot be referred to, and thus, it cannot be determined which controller device to notify. Thus, the binding information backup unit  stores the URI of the controller device in a region which is not deleted even though the bundle is uninstalled before the bundle is completely uninstalled.","The retrieval unit  retrieves the binding information corresponding to the controller device in response to detecting that the controller device is disconnected from the network. For example, a bundle property including the URI of the controller device that leaves the network is selected from bundle properties of bundles installed into the OSGi framework . The binding information management unit  deletes the URI of the controller device, which is included in the selected bundle property.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0081","num":"0080"},"figref":"FIG. 7A"},"A controller device  invokes an action of a device control protocol (DCP) module  and requests a start of a bundle  ().","The DCP module  provides a service of the bundle  installed into an OSGi framework  to the controller device  based on a protocol between the controller device  and a controlled device, invokes an API of the OSGi framework  according to the action invocation of the controller device  and returns the result of the invocation to the controller device . Thus, the DCP module  functions as a gateway between an OSGi service platform of the controlled device and the controller device .","The DCP module  may be implemented as a bundle or a native application that is outside the OSGi service platform.","The DCP module  requests start of the bundle  by invoking the API of the OSGi framework  ().","The OSGi framework  invokes the API that is used to start the bundle , among APIs of the bundle  ().","When the bundle  starts, the bundle  registers a DBS  in an OSGi service registry of the OSGi framework  ().","The OSGi framework  notifies a service event, indicating that the DBS  has been registered, to the DCP module  ().","The DCP module  requests the DBS  to generate binding information by using an URI , which is an identifier of the controller device , by invoking the API of the DBS .
