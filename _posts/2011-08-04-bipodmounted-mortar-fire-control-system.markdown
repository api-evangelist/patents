{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The inventions described herein may be manufactured, used and licensed by or for the U.S. Government for U.S. Government purposes.","The invention relates in general to mortar systems and in particular to the mounting of digital fire control systems for mortar systems.","During firing of a mortar system, a mortar round is dropped into the top of a cannon and slides down until it hits a firing pin at the bottom. Impact with the firing pin ignites the propellant behind the projectile, creating tremendous pressures and ejecting the projectile out of the cannon. The large pressure forces react against the pressure vessel or cannon and translate into the baseplate, thereby forcing both the cannon and baseplate to move into the ground surface. This movement or burying effect into the ground is typical of all dismounted mortar systems.","During the above firing procedure, the bipod is responsible for supporting and stabilizing the cannon. This is done mostly with the buffer system. The buffer system uses springs to isolate or disconnect the firing forces away from the bipod itself. The buffer system allows the cannon and baseplate to move into the ground while maintaining stabilization of the bipod.","Digital fire control systems (DFCS) (for example, Honeywell's TALIN 3000 digital pointing device) may be used with some mortar systems, for example, 120 mm mortar systems. The extreme accelerations experienced by a mortar system during firing may damage sensitive DFCS components. In known mortar systems, the DFCS is mounted on the cannon, whether or not there is a mechanism for isolating the DFCS from large accelerations. In addition, when the DFCS is mounted directly to the cannon, it may be removed from the cannon in the event of a misfire or for hand transportation. The specific torque requirements for direct mounting may prevent the DFCS from being easily removed from the cannon.","Large mortar systems, such as a 120 mm mortar system, may be integrated into a tracked mortar carrier, such as the M1064 mortar carrier. Or, they may be integrated into a trailer or vehicle mount, such as the M326 Quick Stow trailer mount, and subsequently used in a dismounted fashion. The known DFCS mounts for the tracked mortar carrier and the trailer mount each have a different design and require different specifications for actual mounting to the cannon. Both DFCS mounts are attached directly to the cannon. The M326 Quick Stow DFCS mounting system includes an integrated isolation system (separate from the bipod isolation system) that is required to meet survivability criteria for dismounted or ground-mounted 120 mm mortar firing. On the other hand, the M1064 tracked mortar carrier DFCS mount does not require an additional isolation system.","The known mounting methods for mortar DFCS may be satisfactory for their individual platform. However, there is no single mounting method that may be used with both the M1064 and M326 platforms. In addition, neither method allows one to easily remove the fire control mounting hardware from the cannon after a misfire. Because both known mounting methods interface directly with cannon, those methods have precise torque requirements that if not adhered to, can disrupt the functionality of the cannon. Because the harshest firing environment is in the dismounted configuration, the M326 Quick Stow DFCS mount has a very large size and weight. The large size and weight of the mount are needed to meet the shock requirements for DFCS, but are otherwise very undesirable.","A need exists for an apparatus for mounting an electronics unit to a portion of a bipod that is not fixed for movement with a cannon.","It is an object of the invention to provide an apparatus for mounting an electronics unit to a portion of a bipod that is not fixed for movement with a cannon.","One aspect of the invention is an apparatus for mounting an electronics unit to a mortar bipod. The apparatus may include a pair of spaced-apart, generally parallel mounting brackets having respective inner faces. A pair of support rails may be fixed to opposite outer edges of the mounting brackets. A pair of support rods may be fixed between opposite lower portions of the mounting brackets. A lower guide rod housing may be fixed to first ends of the support rails. A pair of fire control guide rods may have first ends fixed to the lower guide rod housing.","The apparatus may include a plurality of shock mounts having respective bases and tops. The shock mount bases may be fixed to the respective inner faces of the mounting brackets. The electronics unit may have a top plate fixed thereto. A pair of side plates may be fixed to the top plate and may extend generally perpendicular thereto. The tops of the shock mounts may be fixed to the side plates. Bearings may be disposed on each of the fire control guide rods.","A traverse yoke may be fixed to seconds ends of the pair of support rails. The traverse yoke may include a pair of openings for receiving the pair of fire control guide rods. Removable fasteners may be included for fixing the second ends of the support rails to the traverse yoke and for fixing the first ends of the support rails to the lower guide rod housing.","Another aspect of the invention is a mortar bipod. The mortar bipod may include a pair of leg assemblies and a cross-level mechanism connected to one of the leg assemblies. An elevation assembly may be connected to the cross-level mechanism and to a traverse assembly. The afore-described apparatus for mounting an electronics unit to a mortar bipod may be included with the mortar bipod. The traverse assembly may include the traverse yoke.","The mortar bipod may include a cannon lower clamp and a pair of bipod buffers. Each bipod buffer may include a recoil housing fixed to the cannon lower clamp for translation therewith. The traverse yoke may include a second pair of openings for receiving ends of the bipod buffers. The ends of the bipod buffers may be fixed to the traverse yoke.","The pair of fire control guide rods may be translatably disposed in openings in the cannon lower clamp. Each bipod buffer may include a recoil spring housing translatably disposed in the recoil housing, a recoil rod guide fixed for translation with the recoil housing, and at least one spring disposed in the recoil spring housing. The at least one spring may be compressed by translation of the recoil rod guide.","A further aspect of the invention is a mortar system. The mortar system may include the afore-described mortar bipod and a cannon upper clamp. A cannon may be fixed between the cannon upper clamp and the cannon lower clamp. A baseplate may receive an end of the cannon.","A method of isolating an electronics unit from firing loads of a cannon may include providing a bipod for the cannon and mounting the electronics unit on a portion of the bipod that is not fixed for movement with the cannon.","The invention will be better understood, and further objects, features, and advantages thereof will become more apparent from the following description of the preferred embodiments, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.","A mortar bipod may include an apparatus for mounting mortar fire control hardware or other electronics which are required to be co-oriented with the mortar cannon tube. The bipod may be axially buffered from the cannon tube and its associated recoil shock. Compared to mounting the electronics to a buffered assembly that is attached directly to the cannon tube, mounting the electronics to a buffered bipod may eliminate the need to remove the electronics from the cannon tube when the cannon tube is removed, such as in misfire procedures. In prior art mortar systems, the fire control hardware, such as a pointing device or DFCS, may be mounted to the cannon tube.","The novel mortar bipod may better isolate the DFCS from the harsh firing environment and may minimize the shock loads experienced by the DFCS. The novel mortar bipod may also weigh much less than prior art bipods. For example, an embodiment of the novel mortar bipod for use with a 120 mm mortar system may weigh about 38% less than the known 120 mm bipod. The novel mortar bipod may not require the cannon mounting bracket used with prior bipods.","The novel bipod may interface with both the M1064 Mortar Carrier mounted configuration and the M326 Quick Stow dismounted configuration. Because the DFCS may be integrated within the bipod, it may utilize the de-coupling technique that many bipods possess. The decoupling technique may minimize the firing accelerations to which the DFCS may be exposed. The novel bipod may avoid interference with misfire procedures because it is not mounted directly to the cannon. Therefore, the bipod may be easily separated from the cannon.","A DFCS is highly sensitive electronic equipment that cannot withstand the shock loads created during a typical mortar firing. In known mortar systems, the DFCS is mounted on the cannon, in one way or another. Although one of these known mounting methods has a separate isolation system, mounting the DFCS on the cannon is not conducive to protecting its sensitive electronic equipment. The novel mortar bipod may utilize a typical bipod disconnect feature by mounting the DFCS to the side of the bipod that is disconnected or isolated from the firing loads.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 3"],"b":["10","46","10","12","14","16","14","18","16","20","20","22"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["100","46","10","100","24","44","26","24","28","24","30","32","26","34","36","30","52","34"]},"A plurality of shock mounts  may have respective bases  and tops  (see  also).

The externally threaded portion of end cap  may include an opening therein (not shown) that may allow for an over travel condition. The opening in externally threaded portion of end cap  may avoid a metal to metal bottoming out. A recoil bump stop  may help avoid a metal to metal bottoming out. Bump stop  may be made of, for example, silicon rubber.","To minimize metal to metal contact between the moving components of buffer , spring guide washers  may be used. Spring guide washers  may be made of, for example, polyurethane. To minimize the entrance of foreign objects such as dirt into buffer , a seal  may be used. A clamp handle  may be fixed to cannon upper clamp .","DFCS  may be attached to traverse yoke  by inserting fire control guide rods  through traverse yoke  and then attaching fasteners  to the sides of traverse yoke .
