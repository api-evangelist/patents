No. 61\/166,896, filed on Apr. 6, 2009, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.","This invention was made with government support under Grant No. CHE-0616759 awarded by the National Science Foundation. The government has certain rights in the invention.","A new generation of optoelectronic devices such as organic thin film transistors (OTFTs), organic light emitting transistors (OLETs), organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs), printable circuits, organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices, electrochemical capacitors, and sensors are built upon organic semiconductors as their active components. To enable high device efficiencies such as large charge carrier mobilities (\u03bc) needed for transistor\/circuit operations, or efficient exciton formation\/splitting that is necessary for OLED\/OPV operations, it is desirable that both p-type and n-type organic semiconductor materials are available. In addition, certain optoelectronic devices such as light emitting transistors require a semiconductor material which can transport both types of charge carriers efficiently. Furthermore, these organic semiconductor-based devices should exhibit satisfactory stability in ambient conditions and should be processable in a cost-effective manner. For example, a benchmark polymer, regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (rr-P3HT), can provide hole mobilities \u02dc0.1 cm\/Vs and current modulation \u226710, close to amorphous silicon, but only under inert atmosphere.","Accordingly, the art desires new organic semiconductor materials, particularly those that can have good charge transport characteristics, processing properties, and stability in ambient conditions.","In light of the foregoing, the present teachings provide organic semiconductor materials that are prepared from monomeric, oligomeric, and polymeric compounds having one or more phthalimide units and\/or one or more head-to-head (H-H) substituted biheteroaryl units. Also provided are associated devices and related methods for the preparation and use of these compounds. The present compounds can exhibit properties such as excellent charge transport characteristics in ambient conditions, chemical stability, low-temperature processability, large solubility in common solvents, and processing versatility (e.g., via various solution processes). As a result, field effect devices such as thin film transistors that incorporate one or more of the present compounds as the semiconductor layer can exhibit high performance in ambient conditions, for example, demonstrating one or more of large charge carrier mobilities, low threshold voltages, and high current on-off ratios. Similarly, other organic semiconductor-based devices such as OPVs, OLETs, and OLEDs can be fabricated efficiently using the organic semiconductor materials described herein.","The present teachings also provide methods of preparing such compounds and semiconductor materials, as well as various compositions, composites, and devices that incorporate the compounds and semiconductor materials disclosed herein.","The foregoing as well as other features and advantages of the present teachings will be more fully understood from the following figures, description, examples, and claims.","The present teachings provide organic semiconductor materials that are prepared from monomeric, oligomeric, and polymeric compounds having one or more phthalimide units and\/or one or more head-to-head (H-H) substituted biheteroaryl units. Compounds of the present teachings can exhibit semiconductor behavior such as high carrier mobility and\/or good current modulation characteristics in a field-effect device, light absorption\/charge separation in a photovoltaic device, and\/or charge transport\/recombination\/light emission in a light-emitting device. In addition, the present compounds can possess certain processing advantages such as solution-processability and\/or good stability (for example, air stability) in ambient conditions. The compounds of the present teachings can be used to prepare p-type, n-type, or ambipolar semiconductor materials, which in turn can be used to fabricate various organic electronic articles, structures and devices, including field-effect transistors, unipolar circuitries, complementary circuitries, photovoltaic devices, and light emitting devices.","Throughout the application, where compositions are described as having, including, or comprising specific components, or where processes are described as having, including, or comprising specific process steps, it is contemplated that compositions of the present teachings also consist essentially of, or consist of, the recited components, and that the processes of the present teachings also consist essentially of, or consist of, the recited process steps.","In the application, where an element or component is said to be included in and\/or selected from a list of recited elements or components, it should be understood that the element or component can be any one of the recited elements or components and can be selected from a group consisting of two or more of the recited elements or components. Further, it should be understood that elements and\/or features of a composition, an apparatus, or a method described herein can be combined in a variety of ways without departing from the spirit and scope of the present teachings, whether explicit or implicit herein.","The use of the terms \u201cinclude,\u201d \u201cincludes\u201d, \u201cincluding,\u201d \u201chave,\u201d \u201chas,\u201d or \u201chaving\u201d should be generally understood as open-ended and non-limiting unless specifically stated otherwise.","The use of the singular herein includes the plural (and vice versa) unless specifically stated otherwise.

The most common quantification of electron-donating and electron-withdrawing properties is in terms of Hammett \u03c3 values. Hydrogen has a Hammett \u03c3 value of zero, while other substituents have Hammett \u03c3 values that increase positively or negatively in direct relation to their electron-withdrawing or electron-donating characteristics. Substituents with negative Hammett \u03c3 values are considered electron-donating, while those with positive Hammett \u03c3 values are considered electron-withdrawing. See Lange's Handbook of Chemistry, 12th ed., McGraw Hill, 1979, Table 3-12, pp. 3-134 to 3-138, which lists Hammett \u03c3 values for a large number of commonly encountered substituents and is incorporated by reference herein.","It should be understood that the term \u201celectron-accepting group\u201d can be used synonymously herein with \u201celectron acceptor\u201d and \u201celectron-withdrawing group\u201d. In particular, an \u201celectron-withdrawing group\u201d (\u201cEWG\u201d) or an \u201celectron-accepting group\u201d or an \u201celectron-acceptor\u201d refers to a functional group that draws electrons to itself more than a hydrogen atom would if it occupied the same position in a molecule.

In particular, an \u201celectron-donating group\u201d or an \u201celectron-donor\u201d refers to a functional group that donates electrons to a neighboring atom more than a hydrogen atom would if it occupied the same position in a molecule. Examples of electron-donating groups include \u2014OH, \u2014OR, \u2014NH, \u2014NHR, \u2014N(R), and 5-14 membered electron-rich heteroaryl groups, where Ris a Calkyl group, a Calkenyl group, a Calkynyl group, a Caryl group, or a Ccycloalkyl group.","Various unsubstituted heteroaryl groups can be described as electron-rich (or \u03c0-excessive) or electron-poor (or \u03c0-deficient). Such classification is based on the average electron density on each ring atom as compared to that of a carbon atom in benzene. Examples of electron-rich systems include 5-membered heteroaryl groups having one heteroatom such as furan, pyrrole, and thiophene; and their benzofused counterparts such as benzofuran, benzopyrrole, and benzothiophene.

For example, the present compounds can have an Ebetween about \u22124.8 eV and about \u22127.0 eV.","As used herein, the highest occupied molecular orbital energy (Ein eV) of a compound is calculated from its oxidation potential (Ein V). Further, as used herein, the Eof a compound is determined by cyclic voltammetry. Specifically, cyclic voltammetry measurements are performed on thin films of the semiconducting compound deposited on a working electrode using a 2% (w\/w) toluene solution of the compound. All the measurements are carried out with a BAS-CV-50W voltammetric analyzer under a nitrogen atmosphere in a 0.1 M solution of tetra-n-butylammonium hexafluorophosphate in dry actonitrile as the supporting electrolyte. The supporting electrolyte solution is thoroughly purged with Nbefore the CV measurements. A platinum disk working electrode, a platinum wire counter electrode, and a silver wire reference electrode are employed and Fc\/Fc is used as the reference for such measurements. A scan rate of 50 mV\/S is used. The measured Evalue, and the corresponding Evalue, are further referenced based on the corresponding values of regioregular poly-3-hexylthiophene (rrP3HT). Specifically, the Eof a compound (e.g., a polymer) reported herein is determined using the following equation:\n\n(compound)=(3, based on , literature)\u2212(compound\u22123)\n\nFor example, the Eof rrP3HT is typically reported to be \u22124.9 eV, based on cyclic voltammetry measurements (see e.g., Osaka, I.; Zhang, R.; Sauve', G.; Smilgies, D.-M.; Kowalewski, T.; McCullogh, R. D. 2009, 131, 2521-29). Therefore, the equation above becomes:\n\n(compound)=\u22124.9 eV\u2212(polymer\u22123)\n\nUsing the setup described above, the Eof rrP3HT was determined to be +0.25 V vs. Fc\/Fc, and the Emeasured for polymer P2 was determined to be +0.34 V vs. Fc\/Fc. Therefore, E(P2)=\u22124.9\u2212(0.34\u22120.25)=\u22124.99 eV. Such a 0.1 eV lowering of Erelative to rrP3HT should be sufficient to improve the ambient stability of OFETs (see Ong, B. S.; Wu, Y.; Liu, P.; Gardner, S. 2004, 126, 3378-79).\n","In certain embodiments, oligomeric and polymeric compounds according to the present teachings can have one or more biheteroaryl units of the formula:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0145","num":"0210"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00057","num":"00057"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00057","he":"32.26mm","wi":"38.44mm","file":"US08927971-20150106-C00057.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0036","list-style":"none"},"li":"wherein X, X, X, X, and R are as defined herein."}},"In particular embodiments, oligomeric and polymeric compounds according to the present teachings can include H-H dialkoxy-substituted biheteroaryl units selected from:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0147","num":"0213"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00058","num":"00058"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00058","he":"119.13mm","wi":"43.01mm","file":"US08927971-20150106-C00058.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0037","list-style":"none"},"li":"where R is an n-Calkyl or haloalkyl group or a branched Calkyl or haloalkyl group"}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0148","num":"0215"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00059","num":"00059"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00059","he":"24.13mm","wi":"59.44mm","file":"US08927971-20150106-C00059.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0038","list-style":"none"},"li":"wherein R\u2032 and R\u2033, independently are an n-Calkyl or haloalkyl group."}},"In certain embodiments, oligomeric and polymeric compounds according to the present teachings can have one or more biheteroaryl units of the formula:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0150","num":"0218"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00060","num":"00060"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00060","he":"32.26mm","wi":"38.44mm","file":"US08927971-20150106-C00060.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0039","list-style":"none"},"li":"wherein X, X, X, X, and R are as defined herein."}},"In particular embodiments, oligomeric and polymeric compounds according to the present teachings can include H-H dialkyl-substituted biheteroaryl units selected from:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0152","num":"0221"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00061","num":"00061"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00061","he":"145.54mm","wi":"43.86mm","file":"US08927971-20150106-C00061.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0040","list-style":"none"},"li":"where R is an n-Calkyl or haloalkyl group or a branched Calkyl or haloalkyl group selected from"}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0153","num":"0223"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00062","num":"00062"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00062","he":"24.13mm","wi":"59.44mm","file":"US08927971-20150106-C00062.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0041","list-style":"none"},"li":"wherein R\u2032 and R\u2033, independently are an n-Calkyl or haloalkyl group."}},"In various embodiments, the present monomeric, oligomeric or polymeric compounds can include at least one other unit that is different from the biheteroaryl unit(s).
