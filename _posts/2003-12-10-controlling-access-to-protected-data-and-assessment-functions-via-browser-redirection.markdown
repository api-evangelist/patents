title: Controlling access to protected data and assessment functions via browser redirection
abstract: Enabling an organization to control user assignments and assessment results while enabling a proprietary provider to maintain control over both network distribution of proprietary content comprising the assignments and use of proprietary assessment functions that evaluate the user's performance of the assignments. A student uses a browser to submit a request to a learning management system (LMS) that includes a URL to a network node hosting the proprietary learning content and assessment functions. The LMS sends a hidden form to the browser, causing the browser to automatically redirect to the network node. The proprietary provider then controls distribution of the proprietary learning content to the browser and controls the student's interaction with the proprietary learning content to accomplish the assignment. When the student submits responses to the assignment, the proprietary provider performs proprietary assessment functions and redirects only results data to the LMS through the browser.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT","Preferred Embodiment"],"p":["The present invention generally relates to a method and system for controlling access to proprietary data from a browser and intermediary server, and more specifically, pertains to redirecting requests and responses to and from protected data sources via a client browser to provide indirect access to proprietary learning content through a learning management system controlling student progress and a proprietary content provider that furnishes the proprietary learning content and proprietary assessment functions.","Partnerships can often more effectively integrate and customize Web-based products and services. For example, organizations, such as retailers and schools, may create Web sites that provide access to a combination of products and services developed by the hosting organization and by selected third party suppliers. The combination of home-grown and third party products and services are often tailored to the interests of the hosting organization. Thus, a book retailer may offer its own book inventory through its Web site along with electronic products from a third party electronics retailer. Typically, this partnering is accomplished by either cross linking between one retailer's Web site and the other retailer's Web site, or arranging cross ordering of both sets of products through either retailer's Web site.","However, in some instances, one partner does not wish to openly offer its proprietary products or services through the other partner's Web site, and the other partner does not wish to enable its users to simply link to a separate, proprietary Web site. In these instances, one partner wishes to protect the proprietary aspects of its products or services, while the other partner wishes to manage its users by controlling access to, and data furnished by one or more selected proprietary providers. Nevertheless, the partners still wish to cooperate in some fashion.","A significant example of this dichotomy is a school partnering with a provider of proprietary learning content and assessment services. Schools increasingly want to provide school-provided learning content to their students through a Web site, but also wish to provide third party, proprietary learning content and testing services to their students through the same Web site to enable the school to manage student assignments and utilize standardized tests for evaluating student progress. For instance, many schools that provide education from kindergarten through 12grade (K-12) are gravitating towards proprietary, but standardized assessments that are provided by recognized experts in the educational assessment industry (e.g., Scantron, Princeton Review, Harcourt, etc.), rather than providing only school-developed assessments, such as traditional exams. These proprietary assessments are aligned to specific learning outcomes, and have been designed by psychometricians to accurately measure student performance against standards that are often mandated by an authority such as a state or federal government. Funding for a school is often directly tied to performance of its students on these types of assessments. Accordingly, schools are increasingly looking for complete assessment and accountability solutions that provide standardized and aligned assessments from a recognized assessment provider.","There are a limited number of recognized assessment providers involved in K-12 education that have sufficient credibility and name recognition to make a complete assessment and accountability solution acceptable for wide use. These specialized providers consider their grading algorithms and assessment items to be valuable intellectual property. They will not allow their assessment software and algorithms to be disclosed and used outside their control. However, these providers also recognize the increasing importance of electronic learning platforms in their marketplace, and desire a way for communicating with school Learning Management Systems (LMSs), while protecting the providers' proprietary information and intellectual property.","Conversely, schools want to maintain control over the learning platform and the reporting functionality regarding their own students. Currently, school LMSs do not enable a school to centrally manage assignments and testing results, while at the same time, enabling third party providers to maintain secure control over their proprietary content and testing services. Instead, content is either local to the LMS, or when hosted remotely by a proprietary provider, is presented through simple Web links or framed in a browser frameset or iframe.","Attempts have been made to develop standards to allow third party providers to communicate with an LMS both to get information about a student (e.g., a proprietary test assigned to the student by the LMS) and to return information to the LMS about the student's performance. A notable standard is the Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) from the Advanced Distributed Learning Initiative, sponsored by the U.S. Department of Defense (http:\/\/www.adlnet.org). The SCORM defines a Web-based learning \u201cContent Aggregation Model\u201d and \u201cRun-Time Environment\u201d (RTE) for learning objects that enable interoperability, accessibility, and reusability of Web-based learning content. However, the SCORM RTE does not allow for cross-domain communication between content and LMS. Thus, content using the SCORM RTE must be hosted on the same domain as the LMS itself. This requires proprietary providers to sacrifice the proprietary nature of their services. Similarly, another standard, known as the Instructional Management Systems (IMS) Question and Test Interoperability (QTI) specification from IMS Global Learning Consortium, Inc. (http:\/\/www.imsglobal.org), enables the interchange of assessment items between systems. However, again, because it is a standard, proprietary providers must modify and\/or divulge some of their proprietary techniques. For example, the proprietary providers may have to disclose some of their grading mechanisms, which they consider their proprietary information and part of their intellectual property. As a result, proprietary assessment providers resist these standards. Other results-reporting solutions such as direct server-to-server communication suffer from additional security-related issues. For example, if a school server is to be exposed via a Web Services application programming interface (API) to a content provider's server, it is often necessary to configure the school's proxy server specially for that content provider. This operation requires a school or district information technology (IT) department to do special configuration for each content provider. Clearly, a need exists for an alternative that will protect proprietary systems by allowing proprietary providers to host their own proprietary content and services, yet report results back to an LMS for customizing and managing student assignments and progress.","The present invention is directed to a method and system for enabling an organization such as a learning institution to control user assignments such as student learning assignments and assessment results while enabling a proprietary provider to maintain control over network distribution of proprietary content comprising the learning assignments and to maintain control over use of proprietary assessment functions that evaluate the student's performance of the assignments. More specifically, the method and system of the present invention enable indirect access to proprietary learning content such as text, graphics, audio, etc. as well as assessment functions over an electronic network. The indirect access is implemented with a browser through an intermediary LMS that redirects the browser to a network node hosting the proprietary learning content and assessment functions. The browser is provided with a link to the LMS rather than to the protected data. Upon activating the link, the LMS returns hidden information about the learning institution, the individual student, the assignment, and the proprietary provider to the browser. The LMS also returns a pointer to the proprietary learning content and assessment functions. The browser evaluates the pointer without the user's knowledge of the hidden information and automatically redirects the browser to the proprietary learning content and assessment functions. The proprietary provider then uses the hidden information to control distribution of the proprietary learning content to the browser and controls the student's interaction with the proprietary learning content to accomplish the assignment. When the student performs the assignment, information is submitted to the proprietary provider, which performs proprietary assessment functions and returns only results data to the LMS through the browser.","Preferably, the link to the LMS also includes a uniform resource locator (URL) identifying the location of the proprietary learning content so that the request from the browser to the LMS for the proprietary learning content identifies the location to which the LMS should redirect the browser. The LMS embeds the URL to the proprietary learning content into a message with the hidden information and sends the message to the browser, which automatically redirects to the URL of the proprietary learning content. The proprietary provider can then perform any of its own validation steps before transferring any of the proprietary learning content to the browser. Thus, an organization controlling the LMS can manage the student user's access to the proprietary learning content, yet the proprietary provider maintains control over distribution of the proprietary learning content to the browser. It appears to the student that the browser has direct access to the proprietary learning content.","The student can stop interacting with the proprietary learning content and return to the LMS by selecting a quit link comprising a URL to the LMS. Alternatively, the student can submit answers to questions asked in the proprietary learning content or submit other information to the proprietary provider. The proprietary provider applies its proprietary assessment functions or other functions to produce results data. The results data are preferably digitally signed and\/or encrypted, and are included in a hidden form that is communicated to the browser for automatic redirection to the LMS.","Another aspect of the invention is directed to a memory medium storing machine instructions that cause a processor to perform the steps described above and discussed in further detail below.","Computing Environment",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"With reference to , an exemplary system for implementing the present invention includes a general purpose computing device in the form of a conventional server computer , provided with a processing unit , a system memory , and a system bus . The system bus couples various system components including the system memory to processing unit  and may be any of several types of bus structures, including a memory bus or memory controller, a peripheral bus, and a local bus using any of a variety of bus architectures. The system memory includes read only memory (ROM)  and random access memory (RAM) . A basic input\/output system  (BIOS), containing the basic routines that helps to transfer information between elements within server computer , such as during start up, is stored in ROM . Server computer  further includes a hard disk drive  for reading from and writing to a hard disk, not shown, a magnetic disk drive  for reading from or writing to a removable magnetic disk , and an optical disc drive  for reading from or writing to a removable optical disc , such as a CDROM or other optical media Hard disk drive , magnetic disk drive , and optical disc drive  are connected to system bus  by a hard disk drive interface , a magnetic disk drive interface , and an optical disc drive interface , respectively. The drives and their associated computer readable media provide nonvolatile storage of computer readable machine instructions, data structures, program modules and other data for server computer . Although the exemplary environment described herein employs a hard disk, removable magnetic disk , and removable optical disc , it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that other types of computer readable media, which can store data that are accessible by a computer, such as magnetic cassettes, flash memory cards, digital video disks, Bernoulli cartridges, random access memories (RAMs), read only memories (ROM), and the like, may also be used in the exemplary operating environment.","A number of program modules may be stored on the hard disk, magnetic disk , optical disc , ROM  or RAM , including an operating system , one or more application programs , other program modules , and program data . A user may enter commands and information into server computer  through input devices such as a keyboard  and a pointing device . Other input devices (not shown) may include a microphone, joystick, game pad, satellite dish, scanner, or the like. These and other input devices are often connected to processing unit  through an input\/output (I\/O) interface  that is coupled to the system bus. The term I\/O interface is intended to encompass each interface specifically used for a serial port, a parallel port, a game port, a keyboard port, and\/or a universal serial bus (USB). A monitor  or other type of display device is also connected to system bus  via an appropriate interface, such as a video adapter . In addition to the monitor, server computers may be coupled to other peripheral output devices (not shown), such as speakers (through a sound card or other audio interface - not shown) and printers.","Server computer  may operate in a networked environment using logical connections to one or more remote computers, such as a remote computer . Remote computer  may be a personal computer (e.g., running a browser), another server, a router, a network personal computer, a peer device, or other common network node, and typically includes many or all of the elements described above in connection with server computer , although only an external memory storage device  has been illustrated in . The logical connections depicted in  include a local area network (LAN)  and a wide area network (WAN) . Such networking environments are common in offices, enterprise wide computer networks, intranets and the Internet.","When used in a LAN networking environment, server computer  is connected to LAN  through a network interface or adapter . When used in a WAN networking environment, server computer  typically includes a modem , or other means for establishing communications over WAN , such as the Internet. Modem , which may be internal or external, is connected to the system bus , or coupled to the bus via I\/O device interface , i.e., through a serial port. In a networked environment, program modules depicted relative to server computer , or portions thereof, may be stored in the remote memory storage device. It will be appreciated that the network connections shown are exemplary and other means of establishing a communications link between the computers may be used.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIGS. 3 and 10"],"b":["60","80","100","60","80","100","60","80","100","60","100","100","102","60","102","102","100","102","62","64","102","60","100"]},"LMS  also includes an LMS run-time module  that communicates with client browser  to enable a student to access and manage local and proprietary educational assignments through LMS . LMS run-time module  preferably authenticates a student user of client browser  via a conventional session key cookie . Those skilled in the art will recognize that session key authentication can alternatively be accomplished by a central communication module (not shown) that communicates with all other modules of LMS . LMS run-time module  also communicates with database  to obtain information about educational assignments available to and\/or assigned to a student. Information regarding a remote proprietary assignment is prepared and communicated by LMS run-time module  to client browser  as an assignment information page . Assignment information page  preferably includes a preview description and other information regarding the remote proprietary assignment and is rendered by client browser  to display the assignment preview information and a proprietary assignment link  that a user may select to initiate a request for the proprietary assignment from proprietary provider . Those skilled in the art will recognize that this data may be provided by the proprietary provider during the out of band setup process, or at runtime via an HTTP request (for example in a frameset or an iframe).","User selection of proprietary assignment link  causes client browser  to send a request to a redirect module  of LMS  for access to the proprietary assignment. Redirect module  preferably comprises an active server page and any application programming interfaces (APIs) needed to interact with other program modules and\/or databases. Redirect module  (or a central authentication module) can authenticate client browser  via session key cookie  before accessing database  for student identifiers and other information needed to obtain the proprietary assignment from proprietary provider .","With the information from database , redirect module  generates and outputs a hidden request form  to client browser . Hidden request form  includes a redirect script , such as a JavaScript function, an applet, or other conventional program module that can be executed by a browser. Upon rendering hidden request form , client browser  executes redirect script , which immediately causes client browser  to submit data from hidden request form  to a provider run-time module  of proprietary provider . This hidden redirection process enables a student user of LMS  to access proprietary assignments from proprietary provider  without having to separately access proprietary provider  and without requiring proprietary provider  to release proprietary data to LMS  for distribution to students.","Provider run-time module  preferably comprises one or more HTML pages, active server pages, APIs, databases, and any other program modules needed by proprietary provider  to manage interaction with client browser  while the student interacts with proprietary assignments. Provider run-time module  obtains the proprietary assignment data requested through hidden request form  and provides client browser  with one or more proprietary assignment pages . Proprietary assignment pages  comprise text, graphics, audio, and\/or other proprietary content. Proprietary assignment pages  can also comprise form elements that enable the student user to enter answers to questions or other responses to be assessed by proprietary provider . Client browser  renders proprietary assignment pages , at least one of which includes a submit link  or other submit user interface element such as a button. When the user has completed the proprietary assignment and selected submit link , client browser  submits the assignment data entered by the user to a proprietary results module . Proprietary results module  also comprises an active server page, APIs, databases, and other program modules used by proprietary provider  to perform its proprietary assessment functions. As illustrated, proprietary results module  is preferably operated under control of proprietary provider ; however, proprietary results module  could alternatively be operated under control of a separate system (not shown) that is associated with proprietary provider .","Based on the assignment data submitted by the student via proprietary assignment pages , proprietary results module  produces a hidden results form , which is communicated to client browser . In a manner similar to hidden request form , hidden results form  includes a redirect script that is executed by client browser  upon rendering hidden results form . Redirect script causes client browser  to immediately submit hidden results data to a submit module  under control of LMS . This process of redirecting hidden results data enables proprietary provider  to maintain control over proprietary techniques for analyzing and reporting the student's performance on proprietary tests included in the proprietary assignment pages. In this way, learning institutions can use their own LMS to manage student results from standardized proprietary tests without requiring control over the standardized proprietary tests.","Submit module  is preferably an active server page, but also includes APIs or other program modules needed to perform preliminary processing on results data. Submit module  may need to authenticate the user via session key cookie  prior to further processing of the hidden results. Once authenticated, submit module  communicates the hidden results to a turn-in API , which verifies the source of the hidden results and stores the results in database . Submit module  also produces a confirmation page  that is communicated to client browser  to inform the student that the results were accepted and stored. Confirmation page  can also include a detailed results link  that enables the student user to access detailed information from proprietary provider  regarding the student's performance on the test material in the proprietary assignment. Preferably, detailed results link  points to redirect module  or a similar redirection module under control of LMS  to redirect a hidden detailed results form (not shown) to proprietary provider  in a manner similar to that described above for hidden request form  and hidden results form . Further detail regarding the program modules, data, and relationships illustrated in  will become apparent from the description of logic flow and the examples provided below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":"110"},"At a step , a user registers with and logs into the LMS. Most of the discussion below is directed to the example of a student user who accesses proprietary assignments through the LMS with a client browser. However, the user can instead be a teacher who wishes to review the proprietary assignments before assigning the proprietary assignments to students, or to access other proprietary data that are not available to students. The user may instead be an educational administrator who wishes to access proprietary administrative data from the proprietary provider via a client browser and the LMS. Those skilled in the art will recognize that many other types of users may access protected data and\/or services through an intermediary server and a client browser. When a user registers with the LMS, the LMS may assign a student ID or other permanent identifier appropriate to that specific user. Additionally, when the user logs into the LMS, the LMS preferably downloads a session key to the client and sets a cookie for use in authenticating communications from the client. For a student user, the LMS also preferably downloads a student home page that provides an index of assignments that the student is expected to perform. This list of assignments can identify locally produced learning resources that are distributed and controlled entirely by the LMS. The list of assignments also may include one or more remote learning resources, which are proprietary assignments distributed and controlled by one or more proprietary providers. Each entry in the list of a local and remote assignments comprises a link to the corresponding local or remote assignment. When the user selects one of the listed remote assignments, the client browser sends to the LMS a request for an assignment information page, at a step .","At a step , the LMS run-time module accesses information about the selected remote proprietary assignment from the LMS database and generates an assignment information page with the description, directions, and other information about that proprietary assignment. Included in the assignment information page is a proprietary assignment link that comprises a URL pointing to the LMS redirect module. Further details regarding the assignment information page and proprietary assignment link are discussed below with regard to .","At a step  of , the user selects the proprietary assignment link, causing the client browser to request initiation of the LMS redirect module. The LMS redirect module obtains information about the student user from the LMS database and constructs a request form, at a step , which will redirect the client browser to the proprietary provider. Preferably, the request form comprises a hidden HTML form. As indicated above, the LMS redirect module includes a redirect script in the hidden request form that is executed by the client browser to perform the redirection operation. The LMS redirect module also includes in the hidden request form, the URL to the provider run-time module where the client browser can redirect the hidden request form. The LMS redirect module further includes in the hidden request form, a URL to the LMS submit module so that the proprietary provider knows where to send the results. The hidden request form preferably also includes identifiers such as the student's ID, the proprietary assignment access code, and other information that the proprietary provider may need. After constructing the hidden request form, the LMS redirect module sends the hidden request form to the client browser. Further details regarding step  are provided below with regard to .","At a step  of , the client browser renders the hidden request form, causing the browser to redirect the hidden request form data to the proprietary provider run-time module. At a step , the proprietary provider run-time module generates and returns one or more proprietary pages to the client browser. Interaction with the proprietary pages is then controlled by the proprietary provider. At least one of the proprietary pages also includes the submit link that points to the proprietary results module for generating and sending results back to the LMS. Further details regarding step  are provided below with regard to .","At a step  of , the student user reviews the proprietary pages and preferably performs the proprietary assignment by entering answers or other information through form elements of the proprietary pages. The student user then selects the submit link to submit the student's answers and other information to the proprietary results module. At a step , the proprietary provider applies its proprietary assessment techniques to generate results, such as a test score, statistical data, and\/or other proprietary data. The proprietary provider also constructs a results form including the results and another redirect script for causing the browser to redirect the results to the LMS. Preferably, the results form comprises a hidden HTML form. Accordingly, the hidden results form also includes the URL to the LMS submit module, which is the delivery destination for the proprietary results. The hidden results form also preferably includes the student ID and any other information needed by the LMS. Further details regarding step  are provided below with regard to .","At a step  of , the client browser receives and renders the hidden results form, thereby executing the redirect script that causes the client browser to submit the hidden results form data to the LMS submit module. At a step , the LMS submit module authenticates the client and relays the results to the turn-in API, which preferably verifies a digital signature applied to the results data by the proprietary provider, and stores the results in the LMS database. If the turn-in API executes properly, the LMS submit module sends a confirmation page to the client browser.

At a decision step , the LMS turn-in API determines whether the assignment associated with the submitted results data is currently in an unsubmitted state for the user that submitted the results data. If results data were previously submitted for the identified assignment, the LMS turn-in API processes an error at a step . Those skilled in the art will recognize that decision step  can be omitted or modified to allow for overwriting previously submitted results data. In this exemplary embodiment, if the assignment is in an unsubmitted state, the LMS turn-in API determines, at a decision step , whether the results are associated with a remote proprietary provider. For example, the LMS turn-in API can check for a proprietary provider ID submitted with the results data. If the results data did not come from a remote proprietary provider, the LMS turn-in API processes an error at step . Results from locally produced assignments are processed by separate program modules rather than the modules described herein.","However, for results data submitted from a remote proprietary provider, the LMS turn-in API determines, at a decision step , whether the results data were digitally signed. If the results data were not digitally signed, the LMS turn-in API can optionally issue a warning, process an error, or perform another operation at a step . Preferably, if the results data were not digitally signed, the LMS turn-in API simply passes the results data to the LMS database. However, if the results data were digitally signed, the LMS turn-in API validates the results data, at a step , using the proprietary provider's public key. At a decision step , the LMS turn-in API determines whether the digital signature was valid. If the digital signature was not valid, the LMS turn-in API processes an error at step . Alternatively, if the digital signature was valid, or if there was no digital signature, the LMS turn-in API stores the results data in the LMS database, at a step . Those skilled in the art will recognize that the turn-in API (or the submit module) could alternatively, or additionally, decrypt the results data and perform a check sum or other validation step before allowing the results data to be stored.","To better understand the above processes, several screen shots are now discussed.  is a screen shot of an exemplary assignment information page  that the browser displays to a student user providing preliminary information about a remote proprietary assignment. Assignment information page  illustrates that the LMS run-time module provides data from both the LMS and the proprietary provider. For example, identifiers  include the student's name provided from the LMS and the assignment name, provided from the proprietary provider. Similarly, logistics data  include scoring information that is obtained from the proprietary provider and also includes scheduling information that is assigned by the student's teacher through the LMS. A status box  indicates the status of the proprietary assignment relative to the individual student tracked by the LMS. A proprietary assignment link  enables the student user to initiate the redirection process through the LMS redirect module to the proprietary provider run-time module.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0062"},"figref":"FIG. 11","b":["220","220","222","224","220","225","220","226","228"]},"Although the present invention has been described in connection with the preferred form of practicing it and modifications thereto, those of ordinary skill in the art will understand that many other modifications can be made to the present invention within the scope of the claims that follow.
