{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60\/460,944, filed Apr. 7, 2003.","The present invention relates to furniture, and more specifically to a lectern for use in auditoriums and other speaking venues.","A speaking venue is often provided with a lectern or podium, in order to provide a surface for any papers or notes used by the speaker as well as to provide a structure to support a microphone and to house voice amplification components and\/or controls. Prior art lecterns or podiums are normally constructed of a base supported on a floor or other supporting surface, a frame or column extending upwardly from the base, and a support member disposed on an upper end of the column opposite the base. The speaker is able to rest or lean against the support member while speaking, and may also place any notes or papers on an upwardly facing support surface defined by the support member.","Prior art lecterns are typically constructed such that the support surface is fixed at a specific height without being adjustable to accommodate speakers of differing stature. Also, prior art lecterns have significant shortcomings when the speaker uses an electronic device such as a computer for assistance in a speech or presentation. While prior art lecterns are able to support the device on the surface, such lecterns have no provisions for accommodating wires or cables associated with the device, which results in such wires or cables trailing off of the surface and down the sides or back of the lectern.","Therefore, it is desirable to develop a lectern that is adjustable in height to adapt to the height of a particular speaker using the lectern. It is also desirable to develop a lectern that facilitates use of a device, such as a computer, by the speaker. Furthermore, it is desirable to develop a lectern that includes the capability to transmit data from a device, such as a computer, to one or more various display devices connected to the lectern in order to more easily display data or information to the audience.","To address these shortcomings of the prior art, the present invention provides a lectern including a base, an adjustable, upright column connected to the base, and a support member connected to the column opposite the base that includes integral connections for providing power and communication capabilities to a device, such as a computer, that is used by the speaker.","The column of the lectern includes a vertical adjustment mechanism that enables the support member to be moved vertically in order to accommodate speakers of varying heights. The vertical adjustment mechanism can be automatically actuated by a control system that is disposed on the support member for easy actuation by the individual utilizing the lectern, to adjust the height of the column as necessary.","A support surface is formed as an upper part of the support member and includes a recess which is adapted to receive an electronic device, such as a touch screen electronic monitor or a laptop computer, which can be operably connected to the lectern. The lectern also includes a well associated with the support surface, which is preferably located toward the front of the support surface. The well is adapted to receive and store cords, communication cables or the like associated with the electronic device placed within the recess, to facilitate connection to the lectern and to enable transmission of power and data to and from the lectern, or to an ancillary display device.","The support member also includes an opening or cavity below the upper support surface. A keyboard tray is slidably positioned within the opening or cavity, such that a keyboard positioned on the tray can be selectively exposed from within the support member. When an electronic device is connected to the lectern, the keyboard is also connected to the device to enable an individual to manually key information into the touch screen or laptop computer for display on the ancillary display device that is connected to the lectern or otherwise interconnected with the electronic device.","Other additional features, alternatives and embodiments of the present invention will be made apparent from the following detailed description taken together with the drawings.","Referring to the drawing figures in which like reference numerals designate like parts throughout the disclosure, a lectern constructed according to the present invention is indicated generally at . The lectern  includes a generally U-shaped base  having high-friction, surface-engaging feet  that contact or rest on a support surface S on which the lectern  is positioned, an upright support column  connected to the base  and extending upwardly therefrom, and a support member  attached to the support column  opposite the base plate .","As shown in ,  and , the upper ends of inner legs  are connected to the support member . The support member  is formed of a head shroud  that includes an interior I defined by a bottom wall  connected to the inner legs , a convex front wall , a concave rear wall , and a sloped upper support wall  joining the concave rear wall  with the convex front wall . The bottom wall  includes an opening  positioned forwardly of the inner legs  that receives one end of a front shroud  forming a part of column . The front shroud  extends into interior I of head shroud  from the opening  of the base plate , and is secured to the outer legs  to provide a seamless appearance to the front of the column . Opposite the front shroud , the column  also includes a rear shroud  including an upper portion  and a lower portion . The lower portion  extends upwardly from the base plate  and is attached to the outer legs  opposite the front shroud , while the upper portion  extends downwardly from the bottom wall  of the head shroud  and moves along with the head shroud .","Referring to , an extendible and retractable assembly, such as a screw-type linear actuator , is located in the column  between the front shroud  and rear shroud  in order to enable the support member  to move vertically with respect to the base plate . The linear actuator  includes a lower tube  connected to the cross member  and extending upwardly therefrom. Linear actuator  further includes a lead screw  that is engaged with a lead nut  mounted to the upper end of lower tube . An actuator in the form of a motor-operated drive  is mounted to lower wall  in the interior of head shroud . Drive  includes a motor  that provides input power to a gear head , which in turn is engaged with the upper end of lead screw . With this arrangement, gear head  imparts rotation to lead screw  in response to operation of motor . Such rotation of lead screw  causes head shroud support member  to be moved vertically upwardly or downwardly relative to support column  according to user requirements, depending on the direction of rotation of lead screw . While the motor  is shown and described as being directly interconnected with lead screw  through gear head , it is also understood that any other satisfactory drive arrangement may be employed, such as a chain and sprocket arrangement, a belt drive or a gear drive arrangement. It is also understood that any other satisfactory type of lifting and lowering arrangement may be employed in place of linear actuator , e.g. a pneumatic or hydraulic cylinder arrangement or the like.","During vertical adjustment of support member  as described, support member  moves upwardly and downwardly relative to front shroud , the upper end of which is received within interior I of head shroud . In this manner the seamless, aesthetically pleasing appearance provided by the front shroud  is maintained when the support member  moves upwardly, by the length of the front shroud  that extends through the opening  into the interior I of the head shroud  and is exposed when the support member  moves upwardly. Furthermore, the rear shroud  also maintains complete coverage of the rear of the column  because the upper portion  of the rear shroud  moves upwardly and downwardly along with the support member  with respect to the lower portion  in a telescoping manner, in order to maintain the generally continuous appearance of the rear shroud .","In order to supply power from the lectern  to an area adjacent support member , the upper portion  of the rear shroud  includes an opening  in which is disposed a power brick  including a pair of electric power outlets . The power brick  and outlets  move in conjunction with the upper portion  of the rear shroud  during adjustment in the height of support member  as described above, in order to maintain the distance between the outlets  and the support member  if the cords from devices positioned on the support member  are connected to the outlets . Outlets  are adapted to supply power to any ancillary equipment that may be employed by the user of lectern , such as a projector or the like.","In order to further accommodate an individual using the lectern , the support member  also includes a pair of pivotable retractable supports, in the form of drink holders  secured to the support member . Each drink holder  is pivotally connected to the bottom wall  of the head shroud  opposite the front wall , and includes a recess  in which a cup or other beverage container may be positioned. The recess  can be formed as a wire cage, shown at , which extends through and downwardly from the drink holder , or may be simply a depression in the upper surface of drink holder  or an opening formed in the drink holder . While the pivoting retractable supports are described as drink holders, it is understood that a support that simply includes a depression, as opposed to an opening, may be used not only to support a beverage container but also any other items such as a user's keys, change, laser pointer, etc.","The support member  also includes a keyboard support assembly  disposed within the interior I of support member . The keyboard support assembly  includes a pair of tracks  disposed on either side of head shroud interior I. An elongate opening  is formed in the rear wall  of the head shroud , and is in communication with head shroud interior I. The tracks  slidably receive a keyboard support tray  therein, which can be moved into and out of the head shroud interior I through slot  in the rear wall , between a retracted position as shown in solid lines in  and an extended position as shown in phantom in . The support tray  is configured to support a keyboard K, which can be connected to an electronic device positioned on the upper wall  of the support member . In the retracted position, the support tray  is located within the interior I of head shroud . Preferably, the support tray  is configured such that the rear edge of support tray  and the rear portion of keyboard K are exposed, to provide a visual cue to the user and also to provide easy access to support tray  and keyboard K. In the extended position, the support tray  is moved outwardly so that keyboard K is accessible to a user of lectern . In this manner, the user is able to input information directly to the electronic device, such as a laptop or notebook computer, that is utilized with the lectern , in order to enable the user to manipulate data or programs used in connection with a presentation, or to access the internet or a local are network, or to accomplish any other task normally associated with a computer or other similar type of electronic device. Typically, keyboard K is interconnected with a presentation controller, commonly available under the designation CRESTRON\u00ae, which controls all aspects of a presentation environment, e.g. lights, projectors, projection screens, room temperature, remote cameras, etc. In the event keyboard K is not required, the user is able to move support tray  to the retracted position, so that support tray  does not interfere with use of lectern . Support tray  may also be configured to include a mouse pad that can be positioned to either side of the keyboard K, to accommodate a computer mouse in a position that is convenient for a user.","In the event a keyboard is not used or desired, tray  and tracks  are eliminated and slot  in the rear wall  of shroud  is enclosed by a snap-in cover.","In order to effectively collect and conceal the wires (not shown) utilized to connect the various parts of the lectern  with the electronic device or devices positioned on the lectern , the support member  also includes a well  () located below the upper wall  of the head shroud  adjacent the front wall . The well  extends downwardly within the head shroud  to the bottom wall , and an opening  is formed in upper wall  to provide access to well . The well  is enclosed by a cover  pivotally secured to the upper wall  that is biased to an open position and can be maintained in a closed position by a magnetic latch  releasably engageable with the cover . Cover  is configured to enclose the majority of the area of opening , and defines a rear edge spaced from the front edge of opening  so as to form an open slot the provides access to well . With this construction, wires or cables from devices supported on support member  pass through the open slot defined by cover  into well . A partition wall  is located in head shroud interior I, and cooperates with front wall  of head shroud  to define well .","A power brick  is located in well , and includes power receptacles for connection electronic devices supported on support member . Well  also may include one end of a data cable that is routed from base  through column , and which is interconnected with a LAN or other network. The user can then pull the data cable out of well  and connect it to the user's computer or other electronic device, for interconnection with a network.","Immediately adjacent the well , the support member  further includes a microphone  and a light  mounted to upper wall . The microphone  is operably connected to a conventional amplification system (not shown) and includes a base  connected to the upper wall  and a flexible stem  which enables a user of the lectern  to position the microphone  where desired. Similarly, the light  includes a base  connected to the upper wall  and a flexible stem  that allows the light to be positioned in a manner similar to the microphone .","As shown in , the support member  also includes a recess  disposed on the upper wall  between the front wall  and rear wall . In the illustrated embodiment, recess  is formed by a pan member  that is secured within an opening formed in upper wall , e.g. by means of a peripheral flange secured to a peripheral lip defined by upper wall , although it is understood that any other satisfactory construction and mounting arrangement may be employed. Recess  is dimensioned to receive an electronic device, such as a control panel or flat screen monitor  (, ), which is positioned within recess  such that the surface of monitor  is flush with the upper wall  of support member . Alternatively, recess  may be used to receive a laptop or notebook computer, and is configured such that the flip-up screen of the computer may be opened when the computer is positioned within recess . The monitor  or the user's computer can also be connected to the power brick  disposed within the well , in order to receive power from the lectern  and to provide an interface with a network or the internet. Power brick  also provides an interface between the user's computer or a network with a display device (not shown), such as a projector or the like. In situations where a laptop or notebook computer is positioned within the recess , the connections between the computer and the power brick  can be easily made and disconnected in order to allow the computer to be quickly and easily positioned within and removed from the recess  as necessary.","Alternatively, as shown in , recess  may be closed by a top panel  that provides an upper surface adapted to support a user's laptop or notebook computer.","Monitor  may be a touchscreen-type monitor used to control presentation technology. In addition, monitor  may be interconnected with a control arrangement for the room environment in order to control room lighting, sound, temperature, etc.","The support member  also includes a pair of slidable panels  connected to opposite sides of the upper support wall . The panels  are slidably received within a transverse recess in the upper surface of upper support wall , which overlies recess  formed by pan member . The transverse recess is defined by a parallel beveled front and rear edges , , respectively, which extend throughout the width of upper wall . Panels  have beveled front and rear edges that are configured so as to be complementary with beveled front and rear edges , , respectively, of upper wall . With this construction, panels  are captured within the recess in upper wall , and are capable of sliding movement relative to upper wall  between a closed position as shown in , and an open position as shown in . Each panel  has a support ledge  that extends upwardly from its upper surface, for use in supporting papers or the like that rest on the panel upper surface. Each support ledge  includes an engagement section  at its inner end, which is shaped to facilitate engagement by a user's fingers to slide panels  between the closed and open positions. In this manner, the user can quickly and easily move panels  between the closed and open positions, to selectively cover and uncover the recess . When the recess  is covered, the panels  form a continuous supporting surface for the support member . When panels  are moved apart to expose the recess , the panels  provide a supporting surface on either side of the recess  for the user's notes or other papers, while providing access to the monitor  or computer positioned within recess . In addition, the user may position a laptop or notebook computer on one of panels  when panels  are in the open position, as shown in , which enables a user to take advantage of the computer as well as monitor . It can thus be appreciated that support member  can be selectively configured to provide a conventional lectern arrangement in which panels  are closed to support notes or other papers, or to provide a combination configuration in which the user is able to utilize a computer and\/or monitor  while still providing surface area for notes or other papers. This is not possible with conventional lecterns, wherein placement of a computer on the supporting surface of the lectern takes up substantially the entire supporting surface and does not leave space for notes or other papers.","In order to supply power to the lectern  for the various components of the lectern  including power brick , power brick , linear actuator motor , microphone  and light , lectern  includes an electric cord  that is provides power to a box  () located adjacent base  between front shroud  and lower section  of rear shroud . Appropriate electrical wiring extends from box  to the various powered components of lectern , and is concealed within support column  and support member . In addition, lectern  facilitates a data cable to provide communication capability, as well as to interconnect lectern  with the environmental controls for the room within which lectern  is contained. Alternatively, it is contemplated that lectern  may communicate data signals using an appropriate wireless network, in a manner as is known.","It should be understood that the various features of lectern  may be used separately from each other or in various subcombinations, and each such feature or subcombination provides advantages in construction and operation over a conventional lectern.","Various alternatives are contemplated as being within the scope of the following claims particularly pointing out and distinctly claiming the subject matter regarded as the invention."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The drawings illustrate the best mode currently contemplated of practicing the present invention.","In the drawings:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 2"],"b":["9","9"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
