No. 60\/373,742, filed Apr. 17, 2002, the contents of which are incorporated by reference herein.","The present document is related to the copending and commonly assigned patent application document entitled \u201cLow-Noise, Switchable RF-Lightwave Synthesizer,\u201d Ser. No. 60\/373,739. The contents of this related application is hereby incorporated by reference herein.","This invention was made with government support under Contract No. N6601-99-C-8635. The government has certain rights in this invention.","The present invention relates to the generation of microwave signals. More specifically, this invention relates to an integrated optical circuit that enables the stable injection locking of two distributed feedback (DFB) diode lasers, whose outputs can be converted into microwave signals.","Frequency synthesis is used to generate 'signals at one or more precise frequencies. These signals may then be used to perform frequency conversion in radio frequency (RF) sensor and communication systems. Frequency synthesis may be provided by several different methods. Of concern in frequency synthesis, are the phase, frequency and amplitude stability of the generated signal. Since the generated signal may be used as a local oscillator signal for frequency up-conversion or down-conversion, instability in the signal results in decreased signal-to-noise performance.","One method of frequency synthesis involves the generation of a multiple tone lightwave signal that can be converted into a RF carrier or local oscillator signal. In this method, optical heterodyning is used to create a sum or difference beat frequency from two optical wavelength tones. The sum or difference beat frequency is detected by a photodetector or similar apparatus to generate an RF carrier or local oscillator signal. However, the stability of the beat frequency signal is limited by the relative stability of each of the optical wavelength tones.","In, R. Logan, R. D. Li, Final Technical Report for DARPA Program, \u201cRadio Frequency Photonic Synthesizer\u201d an optical heterodyning circuit, shown in , is disclosed. This circuit contains a mode locked laser , two DFB lasers , , an optical splitter , two optical circulators , , an optical combiner , two photodetectors ,  connected to power-control feedback circuits , , and two Mach-Zender modulators , . The components of this optical circuit are interconnected using optical fiber. As the figure shows, the optical comb generated by a master laser (which in this case is a mode-locked laser) is split by a power splitter  and then is sent, via optical fibers, to injection-lock a pair of slave lasers, DFB-laser- and DFB-laser-. Each of these slave lasers would become injection-locked to a line of the optical comb if the spacing or detuning between the free-running laser's lasing wavelength and that line of the optical comb is less than the laser's lock-bandwidth, a wavelength range determined by the injected power P. In particular, temperature tuning (\u02dc0.1 nm\/\u00b0 C.) was used to change the slave lasers lasing wavelengths, so that they were tuned to within the injection-locking bandwidth of two selected lines in the incident optical comb. In between the master and slave lasers, a pair of Mach-Zender modulators ,  is used as variable attenuators to provide a way to adjust the injected optical power P. The optical outputs from the Mach-Zender modulators ,  are fed to port  of two optical circulators , . The optical signals from the two slave lasers ,  are used for heterodyning and are obtained through port  of those optical circulators , . The slave laser outputs from port  of the two circulators ,  are subsequently combined by combiner  and then sent to a photodetector (PD) for heterodyning.","As shown in , the photonic components (optical isolators, Mach-Zender modulators for controlling injected optical power, optical circulators, and optical combiner) used to generate the optical outputs were all fiber-pigtailed\/connectorized. Such use of optical fiber to interconnect multiple discrete components results in sensitivity to environmental disturbances such as mechanical or temperature perturbations, which ultimately cause reduced phase stability. In particular, the use of optical fiber links to interconnect the various components of  makes it difficult to keep the optical path lengths of arms I and II equal or balanced over the long term. Since the length of a section of optical fiber typically can be cleaved to an accuracy of only several millimeters, it is difficult to control and balance the overall path lengths of arms I and II to an accuracy of better than 1-2 cm. Also, because the fibers were not co-located physically, environmental perturbations (such as temperature or mechanical disturbances) could cause differential phase fluctuations between the optical inputs to the slave lasers. Theoretically, the phase noise (\u03b4\u03c6and \u03b4\u03c6, |i\u2212k|=n) of the ith and kth lines in the optical comb generated by a mode-locked laser are given by:\n\n\u03b4\u03c6=(\u03b4\u03c6)\u2003\u2003(1)\n\n\u03b4\u03c6=(\u03b4\u03c6)\u2003\u2003(2)\n","In equation 1 and 2 (\u03b4\u03c6)and \u03b4\u03c6are, respectively, the phase fluctuations in the mode-locked laser and the RF-source driving the mode-locked laser. For a high-quality RF source and for lines in the optical comb that correspond to higher order modes of the mode-locked laser, the magnitude of \u03b4\u03c6is much larger than \u03b4\u03c6. The phase noise of the microwave signal (f=nf) generated via optical heterodyning of diodes  and  is then given by;\n\n","Optical heterodyning of the optical outputs of two separate lasers to produce an electronic signal is a technique well known in the art. However, one of the major problems with optical heterodyning, which this invention solves, is the phase drift associated with the optical signals used in and produced for the heterodyning process. This phase drift results in a degradation of the phase and amplitude noise associated with the heterodyned signal.","The present invention provides an integrated optical circuit that enables the stable injection locking of a first and second slave laser to lines in an optical comb generated from a master laser, whose lasing lines are locked in phase. An optical comb is comprised of a series of optical lines, where each of the lines is at a different frequency. By injection-locking the first and second slave lasers to two different lines in the optical comb, and then heterodyning the slave lasers' outputs, one can synthesize microwave signals (f) over a wide frequency range.","For example, if the master laser is a mode-locked fiber laser, one can synthesize frequencies that range from a minimum frequency equal to the mode-locking frequency of f=f, to a maximum frequency of f\u02dc100 GHz. Specifically, the upper frequency limit of fis determined by the spectral width of the mode-locked optical pulses. For this example, the theoretically predicted phase noise (at f) that one can accomplish using the present invention is the sum of:\n\n","One advantage of the present invention over the prior art lies in the exploitation of integrated optics for the interconnection of the photonic components. Specifically, the splitters, directional couplers, and waveguides of the present invention are all integrated on a common substrate and located close to each other. As mentioned earlier, the theoretically predicted phase noise is the sum of the phase noise due to the RF-oscillator and the phase noise incurred by the injection locking process. As a result, by integrating the components, environmental disturbances such as mechanical vibrations and temperature changes which cause degradations to the amplitude stability and phase noise of the synthesized RF-signal are common to all components, which helps reduce the phase and amplitude instability. Also, because the waveguides to\/from the slave lasers are formed on a common substrate and in proximity to each other, the relative phase-drifts between the above components is reduced. Therefore, we can expect long term differential phase stability in the optical injection inputs supplied to the first and second slave lasers. In addition, the two optical signals (the slave laser outputs) to be heterodyned are combined in a common waveguide inside the integrated optical chip. The prior art combines the optical signals using discrete components interconnected by optical fiber, which decreases phase stability.","It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an integrated optical circuit. The integrated optical circuit is formed on a single substrate, receives an optical comb preferably generated from a mode-locked master laser, and transfers the optical comb to a first and a second slave laser, using a first and a second waveguide path, and a plurality of optical couplers. The first and second slave lasers produce first and second laser outputs which are coupled to an optical coupler using the first and second waveguide paths. The optical coupler combines the first laser output and the second laser output creating at least one combined optical output. The combined optical output is then preferably sent to a primary or secondary output port where the combined optical output can be used for heterodyning.","It is also an object of this invention to use optical couplers instead of Mach-Zender modulators and optical circulators. The optical couplers are preferably 2\u00d72directional couplers. The use of directional couplers, which have 4 inputs\/outputs, provides the integrated optical circuit of this invention with monitoring and control output ports located on the substrate that can be used to monitor chosen characteristics and to implement external control circuits which enhance the performance of the integrated optical circuit.","The directional couplers of this invention as aforementioned, are preferably 2\u00d72 directional couplers, but other optical couplers such as X-junction couplers, or multimode interference couplers could be used as well. The 2\u00d72 directional couplers have two ports on each side of the directional coupler, which can be used as either an input or an output for light. Furthermore each port is not bound to remain as an input or an output permanently. Each port has the ability to function as both an input and an output, depending on whether light is entering or exiting the port. If light enters the port, it is acting as an input, and when light exits the same port, the port is acting as an output. In this way, a 2\u00d72 directional coupler has 4 inputs and 4 outputs, or any combination thereof. A 2\u00d72 directional coupler is well known in the art. However, bi-directional coupler use of a 2\u00d72 directional coupler in which a given port is used as both an input and an output is not a matter of normal routine.","It is also an object of the present invention to provide optical waveguides having substantially shortened lengths. One problem associated with optical heterodyning, which this invention solves, is that as the length of the optical path increases, the phase stability decreases. The prior art as mentioned earlier, uses components that are pigtailed and connected with lengths of optical fiber. It is very likely that when implementing the prior art circuit, it will have lengths of optical-fiber paths that are on the order of meters to 10s of meters long. This is a problem because as mentioned earlier, when the optical path length increases the phase stability decreases. By integrating the components on an integrated optical circuit, it is possible to reduce the optical path length to a length in the range of 6-20 centimeters. This difference in optical path lengths using discrete components and integrating the components is roughly a factor of 100. In addition, it is difficult to integrate all of the components of the prior art circuit on a common substrate. The optical circulators of the prior art are generally bulky items and are especially difficult to integrate.","It is also an object of this invention to provide optical waveguides having substantially equal lengths. This is one advantage of using the present invention over the prior art. In the present invention the integrated optical circuit is created using photolithography techniques, which achieve sub-micron accuracy, to ensure that the two optical paths which carry the two optical signals to be heterodyned are of substantially equal lengths. Also, the components of the integrated optical circuit are completely symmetrical about an axis on that circuit. By creating symmetrical waveguide paths with substantially equal lengths on a common substrate, the phase instability is greatly reduced.","It is also a further object of this invention to provide additional output ports for monitoring and adjusting performance characteristics of the integrated optical circuit. As aforementioned, one advantage to using 2\u00d72 directional couplers is that the directional couplers provide additional output ports. External devices may be connected to these additional output ports, which can monitor and control different characteristics of the integrated optical circuit. One device that may be connected is the a Fabry-Perot etalon, and another is a fixed Fabry-Perot etalon. The Fabry-Perot etalon can be used to monitor the slave lasers' lasing wavelengths and compare them to the desired wavelengths in the optical comb. One or more Fabry-Perot etalons can be connected to a processor that can adjust the slave lasers so that they lase at the desired wavelengths, approximately aligned with the selected wavelengths in the optical comb.","It is also a further object of this invention to provide an integrated optoelectronic module for generation of optical signals for heterodyning to synthesize microwave signals. This integrated optoelectronic module comprises the integrated optical circuit hybrid integrated with one or more injection-power control feedback circuits. The feedback circuit is coupled to one or more of the output ports of the integrated optical circuit. The feedback circuit contains one or more photodetectors that measure the intensity of the optical comb and\/or the slave laser output. By monitoring the photocurrents, the feedback circuit can adjust the power level of the optical-comb light that is injected into a slave laser as well as the relative optical-power levels of the two slave-laser outputs as they are combined for heterodyning.","It is also a further object of this invention to provide heterodyne and homodyne phase lock loops for monitoring and adjusting the integrated optical circuit. The heterodyne and homodyne phase lock loops are coupled to the output ports of the integrated optical circuit. The heterodyne phase lock loop is used to ensure that the beat frequency of the slave lasers is kept constant. If the beat frequency changes, the heterodyne phase lock loop provides a feedback system that can adjust one of the slave lasers and regain the desired beat frequency. A homodyne phase lock loop is used to adjust the lasing wavelength of the other slave laser to match a selected line in the optical comb. If the lasing wavelength of that slave laser changes, the homodyne phase lock loop provides feedback that readjusts that slave laser to lase at the desired wavelength in the optical comb. Furthermore, by using homodyne and heterodyne phase lock loops with an integrated optical circuit, loop bandwidths on the order of 10s of KiloHertz can be achieved. In contrast, homodyne and heterodyne phase lock loops comprising discrete components connected by optical fiber only achieve loop bandwidths on the order of 100s of Hertz.","In summary, the integrated optical circuit of this invention, which has optical waveguides, a splitter and directional couplers formed on the same chip, allows us to:\n\n","As a result, synthesized signals will have increased phase and amplitude stability.","The present invention will now be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which preferred embodiments of the invention are shown. This invention may be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein.","An apparatus for generating a microwave signal by optical heterodyning that has improved phase and amplitude stability according to a first embodiment of the present invention is described with reference to , , and , blocks -. This apparatus comprises an integrated optical circuit, illustrated in . Use of the integrated optical circuit to form a photonic synthesizer of microwave signals is illustrated in . In this apparatus, an integrated optical circuit  couples optical energy from a master laser  to a first and second slave laser , . The integrated optical circuit  contains two ports ,  at which the first and second slave lasers ,  are butt coupled to the integrated optical circuit . The first and the second slave laser ,  each receive the optical energy.","The first slave laser  produces a first laser output based on the physical characteristics of the first slave laser  and the received optical energy. The second slave laser  produces a second laser output based on the physical characteristics of the second slave laser  and the received optical energy. The first and second laser outputs are then combined in a directional coupler  creating a primary and a secondary combined laser output. The primary combined laser output is sent to at least one primary output port  where the primary combined laser output can be used for heterodyning. The secondary combined laser output is preferably also sent to one or more secondary output ports  on the integrated optical circuit , where the secondary combined laser output can be used for monitoring or feedback control.","The components of the integrated optical circuit  consist of an optical splitter , preferably a 1:2 optical splitter, a first directional coupler , a second directional coupler , a combining directional coupler , and lengths of optical waveguide that interconnect those components with each other and with input\/output ports of the integrated optical circuit . First and second directional couplers ,  and the combining directional coupler  each have two sides with two ports on each side. The directional couplers can conduct light from the master laser  to the first and second slave laser , , hereinafter referred to as the forward direction, as well as from the first and second slave laser ,  to the primary output port  and the secondary output port , hereinafter referred to as the reverse direction. A directional coupler is a well-known device in the art. It can be adjusted electrically to split the light from either one of its inputs into its outputs according to a selected ratio. It is preferred to have the powers of the first and second laser outputs be equal as they are combined and delivered to the primary output port  for more efficient heterodyning. This can be accomplished by adjusting the first and second directional coupler ,  and the combining directional coupler . First and second directional coupler ,  also can be adjusted to achieve the desired optical powers Pof the optical comb injected into first and second slave lasers , , respectively. The integrated optical circuit  is preferably constructed from a GaAs, LiNbO, InP, or Si substrate. For this invention, we prefer to use 2\u00d72 directional couplers for the first, second, and combining directional couplers , , .","The components of the apparatus are connected by a first waveguide path , and a second waveguide path . The first waveguide path  is formed between one of the two outputs of optical splitter , the first directional coupler , and the first slave laser . The first waveguide path  also includes the lengths of optical waveguide that interconnect the combining directional coupler , and the first slave laser . A second waveguide path  is formed between the other of the two outputs of optical splitter , the second directional coupler , and the second slave laser . The second waveguide path  also includes the lengths of optical waveguide that interconnect the combining directional coupler , and the second slave laser .","The master laser  of the apparatus  is preferably a mode-locked laser. The optical energy generated by the master laser  is preferably an optical comb, which is a series of optical lines at different frequencies. The spacing between the lines is determined by a RF oscillator  (shown in ), which drives the master laser . The output of the master laser  is sent through an optical isolator  to prevent reflected power from destabilizing the optical comb.","The first and second slave laser ,  of the apparatus are preferably distributed feedback (DFB) lasers. The first and second slave laser ,  are preferably each tuned to a different optical line of the optical comb. By tuning the first and second slave laser ,  to different optical lines, they produce a first and second laser output, which when combined, can then be used to generate a microwave signal by optical heterodyning.","For the embodiments of this invention, described in , the optical splitters, waveguides and directional couplers formed on integrated optical circuit  are preferably manufactured using photolithography, which has sub-micron accuracy. This ensures that the first and second waveguide paths ,  are of substantially equal lengths. Also, the components of the integrated optical circuit  are preferably laid out in a symmetrical fashion, with the axis of symmetry shown by the dashed line in FIGS. , , , and . This is another technique to help ensure that the first and second waveguide paths ,  are of equal length.","The transverse spacing between any two sets of directional couplers, for example the first and second directional coupler ,  of the integrated optical circuit , that are placed in parallel can be as small as approximately 0.05-0.10 mm and still ensure that those directional couplers do not interact with each other, except through their inputs and outputs. Thus, the maximum separation between the first and second waveguide paths ,  of the embodiment shown in and can be as small as 0.2 mm. Similarly, the maximum transverse separation between the first and second waveguide paths ,  of the embodiments shown in , and can be as small as 0.4 mm, but is generally less than 10 mm. This close proximity of the first and second waveguide paths ,  ensures that they see the same environment, which results in improved phase stability.","Referring now to , blocks -, the path of the optical comb and the first and second optical output can be followed throughout the apparatus shown in . The optical comb generated by the master laser  (See block ) first goes through an optical isolator  (See block ) to prevent power from being reflected. The optical comb enters the integrated optical circuit  at an input port  to a center waveguide  (See block ). After entering the integrated optical circuit  through center waveguide  (See block ), the optical comb enters the optical splitter  where the optical comb is divided between two outputs of the optical splitter  (See block ) into first and second waveguide paths , . The first and second waveguide paths ,  carry the optical comb to the first and second slave laser , , respectively, traveling through first and second directional coupler , , respectively. The first and second slave laser ,  generate a first and second laser output. The first and second waveguide paths ,  carry the first and second laser output from first and second slave laser ,  to the combining directional coupler , again traveling through first and second directional coupler , , respectively.","The divided optical comb from optical splitter  enters the first and second directional coupler ,  (See blocks ,). Both the first and second directional coupler ,  each split the optical comb into two outputs. The first and second directional coupler ,  each have an output that is connected to the first and second slave laser , , respectively. The other output of first and second directional couplers ,  are connected to output ports ,  (See blocks , ), respectively. The output ports  or  could, for example, be used to couple the optical comb to Fabry-Perot etalons, which monitor the alignment of the lasing wavelength of the first and second slave laser ,  to the desired lines in the optical comb. The optical comb that leaves the first directional coupler  enters the first slave laser , and the optical comb that leaves the second directional coupler  enters the second slave laser  (See blocks , ). The first slave laser  is adjusted so that its emission is at a desired line in the optical comb. Likewise, the second slave laser  is adjusted so that its emission is at, a usually different, desired line in the optical comb, thereby producing a first and second laser output, respectively. The first laser output reenters the first directional coupler  (See block ), and the second optical output reenters the second directional coupler  (See block ). The first directional coupler  splits the first laser output into two portions; one portion is supplied to a combining directional coupler  (See block ) through an output of the first directional coupler . The second directional coupler  likewise splits the second laser output into portions; one portion being supplied to the combining directional coupler  (See block ) through an output of second directional coupler . The first and second laser outputs that enter the combining directional coupler  (See block ) are combined to form a primary and a secondary combined laser output. The primary combined output is then sent to a primary output port  on the integrated optical circuit  (See block ), where the signal can be used for heterodyning to generate the microwave signal. It is preferred that in the primary combined output, the power of the first laser output be equal to the power of the second laser output. This can be achieved by adjusting the combining directional coupler , as well as the first and second directional coupler , . The secondary combined output can be sent to a secondary output port  on the integrated optical circuit .","In an alternate embodiment, as shown in , the relative splitting of light between the two outputs each of first and second directional coupler ,  and combining directional coupler  can be controlled electrically. This control permits the first, second, and combining directional coupler , ,  to be set to obtain the desired optical powers Pof the optical comb injected into the first and second slave lasers , . This control permits the first, second, and combing directional coupler , ,  to also be set to obtain equal powers of the first and second laser outputs in the primary combined laser output of the integrated optical circuit . This embodiment makes use of the output ports ,  and the secondary output port  of the integrated optical circuit. The output ports , , and the secondary output port  are coupled to optical fibers and supplied to an optical spectrum analyzer (OSA)  that may contain at least one scanning Fabry Perot etalon. A portion of the primary combined laser output also may be coupled, by means of an additional optical fiber splitter , into the OSA . The OSA  monitors the amplitudes and frequencies of individual lines of the optical comb and also of the first and second slave laser outputs. This information is then supplied to a processor  and to a directional coupler controller  for controlling the first and second directional coupler ,  and the combining directional coupler .","Once a directional coupler is set to achieve a particular splitting of light from one of its inputs into its two outputs, the light from the other input also is set. In addition, that setting applies for light traveling in either direction, both forward and reverse. In general, the settings of the first and second directional couplers ,  will be determined by the desired optical powers Pi of the optical comb injected into first and second slave lasers , . The setting of the combining directional coupler  is then determined by the desire to obtain equal powers of the first and second laser outputs in the primary combined laser output which is supplied to the primary output port  of the integrated optical circuit. This means that the secondary combined laser output supplied to the secondary output port  of the integrated optical circuit may not have equal powers of the first and second laser outputs.","Another alternate embodiment of the present invention is shown in FIG. . In this embodiment, the components of the integrated optical circuit  comprise the optical splitter , the first directional coupler , the second directional coupler , the combining directional coupler , a third directional coupler , and a fourth directional coupler . The first and second waveguide paths ,  interconnect these components to each other output ports ,  of the integrated optical circuit .","This embodiment is similar to the one shown in but has two additional directional couplers, a third directional coupler  and a fourth directional coupler . These additional directional couplers , , when used in combination with the first and second directional couplers , , permit the control of optical powers Pof the optical comb injected into first and second slave lasers ,  as well as the attainment of equal powers of the first and second laser outputs in the primary combined laser output of the integrated optical circuit . This control can be achieved without needing to use an OSA  for controlling the first and second directional coupler , . Instead, an integrated optoelectronic module  (shown in and ) can be constructed from the integrated optical circuit  of this embodiment for generating a microwave signal by heterodyning. An OSA , however, can still be used for monitoring the optical comb and the first and second laser outputs. An OSA  also can still be used for controlling the emission wavelengths of the first and second slave lasers ,  so that they coincide with the selected lines of the optical comb. Again, in this embodiment, we prefer to use 2\u00d72 third and fourth directional couplers , .","The third and fourth directional couplers ,  each have two ports on each side of the directional coupler, which may act as either inputs or outputs.

One input of third and fourth directional coupler ,  for light traveling in the forward direction is connected to splitter . One output of third and fourth directional coupler ,  for light traveling in the forward direction is connected to first and second slave laser , . Note that the output of third and fourth directional coupler ,  for the optical comb traveling in the forward direction acts as an input for the first and second laser output, which travel in the reverse direction through the third and fourth directional coupler , . The third and fourth directional coupler ,  also each have another output for coupling the optical comb, traveling in the forward direction through the coupler, to output ports , , respectively.
