Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to a conductive sheet and a capacitive touch panel, for example suitable for use in a projected capacitive touch panel.","2. Description of the Related Art","Touch panels have attracted much attention in recent years. For example, some touch panels, which use ITO (indium tin oxide) as an electrode material to make an electrode matrix less visible, have been disclosed (see, Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication Nos. 2010-086684 and 05-224818, etc.)","Though the touch panel has currently been used mainly in small devices such as PDAs (personal digital assistants) and mobile phones, it is expected to be used in large devices such as personal computer displays.","The conventional electrode is composed of the ITO (indium tin oxide) and therefore has a high resistance of about several hundred ohm\/sq. Thus, when the conventional touch panel is used in the large device in the above future trend, the large-sized touch panel has a low current transfer rate between the electrodes, and thereby exhibits a low response speed (taking a long time to detect the position touched with a finger tip).","A large number of lattices made of thin wires of a metal (thin metal wires) may be arranged to form an electrode with a lowered surface resistance. Touch panels using the electrode of the thin metal wires are known from International Publication No. WO 97\/018508, Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 2003-099185, U.S. Pat. No. 5,113,041, International Publication No. WO 95\/027334, U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2004\/0239650, U.S. Pat. No. 7,202,859, International Publication No. WO 2010\/013679, etc.","Conductive sheets according to International Publication No. WO 97\/018508, Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 2003-099185, U.S. Pat. No. 5,113,041 (FIG. 1a), and International Publication No. WO 95\/027334 each have a first conductive pattern formed by arranging a large number of the thin metal wires in the vertical direction, a second conductive pattern formed by arranging a large number of the thin metal wires in the horizontal direction, and an insulating layer disposed between the first and second conductive patterns.","Conductive sheets according to U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2004\/0239650 and U.S. Pat. No. 7,202,859 each have a first conductive pattern formed by arranging the thin metal wires each having a plurality of S-shaped portions in the vertical direction and a second conductive pattern formed by arranging the thin metal wires each having a plurality of S-shaped portions in the horizontal direction.","A touch switch according to International Publication No. WO 2010\/013679 has a substrate, a plurality of first electrodes arranged at regular intervals on one surface of the substrate, and a plurality of second electrodes arranged at regular intervals on the other surface of the substrate, and the first and second electrodes are arranged into a lattice pattern. The touch switch is attached to the front of a display device.","In addition, in International Publication No. WO 2010\/013679, the first electrode shown in  has a plurality of sensing sections each containing a combination of a plurality of small lattices. The sensing sections are connected via two connection paths of conductive wires in a connection part.","However, in the above examples, when one thin metal wire is broken, an address associated with the broken wire cannot be recognized disadvantageously. In the touch switch of International Publication No. WO 2010\/013679, the sensing sections of the first electrode are connected only via two connection paths. Therefore, it is highly probable that both the two connection paths are broken to completely disconnect the sensing sections.","In view of the above problems, an object of the present invention is to provide a conductive sheet and a capacitive touch panel, which can have a lower probability of complete disconnection between sensing sections as compared with conventional ones, can have a

capacitive touch panel of the present invention will be described below with reference to . It should be noted that, in this description, a numeric range of \u201cA to B\u201d includes both the numeric values A and B as the lower limit and upper limit values.","As shown in , a conductive sheet laminate according to a first embodiment (hereinafter referred to as the first conductive sheet laminate A) is obtained by stacking a first conductive sheet A and a second conductive sheet B. For example, an x direction corresponds to the horizontal or vertical direction of a projected capacitive touch panel  or a display panel  equipped therewith to be hereinafter described (see ).","As shown in , the first conductive sheet A has a first conductive part A formed on one main surface of a first transparent substrate A (see ). The first conductive part A contains two or more first conductive patterns A and first auxiliary patterns A. The first conductive patterns A extend in a first direction (the x direction), are arranged in a second direction (a y direction) perpendicular to the first direction, each contain a large number of lattices, and are composed of a thin metal wire. The first auxiliary patterns A are arranged around the first conductive patterns A and are composed of a thin metal wire.","The first conductive pattern A contains two or more first large lattices (first sensing sections, first pad portions) A composed of the thin metal wire. The first large lattices A are connected in series in the first direction, and each contain a combination of two or more small lattices . The above first auxiliary pattern A is formed around a side of the first large lattice A and is not connected to the first large lattice A. The small lattice  is shown as the smallest square in the drawings. First connections A are formed between the first large lattices A, and each adjacent two of the first large lattices A are electrically connected by the first connection A. For example, the thin metal wire contains gold (Au), silver (Ag), or copper (Cu). The thin metal wire is hereinafter referred to also as the conductive wire.","As shown in , the first large lattice A has a shape provided by a square composed of the small lattices  by removing several small lattices  (five small lattices  in this embodiment) from each corner on a diagonal line of the square. Thus, the first large lattice A has four straight sides  and two zigzag sides .","In this example, the first large lattice A and the first connection A are connected at three connection points (contact points), i.e. a first contact point , a second contact point , and a third contact point . Among vertices of the small lattices  in the first large lattice A, the first contact point  corresponds to a vertex closest to the adjacent first large lattice A. The second contact point  corresponds to a vertex adjacent to the first contact point  on the zigzag side . The third contact point  corresponds to a vertex second closest to the adjacent first large lattice A, thus to an intersection point between the straight side  and the zigzag side . Second large lattices B to be hereinafter described have the same contact points. When the adjacent two first large lattices A are distinguished, one of the first large lattices A is represented by a reference sign Aa, and the other is represented by a reference sign Ab.","The first connection A has a first conductive wire portion having an L-shaped with one corner for connecting the first contact point  of the one first large lattice Aa and the second contact point  of the other first large lattice Ab, and further has a second conductive wire portion having an L-shaped with one corner for connecting the first contact point  of the other first large lattice Ab and the second contact point  of the one first large lattice Aa. One rectangular portion  is formed by the first conductive wire portion and the second conductive wire portion ","A third direction (an m direction) bisects the angle between the first and second directions, and a fourth direction (an n direction) is perpendicular to the third direction. The first connection A has a third conductive wire portion extending from the third contact point  of the one first large lattice Aa to the first conductive wire portion in the fourth direction, and further has a fourth conductive wire portion extending from the third contact point  of the other first large lattice Ab to the second conductive wire portion in the fourth direction. In addition, the first connection A has an intersection point P between the first conductive wire portion and the third conductive wire portion , an intersection point P between the second conductive wire portion and the third conductive wire portion , an intersection point P between the second conductive wire portion and the fourth conductive wire portion , and an intersection point P between the first conductive wire portion and the fourth conductive wire portion . Thus, in the first connection A, the rectangular portion  contains a first rectangle adjacent to the one first large lattice Aa having the first contact point , the second contact point , the first intersection point P, and the second intersection point P, a second rectangle having the first to fourth intersection points P to P, and a first rectangle adjacent to the other first large lattice Ab having the first contact point , the second contact point , the third intersection point P, and the fourth intersection point P.","In the first rectangle , the long side is 3 times longer than the side of the small lattice , and the short side is 2 times longer than the side of the small lattice . On the other hand, in the second rectangle , the long side is 3 times longer than the side of the small lattice , and the short side has the same length as the side of the small lattice . Thus, when the thin metal wires (the long sides) of the first rectangle are arranged facing each other at a distance La and the thin metal wires (the long sides) of the second rectangle are arranged facing each other at a distance Lb, the rectangular portion  satisfies La>Lb and preferably satisfies 1.2\u00d7Lb\u2266La\u22663.0\u00d7Lb. In this example, the distance Lb is equal to the side length of the small lattice  as described above, and the rectangular portion  satisfies La=2\u00d7Lb.","As shown in , the first conductive wire portion contains a first conductive wire extending from the first contact point  of the one first large lattice Aa in the fourth direction, a second conductive wire extending from the end of the first conductive wire to the first intersection point P in the third direction, a third conductive wire connecting the first intersection point P and the fourth intersection point P, and a fourth conductive wire connecting the fourth intersection point P and the second contact point  of the other first large lattice Ab.","The second conductive wire portion contains a fifth conductive wire extending from the first contact point  of the other first large lattice Ab in the fourth direction, a sixth conductive wire extending from the end of the fifth conductive wire to the third intersection point P in the third direction, a seventh conductive wire connecting the third intersection point P and the second intersection point P, and an eighth conductive wire connecting the second intersection point P and the second contact point  of the one first large lattice Aa.","The third conductive wire portion contains a ninth conductive wire connecting the third contact point  of the one first large lattice Aa and the second intersection point P, and a tenth conductive wire connecting the second intersection point P and the first intersection point P.","The fourth conductive wire portion contains an eleventh conductive wire connecting the third contact point  of the other first large lattice Ab and the fourth intersection point P, and a twelfth conductive wire connecting the fourth intersection point P and the third intersection point P.","The first connection A having the above structure acts to electrically connect the first large lattices A via three or more connection paths. Specifically, the first connection A has, from the first contact point  of the first large lattice Aa, the following six connection paths:","(1) a first connection path (12 times longer than the side length of the small lattice) extending from the first contact point  of the first large lattice Aa through the conductive wires , , , , , and to the first contact point  of the first large lattice Ab;\n\n(2) a second connection path (12 times longer than the side length of the small lattice) extending from the first contact point  of the first large lattice Aa through the conductive wires , , , , , and to the first contact point  of the first large lattice Ab;\n\n(3) a third connection path (7 times longer than the side length of the small lattice) extending from the first contact point  of the first large lattice Aa through the conductive wires , , , and to the second contact point  of the first large lattice Ab;\n\n(4) a fourth connection path (13 times longer than the side length of the small lattice) extending from the first contact point  of the first large lattice Aa through the conductive wires , , , , , and to the second contact point  of the first large lattice Ab;\n\n(5) a fifth connection path (7 times longer than the side length of the small lattice) extending from the first contact point  of the first large lattice Aa through the conductive wires , , , and to the third contact point  of the first large lattice Ab; and\n\n(6) a sixth connection path (13 times longer than the side length of the small lattice) extending from the first contact point  of the first large lattice Aa through the conductive wires , , , , , and to the third contact point  of the first large lattice Ab.\n","The first connection A further has six connection paths from each of the second contact point  and the third contact point  of the first large lattice Aa though the detailed explanation thereof is omitted. Consequently, the first connection A has eighteen connection paths.","Thus, in general, when N represents the number of the connection paths between the adjacent two large lattices, Na represents the number of the thin metal wires extending from the contact points between the one large lattice and the connection into the connection, Nb represents the number of the thin metal wires extending between the intersection points in the connection, and Nc represents the number of the thin metal wires extending from the contact points between the other large lattice and the connection into the connection, the conductive sheet satisfies N=Na\u00d7(Nb+Nc\u22121).","In the example of the first connection A shown in , Na is 3, Nb is 4, Nc is 3, and thus N=3\u00d7(4+3\u22121)=18 as shown in .","Variant examples of the first connections A include those shown in . In the first variant example of , Na is 4, Nb is 7, Nc is 4, and thus N=4\u00d7(7+4\u22121)=40. In the second variant example of , Na is 4, Nb is 12, Nc is 4, and thus N=4\u00d7(12+4\u22121)=60.","The first connection A further has protrusions composed of the thin metal wire (first protruding wires A). Each of the protrusions is perpendicular to the long side of the first rectangle (3 or more times longer than the side of the small lattice ) and extends from the first contact point  on the long side toward the second rectangle . Thus, the protrusion extends toward the inside of the first connection A. The length of the first protruding wire A is equal to the side length of the small lattice .","An electrically isolated first insulation A is disposed between the adjacent first conductive patterns A.","The first auxiliary pattern A contains a plurality of first auxiliary wires A having an axis direction parallel to the third direction (arranged along the side of the first large lattice A perpendicular to the third direction), a plurality of first auxiliary wires A having an axis direction parallel to the fourth direction (arranged along the side of the first large lattice A perpendicular to the fourth direction), and two first L-shaped patterns A arranged facing each other. Each of the first L-shaped patterns A is formed by combining two first auxiliary wires A into an L-shaped in the first insulation A.","The axis-direction length of each first auxiliary wire A is \u00bd of the inside side length of the small lattice . The first auxiliary wire A is positioned at a predetermined distance from the first large lattice A (a distance equal to \u00bd of the inside side length of the small lattice  in this example).","As shown in , in the first conductive sheet A having the above structure, in one end of each first conductive pattern A, the first connection A is not formed on the open end of the first large lattice A. In the other end of the first conductive pattern A, the end of the first large lattice A is electrically connected to a first terminal wiring pattern A composed of a thin metal wire by a first wire connection A.","On the other hand, as shown in , the second conductive sheet B has a second conductive part B formed on one main surface of a second transparent substrate B (see ). The second conductive part B contains two or more second conductive patterns B and second auxiliary patterns B. The second conductive patterns B extend in the second direction (the y direction), are arranged in the first direction (the x direction), each contain a large number of lattices, and are composed of a thin metal wire. The second auxiliary patterns B are arranged around the second conductive patterns B and are composed of a thin metal wire.","The second conductive pattern B contains two or more second large lattices (second sensing sections, second pad portions) B composed of the thin metal wire. The second large lattices B are connected in series in the second direction, and each contain a combination of two or more small lattices . The above second auxiliary pattern B is formed around a side of the second large lattice B and is not connected to the second large lattice B. Second connections B are formed between the second large lattices B, and each adjacent two of the second large lattices B are electrically connected by the second connection B.","As shown in , the second large lattice B has a shape provided by a square composed of the small lattices  from which several small lattices  (five small lattices  in this embodiment) are removed at each corner on a diagonal line of the square. Thus, the second large lattice B has four straight sides  and two zigzag sides .","When the adjacent two second large lattices B are distinguished in the following explanation, one of the second large lattices B is represented by a reference sign Ba, and the other is represented by a reference sign Bb.","The second connection B has the same structure as the first connection A, and the duplicate explanations thereof are omitted. The second connection B has a fifth conductive wire portion having an L-shaped with one corner for connecting the first contact point  of the one second large lattice Ba and the second contact point  of the other second large lattice Bb, and further has a sixth conductive wire portion having an L-shaped with one corner for connecting the first contact point  of the other second large lattice Bb and the second contact point  of the one second large lattice Ba. One rectangular portion  is formed by the fifth conductive wire portion and the sixth conductive wire portion ","The second connection B has a seventh conductive wire portion extending from the third contact point  of the one second large lattice Ba to the fifth conductive wire portion in the fourth direction, and further has an eighth conductive wire portion extending from the third contact point  of the other second large lattice Bb to the sixth conductive wire portion in the fourth direction.","Though not shown in , the fifth conductive wire portion contains first to fourth conductive wires to in the same manner as the first conductive wire portion , the sixth conductive wire portion contains fifth to eighth conductive wires to in the same manner as the second conductive wire portion , the seventh conductive wire portion contains ninth and tenth conductive wires and in the same manner as the third conductive wire portion , and the eighth conductive wire portion contains eleventh and twelfth conductive wires and in the same manner as the fourth conductive wire portion ","The other components of the second connection B are equal to those of the first connection A, and the duplicate explanations thereof are omitted.","In the second conductive sheet B, an electrically isolated second insulation B is disposed between the adjacent second conductive patterns B.","The second auxiliary pattern B contains a plurality of second auxiliary wires B having an axis direction parallel to the fourth direction (arranged along the side of the second large lattice B perpendicular to the fourth direction), a plurality of second auxiliary wires B having an axis direction parallel to the third direction (arranged along the side of the second large lattice B perpendicular to the third direction), and two second L-shaped patterns B arranged facing each other. Each of the second L-shaped patterns B is formed by combining two second auxiliary wires B into an L-shaped in the second insulation B.","The axis-direction length of each second auxiliary wire B is \u00bd of the inside side length of the small lattice . The second auxiliary wire B is positioned at a predetermined distance from the second large lattice B (a distance equal to \u00bd of the inside side length of the small lattice  in this example).","As shown in , in the second conductive sheet B having the above structure, for example, in one end of each alternate odd-numbered second conductive pattern B and in the other end of each even-numbered second conductive pattern B, the second connection B is not formed for making the open ends of the second large lattice B. In the other end of each odd-numbered second conductive pattern B and in one end of each even-numbered second conductive pattern B, the end of the second large lattice B is electrically connected to a second terminal wiring pattern B composed of a thin metal wire by a second wire connection B.","The side length of each of the first large lattices A and the second large lattices B (the length of the straight side ) is preferably 3 to 10 mm, more preferably 4 to 6 mm. When the side length is less than the lower limit, for example in the case of using the first conductive sheet A and the second conductive sheet B in a touch panel, the first large lattices A and the second large lattices B exhibit a lowered electrostatic capacitance in the detection process, and the touch panel is likely to cause a detection trouble. On the other hand, when the side length is more than the upper limit, the position detection accuracy may be deteriorated. The side length of each small lattice  in the first large lattices A and the second large lattices B is preferably 50 \u03bcm or more, more preferably 50 to 500 \u03bcm, further preferably 150 to 300 \u03bcm, for the same reasons. When the side length of the small lattice  is within this range, the first conductive sheet A and the second conductive sheet B have high transparency and thereby can be suitably used at the front of a display device with excellent visibility.","The line width of each of the first conductive patterns A (the first large lattices A and the first connections A) and the second conductive patterns B (the second large lattices B and the second connections B) is 1 to 15 \u03bcm.","The line width of each of the first auxiliary patterns A (the first auxiliary wires A) and the second auxiliary patterns B (the second auxiliary wires B) is 1 to 15 \u03bcm, and may be equal to or different from those of the first conductive patterns A and the second conductive patterns B. It is preferred that the first conductive patterns A, the second conductive patterns B, the first auxiliary patterns A, and the second auxiliary patterns B have the same line width.","A touch panel  containing the first conductive sheet A and the second conductive sheet B will be described below with reference to .","The touch panel  has a sensor body  and a control circuit such as an input circuit (not shown). As shown in , A, and , the sensor body  contains the above first conductive sheet laminate A (the stack of the first conductive sheet A and the second conductive sheet B) and thereon a protective layer  (not shown in ). The first conductive sheet laminate A and the protective layer  can be disposed on a display panel  of a display device  such as a liquid crystal display. As viewed from above, the sensor body  has a sensor region  corresponding to a display screen of the display panel  and a terminal wiring region  (a so-called frame) corresponding to the periphery of the display panel .","As shown in , in the first conductive sheet A used in the touch panel , the above first conductive patterns A are arranged in the sensor region , and the first terminal wiring patterns A composed of the thin metal wire extend from the first wire connections A in the terminal wiring region .","In the example of , the first conductive sheet A and the sensor region  each have a rectangular shape as viewed from above. In the terminal wiring region , a plurality of first terminals are arranged in the longitudinal center in the length direction of the periphery on one long side of the first conductive sheet A. The first wire connections A are arranged in a straight line in the y direction along one long side of the sensor region  (a long side closest to the one long side of the first conductive sheet A). The first terminal wiring pattern A extends from each first wire connection A to the center of the one long side of the first conductive sheet A, and is electrically connected to the corresponding first terminal . Thus, the first terminal wiring patterns A, connected to each pair of corresponding first wire connections A formed on the right and left of the one long side of the sensor region , have approximately the same lengths. Of course, the first terminals may be formed in a corner of the first conductive sheet A or in the vicinity thereof. However, in this case, the length difference between the longest first terminal wiring pattern A and the shortest first terminal wiring pattern A is increased, whereby the longest first terminal wiring pattern A and the first terminal wiring patterns A in the vicinity thereof are disadvantageously poor in the rate of transferring a signal to the corresponding first conductive pattern A. Thus, in this embodiment, the first terminals are formed in the longitudinal center of the one long side of the first conductive sheet A, whereby the local signal transfer rate deterioration is prevented to increase the response speed.","Also in the second conductive sheet B, the second conductive patterns B are arranged in the sensor region , and the second terminal wiring patterns B extend from the second wire connections B in the terminal wiring region .","As shown in , in the terminal wiring region , a plurality of second terminals are arranged in the longitudinal center in the length direction of the periphery on one long side of the second conductive sheet B. For example, the odd-numbered second wire connections B are arranged in a straight line in the x direction along one short side of the sensor region  (a short side closest to one short side of the second conductive sheet B), and the even-numbered second wire connections B are arranged in a straight line in the x direction along the other short side of the sensor region  (a short side closest to the other short side of the second conductive sheet B).","For example, each odd-numbered second conductive pattern B is connected to the corresponding odd-numbered second wire connection B, and each even-numbered second conductive pattern B is connected to the corresponding even-numbered second wire connection B. The second terminal wiring patterns B extend from the odd-numbered and even-numbered second wire connections B to the center of one long side of the second conductive sheet B, and are each electrically connected to the corresponding second terminal . Thus, for example, the 1st and 2nd second terminal wiring patterns B have approximately the same lengths, and similarly the (2n\u22121)-th and (2n)-th second terminal wiring patterns B have approximately the same lengths (n=1, 2, 3, . . . ).","Of course, the second terminals may be formed in a corner of the second conductive sheet B or in the vicinity thereof. However, in this case, as described above, the longest second terminal wiring pattern B and the second terminal wiring patterns B in the vicinity thereof are disadvantageously poor in the rate of transferring a signal to the corresponding second conductive pattern B. Thus, in this embodiment, the second terminals are formed in the longitudinal center of the one long side of the second conductive sheet B, whereby the local signal transfer rate deterioration is prevented to increase the response speed.","The first terminal wiring patterns A may be arranged in the same manner as the above second terminal wiring patterns B, and the second terminal wiring patterns B may be arranged in the same manner as the above first terminal wiring patterns A.","When the first conductive sheet laminate A is used in the touch panel , a protective layer is formed on the first conductive sheet A, and the first terminal wiring patterns A extending from the first conductive patterns A in the first conductive sheet A and the second terminal wiring patterns B extending from the second conductive patterns B in the second conductive sheet B are connected to a scan control circuit or the like.","A self or mutual capacitance technology can be preferably used for detecting a touch position. In the self capacitance technology, a voltage signal for the touch position detection is sequentially supplied to the first conductive patterns A, and further a voltage signal for the touch position detection is sequentially supplied to the second conductive patterns B. When a finger comes into contact with or close to the upper surface of the protective layer , the capacitance between the first conductive pattern A and the second conductive pattern B in the touch position and the GND (ground) is increased, whereby signals from this first conductive pattern A and this second conductive pattern B have waveforms different from those of signals from the other conductive patterns. Thus, the touch position is calculated by a control circuit based on the signals transmitted from the first conductive pattern A and the second conductive pattern B. On the other hand, in the mutual capacitance technology, for example, a voltage signal for the touch position detection is sequentially supplied to the first conductive patterns A, and the second conductive patterns B are sequentially subjected to sensing (transmitted signal detection). When a finger comes into contact with or close to the upper surface of the protective layer , the stray capacitance of the finger is added in parallel to the parasitic capacitance between the first conductive pattern A and the second conductive pattern B in the touch position, whereby a signal from this second conductive pattern B has a waveform different from those of signals from the other second conductive patterns B. Thus, the touch position is calculated by a control circuit based on the order of the first conductive pattern A supplied with the voltage signal and the signal transmitted from the corresponding second conductive pattern B. Even when two fingers come into contact with or close to the upper surface of the protective layer  simultaneously, the touch positions can be detected by using the self or mutual capacitance technology. Conventional related detection circuits used in projected capacitive technologies are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,582,955, 4,686,332, 4,733,222, 5,374,787, 5,543,588, and 7,030,860, U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2004\/0155871, etc.","For example, as shown in , when the first conductive sheet A is stacked on the second conductive sheet B to form the first conductive sheet laminate A, the first conductive patterns A and the second conductive patterns B are crossed. Specifically, the first connections A of the first conductive patterns A and the second connections B of the second conductive patterns B are arranged facing each other with the first transparent substrate A (see ) interposed therebetween, and also the first insulations A of the first conductive part A and the second insulations B of the second conductive part B are arranged facing each other with the first transparent substrate A interposed therebetween. Though the first conductive patterns A and the second conductive patterns B are exaggeratingly shown by thick lines and thin lines, respectively, to clearly represent the positions thereof in , ,  to  and  to , they have the same line width.","When the stacked first conductive sheet A and second conductive sheet B are observed from above, the spaces between the first large lattices A of the first conductive sheet A are filled with the second large lattices B of the second conductive sheet B. Thus, the surface is covered with the large lattices. In this case, the first auxiliary patterns A and the second auxiliary patterns B overlap with each other to form combined patterns  between the first large lattices A and the second large lattices B.","In the combined pattern , the first auxiliary wires A and the second auxiliary wires B are perpendicularly crossed and do not overlap with each other.","Thus, in the combined pattern , the combination of the first auxiliary wires A arranged along a side of the first large lattice A and the second auxiliary wires B arranged along a side of the second large lattice B is such that, as viewed from above, one end of each first auxiliary wire A (the end farther from the first large lattice A) is connected to the straight side  of the second large lattice B, the other end of each first auxiliary wire A (the end closer to the first large lattice A) is connected to one end of the second auxiliary wire B (the end closer to the second large lattice B), and the other end of each second auxiliary wire B (the end farther from the second large lattice B) is connected to the straight side  of the first large lattice A, so that a plurality of the small lattices  are arrayed. As a result, the boundaries between the first large lattices A and the second large lattices B can hardly be found.","For example, in the case of not forming the first auxiliary patterns A and the second auxiliary patterns B, blank areas corresponding to the combined patterns  are formed, whereby the edges of the first large lattices A and the second large lattices B are highly visible, deteriorating the visibility. This problem may be solved by overlapping each straight side  of the first large lattices A with the corresponding straight side  of the second large lattices B to prevent the formation of the blank area. However, when the stack position accuracy is slightly deteriorated, the overlaps of the straight lines have large widths (the straight lines are thickened), whereby the boundaries between the first large lattices A and the second large lattices B are highly visible, deteriorating the visibility.","In contrast, in this embodiment, the first auxiliary wires A and the second auxiliary wires B are stacked in the above manner, whereby the boundaries between the first large lattices A and the second large lattices B are made less visible to improve the visibility.","In a case where each straight side  of the first large lattices A is overlapped with the corresponding straight side  of the second large lattices B to prevent the formation of the blank area as described above, the straight sides  of the second large lattices B are positioned right under the straight sides  of the first large lattices A. In this case, all straight sides  of the first large lattices A and the second large lattices B function as conductive portions, so that a parasitic capacitance is formed between the straight side  of the first large lattice A and the straight side  of the second large lattice B, and the parasitic capacitance acts as a noise on charge information to significantly deteriorate the S\/N ratio. Furthermore, since the parasitic capacitance are formed between each pair of the first large lattice A and the second large lattice B, a large number of the parasitic capacitances are connected in parallel in the first conductive patterns A and the second conductive patterns B to increase the CR time constant. When the CR time constant is increased, there is a possibility that the waveform rise time of the voltage signal supplied to the first conductive pattern A (and the second conductive pattern B) is increased, and an electric field for the position detection is hardly generated in a predetermined scan time. In addition, there is a possibility that the waveform rise or fall time of the signal transmitted from each of the first conductive patterns A and the second conductive patterns B becomes long, and the waveform change of the transmitted signal cannot be detected in a predetermined scan time. This leads to detection accuracy deterioration and response speed deterioration. Thus, in this case, the detection accuracy and the response speed can be improved only by reducing the number of the first large lattices A and the second large lattices B (lowering the resolution) or by reducing the size of the display screen, and the laminated conductive sheet cannot be used in a large screen such as a B5 sized, A4 sized, or larger screen.","In contrast, in this embodiment, as shown in , the projected distance Lf between the straight side  of the first large lattice A and the straight side  of the second large lattice B is approximately equal to the side length of the small lattice . Therefore, only a small parasitic capacitance is formed between the first large lattice A and the second large lattice B. As a result, the CR time constant can be reduced to improve the detection accuracy and the response speed. In the combined pattern  of the first auxiliary pattern A and the second auxiliary pattern B, an end of the first auxiliary wire A may overlap with an end of the second auxiliary wire B. However, this overlap does not result in increase of the parasitic capacitance between the first large lattice A and the second large lattice B because the first auxiliary wire A is unconnected with and electrically isolated from the first large lattice A and the second auxiliary wire B is unconnected with and electrically isolated from the second large lattice B.","It is preferred that the optimum value of the projected distance Lf is appropriately determined depending not on the sizes of the first large lattices A and the second large lattices B but on the sizes (the line widths and the side lengths) of the small lattices  in the first large lattices A and the second large lattices B. When the small lattices  have an excessively large size as compared with the sizes of the first large lattices A and the second large lattices B, the laminated conductive sheet may have a high light transmittance, but the dynamic range of the transmitted signal may be reduced, lowering the detection sensitivity. On the other hand, when the small lattices  have an excessively small size, the laminated conductive sheet may have a high detection sensitivity, but the light transmittance may be deteriorated under the restriction of line width reduction.","When the small lattices  have a line width of 1 to 15 \u03bcm, the optimum value of the projected distance Lf (the optimum distance) is preferably 100 to 400 \u03bcm, more preferably 200 to 300 \u03bcm. In a case where the small lattices  have a smaller line width, the optimum distance can be further reduced. However, in this case, the electrical resistance may be increased, and the CR time constant may be increased even under a small parasitic capacitance, deteriorating the detection sensitivity and the response speed. Thus, the line width of the small lattice  is preferably within the above range.","For example, the sizes of the first large lattices A, the second large lattices B, and the small lattices  are determined based on the size of the display panel  or the size and touch position detection resolution (drive pulse period or the like) of the sensor region , and the optimum distance between the first large lattice A and the second large lattice B is obtained based on the line width of the small lattices .","In this embodiment, in the terminal wiring region , the first terminals are formed in the longitudinal center of the periphery on the one long side of the first conductive sheet A, and the second terminals are formed in the longitudinal center of the periphery on the one long side of the second conductive sheet B. Particularly, in the example of , the first terminals and the second terminals are close to and not overlapped with each other, and the first terminal wiring patterns A and the second terminal wiring patterns B do not overlap with each other. For example, the first terminal may partially overlap with the odd-numbered second terminal wiring pattern B.","Thus, the first terminals and the second terminals can be electrically connected to the control circuit by using a cable and two connectors (a connector for the first terminals and a connector for the second terminals ) or one connector (a complex connector for the first terminals and the second terminals ).","Since the first terminal wiring patterns A and the second terminal wiring patterns B do not vertically overlap with each other, a parasitic capacitance is reduced therebetween to prevent the response speed deterioration.","Since the first wire connections A are arranged along the one long side of the sensor region  and the second wire connections B are arranged along the both short sides of the sensor region , the area of the terminal wiring region  can be reduced. Therefore, the size of the display panel  containing the touch panel  can be easily reduced, and the display screen can be made to seem impressively larger. Also the operability of the touch panel  can be improved.","The area of the terminal wiring region  may be further reduced by reducing the distance between the adjacent first terminal wiring patterns A or the adjacent second terminal wiring patterns B. The distance is preferably 10 to 50 \u03bcm in view of preventing migration.","Alternatively, the area of the terminal wiring region  may be reduced by arranging the second terminal wiring pattern B between the adjacent first terminal wiring patterns A in the view from above. However, when the pattern is misaligned, the first terminal wiring pattern A may vertically overlap with the second terminal wiring pattern B to increase the parasitic capacitance therebetween. This leads to deterioration of the response speed. Thus, in the case of using such an arrangement, the distance between the adjacent first terminal wiring patterns A is preferably 50 to 100 \u03bcm.","As shown in , first alignment marks and second alignment marks are preferably formed, for example, on the corners of the first conductive sheet A and the second conductive sheet B. The first alignment marks and the second alignment marks are used for positioning the sheets in the process of bonding the first conductive sheet A and the second conductive sheet B. When the first conductive sheet A and the second conductive sheet B are bonded to obtain the first conductive sheet laminate A, the first alignment marks and the second alignment marks form composite alignment marks. The composite alignment marks may be used for positioning the first conductive sheet laminate A in the process of attaching to the display panel .","In the first conductive sheet laminate A, the CR time constant of the first conductive patterns A and the second conductive patterns B can be significantly reduced, whereby the response speed can be increased, and the position detection can be readily carried out in an operation time (a scan time). Thus, the screen sizes (not the thickness but the length and width) of the touch panel  can be easily increased.","When the overlap of the first connection A and the second connection B is observed from above, the connection point between the first conductive wire and the second conductive wire in the first conductive wire portion of the first conductive sheet A is positioned at a vertex  of the small lattice  on the zigzag side  of the second large lattice B, the connection point between the first conductive wire and the second conductive wire in the fifth conductive wire portion of the second conductive sheet B is positioned at a vertex  of the small lattice  on the zigzag side  of the first large lattice A, the ends of the first protruding wires A are positioned at the first intersection point P and the third intersection point P of the second connection B respectively, the ends of the second protruding wires B are positioned at the first intersection point P and the third intersection point P of the first connection A respectively, and the first to fourth conductive wire portions to and the first protruding wires A in the first connection A and the fifth to eighth conductive wire portions to and the second protruding wires B in the second connection B form a plurality of the small lattices  in combination. Therefore, the small lattices  are formed by the combination of the first connection A and the second connection B in the overlapped portion of the first connection A and the second connection B. Thus formed small lattices  cannot be distinguished from the surrounding small lattices  in the first large lattices A and the second large lattices B, so that the visibility is improved.","When the overlap of the first insulation A and the second insulation B is observed from above, the corner of the first L-shaped pattern A is positioned at the connection point of the straight sides  in the second large lattice B, the corner of the second L-shaped pattern B is positioned at the connection point of the straight sides  in the first large lattice A, and the first L-shaped pattern A and the second L-shaped pattern B form a plurality of the small lattices  in combination. Thus formed small lattices  cannot be distinguished from the surrounding small lattices  in the first large lattices A and the second large lattices B, so that the visibility is improved.","In this embodiment, the first large lattices A are connected via the eighteen connection paths in the first connection A. Therefore, for example, even when a part of the second conductive wire portion and a part of the third conductive wire portion are broken in the first connection A, the electric connection between the first large lattices A can be maintained by the unbroken first connection path and the like. Thus, the probability of the complete breakage of the first connection A can be lowered as compared with conventional technologies.","In this embodiment, the first connection A has a connection path 7 times longer than the side length of the small lattice  (such as the third or fifth connection paths), a connection path 8 times longer than the side length, a connection path 12 times longer than the side length of the small lattice  (such as the first or second connection paths), and a connection path 13 times longer than the side length of the small lattice  (such as the fourth or sixth connection paths). The third conductive wire and the seventh conductive wire in each connection path have a length equal to the side length of the small lattice . Therefore, the probability that the third conductive wire or the seventh conductive wire is broken in the connection path is 1\/7 or less. Thus, the probability that both of the third conductive wire and the seventh conductive wire in the first connection A are broken (the first connection A is completely broken) is significantly lowered. Examples of the connection paths, 8 times longer than the side length of the small lattice , include a connection path extending from the third contact point  of the first large lattice Aa through the third conductive wire portion , the third conductive wire , and the fourth conductive wire to the second contact point  of the first large lattice Ab.","The second connection B has the same structure, and the second large lattices B are connected via the eighteen connection paths in the second connection B. Therefore, for example, even when a part of the sixth conductive wire portion and a part of the seventh conductive wire portion are broken in the second connection B, the electric connection between the second large lattices B can be maintained by the unbroken first connection path and the like. Thus, the probability of the complete breakage of the second connection B can be lowered as compared with conventional technologies.","As described above, the first conductive sheet laminate A has a low surface resistance. Therefore, when the first conductive sheet laminate A is used in a projected capacitive touch panel or the like, the response speed and the size of the touch panel can be easily increased. Furthermore, the first large lattices A and the second large lattices B, which function as charge storage cells, each contain a large number of the small lattices . Therefore, the first large lattices A and the second large lattices B can store a large amount of signal charge, whereby the dynamic range of output to input is increased. Thus, when the first conductive sheet A, the second conductive sheet B, or the first conductive sheet laminate A is used in a touch panel, the sensitivity for detecting the finger touch position (the detection sensitivity) can be increased. In addition, the ratio of the signal component to the noise component can be increased, and the S\/N ratio of the detection signal can be improved. This leads to improvement of the touch position detection accuracy.","Furthermore, the combination of the first auxiliary patterns A formed around the first large lattices A in the first conductive sheet A and the second auxiliary patterns B formed around the second large lattices B in the second conductive sheet B, the combination of the first connections A and the second connections B, and the combination of the first insulations A and the second insulation B form a plurality of the small lattices . Therefore, the boundaries between the first large lattices A of the first conductive sheet A and the second large lattices B of the second conductive sheet B can be made less visible, defects such as the local line thickening can be prevented, and the overall visibility can be improved.","Though the small lattice  has a square shape in the above first conductive sheet laminate A, it may have another polygonal shape. Each side of the small lattice  may have a straight line shape, a curved shape, or an arc shape. When the small lattice  has arc-shaped sides, for example, two opposite sides may have an outwardly protruding arc shape, and the other two opposite sides may have an inwardly protruding arc shape. Alternatively, each side may have a wavy shape containing outwardly protruding arcs and inwardly protruding arcs formed continuously. Of course, each side may have a sine curve shape.","Though the first conductive wire and the fifth conductive wire are twice as long as the side of the small lattice  in the above first conductive sheet A and second conductive sheet B, each of the wires may be for example 1.5, 2.5, or 3 times longer than the side of the small lattice . Though the conductive wire extending in the third direction in the first conductive wire portion (the second conductive wire , the third conductive wire , and the fourth conductive wire ), the conductive wire extending in the third direction in the second conductive wire portion (the fifth conductive wire , the sixth conductive wire , and the seventh conductive wire ), the third conductive wire portion , and the fourth conductive wire portion are 5 times longer than the side of the small lattice , each of the wires may be for example 3, 4, or 6 times longer than the side. However, when the first connection A and the second connection B have an excessively large size, the first large lattices A and the second large lattices B cannot be easily arranged, and the overlaps thereof exhibit a large electrostatic capacitance change with considerable noise component. Therefore, it is preferred that the first conductive wire and the fifth conductive wire are 4 or less times longer than the side of the small lattice , and the conductive wire extending along the third direction in the first conductive wire portion , the conductive wire extending along the third direction in the second conductive wire portion , the third conductive wire portion , and the fourth conductive wire portion are 6 or less times longer than the side of the small lattice .","The structure of the first connection A may be optionally modified as long as the first connection A has three or more connection paths. For example, the third conductive wire portion or the fourth conductive wire portion may be omitted from the first connection A. In this case, the first connection A has nine connection paths. Thus, it is only necessary that the first connection A has three or more conductive wires for connecting one or more vertices of the small lattices  in the first large lattice Aa and one or more vertices of the small lattices  in the first large lattice Ab. This is true also for the second connection B.","Also, the sizes of the small lattice  (including the side length and the diagonal line length), the number of the small lattices  in the first large lattice A, and the number of the small lattices  in the second large lattice B may be appropriately selected depending on the size and the resolution (the line number) of the touch panel using the conductive sheet.","As shown in , in the above first conductive sheet laminate A, the first conductive part A is formed on the one main surface of the first transparent substrate A, the second conductive part B is formed on the one main surface of the second transparent substrate B, and the resultant sheets are stacked. Alternatively, as shown in , the first conductive part A may be formed on one main surface of the first transparent substrate A, and the second conductive part B may be formed on the other main surface of the first transparent substrate A. In this case, the second transparent substrate B is not used, the first transparent substrate A is stacked on the second conductive part B, and the first conductive part A is stacked on the first transparent substrate A. In addition, another layer may be disposed between the first conductive sheet A and the second conductive sheet B. The first conductive part A and the second conductive part B may be arranged facing each other as long as they are insulated.","A conductive sheet laminate according to a second embodiment (hereinafter referred to as the second conductive sheet laminate B) will be described below with reference to .","The second conductive sheet laminate B has approximately the same structure as the above first conductive sheet laminate A, but is different in that the protrusions (the first protruding wires A) are not formed in the first connection A of the first conductive sheet A as shown in  and that the protrusions (the second protruding wires B) are not formed in the second connection B of the second conductive sheet B as shown in .","Thus, as shown in , when the first conductive sheet A and the second conductive sheet B are stacked to form the second conductive sheet laminate B, the first blank area A having the same size as two small lattices  is formed in each of a portion adjacent to the first intersection point P and a portion adjacent to the third intersection point P in the first connection A, and the second blank area B having the same size as two small lattices  is formed in each of a portion adjacent to the first intersection point P and a portion adjacent to the third intersection point P in the second connection B.","In this embodiment, though the first blank areas A and the second blank areas B are less visible because they are regularly arranged and have the small size equal to two small lattices , the second conductive sheet laminate B is inferior in visibility to the first conductive sheet laminate A. In the first conductive sheet laminate A, each second blank area B is divided into two by the protrusion (the first protruding wire A) in the first connection A, each first blank area A is divided into two by the protrusion (the second protruding wire B) in the second connection B, and the areas cannot be distinguished from the surrounding small lattices  in the first large lattices A and the second large lattices B as shown in , so that the visibility is improved.","A conductive sheet laminate according to a third embodiment (hereinafter referred to as the third conductive sheet laminate C) will be described below with reference to .","The third conductive sheet laminate C has approximately the same structure as the above first conductive sheet laminate A, but is different in that the protrusions extend outward from the connections.","Thus, as shown in , the first connection A has the protrusions composed of the thin metal wire (the first protruding wires A), which are perpendicular to the conductive wires extending in the third direction in the first conductive wire portion and the second conductive wire portion , and extend from the first intersection point P and the third intersection point P on the conductive wires, respectively.","Similarly, as shown in , the second connection B has the protrusions composed of the thin metal wire (the second protruding wires B), which are perpendicular to the conductive wires extending in the fourth direction in the fifth conductive wire portion and the sixth conductive wire portion , and extend from the first intersection point P and the third intersection point P on the conductive wires, respectively.","Thus, as shown in , when the first conductive sheet A and the second conductive sheet B are stacked to form the third conductive sheet laminate C, each first blank area A (see ) is divided into two by the protrusion (the first protruding wire A) in the first connection A, each second blank area B (see ) is divided into two by the protrusion (the second protruding wire B) in the second connection B, and the areas cannot be distinguished from the surrounding small lattices  in the first large lattices A and the second large lattices B, so that the visibility is improved.","A conductive sheet laminate according to a fourth embodiment (hereinafter referred to as the fourth conductive sheet laminate D) will be described below with reference to .","The fourth conductive sheet laminate D has approximately the same structure as the above first conductive sheet laminate A, but is different in the following points.","Thus, as shown in , in the first connection A, the third conductive wire portion has an L-shaped with one corner for connecting the third contact point  of the one first large lattice Aa and the third contact point  of the other first large lattice Ab, and the fourth conductive wire portion has an L-shaped with one corner for connecting the third contact point  of the other first large lattice Ab and the third contact point  of the one first large lattice Aa. In addition, a first absent portion A (a portion provided by removing a side from the small lattice ) is formed between the first conductive wire portion and a side of the first large lattice A extending in the third direction (the m direction) and between the second conductive wire portion and a side of the first large lattice A extending in the third direction (the m direction), respectively, and also one first auxiliary wire A is removed. The first contact point  is not formed.","Similarly, as shown in , in the second connection B, the seventh conductive wire portion has an L-shaped with one corner for connecting the third contact point  of the one second large lattice Ba and the third contact point  of the other second large lattice Bb, and the eighth conductive wire portion has an L-shaped with one corner for connecting the third contact point  of the other second large lattice Bb and the third contact point  of the one second large lattice Ba. In addition, a second absent portion B (a portion provided by removing a side from the small lattice ) is formed between the fifth conductive wire portion and a side of the second large lattice B extending in the fourth direction (the n direction) and between the sixth conductive wire portion and a side of the second large lattice B extending in the fourth direction (the n direction), respectively, and also one second auxiliary wire B is removed. Also in the second connection B, the first contact point  is not formed.","Though not shown in , as well as the third conductive wire portion in the first connection A, the seventh conductive wire portion contains the ninth conductive wire , the tenth conductive wire , a thirteenth conductive wire , and a fourteenth conductive wire . As well as the fourth conductive wire portion in the first connection A, the eighth conductive wire portion contains the eleventh conductive wire , the twelfth conductive wire , a fifteenth conductive wire , and a sixteenth conductive wire ","Therefore, in the first connection A of the fourth conductive sheet laminate D, Na (the number of the thin metal wires extending from the contact points between the one first large lattice Aa and the first connection A into the first connection A) is 4, Nb (the number of the thin metal wires extending between the intersection points in the first connection A) is 4, Nc (the number of the thin metal wires extending from the contact points between the other first large lattice Ab and the first connection A into the first connection A) is 4, and thus N (the number of the connection paths between the adjacent two first large lattices A) is 4\u00d7(4+4\u22121)=28. Thus, the connection path number N of the first connection A in the fourth conductive sheet laminate D is larger by 10 than the number N (=18) of the first connection A in the first conductive sheet laminate A. As a result, in this embodiment, the probability of the complete breakage of the first connection A can be further lowered to improve the reliability. This is true also for the second connection B.","Furthermore, the thirteenth conductive wire of the third conductive wire portion and the fifteenth conductive wire of the fourth conductive wire portion in the first connection A of the fourth conductive sheet laminate D function in the same manner as the protrusions (the first protruding wires A) in the first connection A of the third conductive sheet laminate C. Similarly, the thirteenth conductive wire of the seventh conductive wire portion and the fifteenth conductive wire of the eighth conductive wire portion in the second connection B of the fourth conductive sheet laminate D function in the same manner as the protrusions (the second protruding wires B) in the second connection B of the third conductive sheet laminate C.","Thus, as shown in , when the first conductive sheet A and the second conductive sheet B are stacked to form the fourth conductive sheet laminate D, each first blank area A (see ) is divided into two by the thirteenth conductive wire and the fourteenth conductive wire of the third conductive wire portion and the fifteenth conductive wire and the sixteenth conductive wire of the fourth conductive wire portion in the first connection A, whereby the second absent portions B and the spaces corresponding to the removed second auxiliary wires B are compensated. In addition, each second blank area B (see ) is divided into two by the thirteenth conductive wire and the fourteenth conductive wire of the seventh conductive wire portion and the fifteenth conductive wire and the sixteenth conductive wire of the eighth conductive wire portion in the second connection B, whereby the first absent portions A and the spaces corresponding to the removed first auxiliary wires A are compensated. As a result, the areas cannot be distinguished from the surrounding small lattices  in the first large lattices A and the second large lattices B, so that the visibility is improved.","A conductive sheet laminate according to a fifth embodiment (hereinafter referred to as the fifth conductive sheet laminate E) will be described below with reference to .","The fifth conductive sheet laminate E is different from the above first conductive sheet laminate A in the following points.","Thus, as shown in , in the first conductive part A according to the present embodiment, the interval between the first large lattices A forming the first conductive pattern A is wide and the area of the first insulation A is broad.","Specifically, the first connection A has a first conductive wire portion including an L-shaped with one corner for connecting the first contact point  of the one first large lattice Aa and the second contact point  of the other first large lattice Ab, and further includes a second conductive wire portion having an L-shaped with one corner for connecting the first contact point  of the other first large lattice Ab and the second contact point  of the one first large lattice Aa. One rectangular portion  is formed by the first conductive wire portion and the second conductive wire portion .

The metallic silver portions may be subjected to a physical development treatment and\/or a plating treatment to deposit a conductive metal thereon.","As shown in , the first conductive patterns A may be formed on one main surface of the first transparent substrate A, and the second conductive patterns B may be formed on the other main surface thereof. In this case, when the one main surface is exposed and then the other main surface is exposed in the usual method, the desired first conductive patterns A and second conductive patterns B cannot be obtained occasionally.

As shown in , the photosensitive material  has the first transparent substrate A, a photosensitive silver halide emulsion layer (hereinafter referred to as the first photosensitive layer ) formed on one main surface of the first transparent substrate A, and a photosensitive silver halide emulsion layer (hereinafter referred to as the second photosensitive layer ) formed on the other main surface of the first transparent substrate A.","In the step S of , the photosensitive material  is exposed. In this step, a simultaneous both-side exposure, which includes a first exposure treatment for irradiating the first photosensitive layer on the first transparent substrate A with a light in a first exposure pattern and a second exposure treatment for irradiating the second photosensitive layer on the first transparent substrate A with a light in a second exposure pattern, is carried out. In the example of , the first photosensitive layer is irradiated through a first photomask with a first light (a parallel light), and the second photosensitive layer is irradiated through a second photomask with a second light (a parallel light), while conveying the long photosensitive material  in one direction. The first light is such that a light from a first light source is converted to a parallel light by an intermediate first collimator lens , and the second light is such that a light from a second light source is converted to a parallel light by an intermediate second collimator lens . Though two light sources (the first light source and the second light source ) are used in the example of , only one light source may be used. In this case, a light from the one light source may be divided by an optical system into the first light and the second light for exposing the first photosensitive layer and the second photosensitive layer ","In the step S of , the exposed photosensitive material  is developed to prepare the first conductive sheet laminate A shown in . The first conductive sheet laminate A has the first transparent substrate A, the first conductive part A (including the first conductive patterns A) formed in the first exposure pattern on the one main surface of the first transparent substrate A, and the second conductive part B (including the second conductive patterns B) formed in the second exposure pattern on the other main surface of the first transparent substrate A. Preferred exposure time and development time for the first photosensitive layer and the second photosensitive layer depend on the types of the first light source , the second light source , and a developer, etc., and cannot be categorically determined. The exposure time and development time may be selected in view of achieving a development ratio of 100%.","As shown in , in the first exposure treatment in the production method of this embodiment, for example, the first photomask is placed in close contact with the first photosensitive layer , the first light source is arranged facing the first photomask , and the first light is emitted from the first light source toward the first photomask , so that the first photosensitive layer is exposed. The first photomask has a glass substrate composed of a transparent soda glass and a mask pattern (a first exposure pattern ) formed thereon. Therefore, in the first exposure treatment, areas in the first photosensitive layer , corresponding to the first exposure pattern in the first photomask , are exposed. A space of approximately 2 to 10 \u03bcm may be formed between the first photosensitive layer and the first photomask ","Similarly, in the second exposure treatment, for example, the second photomask is placed in close contact with the second photosensitive layer , the second light source is arranged facing the second photomask , and the second light is emitted from the second light source toward the second photomask , so that the second photosensitive layer is exposed. The second photomask , as well as the first photomask , has a glass substrate composed of a transparent soda glass and a mask pattern (a second exposure pattern ) formed thereon. Therefore, in the second exposure treatment, areas in the second photosensitive layer , corresponding to the second exposure pattern in the second photomask , are exposed. In this case, a space of approximately 2 to 10 \u03bcm may be formed between the second photosensitive layer and the second photomask ","In the first and second exposure treatments, the emission of the first light from the first light source and the emission of the second light from the second light source may be carried out simultaneously or independently. When the emissions are simultaneously carried out, the first photosensitive layer and the second photosensitive layer can be simultaneously exposed in one exposure process to reduce the treatment time.","In a case where both of the first photosensitive layer and the second photosensitive layer are not spectrally sensitized, a light incident on one side may affect the image formation on the other side (the back side) in the both-side exposure of the photosensitive material .","Thus, the first light from the first light source reaches the first photosensitive layer and is scattered by silver halide particles in the first photosensitive layer , and a part of the scattered light is transmitted through the first transparent substrate A and reaches the second photosensitive layer . Then, a large area of the boundary between the second photosensitive layer and the first transparent substrate A is exposed to form a latent image. As a result, the second photosensitive layer is exposed to the second light from the second light source and the first light from the first light source . When the second photosensitive layer is developed to prepare the first conductive sheet laminate A, the conductive pattern corresponding to the second exposure pattern (the second conductive part B) is formed, and additionally a thin conductive layer is formed due to the first light from the first light source between the conductive patterns, so that the desired pattern (corresponding to the second exposure pattern ) cannot be obtained. This is true also for the first photosensitive layer ","As a result of intense research in view of solving this problem, it has been found that when the thicknesses and the applied silver amounts of the first photosensitive layer and the second photosensitive layer are selected within particular ranges, the incident light can be absorbed by the silver halide to suppress the light transmission to the back side. In this embodiment, the thicknesses of the first photosensitive layer and the second photosensitive layer may be 1 to 4 \u03bcm. The upper limit is preferably 2.5 \u03bcm. The applied silver amounts of the first photosensitive layer and the second photosensitive layer may be 5 to 20 g\/m.","In the above described both-side contact exposure technology, the exposure may be inhibited by dust or the like attached to the film surface to generate an image defect. It is known that the dust attachment can be prevented by applying a conductive substance such as a metal oxide or a conductive polymer to the film. However, the metal oxide or the like remains in the processed product, deteriorating the transparency of the final product, and the conductive polymer is disadvantageous in storage stability, etc. As a result of intense research, it has been found that a silver halide layer with reduced binder content exhibits a satisfactory conductivity for static charge prevention. Thus, the volume ratio of silver\/binder is limited in the first photosensitive layer and the second photosensitive layer . The silver\/binder volume ratios of the first photosensitive layer and the second photosensitive layer are 1\/1 or more, preferably 2\/1 or more.","When the thicknesses, the applied silver amounts, and the silver\/binder volume ratios of the first photosensitive layer and the second photosensitive layer are selected as described above, the first light emitted from the first light source to the first photosensitive layer does not reach the second photosensitive layer as shown in . Similarly, the second light emitted from the second light source to the second photosensitive layer does not reach the first photosensitive layer . As a result, in the following development for producing the first conductive sheet laminate A, as shown in , only the conductive pattern corresponding to the first exposure pattern (the pattern of the first conductive part A) is formed on the one main surface of the first transparent substrate A, and only the conductive pattern corresponding to the second exposure pattern (the pattern of the second conductive part B) is formed on the other main surface of the first transparent substrate A, so that the desired pattern can be obtained.","In the production method using the above one-shot both-side exposure, the first photosensitive layer and the second photosensitive layer can have both of the satisfactory conductivity and both-side exposure suitability, and the same or different patterns can be formed on the sides of the first transparent substrate A by the exposure, whereby the electrodes of the touch panel  can be easily formed, and the touch panel  can be made thinner (smaller).","In the above production method, the first conductive patterns A and the second conductive patterns B are formed using the photosensitive silver halide emulsion layer. The other production methods include the following methods.","A photoresist film on a copper foil disposed on the first transparent substrate A or the second transparent substrate B may be exposed and developed to form a resist pattern, and the copper foil exposed from the resist pattern may be etched to obtain the first conductive part A or the second conductive part B.","Alternatively, a paste containing fine metal particles may be printed on the first transparent substrate A or the second transparent substrate B, and the printed paste may be plated with a metal to obtain the first conductive part A or the second conductive part B.","The first conductive part A or the second conductive part B may be printed on the first transparent substrate A or the second transparent substrate B by using a screen or gravure printing plate.","The first conductive patterns A or the second conductive patterns B may be formed on the first transparent substrate A or the second transparent substrate B by using an inkjet method.","A particularly preferred method, which contains using a photographic photosensitive silver halide material for producing the first conductive sheet A and the second conductive sheet B according to this embodiment, will be mainly described below.","The method for producing the first conductive sheet A and the second conductive sheet B of this embodiment includes the following three processes different in the photosensitive materials and development treatments.","(1) A process comprising subjecting a photosensitive black-and-white silver halide material free of physical development nuclei to a chemical or thermal development to form the metallic silver portions on the material.","(2) A process comprising subjecting a photosensitive black-and-white silver halide material having a silver halide emulsion layer containing physical development nuclei to a solution physical development to form the metallic silver portions on the material.","(3) A process comprising subjecting a stack of a photosensitive black-and-white silver halide material free of physical development nuclei and an image-receiving sheet having a non-photosensitive layer containing physical development nuclei to a diffusion transfer development to form the metallic silver portions on the non-photosensitive image-receiving sheet.","In the process of (1), an integral black-and-white development procedure is used to form a transmittable conductive film such as a light-transmitting conductive film on the photosensitive material. The resulting silver is a chemically or thermally developed silver containing a high-specific surface area filament, and thereby shows a high activity in the following plating or physical development treatment.","In the process of (2), the silver halide particles are melted around and deposited on the physical development nuclei in the exposed areas to form a transmittable conductive film such as a light-transmitting conductive film on the photosensitive material. Also in this process, an integral black-and-white development procedure is used. Though high activity can be achieved since the silver halide is deposited on the physical development nuclei in the development, the developed silver has a spherical shape with small specific surface.","In the process of (3), the silver halide particles are melted in the unexposed areas, and are diffused and deposited on the development nuclei of the image-receiving sheet, to form a transmittable conductive film such as a light-transmitting conductive film on the image-receiving sheet. In this process, a so-called separate-type procedure is used, the image-receiving sheet being peeled off from the photosensitive material.","A negative or reversal development treatment can be used in the processes. In the diffusion transfer development, the negative development treatment can be carried out using an auto-positive photosensitive material.","The chemical development, thermal development, solution physical development, and diffusion transfer development have the meanings generally known in the art, and are explained in common photographic chemistry texts such as Shin-ichi Kikuchi, \u201cShashin Kagaku (Photographic Chemistry)\u201d, Kyoritsu Shuppan Co., Ltd., 1955 and C. E. K. Mees, \u201cThe Theory of Photographic Processes, 4th ed.\u201d, Mcmillan, 1977. A liquid treatment is generally used in the present invention, and also a thermal development treatment can be utilized. For example, techniques described in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication Nos. 2004-184693, 2004-334077, and 2005-010752 and Japanese Patent Application Nos. 2004-244080 and 2004-085655 can be used in the present invention.","The structure of each layer in the first conductive sheet A and the second conductive sheet B of this embodiment will be described in detail below.","[First Transparent Substrate A and Second Transparent Substrate B]","The first transparent substrate A and the second transparent substrate B may be a plastic film, a plastic plate, a glass plate, etc.","Examples of materials for the plastic film and the plastic plate include polyesters such as polyethylene terephthalates (PET) and polyethylene naphthalates (PEN); polyolefins such as polyethylenes (PE), polypropylenes (PP), polystyrenes, and EVA; vinyl resins; polycarbonates (PC); polyamides; polyimides; acrylic resins; and triacetyl celluloses (TAC).","The first transparent substrate A and the second transparent substrate B are preferably a film or plate of a plastic having a melting point of about 290\u00b0 C. or lower, such as PET (melting point 258\u00b0 C.), PEN (melting point 269\u00b0 C.), PE (melting point 135\u00b0 C.), PP (melting point 163\u00b0 C.), polystyrene (melting point 230\u00b0 C.), polyvinyl chloride (melting point 180\u00b0 C.), polyvinylidene chloride (melting point 212\u00b0 C.), or TAC (melting point 290\u00b0 C.). The PET is particularly preferred from the viewpoints of light transmittance, workability, etc. The conductive film such as the first conductive sheet A or the second conductive sheet B used in the conductive sheet laminate  is required to be transparent, and therefore the first transparent substrate A and the second transparent substrate B preferably have a high transparency.","[Silver Salt Emulsion Layer]","The silver salt emulsion layer to be converted to the first conductive part A of the first conductive sheet A (including the first large lattices A, the first connections A, and the first auxiliary patterns A) and the second conductive part B of the second conductive sheet B (including the second large lattices B, the second connections B, and the second auxiliary patterns B) contains a silver salt and a binder and may further contain a solvent and an additive such as a dye.","The silver salt used in this embodiment may be an inorganic silver salt such as a silver halide or an organic silver salt such as silver acetate. In this embodiment, the silver halide is preferred because of its excellent light sensing property.","The applied silver amount (the amount of the applied silver salt in the silver density) of the silver salt emulsion layer is preferably 1 to 30 g\/m, more preferably 1 to 25 g\/m, further preferably 5 to 20 g\/m. When the applied silver amount is within this range, the resultant conductive sheet laminate  can exhibit a desired surface resistance.","Examples of the binders used in this embodiment include gelatins, polyvinyl alcohols (PVA), polyvinyl pyrolidones (PVP), polysaccharides such as starches, celluloses and derivatives thereof, polyethylene oxides, polyvinylamines, chitosans, polylysines, polyacrylic acids, polyalginic acids, polyhyaluronic acids, and carboxycelluloses. The binders show a neutral, anionic, or cationic property depending on the ionicity of a functional group.","In this embodiment, the amount of the binder in the silver salt emulsion layer is not particularly limited, and may be appropriately selected to obtain sufficient dispersion and adhesion properties. The volume ratio of silver\/binder in the silver salt emulsion layer is preferably 1\/4 or more, more preferably 1\/2 or more. The silver\/binder volume ratio is preferably 100\/1 or less, more preferably 50\/1 or less. Particularly, the silver\/binder volume ratio is further preferably 1\/1 to 4\/1, most preferably 1\/1 to 3\/1. When the silver\/binder volume ratio of the silver salt emulsion layer is within the range, the resistance variation can be reduced even under various applied silver amount, whereby the conductive sheet laminate can be produced with a uniform surface resistance. The silver\/binder volume ratio can be obtained by converting the silver halide\/binder weight ratio of the material to the silver\/binder weight ratio, and by further converting the silver\/binder weight ratio to the silver\/binder volume ratio.","<Solvent>","The solvent used for forming the silver salt emulsion layer is not particularly limited, and examples thereof include water, organic solvents (e.g. alcohols such as methanol, ketones such as acetone, amides such as formamide, sulfoxides such as dimethyl sulfoxide, esters such as ethyl acetate, ethers), ionic liquids, and mixtures thereof.","In this embodiment, the ratio of the solvent to the total of the silver salt, the binder, and the like in the silver salt emulsion layer is 30% to 90% by mass, preferably 50% to 80% by mass.","<Other Additives>","The additives used in this embodiment are not particularly limited, and may be preferably selected from known additives.","[Other Layers]","A protective layer (not shown) may be formed on the silver salt emulsion layer. The protective layer used in this embodiment contains a binder such as a gelatin or a high-molecular polymer, and is disposed on the photosensitive silver salt emulsion layer to improve the scratch prevention or mechanical property.

The method of applying or forming the protective layer is not particularly limited, and may be appropriately selected from known applying or forming methods. In addition, an undercoat layer or the like may be formed below the silver salt emulsion layer.","The steps for producing the first conductive sheet A and the second conductive sheet B will be described below.","[Exposure]","In this embodiment, the first conductive part A and the second conductive part B may be formed in a printing process, and may be formed by exposure and development treatments, etc. in another process. Thus, a photosensitive material having the first transparent substrate A or the second transparent substrate B and thereon the silver salt-containing layer or a photosensitive material coated with a photopolymer for photolithography is subjected to the exposure treatment. An electromagnetic wave may be used in the exposure. For example, the electromagnetic wave may be a light such as a visible light or an ultraviolet light, or a radiation ray such as an X-ray. The exposure may be carried out using a light source having a wavelength distribution or a specific wavelength.","The exposure is preferably carried out using a glass mask method or a laser lithography pattern exposure method.","[Development Treatment]","In this embodiment, the emulsion layer is subjected to the development treatment after the exposure. Common development treatment technologies for photographic silver salt films, photographic papers, print engraving films, emulsion masks for photomasking, and the like may be used in the present invention. The developer used in the development treatment is not particularly limited, and may be a PQ developer, an MQ developer, an MAA developer, etc. Examples of commercially available developers usable in the present invention include CN-16, CR-56, CP45X, FD-3, and PAPITOL available from FUJIFILM Corporation, C-41, E-6, RA-4, D-19, and D-72 available from Eastman Kodak Company, and developers contained in kits thereof. The developer may be a lith developer.","In the present invention, the development process may include a fixation treatment for removing the silver salt in the unexposed areas to stabilize the material. Fixation treatment technologies for photographic silver salt films, photographic papers, print engraving films, emulsion masks for photomasking, and the like may be used in the present invention.","In the fixation treatment, the fixation temperature is preferably about 20\u00b0 C. to 50\u00b0 C., more preferably 25\u00b0 C. to 45\u00b0 C. The fixation time is preferably 5 seconds to 1 minute, more preferably 7 to 50 seconds. The amount of the fixer used is preferably 600 ml\/mor less, more preferably 500 ml\/mor less, particularly preferably 300 ml\/mor less, per 1 mof the photosensitive material treated.","The developed and fixed photosensitive material is preferably subjected to a water washing treatment or a stabilization treatment. The amount of water used in the water washing or stabilization treatment is generally 20 L or less, and may be 3 L or less, per 1 mof the photosensitive material. The water amount may be 0, and thus the photosensitive material may be washed with storage water.","The ratio of the metallic silver contained in the exposed areas after the development to the silver contained in the areas before the exposure is preferably 50% or more, more preferably 80% or more by mass. When the ratio is 50% or more by mass, a high conductivity can be achieved.","In this embodiment, the tone (gradation) obtained by the development is preferably more than 4.0, though not particularly restrictive. When the tone is more than 4.0 after the development, the conductivity of the conductive metal portion can be increased while maintaining the high transmittance of the light-transmitting portion. For example, the tone of 4.0 or more can be obtained by doping with rhodium or iridium ion.","The conductive sheet is obtained by the above steps. The surface resistance of the resultant conductive sheet is preferably within the range of 0.1 to 100 ohm\/sq. The lower limit is preferably 1 ohm\/sq or more, 3 ohm\/sq or more, 5 ohm\/sq or more, or 10 ohm\/sq. The upper limit is preferably 70 ohm\/sq or less or 50 ohm\/sq or less. When the surface resistance is controlled within this range, the position detection can be performed even in a large touch panel having an area of 10 cm\u00d710 cm or more. The conductive sheet may be subjected to a calender treatment after the development treatment to obtain a desired surface resistance.","[Physical Development Treatment and Plating Treatment]","In this embodiment, to increase the conductivity of the metallic silver portion formed by the above exposure and development treatments, conductive metal particles may be deposited thereon by a physical development treatment and\/or a plating treatment. In the present invention, the conductive metal particles may be deposited on the metallic silver portion by only one of the physical development and plating treatments or by the combination of the physical development and plating treatments. The metallic silver portion, subjected to the physical development treatment and\/or the plating treatment in this manner, is also referred to as the conductive metal portion.","In this embodiment, the physical development is such a process that metal ions such as silver ions are reduced by a reducing agent, whereby metal particles are deposited on a metal or metal compound core. Such physical development has been used in the fields of instant B & W film, instant slide film, printing plate production, etc., and the technologies can be used in the present invention.","The physical development may be carried out at the same time as the above development treatment after the exposure, and may be carried out after the development treatment separately.","In this embodiment, the plating treatment may contain electroless plating such as chemical reduction plating or displacement plating. Known electroless plating technologies for printed circuit boards, etc. may be used in this embodiment. The electroless plating is preferably electroless copper plating.","[Oxidation Treatment]","In this embodiment, the metallic silver portion formed by the development treatment or the conductive metal portion formed by the physical development treatment and\/or the plating treatment is preferably subjected to an oxidation treatment. For example, by the oxidation treatment, a small amount of a metal deposited on the light-transmitting portion can be removed, so that the transmittance of the light-transmitting portion can be increased to approximately 100%.","[Conductive Metal Portion]","In this embodiment, the lower limit of the line width of the conductive metal portion (the thin metal wire) is preferably 1 \u03bcm or more, 3 \u03bcm or more, 4 \u03bcm or more, or 5 \u03bcm or more, and the upper limit thereof is preferably 15 \u03bcm or less, 10 \u03bcm or less, 9 \u03bcm or less, or 8 \u03bcm or less. When the line width is less than the lower limit, the conductive metal portion has an insufficient conductivity, whereby a touch panel using the conductive part has an insufficient detection sensitivity. On the other hand, when the line width is more than the upper limit, moire is significantly generated due to the conductive metal portion, and a touch panel using the conductive part has a poor visibility. When the line width is within the above range, the moire of the conductive metal portion is improved, and the visibility is remarkably improved. The line distance (the distance between the sides facing each other in the small lattice ) is preferably 30 to 500 \u03bcm, more preferably 50 to 400 \u03bcm, most preferably 100 to 350 \u03bcm. The conductive metal portion may have a part with a line width of more than 200 \u03bcm for the purpose of ground connection, etc.","In this embodiment, the opening ratio of the conductive metal portion is preferably 85% or more, more preferably 90% or more, most preferably 95% or more, in view of the visible light transmittance. The opening ratio is the ratio of the light-transmitting portions other than the conductive portions to the entire first conductive part A or second conductive part B. For example, a square lattice having a line width of 15 \u03bcm and a pitch of 300 \u03bcm has an opening ratio of 90%.","[Light-Transmitting Portion]","In this embodiment, the light-transmitting portion is a portion having light transmittance, other than the conductive metal portions in the first conductive sheet A and the second conductive sheet B. The transmittance of the light-transmitting portion, which is herein a minimum transmittance value in a wavelength region of 380 to 780 nm obtained neglecting the light absorption and reflection of the first transparent substrate A and the second transparent substrate B, is 90% or more, preferably 95% or more, more preferably 97% or more, further preferably 98% or more, most preferably 99% or more.","[First Conductive Sheet A and Second Conductive Sheet B]","In the first conductive sheet A and the second conductive sheet B of this embodiment, the thicknesses of the first transparent substrate A and the second transparent substrate B are preferably 5 to 350 \u03bcm, more preferably 30 to 150 \u03bcm. When the thicknesses are 5 to 350 \u03bcm, a desired visible light transmittance can be obtained, and the substrates can be easily handled.","The thickness of the metallic silver portion formed on the first transparent substrate A and the second transparent substrate B may be appropriately selected by controlling the thickness of the coating liquid for the silver salt-containing layer applied to the first transparent substrate A and the second transparent substrate B. The thickness of the metallic silver portion may be selected within a range of 0.001 to 0.2 mm, and is preferably 30 \u03bcm or less, more preferably 20 \u03bcm or less, further preferably 0.01 to 9 \u03bcm, most preferably 0.05 to 5 \u03bcm. The metallic silver portion is preferably formed in a patterned shape. The metallic silver portion may have a monolayer structure or a multilayer structure containing two or more layers. When the metallic silver portion has a patterned multilayer structure containing two or more layers, the layers may have different wavelength color sensitivities. In this case, different patterns can be formed in the layers by using exposure lights with different wavelengths.","In the case of using the first conductive sheet A or the second conductive sheet B in a touch panel, the conductive metal portion preferably has a smaller thickness. As the thickness is reduced, the viewing angle and visibility of the display panel are improved. Thus, the thickness of the layer of the conductive metal on the conductive metal portion is preferably less than 9 \u03bcm, more preferably 0.1 \u03bcm or more but less than 5 \u03bcm, further preferably 0.1 \u03bcm or more but less than 3 \u03bcm.","In this embodiment, the thickness of the metallic silver portion can be controlled by changing the coating thickness of the silver salt-containing layer, and the thickness of the conductive metal particle layer can be controlled in the physical development treatment and\/or the plating treatment, whereby the first conductive sheet A and the second conductive sheet B having a thickness of less than 5 \u03bcm (preferably less than 3 \u03bcm) can be easily produced.","The plating or the like is not necessarily carried out in the method for producing the first conductive sheet A and the second conductive sheet B of this embodiment. This is because the desired surface resistance can be obtained by controlling the applied silver amount and the silver\/binder volume ratio of the silver salt emulsion layer in the method for producing the first conductive sheet A and the second conductive sheet B of this embodiment. The calender treatment or the like may be carried out if necessary.","(Film Hardening Treatment after Development Treatment)","It is preferred that after the silver salt emulsion layer is developed, the resultant is immersed in a hardener and thus subjected to a film hardening treatment. Examples of the hardeners include boric acid, 2,3-dihydroxy-1,4-dioxane, and dialdehydes such as glutaraldehyde and adipaldehyde, described in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 02-141279.","In the above example, the first conductive pattern A contains the two or more first large lattices A connected in series in the first direction, and the second conductive pattern B contains the two or more second large lattices B connected in series in the second direction. Alternatively, the first conductive pattern A may contain two or more transparent ITO (indium tin oxide) film electrodes having a rhombic shape or the like connected in series in the first direction, and the second conductive pattern B may contain two or more transparent ITO film electrodes having a rhombic shape or the like connected in series in the second direction.","An additional functional layer such as an antireflection layer or a hard coat layer may be formed in the conductive sheet.","The present invention may be appropriately combined with technologies described in the following patent publications and international patent pamphlets shown in Tables 1 and 2. \u201cJapanese Laid-Open Patent\u201d, \u201cPublication No.\u201d, \u201cPamphlet No.\u201d, etc. are omitted.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0289","num":"0288"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 1"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["2004-221564","2004-221565","2007-200922","2006-352073","2007-129205"]},{"entry":["2007-235115","2007-207987","2006-012935","2006-010795","2006-228469"]},{"entry":["2006-332459","2009-21153","2007-226215","2006-261315","2007-072171"]},{"entry":["2007-102200","2006-228473","2006-269795","2006-269795","2006-324203"]},{"entry":["2006-228478","2006-228836","2007-009326","2006-336090","2006-336099"]},{"entry":["2006-348351","2007-270321","2007-270322","2007-201378","2007-335729"]},{"entry":["2007-134439","2007-149760","2007-208133","2007-178915","2007-334325"]},{"entry":["2007-310091","2007-116137","2007-088219","2007-207883","2007-013130"]},{"entry":["2005-302508","2008-218784","2008-227350","2008-227351","2008-244067"]},{"entry":["2008-267814","2008-270405","2008-277675","2008-277676","2008-282840"]},{"entry":["2008-283029","2008-288305","2008-288419","2008-300720","2008-300721"]},{"entry":["2009-4213","2009-10001","2009-16526","2009-21334","2009-26933"]},{"entry":["2008-147507","2008-159770","2008-159771","2008-171568","2008-198388"]},{"entry":["2008-218096","2008-218264","2008-224916","2008-235224","2008-235467"]},{"entry":["2008-241987","2008-251274","2008-251275","2008-252046","2008-277428"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0290","num":"0289"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 2"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["2006\/001461","2006\/088059","2006\/098333","2006\/098336","2006\/098338"]},{"entry":["2006\/098335","2006\/098334","2007\/001008"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"The present invention will be described more specifically below with reference to Examples.

Meanwhile, when the resistance value measured by the circuit tester was less than 1 M\u03a9, the connections in the conductive pattern were judged to be not broken.","(Evaluation Result)","In Example, in all the first conductive sheets A, breakage of the first connection A was not detected. Furthermore, in all the second conductive sheets B, breakage of the second connection B was not detected. In Comparative Example, in 12 first comparative conductive sheets, the first connection was broken. Furthermore, in 13 second comparative conductive sheets, the second connection was broken.","Thus, in Comparative Example, the connection of the conductive pattern was often completely broken in the conductive sheet production process. In contrast, in Example, the complete breakage of the first connection A and the second connection B could be prevented.","Conductive sheet laminates of Examples 1 to 9 were produced respectively. The surface resistance and the transmittance of each conductive sheet were measured, and the moire and the visibility of each conductive sheet were evaluated. The components, measurement results, and evaluation results of Examples 1 to 9 are shown in Table 3.","The first conductive sheets A and the second conductive sheets B of Examples 1 to 9 were produced in the same manner as First Example.","In the first conductive sheet A and the second conductive sheet B produced in Example 1, the conductive portions (the first conductive patterns A and the second conductive patterns B) had a line width of 1 \u03bcm, the small lattices  had a side length of 50 \u03bcm, and the large lattices (the first large lattices A and the second large lattices B) had a side length of 3 mm.","The first conductive sheet A and the second conductive sheet B of Example 2 were produced in the same manner as Example 1 except that the small lattices  had a side length of 100 \u03bcm.","The first conductive sheet A and the second conductive sheet B of Example 3 were produced in the same manner as Example 1 except that the conductive portions had a line width of 3 \u03bcm, the small lattices  had a side length of 150 \u03bcm, and the large lattices had a side length of 4 mm.","The first conductive sheet A and the second conductive sheet B of Example 4 were produced in the same manner as Example 1 except that the conductive portions had a line width of 4 \u03bcm, the small lattices  had a side length of 210 \u03bcm, and the large lattices had a side length of 5 mm.","The first conductive sheet A and the second conductive sheet B of Example 5 were produced in the same manner as Example 1 except that the conductive portions had a line width of 5 \u03bcm, the small lattices  had a side length of 250 \u03bcm, and the large lattices had a side length of 5 mm.","The first conductive sheet A and the second conductive sheet B of Example 6 were produced in the same manner as Example 1 except that the conductive portions had a line width of 8 \u03bcm, the small lattices  had a side length of 300 \u03bcm, and the large lattices had a side length of 6 mm.","The first conductive sheet A and the second conductive sheet B of Example 7 were produced in the same manner as Example 1 except that the conductive portions had a line width of 9 \u03bcm, the small lattices  had a side length of 300 \u03bcm, and the large lattices had a side length of 10 mm.","The first conductive sheet A and the second conductive sheet B of Example 8 were produced in the same manner as Example 1 except that the conductive portions had a line width of 10 \u03bcm, the small lattices  had a side length of 400 \u03bcm, and the large lattices had a side length of 10 mm.","The first conductive sheet A and the second conductive sheet B of Example 9 were produced in the same manner as Example 1 except that the conductive portions had a line width of 15 \u03bcm, the small lattices  had a side length of 500 \u03bcm, and the large lattices had a side length of 10 mm.","(Surface Resistance Measurement)","In each of the first conductive sheets A and the second conductive sheets B, the surface resistivity values of optionally selected 10 areas were measured by LORESTA GP (Model No. MCP-T610) manufactured by Dia Instruments Co., Ltd. utilizing an in-line four-probe method (ASP), and the average of the measured values was obtained to evaluate the detection accuracy.","(Transmittance Measurement)","The transmittance of each of the first conductive sheets A and the second conductive sheets B was measured by a spectrophotometer to evaluate the transparency.","(Moire Evaluation)","In each of Examples 1 to 9, the first conductive sheet A was stacked on the second conductive sheet B to obtain a first conductive sheet laminate A. The first conductive sheet laminate A was attached to a display screen of a liquid crystal display device to obtain a touch panel . The touch panel  was fixed to a turntable, and the liquid crystal display device was operated to display a white color. The moire of the first conductive sheet laminate A was visually observed and evaluated while turning the turntable within a bias angle range of \u221245\u00b0 to +45\u00b0.","The moire was observed at a distance of 1.5 m from the display screen of the liquid crystal display device.
