title: System for allocating data in a communications system and method thereof
abstract: Poor transmission reliability is identified in a data channel. Multiple frequency carriers are used to transmit different sets of data within the data channel. A frequency bin is assigned to each frequency carrier. The frequency bins are used to provide data to each frequency carrier. A transmission power assigned to each frequency carrier may be insufficient to overcome noise in the data channel when all the frequency bins are used to transfer data concurrently. The number of frequency bins associated with frequency carriers of the data channel are reduced. Power is increased to the available frequency bins to improve transmission reliability. The available frequency bins are allocated across the data channel according to a pattern used to spread allocated transmission power across the data channel. The frequency bin pattern is rotated among available frequency bins of the data channel, allowing different frequency bins to be used for each transmission. Accordingly, a power spectral density associated with the transmissions remains within a nominal power spectral density.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES"],"p":["The present disclosure relates generally to improving data channel reliability and more specifically to improving data channel reliability in a multi-carrier communications system.","Multiple carrier modulation systems are known in communication applications. Multiple frequency carriers within an assigned channel, i.e. frequency block, are used for transmitting data. Each of the frequency carriers is modulated with a particular set of data to be transmitted, and power is assigned to each of those frequency carriers.","As shown in prior-art , all of the frequency carriers, carriers , of an assigned data channel, identified by full bandwidth , can be used to transmit data concurrently. Full bandwidth  includes a range of frequencies from a minimum frequency F to a maximum frequency F. As each carrier of carriers  is associated with a power, a power spectral density (PSD), such as full bandwidth PSD , with a root-mean-square (rms) power level of P, can be associated with a transmission of carriers . Full bandwidth PSD  represents a PSD associated with a transmission using a majority of the frequency carriers associated with full bandwidth  concurrently. However, not all of the frequency carriers of carriers , within full bandwidth , can necessarily be received well by a receiving system.","A receiving system can have problems identifying data from some of the carriers of carriers . Noise within the full bandwidth  can be too large for carriers to be distinguished. Noise floor  identifies an average level of noise within the channel having an rms power level P. If the power associated with the carriers is not significantly greater than P, the data associated with the carriers may not be properly identified. Furthermore, interference from other carriers or other signals can make data reception difficult. Noise and interference affect the probability that data will be reliably received across a particular channel. To improve channel reliability, the power associated with carriers  should be greater than the noise or interfering signals within the channel, or full bandwidth .","A prior art method of making the carriers distinguishable over noise or interference is to increase the power of the carriers well above the power of the noise or interference. As shown in prior art , a power associated with the carriers  within the channel, identified by full bandwidth , has been increased. A new PSD, modified PSD , is shown to identify a PSD, with a maximum power level of P, associated with carriers  at the increased power levels. The increase in power makes the carriers  distinguishable over the noise floor . A nominal PSD  is used to identify a PSD, at an average power level of P, of the carriers  at a normal power level, such as full bandwidth PSD  (prior art ). A PSD mask associated with nominal PSD  is often used to identify average PSD levels that are not to be exceeded, according to particular communications specifications. To avoid transmissions of the data channel, which may interfere with transmissions of nearby data channels, the PSD of the data channel is kept within the nominal PSD . However, by increasing the power of the carriers to be well above the noise and interference, modified PSD  well exceeds the nominal PSD , possibly creating interference for other data channels. From the above discussion, it should be apparent that an improved method of increasing channel reliability, while not compromising a quality of adjacent channels, is needed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIGS. 3-7"},"Referring now to , a frequency spectrum plot illustrating transmission using an odd set of frequency bins is shown, according to one embodiment of the present disclosure. In this embodiment, it has been determined that a transmitting system is to use half of the total number of frequency bins associated with a particular data channel identified. The determination to only use half of the total number of frequency bins may be based on a maximum amount of data to be transferred and a maximum number of bits per symbol assigned to each frequency bin. With approximately half of the total number of bins being used, a transmission power provided to frequency carriers associated with the frequency bins may be increased to overcome noise or signal interference, thereby improving channel reliability. In this example, each used bin can be provided twice as much power as when all the frequency bins are used while maintaining a constant transmission power as when all the frequency bins are used.","Channel reliability can be determined in consideration of a maximum information capacity associated with the channel. Transmissions over a single data channel can be limited by the amount of data or information capacity that can be reliably transmitted across the single data channel. The information capacity theorem describes a relationship between a maximum amount of data that can be transmitted per unit time or information capacity, \u201cC\u201d of a particular channel, a channel bandwidth, \u201cB\u201d, such as full bandwidth , and a signal to noise ratio, \u201cSNR\u201d. The signal to noise ratio identifies the ratio of the power of the carriers within the channel to the power of the noise. One representation of the information capacity theorem can express channel capacity in bits per second according to the following equation:\n\nlog(1+SNR) bits per second.\n","Communicating over a fixed bandwidth, an improvement to the channel reliability is achieved through an increase in the power of the carriers, thereby increasing the signal to noise ratio. While the transmission power per carrier is increased in used odd bins , the average transmission power of all used bins remains equal to or less than an average transmission power associated with using all of the frequency bins or frequency carriers at once. By spreading the used frequency bins across the data channel, the transmission power may be spread over full bandwidth .","The frequency bins to be used can be spread across the data channel according to a specific pattern. In this example, since only half of the bins are needed, a pattern can be used consisting of only every other frequency bin. The frequency bins may be distributed with substantially uniform spacing between them. Accordingly, used odd bins  include a set of odd frequency bins in the data channel, while spacing between each of the frequency bins of used odd bins  represents unused even bins. A first odd bin  may be associated with the lowest frequency carrier within the data channel. The frequency carriers associated with the used odd bins  can be allocated enough extra power so that the signal level of each used odd bin  is substantially greater than noise floor , thereby improving a signal to noise ratio associated with the data channel and a channel reliability, as subsequently discussed in reference to . In one embodiment, only used odd bins  are used to transmit data. A collective PSD  is averaged over the full bandwidth  and remains lower than or equal to a nominal PSD . In an alternate embodiment, transmissions switch between the used odd bins  and a set of used even bins, subsequently discussed in reference to , an average PSD, collective PSD , associated with the used odd bins  and the set of used even bins is lower than or equal to the nominal PSD . The nominal PSD  can be associated with a nominal PSD occurring during a normal mode of operation or a PSD mask. It should be appreciated that the power associated with the frequency carriers of the used odd bins  is increased in respect to the power supplied to that same bin during a normal mode of operation. By increasing the power of used odd bins , the collective PSD  matches or remains below the nominal PSD . By keeping the collective PSD  below the nominal PSD , interference to other data channels with frequencies adjacent to the frequencies within full bandwidth  may be avoided. It should be noted that the term adjacent is used to describe sets of frequencies that are closer to each other within the frequency spectrum than other sets of frequencies. For example, a set of frequencies associated with a first odd bin  is adjacent to a set of frequencies associated with an unused frequency bin . However, the set of frequencies associated with first odd bin  is not adjacent to a set of frequencies associated with a second odd bin .","Referring now to , a frequency spectrum plot illustrating transmission using an even set of frequency bins is shown, orthogonal to the odd set of frequency bins identified in , according to one embodiment of the present disclosure. As discussed in reference to , a number of frequency bins to be supported can be half of the total number of frequency bins associated with a data channel, with full bandwidth . The frequency bins to be used are provided more transmission power and allocated across full bandwidth . To allow a collective PSD , associated with used even bins  and used odd bins , to remain below a nominal PSD , the transmitting system switches between activating the used even bins  and the used odd bins  (), wherein the used even bins  are orthogonal to the used odd bins .","Power to carriers associated with used even bins  are increased in comparison to power assigned to all the carriers within full bandwidth  in a normal mode. In one embodiment, the set of used frequency bins identified by used even bins  are substantially orthogonal to the set of frequency bins identified by used odd bins  in that used even bins  include frequency bins not active in used odd bins  and used odd bins  include frequency bins not active in used even bins . The pattern of bins identified by used even bins  may be recognized as being an inverse of the pattern of bins identified by used odd bins . The frequency bins in used even bins  are not used at the same time as the frequency bins of used odd bins . In one embodiment, the transmitting system uses only the used even bins  to transmit data, allowing the average PSD, collective PSD , to remain below nominal PSD . Alternatively, the transmitting system can switch between the sets of used bins  and , allowing the average PSD, collective PSD , to remain lower than nominal PSD . A first even bin  is associated with a frequency carrier adjacent to first odd bin  (). In comparison, the frequency carrier associated with first even bin  (analogous to unused frequency bin  of ) is not adjacent to a frequency carrier associated with second odd bin  (). It should be appreciated that other frequency bin use patterns can be employed without departing from the scope of the present disclosure, as subsequently discussed in reference to .","Referring now to , a frequency spectrum plot illustrating transmission using an alternate set of frequency bins is shown, according to one embodiment of the present disclosure. In one embodiment, it can be determined that only two-thirds of the total frequency bins used within a data channel identified within full bandwidth , are needed. Accordingly, a pattern of frequency bins can be established as described in used alternate bins . Accordingly, a pattern of two adjacent frequency bins can be selected for every three adjacent frequency carriers. Adjacent frequency bins are frequency bins that are associated with frequency carriers substantially closer to each other in frequency than other frequency carriers. Power is increased to the frequency carriers associated with used alternate bins  to improve the ratio of the frequency carrier signal to the noise floor .","First and second alternate bins  and  are adjacent and followed by an unused frequency bin. Third and fourth alternate bins  and  are allocated to frequency carriers adjacent to the unused frequency bin. Accordingly, substantially two-thirds of the frequency bins within full bandwidth  are used. The use of particular frequency bins can be rotated among available frequency bins to allow unused frequency bins to be included in subsequent transmissions. By rotating the use of the frequency bins, a collective PSD associated with used alternate bins  may be smoothed out over full bandwidth  and remain below the nominal PSD , despite a selective increase in power to the frequency carriers associated with the used alternate bins . For example, a first symbol could activate bins , , , ,  and . The pattern of bins used could then rotate. A next symbol could activate bins , , , ,  and . A third symbol could activate bins , , , ,  and . The pattern of bins used could then rotate. Accordingly, the next symbol could activate bins , , , ,  and  again.","Referring now to , a block diagram illustrating a communications system for allocating data to separate frequency bins to improve data channel reliability is shown and generally referenced as system , according to one embodiment of the present disclosure. A set of data to be transmitted is sent across a first set of bins, such as bins , , and , in one instance, and a second set of bins, such as bins , , and , in another instance. Power to each of the carriers in one of the sets of bins is increased to improve channel reliability.","Different frequency bins can be assigned to particular frequency carriers within the data channel. Bins - are each assigned to unique frequency carriers. While transmitting data using all the bins - concurrently, with an increased power assigned to all the carriers to improve channel reliability, can violate a particular PSD mask or predetermined nominal PSD, alternating between the first set of bins, bins , , and , and the second set of bins, , , and , allows the average PSD to remain within the PSD mask even though the power allocated to each used bin is above the nominal power. Accordingly, the power to the carriers can be increased to improve channel reliability without increasing the average PSD above a nominal PSD or PSD mask.","System  includes an initialization module  to identify a particular mode to run in, such as a normal mode in which all or most of the bins - are used at a normal power, or a high reliability mode in which the system uses only the first set of bins or the second set of bins at one time and the power provided to individual bins is higher than the power provided to individual bins in the normal mode. Recall that although the power used by individual bins is increased, the total power used by all the bins combined is not increased.","In one embodiment, the initialization module  determines a current reliability associated with the channel in the normal mode. Reliability can be based on a received signal to noise ratio. In one embodiment, a receiving system (not shown) transmits a message indicating a received signal to noise ratio to the transmitting system, system . Alternatively, a bit error rate (BER) can be used to determine reliability. The receiving system can calculate a BER associated with data received on a particular carrier. The receiving system can then transmit the BER back to system .","Initialization module  can use the signal properties provided by the receiving system, such as the BER or signal to noise ratio, to determine whether to continue in the normal mode or switch to the high reliability mode.","Initialization module  can also determine the mode based on a best data rate to be used. Upon an initialization of system , initialization module  can be used to negotiate a data rate between system  and the receiving system. The data rate can be based on a maximum data rate accepted by the receiving system. Alternatively, system  can attempt running at different data rates and wait for the receiving system to determine which data rate is best. If the data rate is significantly low, initialization module  can switch to a high reliability mode. It should be noted that switching to the high reliability mode can also allow a faster data rate, without exceeding a maximum data rate of the receiving system, to be supported using the channel. The data rate can be increased or decreased by altering a number of bits per symbol assigned to each of the carriers.","A symbol is a signal, sent over a single carrier, representing a set of bits. The number of bits per symbol includes a number of bits to be represented in one instance of a carrier. As the number of bits per symbol is increased, the data rate is increased. It should be noted that while the number of bins or frequency carriers being used concurrently is less in the high reliability mode than in the normal mode, the number of bits per symbol may be increased per carrier in the high reliability mode. Accordingly the data rate can match or exceed a current data rate in the normal mode. In one embodiment, frequency bins associated with better transmission properties, such as a better signal to noise ratio, better BER, or better reliability than other frequency bins, use a higher number of bits per symbol than the other frequency bins. The initialization module  can also be used to determine a bin pattern to use to support the current data rate, as subsequently discussed in reference to . It should also be noted that the power assigned to each of the carriers could be increased through initialization module  if the high reliability mode is selected. It should be noted that other patterns of bins could be used in other embodiments. For example, in a high reliability mode, only a quarter of the total number of carriers may be used for a given symbol. Accordingly, each carrier could be allocated four times the nominal power. The pattern of used and unused carriers could then be repeated every fourth symbol.","Data is received from a data source (not shown) through an input data port . The data source includes a collection of data to be transmitted to a receiving system. The data is provided to a mode selector . Initialization module  can provide a signal to mode selector  to identify a particular mode, a normal mode or a high reliability mode, to be supported. If a normal mode is selected, the data can be provided to a normal bin loader . Normal bin loader  uses all of the bins - to transmit the data concurrently. A signal is modulated by received data in each of the bins -. Each of the bins - are associated with a respective mixer -, to mix the signal from the bins with an appropriate frequency for the particular carrier being used by the bin. For example, a modulated signal from first bin  is mixed at a first carrier frequency by a first mixer  and a modulated signal from second bin  is mixed at a second carrier frequency by a second mixer . The modulated carrier signals may then be provided through an output signal port .","If the high reliability mode is selected through mode selector , the data can be passed to a bin set selector . The bin set selector  switches between concurrently providing data through a first set of bins and concurrently providing data to a second set of bins. In the illustrated embodiment, the bins used to transmit data in the channel are split into two sets of bins. An odd set of bins including bins , , and , and an even set of bins including bins , , and . The bins of each set are generally selected across the channel to allow an average PSD to remain below a nominal PSD. The nominal PSD can be associated with a PSD generally resulting from the normal mode or a PSD mask associated with a particular communications standard. It should be appreciated that while every other bin is being selected in each set in the illustrated embodiment, other bin patterns can be selected, such as described in reference to , without departing from the scope of the present disclosure.","Data is provided to odd bin loader  through bin set selector . Odd bin loader  provides data to bins , , and  for concurrent transmission through the bins' respective carrier frequencies. In another instance, data is provided to even bin loader  through bin set selector . Even bin loader  provides the data to bins , , and  for concurrent transmission through their respective carrier frequencies. Bin set selector  continues to switch between odd bin loader  and even bin loader . In this example, at any instance, only every other bin and frequency carrier in the channel is active. Accordingly, while the power per each frequency carrier has been increased in the high reliability mode, the average PSD is still kept within the nominal PSD. It should be appreciated that while only frequency bins - are shown and discussed in , other frequency bins may also be included without departing from the scope of the present disclosure.","Referring now to , a flow diagram illustrating a method of improving channel reliability is shown, according to one embodiment of the present disclosure. A transmitting system identifies and corrects for channel reliability. In step , the transmitting system determines channel reliability. As previously discussed, the channel reliability can be determined according to a current power associated with the carriers and a signal to noise ratio. Accordingly, the signal to noise ratio can be calculated by a receiving system and provided back to the transmitting system. Similarly a BER associated with data demodulated in a receiving system can be returned to the transmitting system. The transmitting system can also negotiate a data rate with the receiving system. If the best data rate to be used is low, the transmitting system can mark a current operating mode as unreliable, and switch to a more reliable communications mode.","In step , it is determined if the current mode of operation is reliable. If the transmitting system is operating within acceptable parameters, the transmitting system can decide to operate in a normal mode, as in step . In step , the transmitting system engages a normal communications mode in which most or all of the carriers associated with a data channel are used at a normal power. If the current operating mode is not reliable, the transmitting system can prepare to engage a high reliability mode. It should be noted that the transmitting system can engage the normal mode and the high reliability mode to determine which mode offers the best performance. Furthermore, the transmitting system may always operate in the high reliability mode to ensure proper reception of data.","In step , a nominal PSD is identified. In one embodiment, the nominal PSD is associated with a PSD of transmissions when the transmitting system is running in the normal mode. In another mode, the nominal PSD is associated with a PSD mask specified by a communications standard. For examples the IEEE 802.11a standard specifies an acceptable PSD template, measured over a 30 kHz bandwidth, for the transmitting system. In step , the transmitting system identifies a number of frequency bins to be supported. The number of frequency bins is selected from, and less than, a total number of usable frequency bins associated with the data channel. The number of frequency bins to be supported can be based on a data rate negotiated between the transmitting system and the receiving system. For example, by comparing the data rate with the number of bits represented by each carrier signal, the transmitting system can determine the number of frequency carriers or frequency bins necessary to support the data rate. It can be determined that only half of the frequency carriers of the data channel are needed. Or, for example, the transmitting system can determine it needs two-thirds of the maximum number of frequency carriers associated with the data channel. It should be noted that the total number of usable frequency bins associated with a data channel can be less than a maximum number of frequency bins associated with a data channel. Some frequency bins or frequency carriers associated with a data channel may be reserved for control data. For example, some bins may be dedicated to communicate the method of bin-mapping a transmitter is using in a high reliability mode.","In step , the transmitting system identifies sets of frequency bins to be supported. The sets of frequency bins include a number of frequency bins up to the number of frequency bins identified in step . The frequency bins of each set are selected in patterns to spread the usage of frequency carriers across the data channel. For example, if the number of frequency bins to be supported is half of the total number of frequency bins associated with the channel, a pattern of every other frequency bin can be selected, as discussed in reference to . If the number of frequency bins to be supported is one-third of the frequency bins, then the pattern of frequency bin in the frequency bin set may only include every third frequency bin. If two-thirds of the frequency bins are to be supported, the pattern of frequency bins can include a pattern of two used frequency bins followed by an unused frequency bin, as previously discussed in reference to . The frequency bins of each set of frequency bins should mostly include bins not used by another set of frequency bins. For example, a first set of frequency bins may include only odd frequency bins, and the second set of frequency bins may include only even frequency bins. The set, or sets, of frequency bins to be used can be stored, such as in a look-up table, and the transmitting system may only need to select the sets of frequency bins to match the number of frequency bins to be supported.","In step , power to each of the frequency carriers of the sets of frequency bins is increased to improve transmission reliability. The power can be increased up to a point at which an average PSD, which will be associated with a transmission using the sets of frequency bins, matches the nominal PSD identified in step . Instep , the transmitting system provides data to the first set of usable frequency bins determined in step . In one embodiment, after the data has been concurrently transmitted using the first set of frequency bins, the transmitting system disables the first set of frequency bins. In step , the transmitting system provides data to the second set of usable frequency bins determined in step . After the data has been concurrently transmitted using the second set of frequency bins, the transmitting system disables the second set of frequency bins. The transmitting system then returns to step  to re-enable the first set of frequency bins. Accordingly, the transmitting system cycles between the first and second set of frequency bins, allowing the average PSD to be smoothed out over the available bandwidth. Alternatively, the transmitting system may continue to use either the first set of frequency bins or the second set of frequency bins exclusively. By using only the first set of frequency bins or the second set of frequency bins at one time, the average PSD can remain lower or equivalent to the nominal PSD.","The systems described herein can be part of an information handling system. The term \u201cinformation handling system\u201d refers to any system that is capable of processing information or transferring information from one source to another. An information handling system can be a single device, such as a computer, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a hand held computing device, a cable set-top box, an Internet capable device, a cellular phone, and the like. Alternatively, an information handling system can refer to a collection of such devices. It should be appreciated that the system described herein has the advantage of improving data channel reliability without violating an established nominal power spectral density.","In the preceding detailed description of the embodiments, reference has been made to the accompanying drawings which form a part thereof, and in which is shown by way of illustration specific embodiments in which the disclosure can be practiced.
