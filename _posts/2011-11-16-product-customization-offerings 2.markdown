{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Software or program code for a particular product customization offering (e.g., offer to add a monogram to the product in the product catalog) is specifically written for a product in a product catalog in many cases when product customization offerings are built for an online retail environment. This does not provide much flexibility for a merchant to further enhance the options provided in a particular customization offering without requiring additional manual writing of the necessary code.","Embodiments of the disclosure include computing infrastructure and resources that can facilitate multiple electronic marketplaces on behalf of multiple sellers and retailers. This infrastructure can include a product catalog that can house information about the various products, services and\/or content made available by sellers in various marketplaces. Such a product catalog can be structured in a way to provide various possible fields, or attributes, that a seller can populate with product information. One such attribute involves product customization, where product customizations may be augmentations in terms of services on a product (e.g., monogramming, gift wrapping, etc.) or actual variance in the purchased product (e.g., choosing to add additional memory to a laptop computer).","The product catalog structure can be shared across various sellers and marketplaces to avoid the requirement of maintaining multiple product catalog structures. However, certain sellers and\/or marketplaces operated by various sellers may desire alternative customization offerings. Accordingly, embodiments of the disclosure allow a seller or other authorized user to add product customization offerings to a product catalog with which they are associated. In the following discussion, a general description of the system and its components is provided, followed by a discussion of the operation of the same.","With reference to , shown is a networked environment  according to various embodiments. The depicted networked environment  illustrates one example of an implementation of a system according to an embodiment of the disclosure. It should be appreciated that embodiments of the disclosure can be implemented in various ways. The networked environment  includes at least one computing device  and one or more clients  in communication over a network . The network  includes, for example, the Internet, intranets, extranets, wide area networks (WANs), local area networks (LANs), wired networks, wireless networks, or other suitable networks, etc., or any combination of two or more such networks.","The computing device  may comprise, for example, a server computer or any other system providing computing capability. Alternatively, a plurality of computing devices  may be employed that are arranged, for example, in one or more server banks or computer banks or other arrangements. For example, a plurality of computing devices  together may comprise a cloud computing resource, a grid computing resource, and\/or any other distributed computing arrangement. Such computing devices  may be located in a single installation or may be distributed among many different geographical locations. For purposes of convenience, the computing device  is referred to herein in the singular. Even though the computing device is referred to in the singular, it is understood that a plurality of computing devices  may be employed in the various arrangements as described above.","The computing device  and the services and data accessible to the computing device  can facilitate one or more electronic marketplaces . An electronic marketplace  can include an electronic commerce site and\/or storefront powered by the resources of the computing device . For example, a retailer may establish their own electronic commerce sites through which they can offer products to users, and the various electronic commerce sites can be powered by the applications and data accessible to the computing device . To this end, various applications and\/or other functionality may be executed in the computing device  according to various embodiments. Also, various data is stored in a data store  that is accessible to the computing device . The data store  may be representative of a plurality of data stores as can be appreciated. The data stored in the data store , for example, is associated with the operation of the various applications and\/or functional entities described below. It should be appreciated that the data store  may or may not reside within a computing device , but may be accessible via a network to the computing device .","The components executed on the computing device , for example, include an electronic commerce application , a data store management application , a seller portal , search engine , and other applications, services, processes, systems, engines, or functionality not discussed in detail herein. The electronic commerce application  can facilitate the various electronic marketplaces  associated with one or more retailers through which customers can purchase, rent, and\/or download products. To this end, the electronic commerce application  can process orders on behalf of customers and transmit network pages or other user interface elements that can be rendered on a client . Similarly, the electronic commerce application  can receive data from a client  pertaining to product selections, payment information, and other data necessary to effectuate an electronic commerce site.","The data stored in the data store  includes, for example, product data , electronic marketplace data , and potentially other data, such as order data, browse data, etc. Product data  can include various information about products available via an electronic commerce system facilitated by the computing device . The product data  can include a product catalog , which can include various product entries  that are associated with products, services, and\/or content that can be offered by sellers in various electronic marketplaces  facilitated by the computing device .","A product entry  may refer to a product, good, service, software download, multimedia download, social networking profile, or any combination, bundle, or package thereof, that may be offered for sale, purchase, rental, lease, download, and\/or any other form of consumption as may be appreciated. The various data stored in product catalog  may include attributes . Further, product entries  may be associated with product attributes , which contain information specific to a product to which a product entry  corresponds, which can include a product category and\/or other data with which a product can be related to others in the product catalog .","Various attributes may comprise seller data including pricing data and inventory data. For example, titles, descriptions, quantities, conditions, images, options, weights, customer reviews, customer ratings, keywords, shipping restrictions, prices, tax classifications, unique identifiers, and any other data related to product entries or items  may be included. Therefore, the product catalog  may include information or attributes  related to a plurality of product entries or items  offered in the electronic marketplace by one or more sellers. The product catalog  may also include product customization attributes  involving product customization offerings, in accordance with the present disclosure. Accordingly, a subset of product attributes  may include product customization attributes  which describe customizations options and features for a product.","Attributes  can also include information about a marketplace with which the product is associated, such as, for example, a marketplace identifier and\/or a seller identifier. Attributes  can also include browse nodes to which a product is assigned. In this context, a browse node can include a category or a part of a hierarchy to which a product is assigned. Information contained in attributes , including product customization attributes , may appear on a product detail page and may also be used to help customers find a desired product or product offering in search results.","Product customization offerings delineated by the product customization attributes  may differ according to the merchant selling a product. In one embodiment, all available product customization offerings may be initially displayed on a particular product detail page and then depending on which product customization offerings a user selects, the merchants or sellers offering the product are narrowed or restricted in the display to those that offer the selected product customization offerings. Also, in one embodiment, the product detail page may display the product and then list the merchants offering the product including a list of the available product customizations offered by the merchants.","The product catalog  can be associated with a product catalog structure that describes how the various product entries  are structured. The data store  can employ the same product catalog structure for various products that can be offered across various electronic marketplaces  and by various sellers. In this way, product data can be surfaced for display in a user interface, orders processed, and other functions can be performed across various electronic marketplaces  against a common product catalog structure in the data store .","The electronic marketplace data  includes data relating to one or more electronic marketplaces in which multiple sellers participate. For example, the electronic marketplace data  may include data relating to various customers who have accounts with the electronic marketplace and\/or customers who have placed orders with sellers through the electronic marketplace. The order data includes data relating to a plurality of orders placed by customers through the electronic marketplace. The browse data includes data relating to the browsing of the offerings of the electronic marketplace by customers. Such browse data may include records of selections, click trails, page views, and\/or other data related to browsing the electronic marketplace.","The seller data includes various data relating to sellers participating in the electronic marketplace such as, for example, pricing data, inventory data, and other data. The pricing data describes the pricing of the various product entries  offered by the seller in the electronic marketplace. The inventory data describes the current inventory of the various product entries  offered by the seller in the electronic marketplace.","The seller client and the customer client are each representative of a respective plurality of client devices that may be coupled to the network . The seller client and the customer client may each comprise, for example, a processor-based system such as a computer system. Such a computer system may be embodied in the form of a desktop computer, a laptop computer, a personal digital assistant, a cellular telephone, set-top box, music players, web pads, tablet computer systems, game consoles, smartphones, electronic book readers, or other devices with like capability. The seller client may include a display , and the customer client may include a display . The display ,  may comprise, for example, one or more devices such as cathode ray tubes (CRTs), liquid crystal display (LCD) screens, gas plasma-based flat panel displays, LCD projectors, or other types of display devices, etc.","The seller client may be configured to execute various applications such as a client application  and\/or other applications. The client application  may be executed in a seller client , for example, to access and render network content such as network data served up by the computing device  and\/or other servers. The client application  thereby generates rendered content  on the display . The seller client may be configured to execute applications beyond client application  such as, for example, browser applications, mobile applications, email applications, instant message applications, and\/or other applications.","The customer client may be configured to execute various applications such as a client application  and\/or other applications. The client application  may be executed in a customer client , for example, to access and render network content such as network data served up by the computing device  and\/or other servers. The client application  thereby generates rendered content  on the display . The customer client may be configured to execute applications beyond client application  such as, for example, browser applications, mobile applications, email applications, instant message applications, and\/or other applications.","Next, a general description of the operation of the various components of the networked environment  is provided. To begin, sellers at seller clients register with the electronic marketplace and configure offerings of various product entries . Accordingly, a seller may sell an item that is not currently sold in the marketplace and configure a product entry for this item. Also, the seller may sell an item that is an existing item in the marketplace. In either case, the seller may also provide item attributes and product customization options associated with the product entry for the item.","Therefore, sellers may specify inventory quantities, initial pricing, and\/or other configuration parameters. Customers at customer clients browse a network site served up by the electronic commerce application  which corresponds to the electronic marketplace. Various data in the electronic marketplace data  and the product catalog  may be employed to serve up network data as network pages or other forms of network content to be rendered as rendered content  by the client application  in the customer client ","A search engine  may be provided for customers to search for products of interest. Some products may be offered by multiple sellers, possibly at different prices and with different conditions. The customers may view information related to several sellers and ultimately decide to purchase a product from one or more of the sellers. Consequently, the customers initiate the checkout process and complete orders via an order pipeline of the electronic commerce application . Order history in the order data and browse history in the browse data may be created from the customer interactions. Inventory data may be updated based at least in part on the orders.","The seller portal  provides assistance functionality to sellers to manage their presence in the electronic marketplace. The seller portal  generates network data corresponding to user interfaces. The network data is sent over the network  for rendering as rendered content  by a client application  executed in a seller client ","For example, a user may access an electronic marketplace  associated with a first retailer, which can cause network pages associated with the retailer's site to be transmitted to the user client. A user may search, browse, and\/or purchase products from the first retailer's electronic marketplace , which can be facilitated by the electronic commerce application . Similarly, a user may access an electronic marketplace  associated with a second retailer, which can likewise cause network pages associated with the retailer's site to be transmitted to the user client. The electronic marketplace  associated with the second retailer may comprise different user interface elements and other site elements, which can be customized according to a site look and feel desired by a retailer. Accordingly, the computing device  may execute various applications or services through which a seller can manage and\/or access various information about an electronic marketplace  facilitated by the electronic commerce application . The specific functionality and various implementations of an electronic commerce application  that facilitates an electronic marketplace  should be appreciated by a person of ordinary skill in the art, and is not discussed in detail herein.","The data store management application  is executed to provide mechanisms by which users (e.g., sellers, retailers, etc.) can access data pertaining to products offered by the seller via an electronic marketplace . In other words, the data store management application  can allow a seller to access a product catalog  stored in a data store  accessible to the electronic commerce application . Accordingly, the data store management application  can generate a user interface that can be accessible in a browser or other type of application executed in a client  in which a user can view a product catalog structure as well as add or modify entries  in a product catalog , such as those involving product customizations.","In the context of this disclosure, the data store management application  can also allow a seller to define product customization attributes . As one example, assuming a product catalog structure specifies various product catalog entries , a seller may wish to define customization offerings for particular products in particular product categories. Accordingly, rather than requiring a seller to request a software developer or other technician for specific product customization offerings to be tailored for specific products in specific product categories, a user interface is generated for a client (e.g., logic that generates a network page displaying the product catalog ) allowing the seller to define such a product customization attribute , which can be stored in the data store . Accordingly, the data store management application  can provide mechanisms whereby a user can select a product category or applicable subcategories and define a customization offering in a product catalog structure based upon a template provided for the selected category\/subcategory.","In some embodiments, the functionality of the data store management application  may be included in the electronic commerce application . In other embodiments, the data store management application , seller portal , and\/or search engine  may be executed as a sub-module of the electronic commerce application , or as a separate, standalone application, etc.","As referenced above, embodiments of the disclosure can facilitate creation of product customization attributes  associated with a product catalog . Additionally, in one embodiment, the creation of the product customization attributes  can be accomplished via a general user interface that is subject to being adapted for use with products in a multitude of product categories, where the product customization attributes  share the same fundamental structure.","Embodiments of the data store management application  can provide various mechanisms with which a seller can create a product customization attribute . In one embodiment, the data store management application  can provide a user interface on a client application  (e.g., browser) in which a seller can load a template interface for a selected product category or subcategory in which the template interface provides selectable options for specifying desired customization parameters. Therefore, to specify the available customization offerings for a first product in a first category, the seller can utilize the template interface designed for the first category. As an example, a template interface for an automobile category is built with an option for the seller to specify that a satellite radio is a customizable product offering. Whereas, a template interface for a tennis racket category is built with an option for a service to tighten the strings of the racket and does not include the option of offering a satellite radio. Also, in some embodiments, a template interface for a particular item may be provided, such as a particular model of tennis racket.","In another embodiment, the data store management application  can provide an application programming interface (API) with which a seller system can interact to create and\/or manage an individualized template for a product for which a template interface may not be available or may not be to a seller's liking. Therefore, the seller can define its own template interface to design particular product customization(s) that may not be supported by the templates previously provided. After the template interface is created, it may be stored and used at subsequent times. Alternatively, the application programming interface (API) may be used to create the product customization attribute directly from the API without creation of (and therefore bypassing use of) the template interface.","Embodiments of the data store management application , therefore, utilize an architecture that enables merchants and sellers to build a type of product customization offering without being constrained by a definite particular schema or format. Via product customization templates and\/or API, embodiments enable the seller to graphically select requisite parameters or be prompted to submit information that will define the seller's desired product customization offering. In one embodiment, the seller is walked through defining its customization attributes for a particular product via the template interface or API. Accordingly, in a serial manner, the seller is provided design choices via a graphical interface and selects the desired choice and then proceeds to the next step in defining the product customization attribute .","Turning now to , shown is one example of a user interface  that can be rendered in a client application  () (e.g., browser) on a seller client (). The depicted user interface  can be generated by the electronic commerce application  () in concert with the data store management application  () so that a user can create product customization attributes  () in a product catalog  (). In the depicted example, the user interface  can allow a seller associated with an electronic marketplace  and\/or sales listings in an electronic marketplace  () to view, search, browse, etc., or perform other actions related to product entries  () in a product catalog . The example of  illustrates an example of a user interface  in which a product entry  to be associated with a seller is displayed. The item associated with the product entry may be a preexisting product in the seller's product catalog or may be an item already offered via the marketplace and is being added to the seller's product catalog. The various product attributes  () shown in  are associated with the underlying product catalog structure. However, the user interface  also illustrates one example of a selectable control  for a seller to create a product customization attribute .","In , the product entry being shown is named as \u201cPolo Shirt\u201d under the product category \u201cMen Short Sleeve Casual Shirt.\u201d Attributes associated with the product entry include the manufacturer being identified as \u201cWidget Co.\u201d, manufacturer's suggested retail price (MSRP) of $15.99, a list price of $15.50, and a current price of $13.50. Child attributes for the product entry include a variation of the shirt being provided as color red and size medium, where 913 units of this shirt are in stock, and the stock keeping unit (SKU) code for this variation of the product is 343D5E4356AR. The child attributes further include an additional variation of the shirt being provided as color blue, size large, where 99 units of the shirt are in stock, and the stock keeping unit (SKU) code for this variation of the product is 343D5E4356AB.","Continuing the example of , reference is now made to , which illustrates an example of a user interface  in which a seller can define a product customization attribute  (). In particular, the user interface  provides a template interface suited for the particular product category of the product entry  (). In the depicted example, a user is provided an option of selecting a previously defined product customization attribute via dropdown box  or to create a new product customization attribute via interface box . For example, the user may have previously created a product customization offering for a different type of shirt that is applicable to the polo shirt being currently considered. Therefore, the user could select this product customization attribute via the dropdown box  and have it applied towards the product entry corresponding to the polo shirt. Otherwise, the user can specify a product customization offering using the interface box .","In the interface box , the user is prompted (in input box ) to specify a name or other identifier associated with the product customization attribute . Here, the user has entered \u201cSelect a Custom Logo\u201d as the name for the product customization attribute . Additionally, a user can identify or designate a set of options particular to the product customization offering being defined. For instance, a user may select a type of product customization or augmentation in a dropdown box . Therefore, the options that follow may be adaptive and responsive to the choice selected in the dropdown box . Therefore, if a different option was selected in the dropdown box , different options may be presented under the dropdown box .","Here, the user selected the type of customization to be a custom logo. It may be that the user is provided a list of a multitude of different types of customizations from which to select. To demonstrate,  depicts the user interface with the dropdown box  displaying a menu of available choices, such as monogramming the shirt, selecting a special packaging for the shirt (e.g., a special gift box), choosing an option of requesting tailoring of the shirt, etc.","Referring back to , the user is prompted to select the possible locations for placing the logo (being customized) on the shirt. Further, a variety of locations may be grouped together as a set of options from which the user can select his or her desired choice. For example, a first group (G1) of locations consists of the right sleeve, the left sleeve, and both sleeves, as indicated by the checkboxes selected by the user. Additional groups may also be specified. In this case, the user has specified a second group (G2) consisting of the shirt pocket and the right side. Accordingly, the user may allow for two logos to be added to the shirt, where one logo is positioned in one of the options provided in the first group and a second logo is positioned in one of the options provided in the second group. Alternatively, the user may allow for one logo to be added to the shirt, where one logo is positioned in either one of the options provided in the first group or one of the options provided in the second group. To designate which of these possibilities is desired, the user can select the button next to the And\/Or option under the first group (G1). In this example, the user has selected the Or option so either an option selected from the first group or an option selected from the second group is allowed. Accordingly, using the template of the user interface , the user can make graphical choices as to how a product customization offering for a particular product should be set up. It is noted that if the product was a vest jacket, then a different template would be used and different options would be presented. For example, for a vest jacket, an option would not be provided to customize a sleeve, since a vest jacket does not contain any sleeves.","Moving on to , the process of creating the product customization attribute may continue with a series of user interfaces being provided one after another, in one embodiment. In , a user interface  is provided with updated contents to the interface box . Here, the user is prompted to select the logos to be offered as options in the product customization offering for the product entry  (). In this example, the user selected to offer three logos, Logo 1, Logo 2, and Logo 3 as a single group (G4), where this offering group is connected to the previous choices with an AND designation.","Additionally, for Logo 1 and Logo 2, the user selected to upload images for the logos and for Logo 3, the user has selected to allow a customer to upload his or her own image to be used as a logo. Therefore, the user has not uploaded an image for Logo 3.","The customization options offered for a product may vary by merchant or seller. Thus, in one embodiment, customization offerings presented to a consumer depends on which merchant the consumer chooses to buy from. For example, a first merchant may allow adding a logo as a customization option, a second merchant may only offer a few logos, a third merchant may only allow adding your name, etc.","Various embodiments of the user interface  may provide additional configurable options. For example, the user may assign fees to respective customization offerings or subset of offerings via the \u201cAssign Fees\u201d button. Further, via the \u201cPreview\u201d button, an exemplary user interface provides an option to see a preview of a representative user interface from a buyer's perspective offering the product customizations that are being designed, before submitting the selected options in the offering. In one embodiment, the user interface may also provide a preview of the type of underlying data that would be available to be provided to the seller for the product customization offering. The options and controls provided in the user interface  are not meant to be limiting. For example, various embodiments may provide a different arrangement, where controls and interface tools may be provided on a side of the interface.","In one embodiment, the data store management application  () can validate the selected options to ensure that the product customization attribute  () complies with business rules or syntax supported by the data store  (). As another example, the data store management application  can validate whether the product customization attribute  specifies a price or fee to be associated with possible options designated within the product customization offering. In one embodiment, the data store management  enlists or executes authorization attributes to verify that a product customization attribute  complies with applicable business rules and syntax before allowing the attribute to be stored in the data store . Accordingly, authorization attributes may be classified or broken down by product categories.","In one embodiment, the business rules may be predefined or configured by the seller. For example, a user interface may be provided for a seller to specify \u201cbanned\u201d terms or certain types of photos or images that cannot be added as logos (e.g., adult content), an acceptable size of the logo (e.g., logo for a sleeve cannot be larger than a stated size, while logo for the front of the shirt can be larger, etc.), an acceptable file size of a logo image to be uploaded, etc.","Upon submission of the product customization attribute  as shown in , the product entry  in the product catalog  () may be updated with the newly added product customization attribute(s) . Turning now to , shown is one example of a user interface  that can be rendered in a client application  () (e.g., browser) on a seller client (). In the depicted example, the user interface  provides a view of the product catalog structure for a product entry  (), as previously represented in . However, a product customization offering has been added as reflected by the product customization attributes  () to select a custom logo, where one attribute involves an offering as to where on the sleeve(s) of the shirt the logo is to be placed and the second attribute involves an offering as to identify the particular logo to be used.","Further, upon submission of the product customization attribute  as shown in , the data store management application  () can display a product customization offering associated with the product entry  within the electronic marketplace  for a particular seller. In the case of the example in , a presentation layer can access the product customization attribute  \u201cSelect a Custom Logo\u201d associated with a particular product entry . In addition, multiple product customization offerings may be displayed for product entries offered by multiple merchants corresponding to the same product item. For example, multiple merchants may offer the same shirt for sale, where Merchant 1 only allows adding a logo to the front of the shirt, Merchant 2 allows adding a logo to the front of the shirt and sleeves, Merchant 3 only offers monogramming, etc.","Referring now to , an exemplary user interface  for presenting the product customization offering defined in  to a customer or prospective buyer is depicted. In the figure, an item detail page for a Men's Golf Shirt provides an option  to customize or augment the shirt in addition to purchasing the shirt. In response to selecting the option , a user interface  may be caused to be displayed on a customer's browser. Accordingly, the user interface  prompts the customer to select a position on a shirt to place a logo design, where the available options are the ones previously defined by the seller in creating the product customization attribute  () in . Further, the customer is prompted to select a particular logo design, where the available logo options are the ones selected by the seller in . In one embodiment, at the onset of selecting or configuring the type of product customization that is desired, all customization options available by the sellers offering the shirt are displayed (e.g., add a logo, monogram, etc.). And then as the user specifies or selects desired options (e.g., the user selects to add a logo on the right sleeve), certain other options might be ghosted out or made not available for selection, since these options are no longer applicable with the choices made by the user. Alternatively, if the user selects an option that is not valid with the seller's product customization offering or prescribed business rules, an error message or screen may be displayed to the user instructing the user to make another selection. For example, the seller may be able to specify a business rule that only the last names of current players on the Atlanta Braves are able to be added to the back of a replica Atlanta Braves jersey being sold in the seller's product catalog. Therefore, if a customer attempts to add the name of a Philadelphia Phillies player to the back of the jersey (that is not specified within an acceptable list of names for the product item), the customer may be instructed to make another selection.","Accordingly, the user interface  is driven by the same information the seller entered when specifying the product customization attribute  for the product entry  (). The user interface  may also provide a preview button  to see an image of a model of the shirt according to the particular customization options selected by the customer. In this example, the customer has selected the option of placing a logo named Logo 1 on the right sleeve of the shirt.","Therefore, if these options were selected and purchased with the shirt listed on the item detail page, data would be created for the purchase contract, in one embodiment. This data may include the SKUs (stock keeping unit identifiers) for the particular customization offerings that can only be purchased in the context of product entries  to which the product customization attributes are children. From the foregoing examples, sellers can extend customization to their catalog of products in a self-service manner and not enlist the instruction of a platform developer or technician for the online retail website.","An additional benefit of creating of product customization attributes  is that the attributes  provide helpful search criteria. For example, in , a user interface  to a search engine  () is depicted, where keywords to a search query may describe a product customization offering or may be relevant to a product customization offering for one of the products in the product catalog  (). Accordingly, a search engine  can filter search criteria by augmentation or customization criteria. For instance, a customer may be looking for a monogrammed bathrobe, where the customer can narrow down the available choices by first searching for monogrammed bathrobes and then further narrowing the choices by choosing a color. Referring to , a search query \u201cCustomize Logo on Shirt\u201d is input into a search engine  that returns the results of two products from the catalog  that offer a product customization offering involving logos on shirts.","Referring next to , shown is a flowchart that provides one example of the operation of a portion of the computing device  () (e.g., electronic commerce application  () in concert with the data store management application  ()) according to various embodiments. It is understood that the flowchart of  provides merely an example of the many different types of functional arrangements that may be employed to implement the operation of the portion of the data store management application  as described herein. As an alternative, the flowchart of  may be viewed as depicting an example of steps of a method implemented in the computing device  () according to one or more embodiments.","Beginning with box , the computing device  can receive a request to create a product customization attribute  () associated with a product entry  () in a product catalog  (). As described above, the product customization attribute  is a feature or group of features of the product entry that involves product customization or augmentation offerings available to a customer. Further, the product customization attribute  can be defined using a prebuilt template interface corresponding to the category designation assigned to the product, where a different template is provided per product category. In another embodiment, the computing device  can provide an application programming interface (API) with which a seller system can interact to create and\/or manage an individualized template for a product for which a template interface may not be available or may not be to a seller's liking. Creation of a new template is carried out in a similar manner as how a seller may define a product customization offering using the interfaces of , except that the seller may consider more possible choices and make more decisions given that the vast customization possibilities that are possible, where the desired options may need to be specified from all the possibilities. Therefore, the seller can select options that help define the product customization attribute and the associated product customization offering which are received in box .","In box , the computing device  can validate the selected product customization attribute against a rule set of business rules. According to various embodiments, the business rules may be established by the electronic marketplace or may be configured by the individual seller itself. Next, in box , the computing device  can generate an entry corresponding to the product customization attribute  to be associated with the product entry  in a product catalog . Such an entry  can identify an electronic marketplace  () and\/or seller with which the product customization attribute  is associated. In box , the entry  containing the product customization attribute  can be stored in the data store . Further, other attributes may also be associated and contained as part of the product entry .","Therefore, a seller may specify a product customization offering offered for the seller with respect to a product entry in the seller's product catalog . One of the attributes associated with this product entry may also be a standard product identification number (e.g., Amazon Standard Identification Number, Universal Product Code, International Standard Book Number, etc.) for the product item corresponding to the product entry .
