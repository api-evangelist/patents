{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Mobile phones have become ubiquitous in recent years. People have come to rely on mobile phones to the point that they are quickly replacing traditional landline phone services. Short message service (SMS) text messaging has also become popular. Mobile phone technology has also experienced great advancements in recent years. Personal digital assistant (PDA) technology has merged with the mobile phone, resulting in the smartphone.","The present disclosure relates to facilitating remote access to mobile communication devices such as smartphones, satellite phones, marine radios, and other mobile communication devices. For a variety of reasons, people may want to place calls or send text messages from their mobile telephones remotely. As a non-limiting example, a person may be traveling internationally and mobile telephone access may be unavailable or otherwise prohibitively expensive. Nonetheless, access to the Internet may be available. Although various voice over internet protocol (VoIP) services may be employed, users are not able to configure such services to use their mobile telephone number for caller identification. Consequently, friends or other contacts of the users may be reluctant to answer the call if the caller identification does not reflect a known number.","Various embodiments of the present disclosure allow users to access their mobile phones and\/or other mobile communication devices remotely, which may allow the users to place calls and send text messages from their mobile phones or other devices from any location with network access. Accordingly, the caller identification for such calls or text messages is set to the mobile phone or communication device of the respective user because the mobile phone is, in fact, originating the call on the cellular network. Furthermore, users may remotely access important data stored on their mobile phones or other communication devices, such as contact data and so on. In some embodiments, supervisory users may access the personal mobile phones or other communication devices of other users for audits, monitoring, support, and\/or other purposes. In the following discussion, a general description of the system and its components is provided, followed by a discussion of the operation of the same.","With reference to , shown is a networked environment  according to various embodiments. The networked environment  includes one or more communication devices , one or more computing devices , and one or more clients  in data communication by way of a first network . The first network  includes, for example, the Internet, intranets, extranets, wide area networks (WANs), local area networks (LANs), wired networks, wireless networks, or other suitable networks, etc., or any combination of two or more such networks. The communication devices  may be coupled to a second network  such as a cellular network, a marine radio network, a satellite network, an encrypted government network, a universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS) network, global system for mobile communications (GSM) network, code division multiple access (CDMA) network, or other mobile communications network. The second network  may be coupled to the first network , but it may be the case that the first network  and the second network  do not interoperate directly.","The communication devices  correspond to processor-based devices with capability to connect to the second network  to place and receive telephone calls, short message service (SMS) text messages, email messages, and\/or other communications. The communication devices  may be coupled to the Internet by way of the second network  and\/or the first network . In one embodiment, a communication device  may include a Wi-Fi interface to the first network  and may be capable of handling VoIP-based calls over the first network . The communication device  may correspond to a smartphone, a feature phone, a satellite phone, a marine radio, a government radio, or other type of communications device .","The communication device  may have a display  such as a liquid crystal display (LCD) panel, organic light emitting diode (OLED) panel, or other form of display.

In various embodiments, the communication device  may have various input devices  such as, for example, a touchscreen, fixed keyboard, retractable keyboard, keypad, microphone, digital camera, global positioning system (GPS) device, accelerometer, infrared transceiver, Bluetooth\u00ae transceiver, and\/or other input devices. The communication device  may also have various output devices  such as, for example, audio devices, indicator lights, vibration devices, and so on.","Various applications and\/or other functionality may be executed in the communication device  according to various embodiments. The components executed on the communication device , for example, include a communication application , user applications , a remote access application , and other applications, services, processes, systems, engines, or functionality not discussed in detail herein. The communication application  is executed to place and answer telephone calls or other communications over the second network . In some embodiments, the communication application  may be configured to place and answer telephone calls over the first network  using VoIP or another technology, but it is understood that the same caller identification may be employed through the first network  as with the second network . The communication application  may also be employed to send and receive SMS text messages or other text messages over the second network  and\/or the first network  using the same caller identification.","The user applications  correspond to various applications that may be executed in the communication device . Such user applications  may include games, email applications, browser applications, contact management applications, instant message applications, photo editor applications, video creator applications, and\/or other applications.","The remote access application  is executed to facilitate remote access to the communication device  over the first network  and\/or the second network . To this end, the remote access application  may capture a video signal corresponding to the screen  and an audio signal and transmit the signals to the computing device  and\/or the client . In some embodiments, the remote access application  includes one or more media encoders  to encode the video signal and\/or audio signal into a media stream. The media encoders  may correspond to, for example, Moving Pictures Experts Group (MPEG) encoders, H.264 encoders, Flash\u00ae video encoders, etc. Such media encoders  may be selected according to factors such as, for example, data reduction, encoding quality, latency, etc. In some embodiments, the remote access application  may facilitate remote control of the communication device  by way of an application programming interface (API) rather than a video signal of a media stream.","The remote access application  may send the media stream to the client  and\/or the computing device  in the communications output data . The remote access application  may also obtain various data from the client  and\/or the computing device  in the communications input data . The communications input data  may correspond to audio signals, input commands, text message input, and\/or other forms of input data. The communication device  may also store various data as device data . The device data  may include, for example, photos, videos, audio files, contact data, saved text messages, saved voicemails, and\/or other data.","The computing device  may comprise, for example, a server computer or any other system providing computing capability. Alternatively, a plurality of computing devices  may be employed that are arranged, for example, in one or more server banks or computer banks or other arrangements. For example, a plurality of computing devices  together may comprise a cloud computing resource, a grid computing resource, and\/or any other distributed computing arrangement. Such computing devices  may be located in a single installation or may be distributed among many different geographical locations. For purposes of convenience, the computing device  is referred to herein in the singular. Even though the computing device  is referred to in the singular, it is understood that a plurality of computing devices  may be employed in the various arrangements as described above.","Various applications and\/or other functionality may be executed in the computing device  according to various embodiments. Also, various data is stored in a data store  that is accessible to the computing device . The data store  may be representative of a plurality of data stores  as can be appreciated. The data stored in the data store , for example, is associated with the operation of the various applications and\/or functional entities described below.","The components executed on the computing device , for example, include a server application  and other applications, services, processes, systems, engines, or functionality not discussed in detail herein. The server application  is executed to generate an interface for clients  to interact with the remote access applications  on the communication devices . To this end, the server application  may generate one or more network pages, such as web pages or other forms of network content. The network pages may include the streaming video and\/or audio generated by the remote access application .","In various embodiments, images of virtual input devices may be rendered in conjunction with the streaming video and\/or audio from the communication device . For example, a virtual keyboard for the communication device  may be included in the network page. An image of the communication device  may be included in the network page. The server application  may facilitate interaction with the graphical representation of the communication device  in conjunction with the remote access application . The video captured from the communication device  may be surrounded by the image of the communication device , as if the video were shown on the display  of the communication device .","The server application  may communicate with the client  over various protocols such as, for example, hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP), simple object access protocol (SOAP), representational state transfer (REST), real-time transport protocol (RTP), real time streaming protocol (RTSP), real time messaging protocol (RTMP), user datagram protocol (UDP), transmission control protocol (TCP), and\/or other protocols for communicating data over the first network . In some embodiments, the server application  may incorporate a commercially available HTTP server such as Apache\u00ae HTTP Server, Apache\u00ae Tomcat\u00ae, Microsoft\u00ae Internet Information Services (IIS), or other servers.","The data stored in the data store  includes, for example, remote access application code , user account data , device interfaces , media encoders , and potentially other data. The remote access application code  corresponds to code that implements the remote access application , which may be downloaded from the server application  to the communication device . The user account data  may define various user accounts which may connect the communication device  to the server application  and allow clients  to connect to the communication device  by way of the server application . The user account data  may define multiple user accounts for a given communication device . For example, a supervisory account may be defined in the user account data  in order to give a parent access to the communication device  used by a child.","The device interfaces  correspond to images, animations, code, hypertext markup language (HTML), extensible markup language (XML), cascading style sheets (CSS), and\/or other data that may be used to generate a graphical representation of a communication device . As a non-limiting example, the Android\u00ae platform for smartphones may be supported by a multitude of different models of smartphones. Some of the models may have mini-keyboards with a touchscreen, while others may have merely a touchscreen with no physical mini-keyboard. The models may have different controls and casings. Therefore, different device interfaces  may be provided for different models of Android\u00ae smartphones.","In some embodiments, multiple different device interfaces  may be used in conjunction with communication device . Further, device interfaces  that are different from the actual communication device  may be employed. For example, a generic device interface  or a device interface  corresponding to a different model of communication device  may be used. Where the communication device  does not include an integrated display, the device interface  may include a representation of an external display device showing video generated by the communication device . Similarly, other non-integrated external devices that may connect to the emulated computing device (e.g., keyboards, mice, etc.) may be represented by the device interface .","Like the media encoders , the media encoders  may correspond to, for example, Moving Pictures Experts Group (MPEG) encoders, H.264 encoders, Flash\u00ae video encoders, etc. Such media encoders  may be selected according to factors such as, for example, data reduction, encoding quality, latency, etc.","The client  is representative of a plurality of client devices that may be coupled to the first network . The clients  may be geographically diverse. The client  may comprise, for example, a processor-based system such as a computer system. Such a computer system may be embodied in the form of a desktop computer, a laptop computer, personal digital assistants, cellular telephones, smartphones, set-top boxes, televisions that execute applications and can access the first network , music players, web pads, tablet computer systems, game consoles, electronic book readers, or other devices with like capability.","The client  may include a display . The display  may comprise, for example, one or more devices such as cathode ray tubes (CRTs), LCD screens, gas plasma-based flat panel displays, LCD projectors, or other types of display devices, etc. The client  may include one or more input devices  and one or more output devices . The input devices  may comprise, for example, devices such as keyboards, mice, joysticks, accelerometers, light guns, game controllers, touch pads, touch screens, touch sticks, push buttons, optical sensors, microphones, webcams, and\/or any other devices that can provide user input. Additionally, various input devices  may incorporate output devices  with haptic technologies in order to provide feedback to the user. The output devices  may comprise, for example, audio devices, indicator lights, vibration devices, and\/or other devices.","The client  may be configured to execute various applications such as a client application  and\/or other applications. The client application  is executed to allow a user to launch, join, play, or otherwise interact with a user application  or a communication application  executed in the communication device . To this end, the client application  is configured to capture input commands provided by the user through one or more of the input devices  and send this input over the first network  to the communication device  as communications input data . The communications input data  may also incorporate other data (e.g., GPS data, audio data, etc.) generated by the client  for use by the user application  and\/or the communication application . In various embodiments, the client application  corresponds to a browser application.","The client application  is also configured to obtain communications output data  over the first network  from the communication device  and render a screen  on the display . To this end, the client application  may include one or more video and audio players to play out a media stream generated by a media encoder  or a media encoder . In one embodiment, the client application  comprises a plug-in or other client-side code executed within a browser application. The client  may be configured to execute applications beyond the client application  such as, for example, browser applications, email applications, instant message applications, and\/or other applications. In some embodiments, multiple clients  may be employed for one or more users to interact with the communication device . As non-limiting examples, some clients  may be specialized in display output, while other clients  may be specialized in obtaining user input. It is noted that different clients  may be associated with different latency requirements which may affect a delay employed before providing input commands to the user applications  or communication application .","Next, a general description of the operation of the various components of the networked environment  is provided. To begin, a user configures a communication device  to include the remote access application . For example, software may be automatically or manually downloaded from the remote access application code  through the server application . The user may then enable remote access for user accounts of the communication device  or through special user accounts established for the remote access application  and potentially through the server application . The remote access application  begins listening for connections over the first network  and\/or the second network .","The user may then remotely connect to the communication device  by way of a client  coupled to the first network . In one embodiment, the user may be authenticated through the server application  in the computing device . Alternatively, the user may directly connect to the communication device  through the client . However, the communication device  may employ a dynamic network address, and the dynamic network address may be reported to the server application , a dynamic domain name system (DNS) service, and\/or another entity on the first network .","The server application  and\/or the communication device  may serve up a user interface. In one embodiment, the server application  generates one or more network pages that facilitate remote control of the communication device . The remote access application  encodes a video signal corresponding to the screen  and an audio signal corresponding to the output of an audio output device  into a media stream. This media stream may be sent to the client  directly or relayed by way of the server application  as communications output data .","The client application  may be configured to render the media stream on the screen . In some embodiments, a graphical representation of the communication device  may also be rendered to facilitate input\/output outside of the screen . The graphical representation may correspond to a device interface . The user may be able to use an input device  of the client  to select graphical user interface elements of the screen  and\/or enter text or other input. Such input may be sent to the communication device  as communications input data . In one case, the user may use a microphone input device  to record an audio signal which is sent to the communication device  as communications input data .","As a non-limiting example, a user may initiate and\/or answer a telephone call remotely with the communication device  by using the client  in conjunction with the remote access application . The caller identification of the communication device  is employed because the communication device  is actually making or receiving the call. In other examples, a user may seek to have remote access to device data  or other user applications  of the device. A user may obtain remote access to contact information, stored text messages, and\/or other device data . In addition, a supervisory user, such as a parent, employer, et al., may access the communication device  for auditing, monitoring, support, and\/or other reasons. For example, a parent may wish to view text messages sent or received by a child, listen in on telephone calls handled by the communication device , and so on.","Various techniques related to facilitating access to applications that are executed remotely are described in U.S. patent application entitled \u201cRemotely Emulating Computing Devices,\u201d filed on May 24, 2011 and assigned application Ser. No. 13\/114,534, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","Moving on to , shown is one example of a communication device  employed in the networked environment  (). The communication device  includes a touchscreen display  () that is rendering a screen . The communication device  includes various input devices  such as buttons and other input devices. Some buttons may adjust the volume of an audio device of the communication device .","The screen  in this example shows the user interface of a communication application  () that facilitates placing and answering telephone calls through the communication device . To this end, the screen  renders several virtual buttons  corresponding to digits and letters. Virtual buttons  may be provided to initiate a call using the entered number or to clear the previously entered numbers. A status display  is provided to show a status, including, for example, a currently entered telephone number, text message, etc.","Continuing to , shown is one example of a user interface  rendered in a client  () employed in the networked environment  (). The user interface  corresponds to a client application  () such as a browser application, which is rendering a network page  generated by the server application  (). The network page  shows a graphical representation  of the communication device  shown in . The screen  is identical to the screen  shown in .","In one embodiment, the screen  may correspond to a video signal of a media stream generated in the communication device . In another embodiment, both the screen  and the graphical representation  may be included in a video signal of the media stream. In other embodiments, the graphical representation  may be absent. For example, the user interface  may show only the screen , and where the client  is also a communication device , the client  may have an appearance similar to the example of , although a remote communication device  is being controlled. In still other embodiments, a network page or other application-based interface may be used to control the communication device  without showing a screen  of the communication device .","A heading  of the network page  identifies the server application , which corresponds to a \u201cControl My Phone\u201d service. A user identifier  shows that a user with the user name \u201cJSmith\u201d is currently logged into the server application  and to the communication device . A logoff component  may be provided for the user to end the session. One or more additional controls  may be provided to generate input data or commands outside of the graphical representation  and the screen . For example, a rotate device control  may allow for the graphical representation  to be rotated and for accelerometer input to be presented to the communication device .","In the example of , a user is able to press virtual buttons  on the screen  from the client . For example, the user may use a mouse cursor to click on the virtual buttons . The client application , the server application , and\/or the remote access application  may be configured to translate this input command into a touchscreen input to press the buttons shown on the graphical representation  through an API or another interface (e.g., using virtualized input devices ).","Accordingly, the user is able to initiate a telephone call using the communication device . The user may speak into a microphone on the client , thus generating an audio signal, which is sent to the server application  and\/or directly to the communication device . The audio signal is sent to the communication device  as communications input data  (). The communication device  uses the audio signal as the local end of a telephone call. The communication device  encodes the remote end of the telephone call into the media stream, which is ultimately returned to the client  to be rendered through an audio output device  of the client . In this example, a user is able to place calls using the client  where the calls have the same caller identification as the communication device .","Referring next to , shown is a flowchart that provides one example of the operation of a portion of the remote access application  according to various embodiments.
