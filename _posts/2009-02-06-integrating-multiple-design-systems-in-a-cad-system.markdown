title: Integrating multiple design systems in a CAD system
abstract: A method, apparatus, and article of manufacture provide the ability to integrate multiple engineering design systems in a computer aided design (CAD) system. A design generator is displayed and used to create an engineering design that has different worksheets. Each worksheet represents a different aspect of the design, has local design objects that represent functional aspects of a component that are independent from the component's physical representation, and relation objects that models constraints for properties of the design objects. The objects are organized into a functional layout document (FLD) that is stored in a data center/database that is shared by the worksheets. The FLD is then used to design an engineering design/model.

Field of the Invention","The present invention relates generally to computer-aided design (CAD) systems, and in particular, to a method, apparatus, and article of manufacture for integrating multiple subsystems for a conceptual engineering design within a CAD system.","2. Description of the Related Art","Mid-range and high-end CAD systems of today attempt to streamline a user's workflow by optimizing commands and data-structures for building a single, detailed, sometimes very large, 3D model. Users must focus on tying every piece of geometry to every other so that any edit to any portion of the model will cause the rest of the model to update. However, the highly iterative, rough, abstract and piece-wise nature of early stage design becomes difficult to undertake within an essentially monolithic design approach adopted by such CAD systems. Designers end up resorting to various disparate niche software tools, resorting to various data catalogs, to \u2018hand\u2019 references to previous designs, to mental references to the company's rules of thumb, etc., in order to accomplish their task.","Several inefficiencies arise from handling the early stage design task in this manner:\n\n","Accordingly, what is needed is a flexible approach (within a CAD system) to integrate multiple tools, subsystems, software programs, and objects in the early stage or conceptual engineering design stage.","One or more embodiments of the invention recognizes \u2018early stage\u2019 or conceptual engineering design as requiring a different, more flexible approach within a CAD system. To provide the flexible approach, a new document type called the Functional Layout Document (FLD) is provided. Early stage design is captured in an incremental data-model called the Functional Component Description (FCD) within the powerful and very flexible environment of the FL Document. The FCD can, at any time, be rendered into a simple XML for further processing within various contexts, including downstream detailing.","The architecture provides the ability to integrate different engineering design systems by enabling several loosely-connected sub-systems, that can collectively be referred to as \u201cknowledge base\u201d, to interact seamlessly inside the FL Document. The objective is to allow the designer to focus on the creative aspect of his\/her task and spend less time \u201cworking\u201d the parts of the system.","In the following description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof, and which is shown, by way of illustration, several embodiments of the present invention. It is understood that other embodiments may be utilized and structural changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention.","Hardware and Software Environment",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102","104","106","100"]},"One or more embodiments of the invention are implemented by a computer-implemented graphics program , wherein the graphics program  is represented by a window displayed on the display device . Generally, the graphics program  comprises logic and\/or data embodied in\/or readable from a device, media, carrier, or signal, e.g., one or more fixed and\/or removable data storage devices  connected directly or indirectly to the computer , one or more remote devices coupled to the computer  via a data communications device, etc. Such a graphics program  may consist of a computer-aided design (CAD) program, a solid modeling system, a two-dimensional (2D) or three-dimensional (3D) modeling system, a schematic system, mathematical analysis and computing system, a spreadsheet application, cataloging application, or any other system that provides the ability to visually represent and\/or create a design environment.","In one or more embodiments, instructions implementing the graphics program  are tangibly embodied in a computer-readable medium, e.g., data storage device , which could include one or more fixed or removable data storage devices, such as a zip drive, floppy disc drive, hard drive, CD-ROM drive, DVD drive, tape drive, etc. Further, the graphics program  is comprised of instructions which, when read and executed by the computer , causes the computer  to perform the steps necessary to implement and\/or use the present invention. Graphics program  and\/or operating instructions may also be tangibly embodied in a memory and\/or data communications devices of computer , thereby making a computer program product or article of manufacture according to the invention. As such, the terms \u201carticle of manufacture\u201d and \u201ccomputer program product\u201d as used herein are intended to encompass a computer program accessible from any computer readable device or media.","Those skilled in the art will recognize that the exemplary environment illustrated in  is not intended to limit the present invention. Indeed, those skilled in the art will recognize that other alternative environments may be used without departing from the scope of the present invention.","Software Embodiments","Embodiments of the invention enable the ability to integrate multiple different CAD systems\/subsystems into a single graphics\/CAD program . Such embodiments may be more easily understood with an enumeration of specific elements that may exist.  illustrates the various elements and components used to create a flexible engineering design in accordance with one or more embodiments of the invention.","Document Composition","Worksheets of Varying Dimensionality","The Functional Layout (FL) Document  follows the paradigm of a notebook with different work-sheets  representing different aspects of a design. Each work-sheet  can be of a different type or dimensionality. For example, worksheets may exist for 3D abstractions\/abstract models A, 2D abstractions\/abstract sketches B, schematic\/flow diagrams C, mathematical equations (raw functional behavior) (e.g., using MatLab\u2122 tools for performing numerical computations), etc.","Each worksheet  is powered by exactly the same underlying framework and data-base found intrinsically in the CAD system. The architecture also allows for newer work-sheet types to be added dynamically (e.g., \u201con the fly\u201d in real-time during processing) by third party clients\/developers\/designers without the CAD system having fore-knowledge about such newer worksheets at compile time.","A great deal of the commonality found in the individual workflows within the various worksheet types is factored out and re-purposed for use in a consistent manner in the FL Document . For example, a single browser view and interaction may be provided regardless of whether the design is being performed using purely mathematical equations or 2D sketches B or 3D abstract shapes A. This kind of flexibility and consistency is made possible by the introduction of design objects.","Local Design Objects",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["202","202","302","202","302","302"]},"Relation Objects","The all-important relationship between these design objects  is captured with what is called a \u201crelation object\u201d . The relation object  models the constraints that must be obeyed by the properties or parameters of the design objects .","The design objects  and relation objects  together capture the entire design intent, no more no less. Due to their detachment from the more physical aspect of the geometry, a greater flexibility is possible in capturing the essential design.","Master Design Objects","In order to satisfy the often contradictory goals of allowing freedom to design sub-systems while at the same time keeping all sub-systems tightly in synch, the concept of local design objects  and global design objects is introduced. Every work-sheet  has its design objects local , while a master list of the global or \u201cmaster\u201d design objects may be continually maintained. Master design objects can loosely be defined as a \u201cunion\u201d of all the design objects  in the worksheets . They provide the ability to track and manage which category parameters of which local design object  are being utilized.","The system of local design objects  in worksheets  and the master design objects at the \u201ctop\u201d is leveraged to manage a semi-automatic update of the worksheets . When changes are made in one part of the design other parts of the design can be updated (e.g., automatically\/semi-automatically\u2014without additional user input or independent of\/from further user actions). In this regard, the list of master design objects can be used to find and update all of the local design objects. Further, if one design object affects another design object, the master object list can be used to update any relations.","The allowance in the system for designers to intervene in directing the flow of such an \u201cupdate\u201d is useful in catering to the iterative and fluid nature of early design.","Thus, in each design, there may be multiple different master or global design objects that together constitute the final design. For example, in a motor assembly, there are multiple different objects\/parts such as a driveshaft, pistons, cylinders, etc. Each object\/part may be represented by a master design object. In turn the different worksheets may define different aspects of each master design object. For example, a 2D worksheet B may provide a 2D abstraction of the motor assembly, while a 3D worksheet A may provide a 3D abstraction of the motor assembly. The different local design objects  in each worksheet  defines an aspect of the master design object. Accordingly, a local design object  in the 2D worksheet B may define a 2D abstraction for the driveshaft, while a local design object  in the 3D worksheet A may define a 3D abstraction for the same driveshaft (which is represented by a master design object).","The master design object manages all of its constituent local design objects . The master design object may also manage any conflicts between its local design objects and provide a single master design object that is used in the design. Such conflict management may be conducted with or without input and interaction from the user. For example, the master design object may require the user to elect between conflicting parameters from two different local design objects  in different worksheets . Alternatively (or in addition), the master design object may utilize a predefined set of rules to determine which properties from which local design object  to utilize.","Data Center","Referring again to , a knowledge base  maintains information for using and testing a design. The knowledge base  maintains some of the information in a shared database referred to as the data center . The data center  contains categories , reusable designs , and validation rules .","The data center  is the general facility that allows centralized access to all data that is re-usable and shareable. These include previously designed models  and raw engineering data which are to be used by designers during the course of their work. The models and data are organized in a systematic fashion that enables quick search and instantiation.","The set of categories  and their definitions are stored in the data center . As noted earlier, such information is centrally and independently managed to enable consistent communication. Further, design validation rules  are stored centrally in this data center . The use of validation rules  allows for consistency of design across an entire group or groups of designers.","Categories","Each design and relation object is viewed as an instance of a strong-type class. The class is called a category . A category's definition, including its properties, a.k.a category parameters, may be stored in XML syntax. All categories  are managed inside the shared database of the data center . A category  can be likened to a class in Java\u2122 or C++ which supports inheritance.","Besides the category parameters, the category  also defines the \u201cfunctional behaviors\u201d of the objects that claim to conform to it. These functional behaviors can be thought of as equations or constraints that must be obeyed by some of the category parameters.","Categories  form the heart of the system enabling communication at the engineering behavior level. Since they are stored in a centrally accessible database  they enable various commands and software modules to understand each other\u2014their inputs and outputs\u2014with relative ease, using the \u201cinterface\u201d of categories  and their parameters.","Re-Usable Designs","As in most engineering projects, a good portion of the design is very likely to have been previously generated. Embodiments of the invention may build on such prior designs as much as possible. The existence of such designs is formalized in the form of reusable designs  that are stored persistently in a shared database of the data center . The reusable designs  are thus easily and uniformly accessible within one or more commands.","Design Validation Rules","Design validation rules  attempt to automate the application of rules that are often developed within a design company. Such rules  may take the form of validation rules that verify conformance of certain portions of the design to a pre-defined set of rules. In other words, a designer or company may establish a set of conditions or ranges for certain category parameters or for the relationship between different categories. Such rules are reflected by the validation rules . Further, embodiments of the invention may allow statements of fact (rules) to be added in any order at any time.","The application of the rules  can take place pro-actively where the system flags the designer the moment an action is taken that is non-conforming. Alternatively, the application of rules  can take place more passively, with the designer \u201cpushing a button\u201d requesting a validity check be performed for conformance to the stored set of rules.","Compute Engines","Analysis and Simulation","To achieve the design objective the user inevitably needs measurement tools that provide feedback about the goodness (e.g., stability and quality) of his\/her design. In a functional modeling system, such tools refer to various engineering analysis and simulation tools . These modules  are considered essentially stateless\u2014the state of some facet of the current design is used as input, and computed information is output in some useful form that the designer can use to evaluate the design strategy.","The modules or engines  operate on design objects  and relation objects  and are thus removed from the actual representation of the model under consideration. Such a strategy enables the analysis and simulation on data models that may be incomplete in many aspects. It is the level of indirection and abstraction afforded by the design objects  that provides such capabilities.","Public Data Model","Functional Component Description","The set of design objects  and relation objects  built in the FL Document  can be rendered into a related XML syntax called the FCD . Each design object  and relation object  in the FCD  is an XML element that hosts the specific values of the category parameters. Accordingly, a succinct form of the design is provided without any loss of relevant design detail. Due to its simple and tractable nature, the design can be further rendered into alternative embodiments such as a traditional 3D model with the help of some heuristics and intelligent defaults supplied to fill the gaps. Once such a 3D model is emitted, further detailing can be carried out on top of it, in a more traditional manner. Thus, as illustrated in , the FCD  provides\/emits one or more model assemblies  that can have sub-assemblies  with parts .","The FCD  is leveraged for updating the emitted 3D model  when the conceptual design is edited in the FL Document . Accordingly, designers may obtain and evaluate the differences between a former FCD  and a new FCD  and provide algorithmic assessments as to what parts of the 3D detail model  needs to be tweaked and how.","Since a global perspective on the changes made in the conceptual design are provided, it becomes possible to compute the procedures that need to be executed on specific parts of the 3D detail model  so as to synchronize the changes with an actual model. Such synchronization may be performed without losing independent edits done by the detailer.","FCD's  transportability and transformability can be used to work the design into dissimilar CAD systems while preserving the essential design. For example, an air-conditioning unit designed in a solid modeling application can be transported into a building information modeling system by developing an \u201cinterpreter\u201d for the FCD representation  of the air-conditioner (i.e., in the solid modeling application) that can materialize into a building information modeling system \u201cair-conditioner\u201d in the form that it is needed in for such a system.","Interaction Agents","Design Generators","The design objects  and relation objects  are built up using a wide array of commands and datasets available through the FL Document  interface. The objects  and  are commonly built modularly into environments. Each environment is a specialization of the graphical user interface (GUI) for particular disciplines of mechanical design (e.g., mechanical linkage design, hydraulic manifold design, etc.)","Each such environment enhances the \u201cstatic\u201d knowledge-base of the system by contributing special datasets , reusable designs , rules of design , analysis and simulation engines . Each environment may also contribute a specialized application programming interface (API) to the overall CAD-system. All of these facilities (GUI, data , rules , computers, API, etc.) that extend the FL document  behavior combine to constitute a design generator .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0064"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["200","224","216","200","218","204"]},"A basic design generator  may always be available as part of a core system. The commands and analysis capabilities available in a basic design generator  may be generic but powerful enough to enable a designer to build designs fruitfully. Additionally, the same functional design paradigms embraced in general by the system form the underpinnings of the basic design generator .","Users\/designers may leverage the structure and power of the overall system of the invention by utilizing AddIns (e.g., provided by third parties\/entities) that may provide specialized design generators . With such specialization comes ease of use since the designer is communicating precisely in the language of the engineer. They bring in specialized data and analysis and simulation techniques  and a GUI that is very aware of the particular class of systems being designed. Despite the specialization, every design generator  uniformly produces design objects  and relation objects  that contribute to the FL Document's FCD .","Overview","In the prior art, designers were forced to resort to multiple different individual and separate applications in the early design stage. The ability to integrate data from the different systems was either impossible or a long and arduous manual process. For example, once a design was complete, all of the design data (in its various forms) had to be manually moved over into a traditional CAD system for further detail design.","One or more embodiments of the invention overcome the problems of the prior art by providing design generators  that can be used to create various designs and models that are provided in the form of worksheets to the user. For example, a designer may be constructing a wiper-blade assembly. An FL document  may be viewed with 2D B and schematic worksheets C being used to develop and create the basics of the linkage and motor assembly respectively. An analysis of the output of the velocity at some specified points in the linkage can also be viewed (e.g., using an analysis simulation engine ). A starting point for the detail design may be generated and produce a solid modeling assembly document . The components in the assembly  may be filled in based on the FCD  and the data center  connected to the system. Components that are not found in the data center  may have virtual components put in place that can be worked upon further by the detailer.","Thus, embodiments of the invention allow different aspects of the design to be modeled in different dimensionality\u20142D B if the third dimension is not a factor, schematic relationship diagrams C if geometry itself is not a factor, and\/or 3D A if some design features require three dimensions. The concept of local objects  and master design objects allow the designer to freely model an aspect of the design without having to keep all other aspects in synch at the same time. Further, the entire design may be captured at a uniformly high functional level described in an XML schema. Such capabilities allow for the transformation of the data into other forms such as a 3D detail assembly more easily than in the prior art. In addition, the system integrates the analysis and simulation engines found in most prior art CAD systems, directly into the early stages of design, where very little may be known about the geometry of the components. Lastly, the concept and use of a shared database  provides the ability to use the same content database as the traditional CAD system enabling the concept of \u201cpublish once, use everywhere\u201d.","Logical Flow",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0070"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","202","302","304","302","304"]},"During step , master design objects may be created. Since the worksheets  represent different aspects of a design, the master design object serves to organize and manage the different local design objects  from the different worksheets. Accordingly, each master design object is an amalgamation of one or more of the local design objects  from the two or more different worksheets . Each local design object  in a master design object refers to a particular aspect of the master design object. The master design object serves to manage the different local design objects  for a particular aspect of the design. For example, a master design object may represent a drive shaft while local design objects  in the different worksheets  may provide different aspects of the drive shaft (e.g., a 2D schematic, a mathematical operation for the drive shaft's movement, etc.). The master design object serves as an amalgamation of the different local design objects  that represent the different aspects of the drive shaft. There can be many different master design objects in a design that each serve as an amalgamation of the different local design objects for individual aspects of the master design.","In addition, a design generator  may be used\/defined for a particular environment that is a specialization of a graphical user interface for a particular discipline of mechanical design.","At step , the local design objects  and relation objects  are organized into an FLD .","At step , the FLD  is stored in a data center  that provides a shared database within the CAD system. The shared database is shared by two or more worksheets . Also stored in the shared database  may be design validation rules  that verify conformance of the local design objects  to a pre-defined set of rules. The shared database  may further contain reusable designs  that establish a particularly identified set of local design objects  and relation objects .","At step , the FLD  is used, via user input, to design an engineering model\/design (e.g., a model assembly ). Such a step may further include the ability to render the FLD  into an extensible markup language (XML) syntax based FCD  (i.e., an FCD  that is XML based). Each of the master design objects and relation objects  in the FCD  are instances of a category class having category parameters. The FCD  may further be rendered into a specific design model  that is displayed within a second CAD system. The original CAD system (i.e., that is used to produce the FCD  and the second CAD system may be dissimilar\/different CAD systems.","Step  may further involve using engineering analysis\/simulation tools  that operate on the local design objects  or relation objects  to produce computed information. Such computed information is used to evaluate the design strategy formed by the local design objects  and relation objects .","Conclusion","This concludes the description of the preferred embodiment of the invention. The following describes some alternative embodiments for accomplishing the present invention. For example, any type of computer, such as a mainframe, minicomputer, or personal computer, or computer configuration, such as a timesharing mainframe, local area network, or standalone personal computer, could be used with the present invention.","The foregoing description of the preferred embodiment of the invention has been presented for the purposes of illustration and description. It is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise form disclosed. Many modifications and variations are possible in light of the above teaching. It is intended that the scope of the invention be limited not by this detailed description, but rather by the claims appended hereto."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["Referring now to the drawings in which like reference numbers represent corresponding parts throughout:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 4"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
