title: Apparatus and method for gun recoil mitigation
abstract: A weapon may include a translatable recoil mass and two translatable counterweights disposed on opposite sides of the recoil mass. Each counterweight may have a mass that is substantially one-half a mass of the recoil mass. A pair of racks may be fixed to respective ones of the counterweights and a second pair of racks may be fixed to opposites sides of the recoil mass. Pinions may engage the counterweight and recoil mass racks. A receiver may be fixed with respect to the recoil mass and the pair of counterweights. The directions of translation of the recoil mass are substantially opposite directions of translation of the two counterweights.

Because both gas venting momentum and operating group momentum may contribute to recoil, the conventional recoil mitigation methods may, at best, only partially mitigate recoil. Partial mitigation of recoil may occur because the conventional methods do not address both the momentum produced by venting gases and the momentum produced by the operating group. Thus, a need exists for an apparatus and method to mitigate recoil caused by both gas venting momentum and operating group momentum.","It is an object of the invention to provide a mechanism to mitigate recoil in a weapon.","It is another object of the invention to provide a mechanism to mitigate recoil caused by both gas venting momentum and operating group momentum.","One aspect of the invention may be a weapon having a translatable recoil mass and two translatable counterweights disposed on opposite sides of the recoil mass. Each counterweight may have a mass that is substantially one-half the mass of the recoil mass. The directions of translation of the recoil mass may be substantially opposite the directions of translation of the two counterweights. The translatable recoil mass may include a barrel and barrel block.","The weapon may further include a pair of racks fixed to respective ones of the counterweights, a second pair of racks fixed to opposite sides of the translatable recoil mass, and a pair of pinions. Each pinion may engage a counterweight rack and a translatable recoil mass rack.","Another aspect of the invention may be a method of mitigating recoil in a weapon. The method may include moving a pair of counterweights in a direction substantially opposite a direction of movement of a recoil mass. The pair of counterweights may each have a mass that is about one-half a mass of the recoil mass. The counterweights and the recoil mass may move at substantially the same speed. The method may include controlling movement of the counterweights and the recoil mass using pinions that engage racks on the counterweights and the recoil mass.","The invention will be better understood, and further objects, features, and advantages thereof will become more apparent from the following description of the preferred embodiments, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.","A kinematic chain may alleviate weapon recoil by canceling (by way of opposing counterweight momentum) some or all of the momentum generated in a translating barrel during firing. A kinematic chain that includes a translating barrel block and momentum-canceling counterweights may mitigate both gas venting momentum and operating group momentum, simultaneously. The kinematic chain may be used in weapons of any caliber, for example, from small arm calibers to artillery calibers.","The momentum P of a body is the product of the mass m and velocity v of the body (P=mv).  illustrates a ball A traveling within a box B. The box B is initially at rest. Therefore v=0 in . According to the conservation of momentum principle, the momentum of the ball\/box system before impact (P=mv+mv) is equal to the momentum of the system after impact (P=mv+mv). The quantity (mv) is zero. After the ball A strikes the box B, velocity and, subsequently, momentum is transferred to the box B. Thus, the velocity of box B after impact is v=(m\/m) (v+v).","In , two smaller balls C, C each have a mass equal to one half the mass of the ball A. The two smaller balls C, C travel in the opposite direction of the larger ball A, but at the same speed as the larger ball A. The momentum of the ball\/box system before impact (P=mv\u2212mv+mv) is equal to zero and is equal to the momentum of the system after impact (P=mv\u2212mv+mv). Under this condition, the momenta of the traveling balls A, C, C cancel each other upon impact. No velocity and, consequently, no momentum are transferred to the box B after impact. Thus, v=0.","The box B may represent a weapon's receiver, the ball A may represent the weapon's barrel, and the balls C, C may represent the weapon's operating group. Under certain conditions, no momentum may be transferred to the weapon's receiver B and, ultimately, the weapon's operator. The momentum of the weapon may govern its recoil.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["10","12","10","12","10","10","10","10"]},"It is important that the mass of the two counterweights each be equal to or substantially equal to half the mass of the translating barrel. That is, in , if the ball A represents the barrel , the mass of each ball C may be one half the mass of the ball A. It is also important that the speeds of the two counterweights be equal to or substantially equal to the speed of the translating barrel . Furthermore, the counterweights and the translating barrel  may impact the receiver at substantially the same time.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIGS. 4A and 4B","FIG. 4A","FIG. 4B"],"b":["20","24","22","26","28","20","26","28","34","36","30","32","20","38","40","30","32"]},"The kinematic chain shown in  has only one degree of freedom.

In , positioning springs  are disposed on mounting rods  and bear against counterweights , , respectively, and the rear surface of front plate .","Rear flange  of receiver  may include a pair of cylinders .
