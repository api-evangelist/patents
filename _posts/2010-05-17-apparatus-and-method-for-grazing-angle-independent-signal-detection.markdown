No. 61\/216,566, filed May 18, 2009.","The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.","A basic function of radiative systems such as sonar or radar is to reliably correlate echoes received from an object scanned from different locations. This permits identification, classification, or imaging of objects or surfaces, examples of which might be, in a marine environment, sea shells, pebbles, rocks, shoals, patches of seafloor, terrain, naval mines, undersea pipes or cables, or sunken vessels. Unfortunately, echo signature varies with the angle of incidence, or grazing angle, at which the object is scanned, which means that echoes received back from the same object at different grazing angles will correlate poorly. In particular, increasing grazing angle progressively foreshortens the apparent size of an object along the line of sight between the sonar\/radar generator and the object. This in turn changes the frequency of radiation necessary to duplicate the signature of the object, requiring different frequencies for different grazing angles.","Accordingly, an object of the invention is to permit good correlation between echoes returned at different grazing angles.","Another object is to permit a priori identification of the bandwidth necessary to recognize all physical objects of a given size at a given set of grazing angles.","Another object is to permit mapping of the spectrum of an echo from one surface at one grazing angle to the corresponding spectrum for that echo at a second grazing angle, to permit good correlation with a pre-existing echo from the same surface at the second grazing angle.","In accordance with these and other objects made apparent hereinafter, the invention concerns an apparatus and method in which a surface or object is irradiated at a known grazing angle so as to produce detectable echoes. The spectrum detected at one grazing angle is related to a corresponding spectrum for the echo at second grazing angle by the relationship:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0008"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002","num":"00002"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["f","s"]},"mo":"=","mfrac":{"msub":{"mi":["cf","x"]},"mrow":{"mn":"2","mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mi":["Cos","\u03b8"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}}}}}},"br":{},"sub":["x ","s ","x"]},"These and other objects are further understood from the following detailed description of particular embodiments of the invention. It is understood, however, that the invention is capable of extended application beyond the precise details of these embodiments. Changes and modifications can be made to the embodiments that do not affect the spirit of the invention, nor exceed its scope, as expressed in the appended claims. The embodiments are described with particular reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein:","With reference to the drawing figures, wherein like numbers indicate like parts throughout the several views,  shows an embodiment of the invention employing sonar. A side scanning sonar  is mounted on ship  disposed on marine surface  above bottom , and generates a broad beam sonar signal  of azimuthal width . Beam  irradiates a broad swath of bottom  with a pulse of known spectral content, and receives back echoes, here in the form of complex pressure intensities, from bottom  and preferably records the echoes, for example by digitally sampling the echoes and recording the samples on a digital storage device for processing. Included among these echoes are returns from patches ,  of bottom , which have respective lines of sight ,  to sonar  at azimuthal angles \u03b8and \u03b8. As illustrated in , bottom patches ,  are at different distances from sonar , and at different orientations, i.e. different grazing angles, thereto. These patches can be any radiative feature on bottom , for example pebbles, sea shells, a sandy bottom, or (in the case of patch ) a reef or shoal extending from bottom .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0017"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["16","10","10","16","24","10","16","26","16","16","28","16","0","16","10","16","24","16","10","0","16"],"sub":["1 ","1 ","1"]},"For two points at respective distances Rand Rfrom a radiator such as sonar , the difference \u0394t in round trip times of radiation to and from the two points is:\n\n\u03942()\/\n\nwhere c is signal velocity, here the speed of sound in water; for radar, the speed of light in free space. In , the round trip difference between echoes received at sonar  from opposite ends ,  of bottom patch  is the distance wavefront  travels after it hits end  until it hits end , i.e.:\n\n2(0)Cos(\u03b8)\/\n","Any sinusoidal signal of frequency fand wavelength \u03bb obeys the relationship:\n\n\u03bb\n\nwhere \u03bb is signal wavelength.

Wavefront  first strikes the patch at \u2032 when wavefront  is still a distance L()Cos(\u03b8+\u03b1) from opposite end \u2032, as seen in the diagram in , making the effective grazing angle \u03b8+\u03b1, in contrast to the grazing angle of \u03b8in .","From the foregoing, one can see that a knowledge of grazing angle permits a user aboard ship  to correct echo signatures returned from an artifact on bottom  at different grazing angles so that the echoes will correlate well. This in turn permits a wide range of applications. For example, survey data describing the contour of a marine bottom is frequently available and storable in a computer aboard ship . Ship  can then send out a broadbeam sonar pulse , and record the echoes returned from bottom  as a function of time, typically by digitally sampling the echoes and storing the samples in computer memory. This permits formation of a reference data base that relates echo signature to both locations on bottom  as well as grazing angle. A later ship that similarly scans bottom , albeit from a different location and hence different grazing angles, can use the knowledge of its own position to correct the echoes it receives back for differences in grazing angle from the reference data base. One simple way to do this is to use the above equations to transform the spectrum of an echo of interest as follows:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0027"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00007","num":"00007"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":"f","mrow":{"mi":"s","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mn":"2"}},"mo":"=","mrow":{"msub":{"mi":"f","mrow":{"mi":"s","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mn":"1"}},"mo":"\u2062","mfrac":{"mrow":[{"mi":"Cos","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"msub":{"mi":"\u03b8","mn":"1"}}},{"mi":"Cos","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"msub":{"mi":"\u03b8","mn":"2"}}}]}}}}},"br":[{},{},{}],"sub":["s","x","x2","x1","s2 ","2 ","s1 ","1","x2 ","x1 ","s2 ","s1","x "],"b":["0","16","18"],"in-line-formulae":[{},{}],"i":["f","f"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0028"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00008","num":"00008"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mfrac":[{"msub":{"mi":"cf","mrow":{"mi":["x","min"],"mo":","}},"mrow":{"mn":"2","mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}],"mi":"Cos","msub":{"mi":["\u03b8","min"]}}},{"msub":{"mi":"cf","mrow":{"mi":["x","max"],"mo":","}},"mrow":{"mn":"2","mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}],"mi":"Cos","msub":{"mi":["\u03b8","max"]}}}],"mo":["\u2264","\u2264"],"msub":{"mi":["f","s"]}}}},"br":{}},"In practice, a large range of vehicles could advantageously use the foregoing scheme, for example autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), or submarines or other submersibles.
