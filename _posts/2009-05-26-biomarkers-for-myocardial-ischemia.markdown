title: Biomarkers for myocardial ischemia
abstract: This invention relates, e.g., to a method for determining if a subject has myocardial ischemia, comprising (a) providing a blood sample obtained from a subject suspected of having myocardial ischemia; (b) determining in the sample the amount of one or more of the following proteins: (i) Lumican and/or (ii) Extracellular matrix protein 1 and/or (iii) Carboxypeptidase N; and (c) comparing the amount(s) of the protein(s) to a baseline value that is indicative of the amount of the protein in a subject that does not have myocardial ischemia, wherein a statistically significantly increased amount of the protein(s) compared to the baseline value is indicative of myocardial ischemia. Other proteins indicative of myocardial ischemia are also described, as are methods for treating a subject based on a diagnostic procedure of the invention, and kits for carrying out a method of the invention.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application is a U.S. national stage of PCT\/US2009\/045168 and claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7119(e) of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61\/128,686, filed May 23, 2008, each of which is entirely incorporated herein by reference.","Coronary heart disease is the most common single cause of death in the western world, representing about 20% of all deaths. This is equivalent to about 2 million deaths in Europe per year or four people per minute. In the US, over 8 million people exhibit acute (chest pain) symptoms in the Emergency Department (ED) of hospitals, with 1.5 million individuals having confirmed acute coronary symptom (ACS) events, accounting for 500,000 short term deaths. In patients presenting to the emergency room with chest pain, fewer than 15% are ultimately diagnosed as having ischemia or acute myocardial infarction (MI). Currently, blood tests for the cardiac specific isoform of troponin I or troponin T (TnI or TnT, respectively) are generally used for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (due to cardiac muscle (cell) death). Creatine kinase (CK) MB and myoglobin can also be used, but are considered to be less specific for cardiac injury. However, although these cardiac biomarkers can identify patients with even small amounts of myocardial necrosis, there is an earlier time point in which the heart is in ischemia but is not yet in necrosis, and the diagnosis of cardiac ischemia in the absence of necrosis cannot currently be made with accuracy.","It would be useful to be able to identify subjects in this diagnostic window (having non-necrotic ischemia). Such a diagnostic tool would be of great value for triage in the emergency department. For example, it would allow earlier intervention, including earlier perfusion, to allow increased salvage of the injured myocardium; and it would prevent unnecessary admittance to the hospital of patients with non-cardiac chest pain. Furthermore, such an assay could delay therapy in subjects who do not exhibit diagnostic electrocardiographic (ECG) changes, and could help to improve the accuracy of current provocative tests for ischemia, such as exercise stress testing. The sooner intervention can be carried out, the less cardiac damage will occur. Reduced damage is correlated with an increase in long term survival.","The present inventors have identified a number of protein markers for cardiac (myocardial) ischemia, including non-necrotic cardiac (myocardial) ischemia.","Three different types of protein analysis were performed to identify these markers, in order to cover as broad a base as possible of proteome coverage, e.g. to allow the enhanced detection of isoforms and of post-translational modifications (PTM). These types of analysis were two-dimensional electrophoresis (2DE, separating proteins based on pI and molecular weight), two-dimensional liquid chromatography (2DLC, separating proteins based on pI and hydrophobicity) and one-dimensional liquid chromatography (1DLC, separating proteins based on hydrophobicity). Note that the starting pH differs between 2DLC and 1DLC: pH 8.5 and 2.3, respectively. Two different cohorts were analyzed\u2014increased metabolic demand (cohort 1) and reduced supply (cohort 2).","In a first study, ischemia was induced in a first cohort of subjects by metabolic demand: subjects were stimulated by atrial pacing, which makes the heart beat faster and induces ischemia, as indicated by an increase in lactate, and potentially myocardial necrosis (based on detection of cTnI or cTnT in blood). In some cases, individuals did not exhibit any increase in lactate or detectable cTnI\/cTnT. These latter individuals were considered controls. Multiple serum samples were obtained for each individual. Differences between baseline (prior to pacing) and those at peaking pacing and up to 60 minutes after were analyzed. Those proteins that were elevated compared to the baseline in the majority of ischemic or necroiss individuals (and not elevated in controls) were considered to be of interest.","This procedure mimics naturally occurring metabolic cardiac events, such as ministrokes, that might precede a full MI. Ischemia is a heterogeneous group of conditions, resulting from different underlying mechanisms, such as demand and supply limitation. We have \u201cmimicked\u201d these two conditions in the different cohorts used in the analysis. Thus, these cohorts are expected to reflect markers that are overexpressed in subjects suffering from ischemia resulting from a variety of such underlying mechanisms. Samples from demand (atrial pacing) were evaluated by 2DE, 2DLC and 1DLC.","In a second study, ischemia was induced in a second cohort by coronary blockage: subjects undergoing valve replacement surgery exhibited ischemia because of blood loss during the procedure. This procedure mimics naturally occurring events in which ischemia is induced by coronary blood vessel blockage. This cohort was evaluated only by 1DLC, the procedure which provided a comparison to the most useful results with the first cohort. Those proteins found to be altered in both cohorts are considered to be \u201ctier one\u201d markers, although strong hits in either cohort may also be considered to be prime candidate markers.","The results of the studies with these two cohorts are summarized in Table 13. Taken together, these studies show that three proteins are implicated as the most highly correlated markers (sometimes referred to herein as \u201cfirst tier\u201d markers, as they are observed to be elevated in both cohorts) for ischemia, regardless of the cause of the ischemia: Lumican; Extracellular matrix protein 1 (ECM-1); and Carboxypeptidase N (e.g., the catalytic chain).","Three markers in addition to Lumican, ECM-1 and Carboxypeptidase N are implicated as first tier markers for at least subjects similar to those in the first cohort: Angiogenin; Semenogclin (e.g., isoforms 1 and 2); and Long palate, lung and nasal epithelium carcinoma-associated protein 1 (LPLNECA-1) (e.g., isoform 1; isoforms 2-4 are also present, but the method of analysis employed in this study, although it supports isoform 1, cannot distinguish among the four isoforms, which are splice variants, so isoforms 2-4 cannot be ruled out due to sequence homology).","Ten markers in addition to Lumican, ECM-1 and Carboxypeptidase N are implicated as first tier markers for at least subjects similar to those in the second cohort: Perioxiredoxin isoform 2; 5100 isoforms A7, A8 and A9 (other S100 isoforms were detected and not observed to be altered); Sortilin-related receptor; Catalase; Low density lipoprotein receptor related proteins 1 and 2; and Syntaxin 3.","In addition to these first tier markers, Table 13 lists some \u201csecond tier\u201d markers which can also be used for identifying subjects similar to those in both cohorts I and II; in cohort I; or in cohort II. These include, e.g., Alpha-2-HS-glycoprotein; Galectin-7; Hornerin; Proteoglycan-4; Profilaggrin (also called Filaggrin); Vitamin D binding protein; C4b-binding protein alpha chain; Thyroxine binding globulin; Alpha-2-glycoprotein 1, zinc; protease, serine 3; Caspase 14; Desmogelin; Kininogen-1 (we observed the peptide for the intact protein, but our data cannot distinguish between changes to the LMW or HMW, which could also be present); Hepatocyte growth factor like protein; Hepatocyte growth factor activator; and Insulin like growth factor protein 6.","In some embodiments of the invention, it is desirable to distinguish between subjects whose ischemia is induced by metabolic causes (similar to the subjects of cohort I), and subjects whose ischemia is induced by coronary blood vessel blockage (similar to the subjects of cohort II), because different treatment methods can be used for the two classes of subjects. The markers of the invention can be used to make such distinctions.","This invention relates, e.g., to a method for determining if a subject has myocardial ischemia, comprising measuring in a sample from the subject the amount of at least one of the following proteins, compared to a baseline value:","a) Lumican and\/or","b) Extracellular matrix protein 1 and\/or","c) Carboxypeptidase N,","wherein a significant amount (e.g., at least a statistically significant amount) of over-expression of the protein(s) compared to the baseline value is indicative of myocardial ischemia (e.g., indicates that the subject has, or is likely to have, myocardial ischemia). The amount of expression may be determined for any combination of 1, 2, or all 3, of these proteins, and the determinations can be conducted simultaneously, or in any order.","Another aspect of the invention is a method for identifying subjects that have myocardial ischemia that is induced by a metabolic-induced ischemic event [due to a metabolic limitation, in which the heart is unable to meet metabolic need; (excessive) metabolic demand], comprising determining in the sample from the subject the amount, compared to a baseline value, of at least one of proteins a), b), c) above,","d) Angiogenin,","e) Semenogelin, and\/or","f) Long palate, lung and nasal epithelium carcinoma-associated protein 1. The amount of expression may be determined for any combination of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 of these proteins, and the determinations can be conducted simultaneously, or in any order.","Another aspect of the invention is a method for identifying subjects that have myocardial ischemia that is induced by coronary blood vessel blockage, which limits the supply of blood, comprising determining in the sample from the subject the amount, compared to a baseline value, of at least one of proteins a), b), c) above,","g) Syntaxin,","h) Perioxiredoxin isoform 2,","i) S100 isoform A7,","j) S100 isoform A8,","k) S100 isoform A9,","l) Sortilin-related receptor","m) Catalase","n) Low density lipoprotein receptor related protein 1, and\/or","o) Low density lipoprotein receptor related protein 2. The amount of expression may be determined for any combination of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 or 12 of these proteins, and the determinations can be conducted simultaneously, or in any order.","In addition to the proteins noted above, one of more of the \u201csecond tier\u201d proteins indicated in Table 13 can also be measured. A skilled worker will recognize which of these markers are indicative of a cohort I-type of condition, and which are indicative of a cohort II-type of condition.","Another aspect of the invention is a method for determining if a subject has myocardial ischemia, comprising determining in a sample from the subject the amount, compared to a baseline value, of at least one (e.g., at least four) of at least proteins a)-p) as noted above. The amount of expression may be determined for any combination of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, or 15 of these proteins; and the determinations can be conducted simultaneously, or in any order.","In a method of the invention, a determination that increasing numbers of protein markers of the invention are overexpressed in a subject can further indicate that the subject has (or is likely to have) myocardial ischemia.","A method as above may further comprise measuring in the sample the amount of one or more other markers that have been reported to be diagnostic of cardiac necrosis, including cardiac specific isoforms of troponin I (TnI) and\/or troponin T (TnT) (although CK-MB, myoglobin, have been used in the past, cTnI and cTnT are the current gold standards), wherein a significant increase (e.g., at least a statistically significant increase) of the one or more markers further is further indicative that the subject has myocardial ischemia.","As noted above, ischemia is a heterogeneous condition caused by a variety of underlying mechanisms. Even if a single marker of the invention is capable of detecting a subject having ischemia resulting from a particular mechanism, it is possible for some markers that the marker is also upregulated in a disease other than myocardial ischemia. In such a case, it would be desirable to screen for upregulation of at least one additional marker that is associated with ischemia caused by a different underlying mechanism. The column labeled \u201cFunction\u201d in Table 13 shows that some of the markers of the invention can be divided into particular groups on the basis of their functions. A skilled worker, studying this table, could readily identify markers associated with different mechanisms. In one embodiment of the invention, markers associated with 2, 3, 4 or more underlying mechanisms can be tested together in an assay of the invention.","Another aspect of the method is a method for deciding how to treat a subject suspected of having myocardial ischemia, or a subject that is at high risk for having myocardial ischemia, comprising determining by a method as above if the subject has (or is likely to have) myocardial ischemia and, (1) if the subject is determined to have (or to be likely to have) myocardial ischemia, deciding to treat the subject aggressively [such as with angioplasty (mechanical widening in opening blood vessels), treating with an anti-thrombolysis agent or, if possible, with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI, or TPA), or undergoing coronary bypass surgery to replace the injured\/blocked coronary artery], or (2) if the subject is determined not to have (or not to be likely to have) myocardial ischemia, deciding to treat the subject non-aggressively [such as with asprin and\/or thrombolysis (e.g., TPA), with periodic monitoring to ensure no future MI events, or by recommending changes in life style. This method can be used to confirm that a subject does not have ischemia (especially if myocardial ischemia is not detectable by cTnI or cTnT elevation), and thus to allow the subject to be released from hospital care.]","Another aspect of the invention is a method for treating a subject suspected of having myocardial ischemia, or a subject that is at high risk for having myocardial ischemia, comprising determining by a method as above if the subject has (or is likely to have) myocardial ischemia and, (1) if the subject is determined to have (or to be likely to have) myocardial ischemia, treating the subject aggressively, as indicated above, or (2) if the subject is determined not to have (or not to be likely to have) myocardial ischemia, treating the subject non-aggressively, as indicated above.","Another aspect of the invention is a kit for detecting the presence of ischemia in a subject, comprising reagents for detecting the amounts of at least one (e.g., any combination of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, or 15 of at least proteins a)-o) as noted above.","This invention relates, e.g., to a method for determining if a subject has myocardial ischemia, comprising","(a) providing a sample obtained from a subject suspected of having myocardial ischemia;","(b) determining in the sample the amount of at least one of at least proteins a)-p) as noted above (e.g., any combination of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, or 15) of the proteins); and","(c) comparing the amount(s) of the protein(s) to a baseline value that is indicative of the amount of the protein in a subject that does not have myocardial ischemia,","wherein an increased amount (e.g., a statistically significantly increased amount) of the protein(s) compared to the baseline value is indicative of myocardial ischemia.","In one embodiment of the invention, the amount(s) of the protein(s) is compared over time to the baseline value and\/or to levels known to be associated with necrosis. The kinetic rise and fall of combinations of proteins is indicative of impending myocardial ischemia (or other cardio and vascular events, such as stroke. A method of the invention can also be used to determine risk in subjects (patients) with stable or unstable angina.","A sample which is \u201cprovided\u201d can be obtained by the person (or machine) conducting the assay, or it can have been obtained by another, and transferred to the person (or machine) carrying out the assay.","By a \u201csample\u201d (e.g. a test sample) from a subject meant a sample that might be expected to contain elevated levels of the protein markers of the invention in a subject having myocardial ischemia. Many suitable sample types will be evident to a skilled worker. In one embodiment of the invention, the sample is a blood sample, such as whole blood, plasma, or serum (plasma from which clotting factors have been removed). For example, peripheral, arterial or venous plasma or serum can be used. In another embodiment, the sample is urine, sweat, or another body fluid into which proteins are sometimes removed from the blood stream. In the case of urine, for example, the protein is likely to be broken down, so diagnostic fragments of the proteins of the invention can be screened for. In another embodiment, the sample is cardiac tissue, which is harvested, e.g., after a heart transplant or the insertion of a pacemaker or defibrillator. Methods for obtaining samples and preparing them for analysis (e.g., for detection of the amount of protein) are conventional and well-known in the art. Some suitable methods are described in the Examples herein or in the references cited therein.","A \u201csubject,\u201d as used herein, includes any animal that has, or is suspected of having, myocaridal ischemia. Suitable subjects (patients) include laboratory animals (such as mouse, rat, rabbit, guinea pig or pig), farm animals, sporting animals (e.g. dogs or horses) and domestic animals or pets (such as a horse, dog or cat). Non-human primates and human patients are included. For example, human subjects who present with chest pain or other symptoms of cardiac distress, including, e.g. shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, sweating, weakness, fatigue, or palpitations, can be evaluated by a method of the invention. About \u00bc of MI are silent and without chest pain. Furthermore, patients who have been evaluated in an emergency room or in an ambulance or physician's office and then dismissed as not being ill according to current tests for infarction have an increased risk of having a heart attack in the next 24-48 hours; such patients can be monitored by a method of the invention to determine if and when they begin express markers of the invention, which indicates that, e.g., they are beginning to exhibit ischemia. Subjects can also be monitored by a method of the invention to improve the accuracy of current provocative tests for ischemia, such as exercise stress testing. An individual can be monitored by a method of the invention during exercise stress tests of Dobutamine stress tests to determine if the individual is at risk for ischemia; such monitoring can supplement or replace the test that is currently carried out. Athletes (e.g., humans, racing dogs or race horses) can be monitored during training to ascertain if they are exerting themselves too vigorously and are in danger of undergoing an MI.","In another embodiment of the invention, the method is used as a screen in order to identify a drug (or to improve a cardioplegic solution) that protects the heart from ischemia and necrosis. The detection of one or more of the proteins of the invention in blood (or media if cell culture is used) is indicative of ischemia, and the quantity of the protein(s) is indicative of the severity of the ischemia.","The properties and amino acid sequences of the proteins of the invention are well-known and can be determined routinely, as well as downloaded from various known databases. See, e.g., the database, International Protein Index (IPI) at the world wide web site, ebi.ac.uk\/IPI\/xrefs.html. A summary of some properties of some of the proteins discussed herein, including their IPI ID number and amino acid sequences, is provided in Examples II and IV. This information is accurate as of the date of filing of this application. However, some of this information, including the sequences, is routinely updated (e.g. to correct mistakes in the previous entries), so updated (corrected) information about the proteins is included in this application. Information provided in the IPI database is incorporated by reference in the present application.","Although much of the data presented in the Examples herein are directed to particular forms of proteins of interest (or peptides thereof), it will be evident to a skilled worker that a variety of forms of these proteins may be indicative of the presence of myocardial ischemia in a subject. For example, the protein may be an intact, full-length protein. If a protein undergoes processing naturally (e.g., is converted from a pre-pro-hormone to a pro-hormone to a fully processed hormone; the N-terminal methionine is cleaved off; the signal sequence is removed, often accompanied by a post-translational modification, such as acetylation; etc.), any of these forms of the protein are included in the invention. Furthermore, in some instances, a protein of the invention may be broken down or degraded (e.g., proteins that are found in the urine). In such a case, an investigator can determine the level of one or more of the fragments or degradation products. A \u201cdiagnostic protein fragment,\u201d as used herein, is a fragment that is unique to the protein being identified, as detected by the assay. For example, a diagnostic fragment is recognized specifically by an antibody used to detect the full-length protein. Certain isoforms or post translational modifications (PTM) may also be encompassed by the invention. For example, the inventors have obtained data indicating PTM for C4b binding proteins; protease, serine; 3 alpha-2-glycoprotein 1; and zinc caspase 14.","The proteins and combinations of proteins discussed herein are sometimes referred to herein as \u201cproteins (or protein markers) of the invention.\u201d","A variety of tests that have been used to detect myocardial events (particularly late occurring events, such as necrotic myocardial ischemia). These include, e.g., determining the levels of cardiac specific isoform(s) of troponin I (TnI) and\/or troponin T (TnT), CK-MB (Creatine Kinase-MB), or myoglobin, although only the former two are the current gold standard. CK MB and myoglobin are not cardiac-specific. However, none of these markers is completely satisfactory for the detection of myocardial ischemia. For example, they fail to detect early stages of heart disease, such as non-necrotic myocardial ischemia. The new markers described herein can be used in conjunction with these types of assays.","When the values of more than one protein are being analyzed, a statistical method such as multi-variant analysis or principal component analysis (PCA) is used which takes into account the levels of the various proteins (e.g., using a linear regression score). For verification, we will use either immunoassay or multiple reaction monitoring (MRM, a MS-based targeted method that quantifies peptides that are unique to the protein of interest) on individuals (control, ischemia and MI).","In some embodiments, it is desirable to express the results of an assay in terms of an increase (e.g., a statistically significant increase) in a value (or combination of values) compared to a baseline value.","A \u201csignificant\u201d increase in a value, as used herein, can refer to a difference which is reproducible or statistically significant, as determined using statistical methods that are appropriate and well-known in the art, generally with a probability value of less than five percent chance of the change being due to random variation. In general, a statistically significant value is at least two standard deviations from the value in a \u201cnormal\u201d healthy control subject. Suitable statistical tests will be evident to a skilled worker. For example, a significant increase in the amount of a protein compared to a baseline value can be about 50%, 2-fold, or more higher. A significantly elevated amount of a protein of the invention compared to a suitable baseline value, then, is indicative that a test subject has myocardial ischemia (indicates that the subject is likely to have myocardial ischemia). A subject is \u201clikely\u201d to have myocardial ischemia if the subject has levels of the marker protein(s) significantly above those of a healthy control or his own baseline (taken at an earlier time point). The extent of the increased levels correlates to the % chance. For example, the subject can have greater than about a 50% chance, e.g., greater than about 70%, 80% 90%, 95% or higher chance, of having the ischemia. In general, the presence of an elevated amount of a marker of the invention is a strong indication that the subject has ischemia.","As used herein, a \u201cbaseline value\u201d generally refers to the level (amount) of a protein in a comparable sample (e.g., from the same type of tissue as the tested tissue, such as blood or serum), from a \u201cnormal\u201d healthy subject that does not exhibit myocardial ischemia. If desired, a pool or population of the same tissues from normal subjects can be used, and the baseline value can be an average or mean of the measurements. Suitable baseline values can be determined by those of skill in the art without undue experimentation. Suitable baseline values may be available in a database compiled from the values and\/or may be determined based on published data or on retrospective studies of patients' tissues, and other information as would be apparent to a person of ordinary skill implementing a method of the invention. Suitable baseline values may be selected using statistical tools that provide an appropriate confidence interval so that measured levels that fall outside the standard value can be accepted as being aberrant from a diagnostic perspective, and predictive of ischemia.","It is generally not practical in a clinical or research setting to use patient samples as sources for baseline controls. Therefore, one can use any of variety of reference values in which the same or a similar level of expression is found as in a subject that does not have myocardial ischemia.","It will be appreciated by those of skill in the art that a baseline or normal level need not be established for each assay as the assay is performed but rather, baseline or normal levels can be established by referring to a form of stored information regarding a previously determined baseline levels for a given protein or panel of proteins, such as a baseline level established by any of the above-described methods. Such a form of stored information can include, for example, a reference chart, listing or electronic file of population or individual data regarding \u201cnormal levels\u201d (negative control) or positive controls; a medical chart for the patient recording data from previous evaluations; a receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curve; or any other source of data regarding baseline levels that is useful for the patient to be diagnosed. In one embodiment of the invention, the amount of the proteins in a combination of proteins, compared to a baseline value, is expressed as a linear regression score, as described, e.g., in Irwin, in Neter, Kutner, Nachtsteim, Wasserman (1996) Applied Linear Statistical Models, 4edition, page 295.","In an embodiment in which the progress of a treatment is being monitored, a baseline value can be based on earlier measurements taken from the same subject, before the treatment was administered.","The amount of a protein can be measured using any suitable method. Some methods involve the use of antibodies, binding ligands, or mass spectrometry tagged peptides specific for a protein of interest. Antibodies suitable for use in assays of the invention are commercially available, or can be prepared routinely. Methods for preparing and using antibodies in assays for proteins of interest are conventional, and are described, e.g., in Green et al., (Manson, ed.), (Humana Press 1992); Coligan et al., in , Sec. 2.4.1 (1992); Kohler & Milstein (1975), 256, 495; Coligan et al., sections 2.5.1-2.6.7; and Harlow et al., Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, page 726 (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Pub. 1988).","Any of a variety of antibodies can be used in methods of the invention. Such antibodies include, e.g., polyclonal, monoclonal (mAbs), recombinant, humanized or partially humanized, single chain, Fab, and fragments thereof. The antibodies can be of any isotype, e.g., IgM, various IgG isotypes such as IgG IgG, etc., and they can be from any animal species that produces antibodies, including goat, rabbit, mouse, chicken or the like. The term, an antibody \u201cspecific for\u201d a protein, means that the antibody recognizes a defined sequence of amino acids, or epitope in the protein. An antibody that is \u201cspecific for\u201d a polypeptide refers to an antibody that binds selectively to the polypeptide and not generally to other polypeptides unintended for binding to the antibody. The parameters required to achieve such specificity can be determined routinely, using conventional methods in the art. Conditions that are effective for binding a protein to an antibody which is specific for it are well-known and conventional.","In one embodiment of the invention, antibodies specific for a (one or more) protein of the invention are immobilized on a surface (e.g., are reactive elements on an array, such as a microarray, or are on another surface, such as used for surface plasmon resonance (SPR)-based technology, such as Biacore), and proteins in the sample are detected by virtue of their ability to bind specifically to the antibodies. Alternatively, proteins in the sample can be immobilized on a surface, and detected by virtue of their ability to bind specifically to the antibodies. Methods of preparing the surfaces and performing the analyses, including conditions effective for specific binding, are conventional and well-known in the art.","Among the many types of suitable immunoassays are immunohistochemical staining, ELISA, Western blot (immunoblot), immunoprecipitation, radioimmuno assay (RIA), fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), etc. Assays used in a method of the invention can be based on colorimetric readouts, fluorescent readouts, mass spectrometry, visual inspection, etc. Assays can be carried out, e.g., with suspension beads, or with arrays, in which antibodies or cell or blood samples are attached to a surface such as a glass slide or a chip.","In one embodiment, a tissue sample (e.g. a cardiac tissue sample) is stained with a suitable antibody in a conventional immunohistochemical assay for those proteins which are present in the myocardium. Note that it can be difficult to obtain human tissue unless an individual is undergoing surgery or a routine biopsy (e.g. following heart transplantation), and such subjects are likely to be ischemic to some degree.","Mass spectrometry (MS) can also be used to determine the amount of a protein, using conventional methods. Some typical such methods are described in the Examples herein. Relative ratio between multiple samples can be determined using label free methods (as done in the present Examples), based on spectral count (and the number of unique peptides and the number of observation of each peptide). In the Examples herein, we used a LTQ-Orbitrap LC\/MS\/MS instrument to obtain the data. Alternatively, quantitive data can be obtained using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM), most often carried out using a triple quadruple mass spectrometer. In this case, peptides that are unique to a given protein are selected in the MS instrument and quantified. Absolute quantification can be obtained if a known labeled synthetic peptide is used. For detailed methods see, e.g., Qin Fu and JE Van Eyk, in Clinical Proteomics: from diagnostics to therapy (Van Eyk JE and Dunn M, eds), Wiley and Son Press; Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Preparation of Proteins and Peptides for Mass Spectrometry Analysis in a Bottom-Up Proteomics Workflow, Gundry et al., chapter 10, 2009, in press)","In general, molecular biology methods referred to herein are well-known in the art and are described, e.g., in Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, current edition, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., and Ausubel et al., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley & sons, New York, N.Y.","A detection (diagnostic) method of the invention can be adapted for many uses. For example, it can be used to follow the progression of cardiac ischemia. In one embodiment of the invention, the detection is carried out both before (or at approximately the same time as), and after, the administration of a treatment, and the method is used to monitor the effectiveness of the treatment. A subject can be monitored in this way to determine the effectiveness for that subject of a particular drug regimen, or a drug or other treatment modality can be evaluated in a pre-clinical or clinical trial. If a treatment method is successful, the levels of the protein markers of the invention are expected to decrease.","A method of the invention can be used to suggest a suitable method of treatment for a subject. For example, if a subject is determined by a method of the invention to be likely to have myocardial ischemia, a decision can be made to treat the subject with an aggressive form of treatment; and, in one embodiment, the treatment is then administered. Suitable aggressive treatment modalities include, for example, angioplasty (mechanical widening to open blood vessels); treating with an anti-thrombolysis agent or, if possible, with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI, or TPA); or undergoing coronary bypass surgery to replace the injured\/blocked coronary artery. Methods for carrying out such treatments are conventional and well-known. By contrast, if a subject is determined not to be likely to have myocardial ischemia, a decision can be made to adopt a less aggressive treatment regimen; and, in one embodiment, the subject is then treated with this less aggressive forms of treatment. Suitable less aggressive forms of treatment include, for example, treatment with asprin and\/or agents that bring about thrombolysis (e.g., TPA); periodic monitoring to ensure no future MI events; or recommending changes in life style. A subject that does not have myocardial ischemia is thus spared the unpleasant side-effects associated with the unnecessary, more aggressive forms of treatment. By \u201ctreated\u201d is meant that an effective amount of a drug or other anti-heart disease procedure is administered to the subject. An \u201ceffective\u201d amount of an agent refers to an amount that elicits a detectable response (e.g. of a therapeutic response) in the subject.","One aspect of the invention is a kit for detecting whether a subject is likely to have myocardial ischemia, comprising one or more agents for detecting the amount of a protein of the invention. As used herein, the singular forms \u201ca,\u201d \u201can\u201d and \u201cthe\u201d include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. For example, \u201ca\u201d protein of the invention, as used above, includes 2, 3, 4, 5 or more of the proteins. In addition, other markers for ischemia (e.g., as discussed elsewhere herein) can also be present in a kit. If mass spectrometry is to be used to measure protein levels, the following reagents can be included in the kit: known amounts of a labeled (e.g. stable isotope) peptide (synthetic or recombinant) standard for each peptide to be assessed, separately or combined into a single mixture containing all peptides; optionally, a different peptide standard for assessing reproducibility of the assay; and\/or, optionally, dilutant and trypsin for preparation of the sample. If an antibody-based method is to be used to measure protein levels, the agents in the kit can encompass antibodies specific for the proteins. The kit may also include additional agents suitable for detecting, measuring and\/or quantitating the amount of protein, including conventional analytes for creation of standard curves. Among other uses, kits of the invention can be used in experimental applications. A skilled worker will recognize components of kits suitable for carrying out a method of the invention.","Optionally, a kit of the invention may comprise instructions for performing the method. Optional elements of a kit of the invention include suitable buffers, containers, or packaging materials. The reagents of the kit may be in containers in which the reagents are stable, e.g., in lyophilized form or stabilized liquids. The reagents may also be in single use form, e.g., for the performance of an assay for a single subject. In one embodiment of the invention, the kit is a \u201chome chest pain test kit,\u201d that can be used to test blood, urine, or other body fluids for the presence (and\/or level) of protein markers of the invention. Thus, a patient who has been released from an Emergency Department (ED) or a cardiac ward, but who is at risk over the next about 48 hours, can take the test over time at home and, if the test produces positive results, return to the ED.","In the foregoing and in the following examples, all temperatures are set forth in uncorrected degrees Celsius; and, unless otherwise indicated, all parts and percentages are by weight.","A. Overview of the Studies","Rapid atrial pacing has been reported to produce reversible and controlled myocardial ischemia, as measured by a coronary sinus lactate concentration that rises above arterial lactate concentration, in approximately \u2154 of patients with fixed epicardial coronary artery disease (>70% diameter stenosis in at least one coronary artery). (Dehmer et al. (1983) 106, 114-24; Markham et al. (1983) 51, 1589-94). Therefore, in the experiments shown in this Example, atrial pacing was used as the human demand ischemia model.","In the studies shown in this Example, three types of protein analysis were conducted to identify protein markers of the invention. There is normally less than 40% overlap (e.g., 3-5) in the proteins observed between the different types of analysis platforms. This is because every protein is intrinsically different with respect to its pI, hydrophobicity and mass. Furthermore, post translational modifications (PTM) alter the intrinsic nature of the protein and thus may display quite different separation or enrichment characteristics. As such, the choice of technology or group of technologies should be dictated by the characteristics of the proteins targeted by the experimental question. In the case of biomarker discovery (and based on the lessons learnt from the biomarker, cTnI), multiple protein separation strategies should (and do) increase proteome coverage.","The present inventors and collaborators have found that the combination of intact protein separation technologies of 2DE (two-dimensional electrophoresis), 2DLC (two-dimensional liquid chromatography) and 1DLC (one-dimensional liquid chromatography) increases the proteome coverage while allowing enhanced detection of isoforms and PTM. 2DE of serum (and plasma) was optimized for separation by using pH 4-7 and 10% Bis-Tris gel (Graham et al. (20050) 5, 2309-14; Fu et al. (2005) 5, 2656-64), as were the liquid chromatography methods. The combination of chemical depletion and optimized 2DE conditions can achieve good reproducibility (\u02dc20% CV) (Fu et al. (supra)). Liquid chromatography (LC) separates proteins based on one or more of their intrinsic properties: mass (size exclusion), isoelectric point (pI, chromatographic focusing or ion exchange), hydrophobicity (reversed phase) or affinity chromatography (bio-specificity). Our laboratory has optimized 2DLC combining chromatographic focusing and reversed phase HPLC with the commercial Beckman Coulter instrument, the Two-Dimensional Protein Fractionation (PF2D) system (McDonald et al. (2006) 5, 2392-411; Sheng et al. (2006) 5, 26-34; Stasna et al. Protein separation: Liquid chromatography, In \u201cProteomic and Genomic Analysis of Cardiovascular Disease\u201d (eds. Van Eyk JE and Dunn M) 2008 Wiley and Son Press, page 241). Briefly, samples are loaded onto the first dimension column (ion exchange column) at pH 8.5 in presence of urea and detergent and separated based on pI by decreasing the pH to 4.0 (Graham et al. (2006) (supra). Proteins that are bound tightly to the column or have a pI below 4.0 are eluted using 1M salt. We found that including 20% isopropanol in the buffers can eliminate \u201cartificial\u201d binding of a subset of proteins to the first dimension. Fractions are collected throughout the chromatographic separation and each fraction is subsequently separated by reversed phase chromatography using a linear gradient composed of aqueous trifloroacetic acid (TFA), pH 2.3 and TFA\/actronitrile, pH 2.3. The second dimension elution profile is monitored at 214 nm (peptide bonds) and is semi-quantitative. On average, fractions contain 1-100 proteins in each peak (McDonald et al. (2006); Graham et al. (2006) (both supra)). These samples can be further analyzed by electrophoresis (1DE or 2DE) or analyzed directly by mass spectrometry (MS). If so, due to the complexity of the reversed phase fractions they must undergo further online LC separation prior to MS. An overview outlining the process is summarized in Fu et al. (2008) (supra).","B. Cohort Information for Atria Pacing Human Model\u2014Cohort I","1.

TP0 or TPx is the number of all unique peptides for the complete data set for that individual at that specific time point (0 or x). SC0 and SCx are the spectral counts at time points 0 and x for the protein. TSC0 and TSCx are the total number of spectral counts in the experiment at time points 0 and x.

criteria for 1DLC was based on analysis of all individuals in each group (induced necrosis or induced ischemia) and are as follows:","i) Changes in the number of unique peptides or the number of time each peptide was observed regardless of charge state (2+. 3+ or 4+) were compared to the equivalent protein (if observed) at time point 0. Changes are based on Ror Rvalues of 0.30 or greater. The fold changes associated with these R values depend on the number of observations and range from 1:4 ratio (R=0.36 before total observation correction, 4 fold change) to a 300:600 (R=0.3001 before total observation correction, 2 fold change). The total observation correction will shift the R value depending on the different in size of the 2 sample groups and the proportion of observations for a the protein of interest relative to the entire sample. A 10% difference in sample size between the compared samples could increase or decrease the R value by 0.045ii)","ii) Changes in 2 out of the 3 or 3 out of the 3 individuals in a designated group (induced ischemia or induced necrosis) at any time point.","5. Results","Although the number of unique peptides observed between MS run 1 and 2 were similar, the number of peptide observations was reduced in the second run (Table 6). This did not overly affect the number of proteins observed except for the lower abundant proteins. There were 25 different serum samples analyzed, giving raise to 650 fractions being analyzed per MS analysis (1300 total MS runs). This resulted in, for both MS runs, over 41,000 unique peptides being identified, with these peptides observed over 410,600 times. Table 7 outlines the proteins that met the criteria above and whether they were observed to change by 2DLC.","An additional level of stringency was added in which the variation within an individual was taken into account. The first tier proteins are found consistently to remain elevated. These are highlighted in bold type. Those proteins with variation between patients or time points were ranked as second tier. Bradykinin peptide was also included (rather than kininogen, the parent protein which had a weaker correlation) based on reducing the fold change required to 1.5 fold. It was the only additional protein that met this weaker criterion.

This was done in order to reduce background of the chromatogram. Protein concentration was determined using BCA assay (Pierce). Samples were analyzed on the same set of first and second dimension columns. 2 mg of sample from each time point were sequentially injected on the HPCF first dimension column, followed by HPRF second dimension separation. Fractions were collected into 96-well plates and stored at \u221280 C until analyzed. Extensive washing was carried out between runs to eliminate possible cross-over contamination.","Chromatographic images were compared and the same regions\/domains from multiple-pH fractions were combined based on profile and previous identification. Fractions from high salt wash were analyzed individually without pooling. Total 315 fractions from 7 time points were dried down, neutralized, and digested with trypsin. 50% of the digested sample was applied to the LC LTQ-Orbitrap MS.","For LC-MS\/MS experiments on the LTQ-Orbitrap (ThermoFinnigan, San Jose, Calif.), peptides from the digestion of LC fraction were resuspended in 6 \u03bcl resuspension buffer (4% acetonitrile in water with 0.1% formic acid). Samples (3 \u03bcl) were loaded onto a 75 um\u00d710 cm BioBasic C18 column (New Objective, Woburn, Mass.). Peptides were eluted into an LTQ-Orbitrap (ThermoFinnigan, San Jose, Calif.) using an Agilent 1200 nano-LC system (Agilent, Santa Clara, Calif.). The HPLC gradient was 5% to 60% B (90% acetonitrile\/water in 0.1% Formic acid) over 30 or 60 min dependent on sample complexity. The mass spectrometer was operated in data-dependent mode in which every FT-MS scan (survey 350-2000 Da) was followed by MS\/MS scans of the 5 most abundant ions.","All mass spectrometry data was analyzed according to the pipeline established and already used in the Van Eyk laboratory, designed to meet stringent criteria from the proteomics community. Data from the LTQ-Orbitrap was searched against the IPI databases where possible, using Sorcerer Sequest (Sagen, San Jose, Calif.). Search results were validated and analyzed using Scaffold (Proteome Systems, Portland, Oreg.). Protein identifications based upon a single peptide observation were handled carefully through manual inspection of the tandem MS (MS\/MS) spectra, BLAST searching of the sequence to ensure it matches only the reported protein, requiring a minimum of 8 amino acids and a peptide probability score of >0.9.","Data analysis flow was based on the following: peptide redundancy removed, protein name redundancy removed, the number of unique peptides and number of observation for each peptide regardless of charge state were determined for each protein and, in the cases where the protein was observed in multiple domains as an indicator of potential PTM this was noted and all data for the protein was included for quantitation.","The number of unique peptides and total number of counts (number of times each peptide is observed) were dependently used to semi-quantify each protein that was observed. To deal with proteins which peptides were only observed at some but not all time points (resulting in no information) a correction factor of 1.25 was used in all R value calculations with a R>0.3 as indicative of change.

Intact Protein Separation by Hydrophobicity","1DLC analysis was carried out for cohort II (20 patients with two time points). All 1DLC analyses were done in duplicate using the optimized gradient developed to eliminate the interference of the unknown contaminates that eluted at the beginning and end of the run. Optimization was required as the contaminants were not MS compatible and co-eluted with proteins found to be interesting in cohort I. The duplicate run for each patient time point were collected into a single plate and stored at \u221280\u00b0 C. until analyzed. A total of 80@ 1DLC runs were carried out (20\u00d72\u00d72=80 (2 time points, 20 patients, in duplicate)). The fractions obtained for each 1DLC run were pooled into 16 fractions, neutralized and dried down, prior to resolublization in buffer compatible for tryptic digestion.","3. MS Analysis","MS, analysis for each digested fraction was carried using the LTQ Orbitrap LC MSMS instrument. Each fraction was run in duplicate. A total 1216 MS runs were carried out (19\u00d72\u00d716\u00d72=1216 (19 patients, 16 fractions per time point, two time points, in duplicate). For LC-MS\/MS experiments on the LTQ-Orbitrap (ThermoFinnigan, San Jose, Calif.), peptides were dissolved in 6 \u03bcl resuspension buffer (4% acetonitrile in water with 0.1% formic acid). Samples (3 \u03bcl) were loaded onto a 75 um\u00d710 cm BioBasic C18 column (New Objective, Woburn, Mass.). Peptides were eluted into an LTQ-Orbitrap (ThermoFinnigan, San Jose, Calif.) using an Agilent 1200 nano-LC system (Agilent, Santa Clara, Calif.). The HPLC gradient was 5% to 60% B (90% acetonitrile\/water in 0.1% Formic acid) over 30 or 60 min depended on sample complexity. The mass spectrometer was operated in data-dependent mode in which every FT-MS scan (survey 350-2000 Da) was followed by MS\/MS scans of the 5 most abundant ions.","Mass spectrometry data were analyzed, and data reanalysis was carried out, as described in Example 1D2 above.","C.

The analyte will either be peptide, protein fragment or protein and will be used to generate standard curve. Analysis will be carried out using conventional ELISA or on a Luminex or Mesoscale platform. Assays will be carried out at least in duplicate. For MRM assays, peptides (generated most likely by trypsin, chymotrypsin or Lys C) that are unique to the protein of interest and showing high MS signal response (prototypic peptides) which will help maximize the sensitivity of the assay. 2. Selection of predominant peptide fragments specific (MS\/MS) for the parent peptide (useful MRM transition). 3. For each peptide-fragment pair, optimization of specific MS parameters (e.g. the collision energy) to maximize the signal response\/sensitivity. 4. Validation of the MRM assay to confirm peptide identity, e.g. by acquiring a full MS2 spectrum of the peptide in the triple quadrupole MS instrument used for MRM. 5. Extraction of the final \u201ccoordinates\u201d of the MRM assay, including the selected peptide and peptide fragments, the corresponding mass-to-charge ratios, the fragment intensity ratios, the associated collision energy, and the chromatographic elution time to be optionally used in time-constrained MRM analyses. We will add isotopically labeled internal peptide standards (with known concentrations determined by amino acid analysis) to facilitate absolute quantitation of selected peptides.
