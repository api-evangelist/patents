The entire disclosures of the above applications are hereby expressly incorporated by reference in their entireties in the instant Application.","Voltage drop, also called IR drop, is the voltage reduction that occurs on power supply networks. The IR drop may be static or dynamic and results from the existence of non-ideal elements\u2014the resistance within the power and ground supply wiring and the capacitance between them. While static voltage drop considers only the average currents, dynamic voltage drop considers current waveforms within clock cycles and has an RC transient behavior. Similar effects may be found in ground wiring, usually referred as ground bounce, whereby current flows back to the ground\/Vpins causing its voltage to fluctuate. Both effects contribute to lower operating voltages within devices (e.g., logic cells\/gates in digital circuits), which in general increases the overall time response of a device and might cause operational failures.","The recent advances in very deep sub-micron (VDSM) integrated circuits (ICs) have brought new challenges in the physical design methodology process of integrated systems. In modern electronic circuits, geometries become smaller; clock frequencies increase; and on-chip interconnections gain increased importance in the prediction of performance. Nonetheless, it has been found that from 0.13 \u03bcm and bellow, ICs are more susceptible to IR drop, which requires some degree of built-in fault-tolerance and a careful design planning. Meanwhile, increased power demanded on ever shrunk chip size further exacerbates the problem because a significant number of devices may become active in a short period of time and drawing current from close regions of the power grid.","Unfortunately, most conventional electronic circuit design tools focus on post-layout verification of the power grid when the entire chip design is complete and detailed information about the parasitics of the physical designs and the currents drawn by the transistors are known. IR drop problems revealed at this stage are usually very difficult or expensive to fix so the conventional methodologies help to design an initial electronic design and refine it iteratively at various design stages. In other words, the conventional circuit synthesis step is followed by layout synthesis and each step is carried out independent of the other. This is again followed by a physical or formal verification step to check whether the desired performance goals have been achieved after layout generation and extraction. These steps are carried out iteratively in such conventional approaches till the desired performance goals are met.","Thus, there exists a need for implementing electronic circuit designs with IR-drop awareness early in the design stage.","What is disclosed is a method, a system, and a computer program product for implementing electronic circuit designs with IR-drop awareness. In various embodiments, the method or the system for implementing electronic circuit designs with IR-drop awareness comprises the process or module for identifying, determining, or updating physical data of a net, a device, or a component of a physical design of the electronic circuit. In some device, the method or the system further comprises the process or module for characterizing one or more electrical parasitics that are associated with the physical data.","In some embodiments, the method or the system for implementing electronic circuit designs with IR-drop awareness may further comprise the process or module for identifying or determining one or more IR-drop related constraints that are associated with one or more electrical characteristics, etc. The method or the system may also optionally comprise the process or module for ensuring correctness of the physical data and\/or other data that are related to the one or more IR-drop related constraints in some embodiments.","In some embodiments where at least one of the one or more IR-drop related constraints is not met, the method or the system may further optionally comprise the process or module for determining or computing one or more adjustments for the physical data, the net(s), and\/or the device(s) and\/or providing hint(s) to correct the physical data. Some embodiments may further comprise the process or module for checking to ensuring that the one or more adjustments for the physical data do not violate or cause conflict with other design rules, constraints, or other issues, etc. Some embodiments may further comprise automatic or assisted application of the one or more adjustments to fix or repair the physical data. More description of the aforementioned processes or modules will be further described in greater details in the subsequent paragraphs with reference to various figures.","Various embodiments will now be described in detail with reference to the drawings, which are provided as illustrative examples of the invention so as to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention. Notably, the figures and the examples below are not meant to limit the scope of the present invention. Where certain elements of the invention may be partially or fully implemented using known components (or methods or processes), only those portions of such known components (or methods or processes) that are necessary for an understanding of the present invention will be described, and the detailed descriptions of other portions of such known components (or methods or processes) will be omitted so as not to obscure the invention. Further, the present invention encompasses present and future known equivalents to the components referred to herein by way of illustration.","Characterization of an electrical characteristic or a device parameter (collectively \u201celectrical parasitic\u201d or simply \u201cparasitic\u201d) may be performed to determine the current and voltage characteristics of the created or modified physical data, such as interconnect wires, via or via clusters. The interconnect structures may be part of signal or power nets. This characterization is not limited to interconnect in that physical design creation and modification of devices may impact device parasitics such as gate to contact capacitance or gate related fringe capacitance. Also one device in the schematic may be represented in the layout as multiple devices, e.g. multi-fingered devices, where a single terminal current on the schematic is actually multiple currents to each finger.","Generally, a schematic circuit is created and simulated to determine the electrical characteristics of the circuit. In the approach described herein this may be done any time prior to solving for the electrical characteristics of the physical design. Simulation is often done upon completion of the schematic and in this flow that data may be stored in a database for retrieval later. The simulation is operated at particular corners and analysis points, such as temperature, and the same settings are used during parasitic extraction. In one embodiment, the parasitic extraction or the determination of electrical characteristics may be performed in memory as one or more layout shapes or nets are created or modified.","For IR drop analysis of power grids, both the non-linear devices and linear interconnect components of the circuit must be accounted for during simulation. However due to the large size of the power grid, it is usually not efficient to solve the complete nonlinear circuit and distribution network simultaneously within the circuit simulator. As such, methods have been created to decouple the nonlinear and linear elements of the overall circuit to enable a more efficient solution. The most common approach simulates the non-linear devices and models the power sources and drains as a constant voltage source and power drains respectively.","In the second step, electrical parasitics (e.g. resistance (R), inductance (L), or capacitance (C)) may be computed for any physical design object or set of objects to re-simulate the design. The system monitors and tracks all design changes and applies resistance and capacitance models. The set of partial objects may form a partial layout. The preferred embodiment is that parasitics may be generated interactively as physical design objects are created or modified. The data is stored for use with subsequent electrical analysis and may additionally be displayed in parasitic form. The parasitics may be displayed as function of a wire object or segment, a full net or in the case of capacitance the interaction with other nets may be shown. In some embodiments, thermal maps where the estimated operating temperature varies across a device may be applied locally to estimate the correct parasitic elements.","In the third step, the current and voltage information is then used with the RC parasitic data to solve the power network as a linear system using direct (e.g. Cholesky) or iterative (e.g. Conjugate Gradient) techniques.","For DC (direct current) analysis the resulting linear formulation for IR drop uses only resistance\/conductance and contains no capacitors. The resulting equation:\n\n\n","where G is the matrix of conductance values, v is the vector of node voltages and i is the vector of independent sources is solved using a linear solver employing direct or indirect methods. For example, Cholesky factorization may be used to separate the conductance matrix into a product of lower and upper triangular matrices and then forward and back substitution may be used to solve for the voltages throughout the network. In some embodiments, the aforementioned method followed by forward and backward substitution may be used to produce a vector of currents where each vector element represents a point in time, associated with each sample from the current waveform. For example, the aforementioned method may be used to compute RMS (root mean square) values, using the current waveforms produced by the linear solver for each part of the net.","In the aforementioned approach, the device related simulation parameters may be done during the schematic creation stage prior to physical design. The only requirement is that it be done prior to any linear solver being employed. During physical design, the electrical parasitics (e.g. R,L,C) are computed as the each physical data object\/net is created or invoked manually as a set of physical data objects\/nets are created.","Another approach uses the electrical parasitics associated with any physical design object or set of objects to re-simulate the design. The set of partial objects may also form a partial layout. In this approach the parasitics may need to be mapped to the schematic representation or stitched into the schematic. The parasitics may also be reduced a form that allows for faster simulation. The simulation parameters such as temperature are matched with that used for extraction. The simulator provides parasitic aware set of voltages and currents that are used for static or transient IR drop checks in subsequent steps. One embodiment is where simulation or re-simulation of the layout parasitics may be done in conjunction with IR-drop analysis or vice versa so that any impact of the interconnect may be addressed before the layout is completed.","For each physical data object, e.g. an element of the power grid, the resulting voltage drop may be compared to pre-set limits or mathematical expressions. When the limits are exceeded then the user may be notified through a graphical user interface. When the IR drop associated with a physical data, e.g. wire segment, is exceeded, the physical geometries, e.g. wire width, of the data object may be computed such the limit is not exceeded. These changes may be displayed as a hint to the user for manual fixing or the changes may be made automatically.","The IR drop checking flow may be used as part of the manual or automatic routing or post-route optimization of a design, for example during design of a block or integration activity. In this flow each route is created, checked for IR drop correctness and if necessary corrected before moving to the next route. The IR drop checking flow may be combined with current, voltage, resistance or capacitance constraints created prior to physical design.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 1A","b":["102","100"]},"In some embodiments, the process for identifying, determining, or updating physical data of a component of an electronic circuit physical design may be invoked from within a physical design tool or flow, such as a layout editor, while the designer is implementing or modifying the physical design of the electronic circuit rather than from a post-layout verification tool or flow in one or more embodiments. In some embodiments, device recognition and connectivity tasks are performed to able to map electrical characteristics such as current at a given terminal with the proper nets attached to that terminal. In some embodiments; connectivity can be directed to traverse the nets hierarchically and stop on levels determined by the user.","In some embodiments, the physical data may be related to a net, which comprises one or more wires or interconnects connecting various other components together in an electronic circuit design. In some embodiment, the physical data may be related to a single component in the physical design (e.g., a layout) of the electronic circuit. In some embodiments, the physical data may be related to a device, which comprises a component that comprises a source and a drain. A device may comprise, for example, a field-effect transistor. In this example, the physical data may comprise the description of physical device layers and geometric descriptions that define the gate, source and drain regions. In various embodiments, the physical data may further comprise the material and its associated physical (e.g., physical or electrical) attributes. In various embodiments, the method or system may characterize shapes associated with a net and need to determine connectivity to identify one net from another.","In various embodiments, the method or system may characterize one or more shapes associated with a net and need to determine connectivity to identify or distinguish one net from another. In various embodiments, the characterization of parasitics such as R, L or C for shapes that constitute a net and the subsequent characterization of the electrical behavior such as currents, voltages, or with additional computation, current density or densities occur as a net (or shape that is part of a net) is created or modified. This characterization may occur incrementally as each net is created or modified and may occur while there is only a partial layout in some embodiments. The simulation produced terminal currents may be used as nets that connect to those terminals are created or modified. The simulation produced terminal currents may be used as one or more nets that connect to these terminals are being created or modified in some embodiments. In addition, these characterization(s) or verification(s) may occur while there is only a partial layout in some embodiments. In these embodiments, the simulation, re-simulation, characterization, or verification of the electrical parasitics may be performed in conjunction with the creation or modification of the physical design of an electronic circuit design so that any impact of a circuit component is addressed before the physical design is completed.","In some embodiments, the methods or systems for implementing electronic circuit design with IR-drop awareness comprises the process or the hardware module for characterizing one or more electrical parasitics that are associated with the physical data of the component that has been identified, determined, or updated at .","In some embodiments, the electrical parasitic comprises resistance, self- or coupled-inductance, or capacitance that is associated with the physical data. In the example of an interconnect segment in a physical design, the method or the system may characterize the resistance of this particular interconnect segment by using the electrical resistivity, the length of the segment, and the cross-sectional area along the segment. In some embodiments, the system monitors and tracks the relevant physical data associated with the creation or change to the design, for example the creation of a net or the widening of a wire segment in a net.","Resistance and capacitance models may be applied automatically to compute the parasitic data in some embodiments. In these embodiments, electrical parasitics may be generated interactively as physical design objects have been or are being created or modified. The set of partial design objects, including a set of one or more objects in the electronic circuit design that is interactively analyzed, may form a partial layout in some embodiments. In various embodiments, a partial layout comprises zero or more physical design objects and thus does not pass a layout versus schematic (LVS) check or verification. The results of various characterization processes or modules may be stored for use with subsequent electrical analysis processes or may additionally be displayed in parasitic form(s) in one or more embodiments.","In some embodiments, the characterization of electrical parasitics associated with physical data may be done with a two stage approach. This process begins with the selection a particular net or partial net. In the first stage, the process identifies where along that net that a geometric description should be created. The geometric descriptions may include wire widths and spacings, conductor and ILD (inter layer dielectrics) thicknesses, or thickness of barrier materials. A common description may be created and provided via an API (application programming interface.) The second stage may include one or more components that may translate, transform, convert, or map (hereinafter \u201cmap\u201d) the geometric description to an equivalent parasitic value such as a resistance, capacitance or inductance. This translation, transformation, conversion, or mapping (hereinafter \u201cmapping\u201d) may be done with mathematical algorithms or models that are often referred to as parasitic extraction. The models may be created through the use of semi-empirical methods that combine models or knowledge of the underlying physics with data provided by various solver(s), simulator(s), or a combination thereof. In some cases, the mapping for capacitance may also be done with a solver.","In some embodiments, the second stage may use parasitic extraction for some nets and a field solver for other nets. In some embodiments, the second stage may use a combination of parasitic extraction for, for example, resistance(s) and a field solver for, for example, capacitance(s) on the same net. In some embodiments, the characterization of electrical parasitics may be performed with extraction tools that map geometric dimensions and patterns to corresponding parasitics such as R, L, or C.","The method or the system may further comprise the process or the hardware module for characterizing one or more electrical characteristics that are associated with the one or more electrical parasitics or the physical data of the component at  in some embodiments. In one or more embodiments, the methods or systems for implementing electronic circuit design with IR-drop awareness comprises the process or the hardware module for storing the one or more electrical characteristics that are associated with the physical data of the component at .","In one or more embodiments, the characterization of electrical parasitics, such as but not limited to various types of R, L, or C for one or more shapes that constitute a net, and the subsequent characterization of the electrical behavior or characteristic(s), such as but not limited to various types of currents, voltages, or current densities, as well as the checking or verification occur as a single net (or one or more shapes that are part of a net) has been created or modified but before the creation or modification of the next net or one or more shapes that are part of the next net. These characterizations or verification may also occur incrementally as a net is being created or modified in some embodiments.
