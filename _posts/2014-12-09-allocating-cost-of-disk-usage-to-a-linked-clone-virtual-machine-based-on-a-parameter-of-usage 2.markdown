title: Allocating cost of disk usage to a linked clone virtual machine based on a parameter of usage
abstract: The present disclosure is related to methods, systems, and machine-readable media for allocating cost of disk usage to a linked clone virtual machine (VM) based on a parameter of usage. A determination can be made as to a number of disks used by a linked clone VM among a plurality of disks in a software defined data center over a time period and as to a respective portion of a parameter of usage for each of the number of disks used by the linked clone VM over the time period that is attributable to the linked clone VM. A portion of a cost for usage of each of the number of disks over the time period can be allocated to the linked clone VM in proportion to the respective portion of the parameter of usage attributable to the linked clone VM and/or on a relative latency.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["A data center is a facility that houses servers, data storage devices, and\/or other associated components such as backup power supplies, redundant data communications connections, environmental controls such as air conditioning and\/or fire suppression, and\/or various security systems. A data center may be maintained by an information technology (IT) service provider. An enterprise may purchase data storage and\/or data processing services from the provider in order to run applications that handle the enterprises' core business and operational data. The applications may be proprietary and used exclusively by the enterprise or made available through a network for anyone to access and use.","Virtual machines (VMs) have been introduced to lower data center capital investment in facilities and operational expenses and reduce energy consumption. A VM is a software implementation of a computer that executes application software analogously to a physical computer. VMs have the advantage of not being bound to physical resources, which allows VMs to be moved around and scaled to meet changing demands of an enterprise without affecting the use of the enterprise's applications.","In a software defined data center, storage resources may be allocated to VMs in various ways, such as through network attached storage (NAS), a storage area network (SAN) such as fiber channel and\/or Internet small computer system interface (iSCSI), and\/or raw device mappings, among others. VMs may run a finite set of operating systems along with some applications. Installing operating systems and applications may be time consuming. Accordingly, a virtualization technology called clones may be used to reduce the time in setup and to reuse already setup images.","The term \u201cvirtual machine\u201d (VM) refers generally to an isolated user space instance, which can be executed within a virtualized environment. Other technologies aside from hardware virtualization can provide isolated user space instances, also referred to as data compute nodes. Data compute nodes may include non-virtualized physical hosts, VMs, containers that run on top of a host operating system without a hypervisor or separate operating system, and\/or hypervisor kernel network interface modules, among others. Hypervisor kernel network interface modules are non-VM data compute nodes that include a network stack with a hypervisor kernel network interface and receive\/transmit threads.","VMs, in some embodiments, operate with their own guest operating systems on a host using resources of the host virtualized by virtualization software (e.g., a hypervisor, virtual machine monitor, etc.). The tenant (i.e., the owner of the VM) can choose which applications to operate on top of the guest operating system. Some containers, on the other hand, are constructs that run on top of a host operating system without the need for a hypervisor or separate guest operating system. The host operating system can use name spaces to isolate the containers from each other and therefore can provide operating-system level segregation of the different groups of applications that operate within different containers. This segregation is akin to the VM segregation that may be offered in hypervisor-virtualized environments that virtualize system hardware, and thus can be viewed as a form of virtualization that isolates different groups of applications that operate in different containers. Such containers may be more lightweight than VMs.","While the specification refers generally to VMs, the examples given could be any type of data compute node, including physical hosts, VMs, non-VM containers, and hypervisor kernel network interface modules. Embodiments of the present disclosure can include combinations of different types of data compute nodes.","Examples of cloned VMs include full clones and linked clones. A full clone is an independent copy of a VM that shares nothing from the parent VM. Thus, for example, any changes to the parent VM made after the full clone is created will not be propagated to the full clone. A linked clone is a copy of a VM that shares disks with the parent VM. Thus, any changes made to the shared disks for the parent VM will be propagated to the linked clone VM. In some instances, linked clone VMs may share some, but not all disks. For example, a parent VM may have a shared disk with a linked clone VM and the parent VM may also have its own delta disk that is not shared with the linked clone VM so that changes for the parent VM can be made in the delta disk and not propagated to the linked clone VM while changes that are intended to affect both the parent VM and the linked clone VM can be made in the shared disk. As used herein with respect to VMs, a \u201cdisk\u201d is a representation of memory resources (e.g., memory resources  illustrated in ) that are used by a VM. As used herein, \u201cmemory resource\u201d includes primary storage (e.g., cache memory, registers, and\/or main memory such as random access memory (RAM)) and secondary or other storage (e.g., mass storage such as hard drives, solid state drives, removable media, etc., which may include non-volatile memory). The term \u201cdisk\u201d does not imply a single physical memory device. Rather, \u201cdisk\u201d implies a portion of memory resources that are being used by a VM, regardless of how many physical devices provide the memory resources. Because operating systems and general applications may take up most of the space on the VM disks, which can be duplicated across many VMs, linked clones can help to improve this situation. In addition to saving disk space, linked clones can also help in fast provisioning.","Linked clones can be created using the concept of VM snapshots. A VM snapshot can preserve the state of a VM so that it can be reverted to at a later point in time. The snapshot can include memory as well. In some embodiments, a snapshot includes secondary storage, while primary storage is optionally included with the snapshot. A linked clone VM can be constructed from a snapshot. A snapshot hierarchy and\/or linked clone hierarchy can be represented as a tree of disks. The leaves of the tree can represent currently active delta disks. A delta disk can be a disk that stores changes from a parent disk (e.g., without storing an entire copy of the parent disk). Some embodiments of the present disclosure can accurately allocate storage costs for a VM that is using linked clones and\/or snapshots (a \u201clinked clone VM\u201d) using the linked clone hierarchy.","The tree of disks representing the linked clone hierarchy can become complex as the linked clone levels increase. At a given point in time, there could be multiple VMs sharing the same linked clone in multiple levels. This can complicate the costing of storage consumption per VM in a software defined data center at a given point in time. The complexity of the environment can multiply further when the cost of storage is to be allocated over a time period (e.g., where changes to the hierarchy may be made over the time period). In order to allocate costs to a VM accurately, a determination can be made as to the amount of resources consumed by the VM.","According to a number of embodiments of the present disclosure, costs can be allocated to a linked clone VM based on dynamic parameters. A dynamic parameter is a parameter that changes during runtime, whereas a static parameter is a parameter that does not usually change during runtime. Some examples of static parameters include a size of a disk being used, a number of VMs using the disk, and\/or a clone count for the disk, among others. A parameter being static does not mean that the parameter is fixed or cannot change, as, for example, the number of VMs using a disk can change, and a use of the disk (a size of the disk) can change. Again, the term \u201cdisk\u201d represents the memory resources used by a VM and is more indicative of an amount of memory used rather than an indication of one or more physical memory devices. However, such changes may occur outside of runtime, that is, outside of a time where operations are being performed on the disk by a VM. Some examples of dynamic parameters include a number of operations performed on a disk over time and\/or a latency for operations performed on the disk. For example, a proportionate cost of the usage of a disk can be attributed to a linked clone VM that uses the disk based on operations performed on the disk by the linked clone VM and\/or a proportionate cost of the usage of a disk can be attributed to a linked clone VM that uses the disk based on operations performed on the disk by the linked clone VM in consideration of the operational latency. Some advantages of using dynamic parameters can include higher accuracy than using static parameters because allocation can be based on actual runtime data about the a VM's disk usage. Some hypervisors support storage input\/output (I\/O) control such that performance can be controlled, balanced, and\/or optimized across multiple hosts that host multiple VMs. For example, if two VMs (VM-1 and VM-2) are sharing a disk and the disk is accessed more by VM-1 than VM-2 over a time period, then more of the cost of the disk can be allocated to VM-1 than VM-2.","The present disclosure is not limited to particular devices or methods, which may vary.

Hard-wired program instructions (e.g., logic) can be considered as both program instructions and hardware.","The disk usage engine  can include a combination of hardware and program instructions that is configured to determine, for a linked clone VM, a number of disks used by the linked clone VM among a plurality of disks in a software defined data center over a period of time. The disk usage engine  can be configured to determine a respective portion of a parameter of usage for each of the number of disks used by the linked clone VM over the time period that is attributable to the linked clone VM. In some embodiments, the disk usage engine  can be configured to poll a hypervisor of the linked clone VM to determine the portion of the parameter of usage (e.g., input\/output operations (IOPs) that is attributable to the linked clone VM. The disk usage engine  can be configured to determine, for each of the plurality of disks in the software defined data center, a respective total plurality of IOPs over the time period. For example, the IOPs can be read IOPS.","In some embodiments, the disk usage engine  can be configured to build a linked clone tree for a number of VMs that use the plurality of disks in the software defined data center during the time period. Each node in the tree represents one of the plurality of disks in the software defined data center that is used by at least one of the number of VMs. Specifically, while disks can be physical or virtual, a node represents one virtual disk, which can be a portion of a physical disk, a whole physical disk, multiple physical disks, or combinations thereof. Examples of linked clone trees are illustrated and described in more detail with respect to . The disk usage engine  can be configured, for a leaf in the tree corresponding to the linked clone VM, to determine a path from a root of the tree. The path can include a number of nodes representing the number of virtual disks used by the linked clone VM.","The cost engine  can include a combination of hardware and program instructions that is configured to allocate, to the linked clone VM, a portion of a cost for usage of each of the number of disks over the time period in proportion to the respective portion of the parameter of usage attributable to the linked clone VM.

The unit rate per unit time can be common to two or more of the disks and\/or specific to a particular disk. The size of a particular disk is an indication of how much memory the disk uses. In some embodiments, the cost engine  can be configured to allocate, to the linked clone VM, the portion of the cost regardless of relative latency of the linked clone VM to latency of other linked clone VMs that use the disks. In some embodiments, relative latency can be a factor in the allocation of costs as described in more detail herein.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["324","324","308","310","310","310","324","324","324","308","310","324","310"]},"Memory resources  can be non-transitory and can include volatile and\/or non-volatile memory. Volatile memory can include memory that depends upon power to store information, such as various types of dynamic random access memory (DRAM) among others. Non-volatile memory can include memory that does not depend upon power to store information. Examples of non-volatile memory can include solid state media such as flash memory, electrically erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM), phase change random access memory (PCRAM), magnetic memory, optical memory, and\/or a solid state drive (SSD), etc., as well as other types of machine-readable media.","The processing resources  can be coupled to the memory resources  via a communication path . The communication path  can be local or remote to the machine .

The instructions to determine the relative usage in consideration of the relative latency can include instructions to determine a latency factor for the linked clone VM. A latency factor is described in more detail with respect to . The latency factor can be based on a latency for the linked clone VM, and average latency for the linked clone VM and the other linked clone VMs, and a weight of latency on cost. The latency for the linked clone VM and\/or the average latency for the linked clone VM and the other linked clone VMs can be measured during runtime.

Thus, the linked clone VMs (VM and VM) are linked clones of VM in its state as recorded on disk D. This is illustrated in the linked clone hierarchy by the lines connecting disk D to disks D and D respectively. Thus, any changes to VM made after disk D was locked and delta disk D was created would not be reflected in the linked clones VM and VM because such changes would be stored in delta disk D and the linked clones VM and VM were snapshots of VM according to disk D rather than delta disk D.","An application can be installed in VM in delta disk D. This is a change to VM (e.g., installing a new application). As described above, such a change to VM would not reach the linked clones VM and VM because they were cloned from VM in its state recorded in disk D. After the application is installed, a snapshot can be taken on VM, which locked disk D (where the application was installed) and created a new delta disk D (e.g., where any further changes for VM can be stored).","From the snapshot of VM at disk D, a linked clone (VM) can be created with delta disk D. VM can write some data into delta disk D. Subsequently, a snapshot can be taken on VM, which can lock delta disk D to create delta disk D. Thus, any further changes for VM can be reflected in delta disk D. A linked clone VM (VM) can be created from VM at disk D with delta disk D for VM. A VM can make changes to its disk at any time and may not lock the disk unless a snapshot is going to be taken, for example, to preserve a particular state of the VM and\/or to create a linked clone VM. The snapshot allows the VM to have a new delta disk for further changes and allows the new linked clone VM to have its own delta disk based on the previous state of the VM from which it was cloned. Thus, for example, a snapshot can be taken on VM, which can lock disk D, and create delta disk D.","In the linked clone hierarchy A illustrated in , various states of VM are represented by disks D, D, and D as illustrated by dotted line -.

A node is a parent node if it has a child node. A child node is a node that depends from a parent node as represented by a line coming from a first node with an arrow toward a second node. Child nodes are generally presented below parent nodes. A parent node that has no parent node of its own is a root node (e.g., disk D). A child node with no child node of its own is a leaf node (e.g., disks D, D, D, D, and D). A leaf node in the linked clone tree represents a current state of a particular VM. Thus, for example, leaf node disk D represents a current state of VM, leaf node disk D represents a current state of VM , leaf node disk D represents a current state of VM, leaf node disk D represents a current state of VM, and leaf node disk D represents a current state of VM. The linked clone tree illustrated in  represents the linked clone hierarchy A at a first time (t).","Each VM can also have a diskchain, which is a path from the root node to that VM's leaf node, representing its current state.

For time period t, the total IOPs are 130, as illustrated (and as indicated in the chart  by the sum of 35+10+85). Thus, the total cost of the disk for time period t is 130. An approach that allocated a total cost to each VM using the disk, would allocate the full 130 to each of VMS, VM, and VM.
