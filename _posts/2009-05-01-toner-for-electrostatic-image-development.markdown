In view of the above, as a means for meeting the requirement of speeding up, a toner that is capable of fixing at a low temperature is studied in order to fix the toner on paper with less energy. For example, a toner having excellent low-temperature fixing ability by containing a linear low-softening point polyester as a resin binder (see JP-A-Hei-3-5764 (U.S. Pat. No. 5,079,123), JP-A-Hei-6-282102 (U.S. Pat. No. 5,395,726), and the like); a method for producing a toner including the step of melt-kneading under specified conditions, using a resin binder containing a polyester having a softening point of from 90\u00b0 to 110\u00b0 C. and a low-melting point wax having a melting point of from 60\u00b0 to 90\u00b0 C. (see JP-A-2006-47879, and the like); and the like are proposed.","Further, in order to control an increase in toner scattering, i.e. toner dust, caused by the speeding up of a developer device, a polyester having a high triboelectric chargeability obtained from an aromatic monomer such as terephthalic acid as a raw material monomer for a resin binder is widely used. In addition, with the speeding up, mechanical stress applied to a toner also increases, so that durability is lowered; however, by using the above aromatic monomer, the glass transition temperature of the polyester is increased, and durability is also increased (see JP-A-2003-149865, and the like).","On the other hand, as a new charge control agent having a quick initial rise of triboelectric charges and excellent environmental stability, a specified azo-iron complex is reported in JP-A-2007-334139.","The present invention relates to:\n\n","(a) a resin binder and","(b) a charge control agent,","wherein the resin binder contains a polyester A obtained by polycondensing a carboxylic acid component containing isophthalic acid and\/or an ester thereof, and an alcohol component, and wherein the charge control agent contains an azo-iron complex represented by the formula (I):",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"51.14mm","wi":"75.95mm","file":"US08187779-20120529-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sup":["1 ","4","2","3","5","6","+"],"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002","list-style":"none"},"li":"[2] a method of forming fixed images comprising applying the toner as defined in the above [1] to an image-forming apparatus according to a non-contact fusing method."}},"The present invention relates to a toner for electrostatic image development, having excellent low-temperature fixing ability and triboelectric chargeability and providing even more excellent smearing property and transferability, thereby making it possible to maintain a stable image density without causing toner scattering, even in the formation of fixed images at high speeds, and a method of forming fixed images using the toner.","The toner for electrostatic image development of the present invention exhibits excellent effects that the toner has excellent low-temperature fixing ability and triboelectric chargeability and provides even more excellent smearing property and transferability, thereby making it possible to maintain a stable image density without causing toner scattering, even in the formation of fixed images at high speeds.","These and other advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the following description.","Even when an iron-azo complex described in JP-A-2007-334139 is used, smearing property and transferability are not sufficient, so that the image density is likely to be lowered and the toner scattering is likely to be generated.","A great feature of the toner for electrostatic image development of the present invention containing a resin binder and a charge control agent resides in that the toner contains a specified resin binder and a specified charge control agent.","The resin binder contains a polyester A obtained by polycondensing a carboxylic acid component containing isophthalic acid and\/or an ester thereof (hereinafter also referred to as \u201cisophthalic acid compound\u201d), and an alcohol component. As in a conventional case, if a polyester having a low-softening point that can meet the demand for a non-contact fusing method is synthesized using terephthalic acid, from the viewpoint of triboelectric chargeability, the reactivity with terephthalic acid and the alcohol component is low, so that a low-molecular weight component such as a monomer or an oligomer remains, thereby leading to cause the lowering of elasticity of the resin. If a toner of which resin has a lowered elasticity is used in a high-speed apparatus for forming fixed images, a large stress is applied to the toner, and an external additive is easily embedded in the toner, so that transferability is worsened, and an image density is also lowered. By contrast, in the present invention, since isophthalic acid is used in the carboxylic acid component, its reactivity with the alcohol component is excellent, so that the residual monomers in the polyester can be dramatically reduced. Further, by combining an azo-iron complex mentioned later and the polyester, dispersibility of a charge control agent in the toner increases, so that a phenomenon in which a toner after fixing is removed at an interface of the charge control agent and the resin due to stress is reduced, thereby making smearing property excellent. Specifically, since isophthalic acid is an asymmetric monomer, a polymer chain is bent, thereby lowering crystallinity of the polyester, as compared to a case where a symmetric monomer such as terephthalic acid is used. Although not wanting to be limited by theory, it is presumed that if crystallinity is low, the interaction of the molecular chains themselves is weakened, so that the charge control agent is very highly dispersed by a combined use of a polyester having low crystallinity and a charge control agent having high dispersibility, whereby the phenomenon of removing a toner at an interface of the charge control agent and the resin is prevented.","In the present invention, if only a polyester obtained by using an aromatic carboxylic compound such as isophthalic acid as a carboxylic acid component is used, low-temperature fixing ability is not sufficient because of a rigid molecular backbone of the polyester. Therefore, it is preferable that one or more members selected from the group consisting of fumaric acid, maleic acid, maleic anhydride, and an ester thereof (which may be hereinafter referred to as a \u201cfumaric acid\/maleic acid compound\u201d) is further used as the carboxylic acid component of the polyester. The esters of isophthalic acid, fumaric acid and maleic acid include lower alkyl (1 to 6 carbon atoms) esters thereof, and the like.","The fumaric acid\/maleic acid compound may be used as a carboxylic acid component of a polyester different from the polyester obtained by using a carboxylic acid component containing the isophthalic acid compound (a first embodiment), or the fumaric acid\/maleic acid compound may be used as a carboxylic acid component of the same polyester together with the isophthalic compound (a second embodiment), and the first embodiment is preferable, from the viewpoint of improving durability and smearing property.","The first embodiment of the polyester in the present invention contains a polyester A obtained by polycondensing a carboxylic acid component containing an isophthalic acid compound, and an alcohol component, and a polyester B obtained by polycondensing a carboxylic acid component containing a fumaric acid\/maleic acid compound, and an alcohol component.","The isophthalic acid compound in the polyester A is contained in an amount of preferably 50% by mol or more, more preferably 70% by mol or more, and even more preferably 90% by mol or more, of the carboxylic acid component.","In addition, the fumaric acid\/maleic acid compound in the polyester B is contained in an amount of preferably 50% by mol or more, more preferably 70% by mol or more, and even more preferably 90% by mol or more, of the carboxylic acid component. Here, the isophthalic acid compound is preferably not contained in the carboxylic acid component of the polyester B.

to provide a two-component developer.","The resulting two-component developer was loaded on a copy machine \u201cAR-505\u201d (commercially available from Sharp Corporation), and adjustment was made so that the amount of toner would be 0.6 mg\/cm. Thereafter, images at the stage before fixing were taken out to provide unfixed images. The unfixed images were fixed with an external fixing device, a modified fixing device for an apparatus for forming fixed images according to a non-contact fusing method \u201cVario stream 9000\u201d (commercially available from Oce Printing Systems GmbH) by sequentially raising the temperature on paper from 90\u00b0 to 150\u00b0 C., to provide fixed images. \u201cUNICEF Cellophane\u201d tape (commercially available from MITSUBISHI PENCIL CO., LTD., width: 18 mm, JIS Z-1522) was adhered to the fixed images obtained at each fixing temperature, the tape was pressed with a roller so as to apply a load of 500 g, and the tape was then removed. The image densities before and after the removal of the tape were measured. The temperature on paper at which the ratio of the image density after removal of tape\/before removal of tape initially exceeds 90% is defined as the lowest fixing temperature, and the low-temperature fixing ability was evaluated. The lower the lowest fixing temperature, the more excellent the low-temperature fixing ability. Paper used in the fixing test was a paper \u201cCopy Bond SF-70NA\u201d (75 g\/m) commercially available from Sharp Corporation. The results are shown in Table 3.","A two-component developer obtained in the same manner as in Test Example 1 was loaded on an apparatus for forming fixed images according to a non-contact development method \u201cVario stream 9000\u201d (commercially available from Oce Printing Systems GmbH), and a durability printing test was conducted at a print coverage of 9%, a linear speed of 1,000 mm\/sec for 2 hours. Thereafter, a durability printing test was conducted at a print coverage of 0.15% for 3 hours, the printer was imperatively halted, and the amount of the toner on a photoconductor (To) and the amount of the toner on paper (Tp) were weighed. Defining a value calculated by the formula of Tp\/To\u00d7100 as the transfer efficiency, the transferability was evaluated. The higher the transfer efficiency, the more excellent the transferability. The results are shown in Table 3.","Also, image samples obtained immediately before the hard stop were collected, and the image densities were measured with a calorimeter \u201cGretagMacbeth Spectroeye\u201d (commercially available from GretagMacbeth CO.) at 5 points of the printed portion of the fixed images, and an average was calculated as an image density (ID) to evaluate image densities.","A two-component developer obtained in the same manner as in Test Example 1 was loaded on an apparatus for forming fixed images according to a non-contact development method \u201cVario stream 9000\u201d (commercially available from Oce Printing Systems GmbH), and printing was conducted at a print coverage of 9%, and a linear speed of 1,000 mm\/sec to provide printouts. A 500 g stainless weight having a length of 3 cm, a width of 3 cm, and a height of 6.5 cm was placed on the printouts obtained, and the weight was reciprocated over the printed characters at a speed of 0.5 m\/s.
