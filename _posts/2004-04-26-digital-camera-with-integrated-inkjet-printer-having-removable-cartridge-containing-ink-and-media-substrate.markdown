{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCES TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED AND OTHER EMBODIMENTS","CROSS-REFERENCED APPLICATIONS"],"p":["The present application is a Continuation-in-Part of U.S. application Ser. No. 09\/112,743 filed on Jul. 10, 1998, now issued U.S. Pat. No. 6,727,951.","The present invention relates to digital cameras and in particular, the onboard processing of image data captured by the camera.","Recently, digital cameras have become increasingly popular. These cameras normally operate by means of imaging a desired image utilising a charge coupled device (CCD) array and storing the imaged scene on an electronic storage medium for later down loading onto a computer system for subsequent manipulation and printing out. Normally, when utilising a computer system to print out an image, sophisticated software may available to manipulate the image in accordance with requirements.","Unfortunately such systems require significant post processing of a captured image and normally present the image in an orientation to which it was taken, relying on the post processing process to perform any necessary or required modifications of the captured image. Also, much of the environmental information available when the picture was taken is lost. Furthermore, the type or size of the media substrate and the types of ink used to print the image can also affect the image quality. Accounting for these factors during post processing of the captured image data can be complex and time consuming.","Accordingly, the present invention provides a digital camera for use with a media cartridge comprising a supply of media substrate on which images can be printed, and an information store with information relating to the media substrate, the camera comprising:","an image sensor for capturing an image;","an image processor for processing image data from the image sensor and transmitting processed data to a printhead; and,","a cartridge interface for accessing the information such that the image processor can utilise the information relating to the media substrate.","The camera accesses information about the media substrate so that the image processor can utilise the information to enhance the quality of the printed image.","Preferably, the media substrate has postcard formatting printed on its reverse surface so that the camera can produce personalised postcards, and the information store has the dimensions of the postcard formatting to allow the image processor to align printed images with the postcard formatting.","In a further preferred form the cartridge further comprises an ink supply for the printhead and the information store is an authentication chip that allows the image processor to confirm that the media substrate and the ink supply is suitable for use with the camera.","According to a related aspect, there is provided a digital camera for sensing and storing an image, the camera comprising:","an image sensor with a charge coupled device (CCD) for capturing image data relating to a sensed image, and an auto exposure setting for adjusting the image data captured by the CCD in response to the lighting conditions at image capture; and,","an image processor for processing image data from the CCD and storing the processed data; wherein,","the image processor is adapted to use information from the auto exposure setting relating to the lighting conditions at image capture when processing the image data from the CCD.","Utilising the auto exposure setting to determine an advantageous re-mapping of colours within the image allows the processor to produce an amended image having colours within an image transformed to account of the auto exposure setting. The processing can comprise re-mapping image colours so they appear deeper and richer when the exposure setting indicates low light conditions and re-mapping image colours to be brighter and more saturated when the auto exposure setting indicates bright light conditions.","The digital image processing camera system constructed in accordance with the preferred embodiment is as illustrated in . The camera unit  includes means for the insertion of an integral print roll (not shown). The camera unit  can include an area image sensor  which sensors an image  for captured by the camera. Optionally, the second area image sensor can be provided to also image the scene  and to optionally provide for the production of stereographic output effects.","The camera  can include an optional color display  for the display of the image being sensed by the sensor . When a simple image is being displayed on the display , the button  can be depressed resulting in the printed image  being output by the camera unit . A series of cards, herein after known as \u201cArtcards\u201d  contain, on one surface encoded information and on the other surface, contain an image distorted by the particular effect produced by the Artcard . The Artcard  is inserted in an Artcard reader  in the side of camera  and, upon insertion, results in output image  being distorted in the same manner as the distortion appearing on the surface of Artcard . Hence, by means of this simple user interface a user wishing to produce a particular effect can insert one of many Artcards  into the Artcard reader  and utilize button  to take a picture of the image  resulting in a corresponding distorted output image .","The camera unit  can also include a number of other control button ,  in addition to a simple LCD output display  for the display of informative information including the number of printouts left on the internal print roll on the camera unit. Additionally, different output formats can be controlled by CHP switch .","Turning now to , there is illustrated a schematic view of the internal hardware of the camera unit . The internal hardware is based around an Artcam central processor unit (ACP) .","Artcam Central Processor ","The Artcam central processor  provides many functions which form the \u2018heart\u2019 of the system. The ACP  is preferably implemented as a complex, high speed, CMOS system on-a-chip. Utilising standard cell design with some full custom regions is recommended. Fabrication on a 0.25 \u03bcl CMOS process will provide the density and speed required, along with a reasonably small die area.","The functions provided by the ACP  include:","1. Control and digitization of the area image sensor . A 3D stereoscopic version of the ACP requires two area image sensor interfaces with a second optional image sensor  being provided for stereoscopic effects.","2. Area image sensor compensation, reformatting, and image enhancement.","3. Memory interface and management to a memory store .","4. Interface, control, and analog to digital conversion of an Artcard reader linear image sensor  which is provided for the reading of data from the Artcards .","5. Extraction of the raw Artcard data from the digitized and encoded Artcard image.","6. Reed-Solomon error detection and correction of the Artcard encoded data. The encoded surface of the Artcard  includes information on how to process an image to produce the effects displayed on the image distorted surface of the Artcard . This information is in the form of a script, hereinafter known as a \u201cVark script\u201d. The Vark script is utilised by an interpreter running within the ACP  to produce the desired effect.","7. Interpretation of the Vark script on the Artcard .","8. Performing image processing operations as specified by the Vark script.","9. Controlling various motors for the paper transport , zoom lens , autofocus  and Artcard driver .","10. Controlling a guillotine actuator  for the operation of a guillotine  for the cutting of photographs  from print roll .","11. Half-toning of the image data for printing.","12. Providing the print data to a print-head  at the appropriate times.","13. Controlling the print head .","14. Controlling the ink pressure feed to print-head .","15. Controlling optional flash unit .","16. Reading and acting on various sensors in the camera, including camera orientation sensor , autofocus  and Artcard insertion sensor .","17. Reading and acting on the user interface buttons , , .","18. Controlling the status display .","19. Providing viewfinder and preview images to the color display .","20. Control of the system power consumption, including the ACP power consumption via power management circuit .","21. Providing external communications  to general purpose computers (using part USB).","22. Reading and storing information in a printing roll authentication chip .","23. Reading and storing information in a camera authentication chip .","24. Communicating with an optional mini-keyboard  for text modification.","Quartz Crystal ","A quartz crystal  is used as a frequency reference for the system clock. As the system clock is very high, the ACP  includes a phase locked loop clock circuit to increase the frequency derived from the crystal .","Image Sensing","Area Image Sensor ","The area image sensor  converts an image through its lens into an electrical signal. It can either be a charge coupled device (CCD) or an active pixel sensor (APS) CMOS image sector. At present, available CCD's normally have a higher image quality, however, there is currently much development occurring in CMOS imagers. CMOS imagers are eventually expected to be substantially cheaper than CCD's have smaller pixel areas, and be able to incorporate drive circuitry and signal processing. They can also be made in CMOS fabs, which are transitioning to 12\u2033 wafers. CCD's are usually built in 6\u2033 wafer fabs, and economics may not allow a conversion to 12\u2033 fabs. Therefore, the difference in fabrication cost between CCD's and CMOS imagers is likely to increase, progressively favoring CMOS imagers. However, at present, a CCD is probably the best option.","The Artcam unit will produce suitable results with a 1,500\u00d71,000 area image sensor. However, smaller sensors, such as 750\u00d7500, will be adequate for many markets. The Artcam is less sensitive to image sensor resolution than are conventional digital cameras. This is because many of the styles contained on Artcards  process the image in such a way as to obscure the lack of resolution. For example, if the image is distorted to simulate the effect of being converted to an impressionistic painting, low source image resolution can be used with minimal effect. Further examples for which low resolution input images will typically not be noticed include image warps which produce high distorted images, multiple miniature copies of the of the image (eg. passport photos), textural processing such as bump mapping for a base relief metal look, and photo-compositing into structured scenes.","This tolerance of low resolution image sensors may be a significant factor in reducing the manufacturing cost of an Artcam unit  camera. An Artcam with a low cost 750\u00d7500 image sensor will often produce superior results to a conventional digital camera with a much more expensive 1,500\u00d71,000 image sensor.","Optional Stereoscopic 3D Image Sensor ","The 3D versions of the Artcam unit  have an additional image sensor , for stereoscopic operation. This image sensor is identical to the main image sensor. The circuitry to drive the optional image sensor may be included as a standard part of the ACP chip  to reduce incremental design cost. Alternatively, a separate 3D Artcam ACP can be designed. This option will reduce the manufacturing cost of a mainstream single sensor Artcam.","Print Roll Authentication Chip ","A small chip  is included in each print roll . This chip replaced the functions of the bar code, optical sensor and wheel, and ISO\/ASA sensor on other forms of camera film units such as Advanced Photo Systems film cartridges.","The authentication chip also provides other features:","1. The storage of data rather than that which is mechanically and optically sensed from APS rolls","2. A remaining media length indication, accurate to high resolution.","3. Authentication Information to prevent inferior clone print roll copies.","The authentication chip  contains 1024 bits of Flash memory, of which 128 bits is an authentication key, and 512 bits is the authentication information. Also included is an encryption circuit to ensure that the authentication key cannot be accessed directly.","Print-Head ","The Artcam unit  can utilize any color print technology which is small enough, low enough power, fast enough, high enough quality, and low enough cost, and is compatible with the print roll. Relevant printheads will be specifically discussed hereinafter.","The specifications of the ink jet head are:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0070","num":"0069"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"84pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"105pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Image type","Bi-level, dithered"]},{"entry":[{},"Color","CMY Process Color"]},{"entry":[{},"Resolution","1600 dpi"]},{"entry":[{},"Print head length","\u2018Page-width\u2019 (100 mm)"]},{"entry":[{},"Print speed","2 seconds per photo"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}},"br":{}},"The function of the ink pressure controller depends upon the type of ink jet print head  incorporated in the Artcam. For some types of ink jet, the use of an ink pressure controller can be eliminated, as the ink pressure is simply atmospheric pressure. Other types of print head require a regulated positive ink pressure. In this case, the in pressure controller consists of a pump and pressure transducer.","Other print heads may require an ultrasonic transducer to cause regular oscillations in the ink pressure, typically at frequencies around 100 KHz. In the case, the ACP  controls the frequency phase and amplitude of these oscillations.","Paper Transport Motor ","The paper transport motor  moves the paper from within the print roll  past the print head at a relatively constant rate. The motor  is a miniature motor geared down to an appropriate speed to drive rollers which move the paper. A high quality motor and mechanical gears are required to achieve high image quality, as mechanical rumble or other vibrations will affect the printed dot row spacing.","Paper Transport Motor Driver ","The motor driver  is a small circuit which amplifies the digital motor control signals from the APC  to levels suitable for driving the motor .","Paper Pull Sensor","A paper pull sensor  detects a user's attempt to pull a photo from the camera unit during the printing process. The APC  reads this sensor , and activates the guillotine  if the condition occurs. The paper pull sensor  is incorporated to make the camera more \u2018foolproof\u2019 in operation. Were the user to pull the paper out forcefully during printing, the print mechanism  or print roll  may (in extreme cases) be damaged. Since it is acceptable to pull out the \u2018pod\u2019 from a Polaroid type camera before it is fully ejected, the public has been \u2018trained\u2019 to do this. Therefore, they are unlikely to heed printed instructions not to pull the paper.","The Artcam preferably restarts the photo print process after the guillotine  has cut the paper after pull sensing.","The pull sensor can be implemented as a strain gauge sensor, or as an optical sensor detecting a small plastic flag which is deflected by the torque that occurs on the paper drive rollers when the paper is pulled. The latter implementation is recommendation for low cost.","Paper Guillotine Actuator ","The paper guillotine actuator  is a small actuator which causes the guillotine  to cut the paper either at the end of a photograph, or when the paper pull sensor  is activated.","The guillotine actuator  is a small circuit which amplifies a guillotine control signal from the APC tot the level required by the actuator .","Artcard ","The Artcard  is a program storage medium for the Artcam unit. As noted previously, the programs are in the form of Vark scripts. Vark is a powerful image processing language especially developed for the Artcam unit. Each Artcard  contains one Vark script, and thereby defines one image processing style.","Preferably, the VARK language is highly image processing specific. By being highly image processing specific, the amount of storage required to store the details on the card are substantially reduced. Further, the ease with which new programs can be created, including enhanced effects, is also substantially increased. Preferably, the language includes facilities for handling many image processing functions including image warping via a warp map, convolution, color lookup tables, posterizing an image, adding noise to an image, image enhancement filters, painting algorithms, brush jittering and manipulation edge detection filters, tiling, illumination via light sources, bump maps, text, face detection and object detection attributes, fonts, including three dimensional fonts, and arbitrary complexity pre-rendered icons. Further details of the operation of the Vark language interpreter are contained hereinafter.","Hence, by utilizing the language constructs as defined by the created language, new affects on arbitrary images can be created and constructed for inexpensive storage on Artcard and subsequent distribution to camera owners. Further, on one surface of the card can be provided an example illustrating the effect that a particular VARK script, stored on the other surface of the card, will have on an arbitrary captured image.","By utilizing such a system, camera technology can be distributed without a great fear of obsolescence in that, provided a VARK interpreter is incorporated in the camera device, a device independent scenario is provided whereby the underlying technology can be completely varied over time. Further, the VARK scripts can be updated as new filters are created and distributed in an inexpensive manner, such as via simple cards for card reading.","The Artcard  is a piece of thin white plastic with the same format as a credit card (86 mm long by 54 mm wide). The Artcard is printed on both sides using a high resolution ink jet printer. The inkjet printer technology is assumed to be the same as that used in the Artcam, with 1600 dpi (63 dpmm) resolution. A major feature of the Artcard  is low manufacturing cost. Artcards can be manufactured at high speeds as a wide web of plastic film. The plastic web is coated on both sides with a hydrophilic dye fixing layer. The web is printed simultaneously on both sides using a \u2018pagewidth\u2019 color ink jet printer. The web is then cut and punched into individual cards. On one face of the card is printed a human readable representation of the effect the Artcard  will have on the sensed image. This can be simply a standard image which has been processed using the Vark script stored on the back face of the card.","On the back face of the card is printed an array of dots which can be decoded into the Vark script that defines the image processing sequence. The print area is 80 mm\u00d750 mm, giving a total of 15,876,000 dots. This array of dots could represent at least 1.89 Mbytes of data. To achieve high reliability, extensive error detection and correction is incorporated in the array of dots. This allows a substantial portion of the card to be defaced, worn, creased, or dirty with no effect on data integrity. The data coding used is Reed-Solomon coding, with half of the data devoted to error correction. This allows the storage of 967 Kbytes of error corrected data on each Artcard .","Linear Image Sensor ","The Artcard linear sensor  converts the aforementioned Artcard data image to electrical signals. As with the area image sensor , , the linear image sensor can be fabricated using either CCD or APS CMOS technology. The active length of the image sensor  is 50 mm, equal to the width of the data array on the Artcard . To satisfy Nyquist's sampling theorem, the resolution of the linear image sensor  must be at least twice the highest spatial frequency of the Artcard optical image reaching the image sensor. In practice, data detection is easier if the image sensor resolution is substantially above this. A resolution of 4800 dpi (189 dpmm) is chosen, giving a total of 9,450 pixels. This resolution requires a pixel sensor pitch of 5.3 \u03bcm. This can readily be achieved by using four staggered rows of 20 \u03bcm pixel sensors.","The linear image sensor is mounted in a special package which includes a LED  to illuminate the Artcard  via a light-pipe (not shown).","The Artcard reader light-pipe can be a molded light-pipe which has several function:","1. It diffuses the light from the LED over the width of the card using total internal reflection facets.","2. It focuses the light onto a 16 \u03bcm wide strip of the Artcard  using an integrated cylindrical lens.","3. It focuses light reflected from the Artcard onto the linear image sensor pixels using a molded array of microlenses.","The operation of the Artcard reader is explained further hereinafter.","Artcard Reader Motor ","The Artcard reader motor propels the Artcard past the linear image sensor  at a relatively constant rate. As it may not be cost effective to include extreme precision mechanical components in the Artcard reader, the motor  is a standard miniature motor geared down to an appropriate speed to drive a pair of rollers which move the Artcard . The speed variations, rumble, and other vibrations will affect the raw image data as circuitry within the APC  includes extensive compensation for these effects to reliably read the Artcard data.","The motor  is driven in reverse when the Artcard is to be ejected.","Artcard Motor Driver ","The Artcard motor driver  is a small circuit which amplifies the digital motor control signals from the APC  to levels suitable for driving the motor .","Card Insertion Sensor ","The card insertion sensor  is an optical sensor which detects the presence of a card as it is being inserted in the card reader . Upon a signal from this sensor , the APC  initiates the card reading process, including the activation of the Artcard reader motor .","Card Eject Button ","A card eject button  () is used by the user to eject the current Artcard, so that another Artcard can be inserted. The APC  detects the pressing of the button, and reverses the Artcard reader motor  to eject the card.","Card Status Indicator ","A card status indicator  is provided to signal the user as to the status of the Artcard reading process. This can be a standard bi-color (red\/green) LED. When the card is successfully read, and data integrity has been verified, the LED lights up green continually. If the card is faulty, then the LED lights up red.","If the camera is powered from a 1.5 V instead of 3V battery, then the power supply voltage is less than the forward voltage drop of the greed LED, and the LED will not light. In this case, red LEDs can be used, or the LED can be powered from a voltage pump which also powers other circuits in the Artcam which require higher voltage.","64 Mbit DRAM ","To perform the wide variety of image processing effects, the camera utilizes 8 Mbytes of memory . This can be provided by a single 64 Mbit memory chip. Of course, with changing memory technology increased Dram storage sizes may be substituted.","High speed access to the memory chip is required. This can be achieved by using a Rambus DRAM (burst access rate of 500 Mbytes per second) or chips using the new open standards such as double data rate (DDR) SDRAM or Synclink DRAM.","Camera Authentication Chip","The camera authentication chip  is identical to the print roll authentication chip , except that it has different information stored in it. The camera authentication chip  has three main purposes:","1. To provide a secure means of comparing authentication codes with the print roll authentication chip;","2. To provide storage for manufacturing information, such as the serial number of the camera;","3. To provide a small amount of non-volatile memory for storage of user information.","Displays","The Artcam includes an optional color display  and small status display . Lowest cost consumer cameras may include a color image display, such as a small TFT LCD  similar to those found on some digital cameras and camcorders. The color display  is a major cost element of these versions of Artcam, and the display  plus back light are a major power consumption drain.","Status Display ","The status display  is a small passive segment based LCD, similar to those currently provided on silver halide and digital cameras. Its main function is to show the number of prints remaining in the print roll  and icons for various standard camera features, such as flash and battery status.","Color Display ","The color display  is a full motion image display which operates as a viewfinder, as a verification of the image to be printed, and as a user interface display. The cost of the display  is approximately proportional to its area, so large displays (say 4\u2033 diagonal) unit will be restricted to expensive versions of the Artcam unit. Smaller displays, such as color camcorder viewfinder TFT's at around 1\u2033, may be effective for mid-range Artcams.","Zoom Lens (not Shown)","The Artcam can include a zoom lens. This can be a standard electronically controlled zoom lens, identical to one which would be used on a standard electronic camera, and similar to pocket camera zoom lenses. A referred version of the Artcam unit may include standard interchangeable 35 mm SLR lenses.","Autofocus Motor ","The autofocus motor  changes the focus of the zoom lens. The motor is a miniature motor geared down to an appropriate speed to drive the autofocus mechanism.","Autofocus Motor Driver ","The autofocus motor driver  is a small circuit which amplifies the digital motor control signals from the APC  to levels suitable for driving the motor .","Zoom Motor ","The zoom motor  moves the zoom front lenses in and out. The motor is a miniature motor geared down to an appropriate speed to drive the zoom mechanism.","Zoom Motor Driver ","The zoom motor driver  is a small circuit which amplifies the digital motor control signals from the APC  to levels suitable for driving the motor.","Communications","The ACP  contains a universal serial bus (USB) interface  for communication with personal computers. Not all Artcam models are intended to include the USB connector. However, the silicon area required for a USB circuit  is small, so the interface can be included in the standard ACP.","Optional Keyboard ","The Artcam unit may include an optional miniature keyboard  for customizing text specified by the Artcard. Any text appearing in an Artcard image may be editable, even if it is in a complex metallic 3D font. The miniature keyboard includes a single line alphanumeric LCD to display the original text and edited text. The keyboard may be a standard accessory.","The ACP  contains a serial communications circuit for transferring data to and from the miniature keyboard.","Power Supply","The Artcam unit uses a battery . Depending upon the Artcam options, this is either a 3V Lithium cell, 1.5 V AA alkaline cells, or other battery arrangement.","Power Management Unit ","Power consumption is an important design constraint in the Artcam. It is desirable that either standard camera batteries (such as 3V lithium batters) or standard AA or AAA alkaline cells can be used. While the electronic complexity of the Artcam unit is dramatically higher than 35 mm photographic cameras, the power consumption need not be commensurately higher. Power in the Artcam can be carefully managed with all unit being turned off when not in use.","The most significant current drains are the ACP , the area image sensors ,, the printer  various motors, the flash unit , and the optional color display  dealing with each part separately:","1. ACP: If fabricated using 0.25 \u03bcm CMOS, and running on 1.5V, the ACP power consumption can be quite low. Clocks to various parts of the ACP chip can be quite low. Clocks to various parts of the ACP chip can be turned off when not in use, virtually eliminating standby current consumption. The ACP will only fully used for approximately 4 seconds for each photograph printed.","2. Area image sensor: power is only supplied to the area image sensor when the user has their finger on the button.","3. The printer power is only supplied to the printer when actually printing. This is for around 2 seconds for each photograph. Even so, suitably lower power consumption printing should be used.","4. The motors required in the Artcam are all low power miniature motors, and are typically only activated for a few seconds per photo.","5. The flash unit  is only used for some photographs. Its power consumption can readily be provided by a 3V lithium battery for a reasonably battery life.","6. The optional color display  is a major current drain for two reasons: it must be on for the whole time that the camera is in use, and a backlight will be required if a liquid crystal display is used. Cameras which incorporate a color display will require a larger battery to achieve acceptable batter life.","Flash Unit ","The flash unit  can be a standard miniature electronic flash for consumer cameras.","Overview of the ACP ",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0127","num":"0126"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["31","31","31"],"sup":"2","ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004","list-style":"none"},"li":["A RISC CPU core ","A 4 way parallel VLIW Vector Processor ","A Direct RAMbus interface ","A CMOS image sensor interface ","A CMOS linear image sensor interface ","A USB serial interface ","An infrared keyboard interface ","A numeric LCD interface , and","A color TFT LCD interface ","A 4 Mbyte Flash memory  for program storage \n\nThe RISC CPU, Direct RAMbus interface , CMOS sensor interface  and USB serial interface  can be vendor supplied cores. The ACP  is intended to run at a clock speed of 200 MHz on 3V externally and 1.5V internally to minimize power consumption. The CPU core needs only to run at 100 MHz. The following two block diagrams give two views of the ACP :\n","A view of the ACP  in isolation\n\nAn example Artcam showing a high-level view of the ACP  connected to the rest of the Artcam hardware.\n\nImage Access\n"]}}}},"As stated previously, the DRAM Interface  is responsible for interfacing between other client portions of the ACP chip and the RAMBUS DRAM. In effect, each module within the DRAM Interface is an address generator.","There are three logical types of images manipulated by the ACP. They are:\n\n","Print Image\u2014the Output Image format printed by the Artcam","These images are typically different in color space, resolution, and the output & input color spaces which can vary from camera to camera. For example, a CCD image on a low-end camera may be a different resolution, or have different color characteristics from that used in a high-end camera. However all internal image formats are the same format in terms of color space across all cameras.","In addition, the three image types can vary with respect to which direction is \u2018up\u2019. The physical orientation of the camera causes the notion of a portrait or landscape image, and this must be maintained throughout processing. For this reason, the internal image is always oriented correctly, and rotation is performed on images obtained from the CCD and during the print operation.","CPU Core (CPU) ","The ACP  incorporates a 32 bit RISC CPU  to run the Vark image processing language interpreter and to perform Artcam's general operating system duties. A wide variety of CPU cores are suitable: it can be any processor core with sufficient processing power to perform the required core calculations and control functions fast enough to met consumer expectations. Examples of suitable cores are: MIPS R4000 core from LSI Logic, StrongARM core. There is no need to maintain instruction set continuity between different Artcam models. Artcard compatibility is maintained irrespective of future processor advances and changes, because the Vark interpreter is simply re-compiled for each new instruction set. The ACP  architecture is therefore also free to evolve. Different ACP  chip designs may be fabricated by different manufacturers, without requiring to license or port the CPU core. This device independence avoids the chip vendor lock-in such as has occurred in the PC market with Intel. The CPU operates at 100 MHz, with a single cycle time of 10 ns. It must be fast enough to run the Vark interpreter, although the VLIW Vector Processor  is responsible for most of the time-critical operations.","Program Cache ","Although the program code is stored in on-chip Flash memory , it is unlikely that well packed Flash memory  will be able to operate at the 10 ns cycle time required by the CPU. Consequently a small cache is required for good performance. 16 cache lines of 32 bytes each are sufficient, for a total of 512 bytes. The program cache  is defined in the chapter entitled Program cache .","Data Cache ","A small data cache  is required for good performance. This requirement is mostly due to the use of a RAMbus DRAM, which can provide high-speed data in bursts, but is inefficient for single byte accesses. The CPU has access to a memory caching system that allows flexible manipulation of CPU data cache  sizes. A minimum of 16 cache lines (512 bytes) is recommended for good performance.","CPU Memory Model","An Artcam's CPU memory model consists of a 32 MB area.

It is envisaged that Flash memory  will have denser packing coefficients than masked ROM, and allows for greater flexibility for testing camera program code. The downside of the Flash memory  is the access time, which is unlikely to be fast enough for the 100 MHz operating speed (10 ns cycle time) of the CPU. A fast Program Instruction cache  therefore acts as the interface between the CPU and the slower Flash memory .","Program Cache ","A small cache is required for good CPU performance. This requirement is due to the slow speed Flash memory  which stores the Program code. 16 cache lines of 32 bytes each are sufficient, for a total of 512 bytes. The Program cache  is a read only cache. The data used by CPU programs comes through the CPU Memory Decoder  and if the address is in DRAM, through the general Data cache . The separation allows the CPU to operate independently of the VLIW Vector Processor . If the data requirements are low for a given process, it can consequently operate completely out of cache.\n\nFinally, the Program cache  can be read as data by the CPU rather than purely as program instructions. This allows tables, microcode for the VLIW etc to be loaded from the Flash memory . Addresses with bit  set and bit  clear are satisfied from the Program cache .\n\nCPU Memory Decoder \n\nThe CPU Memory Decoder  is a simple decoder for satisfying CPU data accesses. The Decoder translates data addresses into internal ACP register accesses over the internal low speed bus, and therefore allows for memory mapped I\/O of ACP registers. The CPU Memory Decoder  only interprets addresses that have bit  set and bit  clear. There is no caching in the CPU Memory Decoder .\n\nDRAM Interface \n\nThe DRAM used by the Artcam is a single channel 64 Mbit (8 MB) RAMbus RDRAM operating at 1.6 GB\/sec. RDRAM accesses are by a single channel (16-bit data path) controller. The RDRAM also has several useful operating modes for low power operation. Although the Rambus specification describes a system with random 32 byte transfers as capable of achieving a greater than 95% efficiency, this is not true if only part of the 32 bytes are used. Two reads followed by two writes to the same device yields over 86% efficiency. The primary latency is required for bus turn-around going from a Write to a Read, and since there is a Delayed Write mechanism, efficiency can be further improved. With regards to writes, Write Masks allow specific subsets of bytes to be written to. These write masks would be set via internal cache \u201cdirty bits\u201d. The upshot of the Rambus Direct RDRAM is a throughput of >1 GB\/sec is easily achievable, and with multiple reads for every write (most processes) combined with intelligent algorithms making good use of 32 byte transfer knowledge, transfer rates of >1.3 GB\/sec are expected. Every 10 ns, 16 bytes can be transferred to or from the core.\n\nDRAM Organization\n\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0140","num":"0156"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00003","num":"00003"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"147pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"Contents","Size"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"147pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"21pt","align":"right"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Program scratch RAM","0.50","MB"]},{"entry":[{},"Artcard data","1.00","MB"]},{"entry":[{},"Photo Image, captured from CMOS Sensor","0.50","MB"]},{"entry":[{},"Print Image (compressed)","2.25","MB"]},{"entry":[{},"1 Channel of expanded Photo Image","1.50","MB"]},{"entry":[{},"1 Image Pyramid of single channel","1.00","MB"]},{"entry":[{},"Intermediate Image Processing","1.25","MB"]},{"entry":[{},"TOTAL","8","MB"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}},"br":{},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0011","list-style":"none"},"li":["Uncompressed, the Print Image requires 4.5 MB (1.5 MB per channel). To accommodate other objects in the 8 MB model, the Print Image needs to be compressed. If the chrominance channels are compressed by 4:1 they require only 0.375 MB each).","The memory model described here assumes a single 8 MB RDRAM. Other models of the Artcam may have more memory, and thus not require compression of the Print Image. In addition, with more memory a larger part of the final image can be worked on at once, potentially giving a speed improvement.","Note that ejecting or inserting an Artcard invalidates the 5.5 MB area holding the Print Image, 1 channel of expanded photo image, and the image pyramid. This space may be safely used by the Artcard Interface for decoding the Artcard data.\n\nData Cache \n\nThe ACP  contains a dedicated CPU instruction cache  and a general data cache . The Data cache  handles all DRAM requests (reads and writes of data) from the CPU, the VLIW Vector Processor , and the Display Controller . These requests may have very different profiles in terms of memory usage and algorithmic timing requirements. For example, a VLIW process may be processing an image in linear memory, and lookup a value in a table for each value in the image. There is little need to cache much of the image, but it may be desirable to cache the entire lookup table so that no real memory access is required. Because of these differing requirements, the Data cache  allows for an intelligent definition of caching.\n\nAlthough the Rambus DRAM interface  is capable of very high-speed memory access (an average throughput of 32 bytes in 25 ns), it is not efficient dealing with single byte requests. In order to reduce effective memory latency, the ACP  contains 128 cache lines. Each cache line is 32 bytes wide. Thus the total amount of data cache  is 4096 bytes (4 KB). The 128 cache lines are configured into 16 programmable-sized groups. Each of the 16 groups must be a contiguous set of cache lines. The CPU is responsible for determining how many cache lines to allocate to each group. Within each group cache lines are filled according to a simple Least Recently Used algorithm. In terms of CPU data requests, the Data cache  handles memory access requests that have address bit  clear. If bit  is clear, the address is in the lower 16 MB range, and hence can be satisfied from DRAM and the Data cache . In most cases the DRAM will only be 8 MB, but 16 MB is allocated to cater for a higher memory model Artcam. If bit  is set, the address is ignored by the Data cache .\n\nAll CPU data requests are satisfied from Cache Group 0. A minimum of 16 cache lines is recommended for good CPU performance, although the CPU can assign any number of cache lines (except none) to Cache Group 0. The remaining Cache Groups (1 to 15) are allocated according to the current requirements. This could mean allocation to a VLIW Vector Processor  program or the Display Controller . For example, a 256 byte lookup table required to be permanently available would require 8 cache lines. Writing out a sequential image would only require 2-4 cache lines (depending on the size of record being generated and whether write requests are being Write Delayed for a significant number of cycles). Associated with each cache line byte is a dirty bit, used for creating a Write Mask when writing memory to DRAM. Associated with each cache line is another dirty bit, which indicates whether any of the cache line bytes has been written to (and therefore the cache line must be written back to DRAM before it can be reused). Note that it is possible for two different Cache Groups to be accessing the same address in memory and to get out of sync. The VLIW program writer is responsible to ensure that this is not an issue. It could be perfectly reasonable, for example, to have a Cache Group responsible for reading an image, and another Cache Group responsible for writing the changed image back to memory again. If the images are read or written sequentially there may be advantages in allocating cache lines in this manner. A total of 8 buses  connect the VLIW Vector Processor  to the Data cache . Each bus is connected to an I\/O Address Generator. (There are 2 I\/O Address Generators ,  per Processing Unit , and there are 4 Processing Units in the VLIW Vector Processor . The total number of buses is therefore 8.) In any given cycle, in addition to a single 32 bit (4 byte) access to the CPU's cache group (Group 0), 4 simultaneous accesses of 16 bits (2 bytes) to remaining cache groups are permitted on the 8 VLIW Vector Processor  buses. The Data cache  is responsible for fairly processing the requests. On a given cycle, no more than 1 request to a specific Cache Group will be processed. Given that there are 8 Address Generators ,  in the VLIW Vector Processor , each one of these has the potential to refer to an individual Cache Group. However it is possible and occasionally reasonable for 2 or more Address Generators ,  to access the same Cache Group. The CPU is responsible for ensuring that the Cache Groups have been allocated the correct number of cache lines, and that the various Address Generators ,  in the VLIW Vector Processor  reference the specific Cache Groups correctly.\n\nThe Data cache  as described allows for the Display Controller  and VLIW Vector Processor  to be active simultaneously. If the operation of these two components were deemed to never occur simultaneously, a total 9 Cache Groups would suffice. The CPU would use Cache Group 0, and the VLIW Vector Processor  and the Display Controller  would share the remaining 8 Cache Groups, requiring only 3 bits (rather than 4) to define which Cache Group would satisfy a particular request.\n\nJTAG Interface \n\nA standard JTAG (Joint Test Action Group) Interface is included in the ACP  for testing purposes. Due to the complexity of the chip, a variety of testing techniques are required, including BIST (Built In Self Test) and functional block isolation. An overhead of 10% in chip area is assumed for overall chip testing circuitry. The test circuitry is beyond the scope of this document.\n\nSerial Interfaces\n\nUSB Serial Port Interface \n\nThis is a standard USB serial port, which is connected to the internal chip low speed bus, thereby allowing the CPU to control it.\n\nKeyboard Interface \n\nThis is a standard low-speed serial port, which is connected to the internal chip low speed bus, thereby allowing the CPU to control it. It is designed to be optionally connected to a keyboard to allow simple data input to customize prints.\n\nAuthentication Chip Serial Interfaces \n\nThese are 2 standard low-speed serial ports, which are connected to the internal chip low speed bus, thereby allowing the CPU to control them. The reason for having 2 ports is to connect to both the on-camera Authentication chip, and to the print-roll Authentication chip using separate lines. Only using 1 line may make it possible for a clone print-roll manufacturer to design a chip which, instead of generating an authentication code, tricks the camera into using the code generated by the authentication chip in the camera.\n\nParallel Interface \n\nThe parallel interface connects the ACP  to individual static electrical signals. The CPU is able to control each of these connections as memory-mapped I\/O via the low speed bus The following table is a list of connections to the parallel interface:\n"]}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0141","num":"0160"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00004","num":"00004"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"112pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"Connection","Direction","Pins"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"112pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"char","char":"."}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Paper transport stepper motor","Out","4"]},{"entry":[{},"Artcard stepper motor","Out","4"]},{"entry":[{},"Zoom stepper motor","Out","4"]},{"entry":[{},"Guillotine motor","Out","1"]},{"entry":[{},"Flash trigger","Out","1"]},{"entry":[{},"Status LCD segment drivers","Out","7"]},{"entry":[{},"Status LCD common drivers","Out","4"]},{"entry":[{},"Artcard illumination LED","Out","1"]},{"entry":[{},"Artcard status LED (red\/green)","In","2"]},{"entry":[{},"Artcard sensor","In","1"]},{"entry":[{},"Paper pull sensor","In","1"]},{"entry":[{},"Orientation sensor","In","2"]},{"entry":[{},"Buttons","In","4"]},{"entry":[{},{},"TOTAL","36"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}},"br":[{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{}],"b":["78","79","74","74","78","78","74","74","78","83","83","83","79","74","79","74","79","79","62","62","79","31","62","74","31","178","183","178","178","189","190","178","74"]},"Turning now to , the auto exposure setting information  is utilised in conjunction with the stored image  to process the image by utilising the ACP. The processed image is returned to the memory store for later printing out  on the output printer.","A number of processing steps can be undertaken in accordance with the determined light conditions. Where the auto exposure setting 1 indicates that the image was taken in a low light condition, the image pixel colours are selectively re-mapped so as to make the image colours stronger, deeper and richer.","Where the auto exposure information indicates that highlight conditions were present when the image was taken, the image colours can be processed to make them brighter and more saturated. The re-colouring of the image can be undertaken by conversion of the image to a hue-saturation-value (HSV) format and an alteration of pixel values in accordance with requirements. The pixel values can then be output converted to the required output colour format of printing.","Of course, many different re-colouring techniques may be utilised. Preferably, the techniques are clearly illustrated on the pre-requisite Artcard inserted into the reader. Alternatively, the image processing algorithms can be automatically applied and hard-wired into the camera for utilization in certain conditions.","Alternatively, the Artcard inserted could have a number of manipulations applied to the image which are specific to the auto-exposure setting. For example, clip arts containing candles etc could be inserted in a dark image and large suns inserted in bright images.","Referring now to , the Artcam prints the images onto media stored in a replaceable print roll . In some preferred embodiments, the operation of the camera device is such that when a series of images is printed on a first surface of the print roll, the corresponding backing surface has a ready made postcard which can be immediately dispatched at the nearest post office box within the jurisdiction. In this way, personalized postcards can be created.","It would be evident that when utilising the postcard system as illustrated  only predetermined image sizes are possible as the synchronization between the backing postcard portion and the front image must be maintained. This can be achieved by utilising the memory portions of the authentication chip stored within the print roll  to store details of the length of each postcard backing format sheet. This can be achieved by either having each postcard the same size or by storing each size within the print rolls on-board print chip memory.","In an alternative embodiment, there is provided a modified form of print roll which can be constructed mostly from injection moulded plastic pieces suitably snapped fitted together. The modified form of print roll has a high ink storage capacity in addition to a somewhat simplified construction. The print media onto which the image is to be printed is wrapped around a plastic sleeve former for simplified construction. The ink media reservoir has a series of air vents which are constructed so as to minimise the opportunities for the ink flow out of the air vents. Further, a rubber seal is provided for the ink outlet holes with the rubber seal being pierced on insertion of the print roll into a camera system. Further, the print roll includes a print media ejection slot and the ejection slot includes a surrounding moulded surface which provides and assists in the accurate positioning of the print media ejection slot relative to the printhead within the printing or camera system.","Turning to  there is illustrated a single point roll unit  in an assembled form with a partial cutaway showing internal portions of the print roll.  and  illustrate left and right side exploded perspective views respectively.

The present embodiment is, therefore, to be considered in all respects to be illustrative and not restrictive.","The present invention is best utilized in the Artcam device, the details of which are set out in the following paragraphs.","Ink Jet Technologies","The embodiments of the invention use an ink jet printer type device. Of course many different devices could be used. However presently popular ink jet printing technologies are unlikely to be suitable.","The most significant problem with thermal inkjet is power consumption. This is approximately 100 times that required for high speed, and stems from the energy-inefficient means of drop ejection. This involves the rapid boiling of water to produce a vapor bubble which expels the ink. Water has a very high heat capacity, and must be superheated in thermal inkjet applications. This leads to an efficiency of around 0.02%, from electricity input to drop momentum (and increased surface area) out.","The most significant problem with piezoelectric inkjet is size and cost. Piezoelectric crystals have a very small deflection at reasonable drive voltages, and therefore require a large area for each nozzle. Also, each piezoelectric actuator must be connected to its drive circuit on a separate substrate. This is not a significant problem at the current limit of around 300 nozzles per print head, but is a major impediment to the fabrication of pagewide print heads with 19,200 nozzles.","Ideally, the inkjet technologies used meet the stringent requirements of in-camera digital color printing and other high quality, high speed, low cost printing applications. To meet the requirements of digital photography, new inkjet technologies have been created. The target features include:","low power (less than 10 Watts)","high resolution capability (1,600 dpi or more)","photographic quality output","low manufacturing cost","small size (pagewidth times minimum cross section)","high speed (<2 seconds per page).","All of these features can be met or exceeded by the inkjet systems described below with differing levels of difficulty. 45 different inkjet technologies have been developed by the Assignee to give a wide range of choices for high volume manufacture. These technologies form part of separate applications assigned to the present Assignee as set out in the table below.","The inkjet designs shown here are suitable for a wide range of digital printing systems, from battery powered one-time use digital cameras, through to desktop and network printers, and through to commercial printing systems","For ease of manufacture using standard process equipment, the print head is designed to be a monolithic 0.5 micron CMOS chip with MEMS post processing. For color photographic applications, the print head is 100 mm long, with a width which depends upon the inkjet type. The smallest print head designed is IJ38, which is 0.35 mm wide, giving a chip area of 35 square mm. The print heads each contain 19,200 nozzles plus data and control circuitry.","Ink is supplied to the back of the print head by injection molded plastic ink channels. The molding requires 50 micron features, which can be created using a lithographically micromachined insert in a standard injection molding tool. Ink flows through holes etched through the wafer to the nozzle chambers fabricated on the front surface of the wafer.
