The heterobicyclic pyrazole compounds may be useful in the treatment of hyperproliferative disorders, such as cancer, in mammals. The invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions and formulations, methods of synthesis, and methods of use such as treating hyperproliferative disorders.","Met tyrosine kinase is a high-affinity transmembrane receptor for the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF, Bottaro et al. (1991) Science 251:802-804). Met was cloned, named (Cooper et al. (1984) 311:29-33) and identified as an oncogene (Park et al. (1986) Cell 45:895-904). When deregulated by overexpression or mutations, Met receptor tyrosine kinase leads to tumor growth and invasion (Cristiani et al. (2005) Biochem. 44:14110-14119). Stimulation of Met by the ligand HGF, also known as Scatter Factor, initiates numerous physiological processes, including cell proliferation, scattering, morphogenic differentiation, angiogenesis, wound healing, tissue regeneration, and embryological development (Parr et al. (2004) Clin. Cancer Res. 10(1, Pt. 1) 202-211; Comoglio et al. (2002) J. Clin. Invest. 109:857-862; Maulik et al. (2002) Cytokine Growth Factor Reviews 13:41-59; Hecht et al. (2004) Cancer Res. 64(17):6109-6118). Receptor c-Met is rapidly internalized via clathrin-coated vesicles and traffics through an early endosomal compartment after hepatocyte growth factor stimulation. c-Met accumulates progressively in perinuclear compartments, which in part include the Golgi (Kermorgant et al. (2003) J. of Biol. Chem. 278(31):28921-28929).","The phenomena of: deregulation or dysregulation of Met and\/or HGF; Met overexpression; and Met mutations are implicated in uncontrolled cell proliferation and survival, and play a key role in early-stage tumorigenesis, invasive growth of cancer cells, and metastasis (Danilkovitch-Miagkova et al. (2002) J. Clin. Invest. 109(7):863-867; Di Renzo et al. (1994) Int. J. Cancer 58:658-662; Matsumoto et al. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269:31807-31813; Tusolino et al. (1998) J.

Cancer Res. 8:620-627), making Met an important target for anticancer drug development (Cohen, P. (2002) Nat. Rev. Drug Discovery 1:309-315). Overexpression of Met and HGF is associated with poor prognosis.","Recent data demonstrating the suppression of cancer cell proliferation, survival, and invasion upon inhibition of Met binding to HGF and Met receptor dimerization (Furge et al. (2001) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 98:10722-10727; Michieli et al. (2004) Cancer Cell 6:61-73) confirm the relevance of Met in neoplasia and provide further proof of concept for the development of small-molecule compounds for antineoplastic therapy, e.g. against multiple myeloma (Hov et al. (2004) Clin. Cancer Res. 10(19):6686-6694). Inhibition of Met results in slowing tumor growth in tumor xenograft mouse models. Antibodies specific for c-Met have been expressed to block binding of HGF to c-Met (US 2005\/0037431; US 2004\/0166544).","Protein kinases (PK) are enzymes that catalyze the phosphorylation of hydroxy groups on tyrosine, serine and threonine residues of proteins by transfer of the terminal (gamma) phosphate from ATP. Through signal transduction pathways, these enzymes modulate cell growth, differentiation and proliferation, i.e., virtually all aspects of cell life in one way or another depend on PK activity. Furthermore, abnormal PK activity has been related to a host of disorders, ranging from relatively non-life threatening diseases such as psoriasis to extremely virulent diseases such as glioblastoma (brain cancer). Protein kinases include two classes; protein tyrosine kinases (PTK) and serine-threonine kinases (STK).","One of the prime aspects of PTK activity is their involvement with growth factor receptors which are cell-surface proteins. When bound by a growth factor ligand, growth factor receptors are converted to an active form which interacts with proteins on the inner surface of a cell membrane. This leads to phosphorylation on tyrosine residues of the receptor and other proteins and to the formation inside the cell of complexes with a variety of cytoplasmic signaling molecules that, in turn, effect numerous cellular responses such as cell division (proliferation), cell differentiation, cell growth, expression of metabolic effects to the extracellular microenvironment, etc. For a more complete discussion, see Schlessinger and Ullrich, (1992) Neuron 9:303-391.","Growth factor receptors with PTK activity are known as receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK, Plowman et al. (1994) DN&P, 7(6):334-339), which comprise a large family of transmembrane receptors with diverse biological activity. At present, at least nineteen (19) distinct subfamilies of RTK have been identified. An example of these is the subfamily designated the \u201cHER\u201d RTK, which include EGFR (epithelial growth factor receptor), HER2, HER3 and HER4. These RTK consist of an extracellular glycosylated ligand binding domain, a transmembrane domain and an intracellular cytoplasmic catalytic domain that can phosphorylate tyrosine residues on proteins. Another RTK subfamily consists of insulin receptor (IR), insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF-1R) and insulin receptor related receptor (IRR). IR and IGF-1R interact with insulin, IGF-I and IGF-II to form a heterotetramer of two entirely extracellular glycosylated alpha subunits and two beta subunits which cross the cell membrane and which contain the tyrosine kinase domain. A third RTK subfamily is referred to as the platelet derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) group, which includes PDGFR-alpha, PDGFR-beta, CSFIR, c-kit and c-fms. These receptors consist of glycosylated extracellular domains composed of variable numbers of immunoglobin-like loops and an intracellular domain wherein the tyrosine kinase domain is interrupted by unrelated amino acid sequences. Another group which, because of its similarity to the PDGFR subfamily, is sometimes subsumed into the later group is the fetus liver kinase (flk) receptor subfamily. This group is believed to be made up of kinase insert domain-receptor fetal liver kinase-1 (KDR\/FLK-1), flk-1R, flk-4 and fins-like tyrosine kinase 1 (flt-1). Another member of the tyrosine kinase growth factor receptor family is the fibroblast growth factor (\u201cFGF\u201d) receptor subgroup. This group consists of four receptors, FGFR1-4, and seven ligands, FGF1-7. While not yet well defined, it appears that these receptors consist of a glycosylated extracellular domain containing a variable number of immunoglobin-like loops and an intracellular domain in which the tyrosine kinase sequence is interrupted by regions of unrelated amino acid sequences. Still another member of the tyrosine kinase growth factor receptor family is the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor subgroup. VEGF is a dimeric glycoprotein similar to PDGF but has different biological functions and target cell specificity in vivo. In particular, VEGF is presently thought to play an essential role is vasculogenesis and angiogenesis.","Met is still another member of the tyrosine kinase growth factor receptor family, and often referred to as c-Met or human hepatocyte growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase (hHGFR). The expression of c-Met is thought to play a role in primary tumor growth and metastasis (Kim et al. Clin. Cancer Res. (2003) 9(14):5161-5170).","Modulation of the HGF\/c-Met signaling pathway may be effected by regulating binding of HGF beta chain to cMet. In particular embodiments, the zymogen-like form of HGF beta mutant was shown to bind Met with 14-fold lower affinity than the wild-type serine protease-like form, suggesting optimal interactions result from conformational changes upon cleavage of the single-chain form (US 2005\/0037431). Extensive mutagenesis of the HGF beta region corresponding to the active site and activation domain of serine proteases showed that 17 of the 38 purified two-chain HGF mutants resulted in impaired cell migration or Met phosphorylation but no loss in Met binding. However, reduced biological activities were well correlated with reduced Met binding of corresponding mutants of HGF beta itself in assays eliminating dominant alpha-chain binding contributions.","Protein-tyrosine kinases (PTK) are critical components of signaling pathways that control cellular proliferation and differentiation. PTK are subdivided into two large families, receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) and non-receptor tyrosine kinases (NRTK). RTK span the plasma membrane and contain an extra-cellular domain, which binds ligand, and an intracellular portion, which possesses catalytic activity and regulatory sequences. Most RTK, like the hepatocyte growth factor receptor c-met, possess a single polypeptide chain and are monomeric in the absence of a ligand. Ligand binding to the extracellular portion of RTK, dimerizes monomeric receptors, resulting in autophosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic portion (for review see: Blume-Jensen, P., and Hunter, T., Nature (2001) 411:355-365; Hubbard, S. R., et al., J. Biol. Chem. 273 (1998) 11987-11990; Zwick, E., et al., Trends Mol. Med. (2002) 8:17-23). In general, tyrosine autophosphorylation either stimulates the intrinsic catalytic kinase activity of the receptor or generates recruitment sites for downstream signaling proteins containing phosphotyrosine-recognition domains, such as the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain or the phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain.","PTK have become primary targets for the development of novel therapeutics designed to block cancer cell proliferation, metastasis, and angiogenesis and promote apoptosis. The strategy that has progressed farthest in clinical development is the use of monoclonal antibodies to target growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases. The use of small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors however could have significant theoretical advantages over monoclonal antibodies. Small molecule inhibitors could have better tissue penetration, could have activity against intracellular targets and mutated targets and could be designed to have oral bioavailability. Several lead compounds have shown promising activity against such targets as the EGFR, the vascular endothelial cell growth factor receptor and bcr-abl. The hepatocyte growth factor receptor c-Met was first identified as an activated oncogene in an N-methyl-N\u2032-nitrosoguanidinic treated human osteogenic sarcoma cell line (MUNG-HOS) by its ability to transform NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts. The receptor encoded by the c-Met protooncogene (located on chromosome 7) is a two-chain protein composed of 50 kDa (alpha) chain disulfide linked to a 145 kDa (beta) chain in an alpha-beta complex of 190 kDa. The alpha-chain is exposed at the cell surface while the beta chain spans the cell membrane and possesses an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. The presence of this intracellular tyrosine kinase domain groups c-Met as a member of the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) family of cell surface molecules.","Much evidence supports the role of HGF as a regulator of carcinogenesis, cancer invasion and metastasis (for review see: Herynk, M. H., and Radinsky, R. (2000) In Vivo 14:587-596; Jiang et al. (1999) Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 29:209-248; Longati (2001) Curr. Drug Targets 2:41-55; Maulik et al., (2002) Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 13:41-59; Parr, C., and Jiang, W. G., (2001) Histol. Histopathol. 16:251-268). HGF binds to and induces tyrosine phosphorylation of the mature c-met receptor beta-chain. Such events are thought to promote binding of intracellular signaling proteins containing src homology (SH) regions such as PLC-gamma, Ras-GAP, PI-3 kinase ppc-src and the GRB-2 Socs complex to the activated receptor. Each SH2-containing protein may activate a different subset of signaling phosphopeptides, thus eliciting different responses within the cell. c-Met mutations have been well-described in hereditary and sporadic human papillary renal carcinomas and have been reported in ovarian cancer, childhood hepatocellular carcinoma, metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinomas, and gastric cancer. c-Met is also over-expressed in both non-small cell lung cancer and small cell lung cancer cells, in lung, breast, colon and prostate tumors (Herynk et al. (2003) Cancer Res. 63(11):2990-2996; Maulik et al. (2002) Clin. Cancer Res. 8:620-627). Since c-Met appears to play an important role in oncogenesis of a variety of tumors, various inhibition strategies have been employed to therapeutically target this receptor tyrosine kinase. The usefulness of inhibiting the protein-tyrosine kinase c-Met for inhibiting tumor growth and invasion has been shown in many well documented preclinical experiments (Abounader et al. (1999) J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 91:1548-1556; Laterra et al. (1997) Lab. Invest. 76:565-577; Tomioka, D. (2001) Cancer Res. 61:7518-7524; Wang et al. (2001) J. Cell Biology 153:1023-1033).","c-Met inhibitors have been reported (US 2004\/0242603; US 2004\/0110758; US 2005\/0009845; WO 2003\/000660; WO 98\/007695; U.S. Pat. No. 5,792,783; U.S. Pat.

PHA-665752 is a small molecule, ATP-competitive, active-site inhibitor of the catalytic activity of c-Met, as well as phenotypes such as cell growth, cell motility, invasion, and morphology of a variety of tumor cells (Ma et al.

The components of the liposome are commonly arranged in a bilayer formation, similar to the lipid arrangement of biological membranes.","The term \u201cpackage insert\u201d is used to refer to instructions customarily included in commercial packages of therapeutic products, that contain information about the indications, usage, dosage, administration, contraindications and\/or warnings concerning the use of such therapeutic products.","The term \u201cchiral\u201d refers to molecules which have the property of non-superimposability of the mirror image partner, while the term \u201cachiral\u201d refers to molecules which are superimposable on their mirror image partner.","The term \u201cstereoisomers\u201d refers to compounds which have identical chemical constitution, but differ with regard to the arrangement of the atoms or groups in space.","\u201cDiastereomer\u201d refers to a stereoisomer with two or more centers of chirality and whose molecules are not mirror images of one another. Diastereomers have different physical properties, e.g. melting points, boiling points, spectral properties, and reactivities. Mixtures of diastereomers may separate under high resolution analytical procedures such as electrophoresis and chromatography.","\u201cEnantiomers\u201d refer to two stereoisomers of a compound which are non-superimposable mirror images of one another.","Stereochemical definitions and conventions used herein generally follow S. P. Parker, Ed., -(1984) McGraw-Hill Book Company, New York; and Eliel, E. and Wilen, S., \u201cStereochemistry of Organic Compounds\u201d, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, 1994. The compounds of the invention may contain asymmetric or chiral centers, and therefore exist in different stereoisomeric forms. It is intended that all stereoisomeric forms of the compounds of the invention, including but not limited to, diastereomers, enantiomers and atropisomers, as well as mixtures thereof such as racemic mixtures, form part of the present invention. Many organic compounds exist in optically active forms, i.e., they have the ability to rotate the plane of plane-polarized light. In describing an optically active compound, the prefixes D and L, or R and S, are used to denote the absolute configuration of the molecule about its chiral center(s). The prefixes d and l or (+) and (\u2212) are employed to designate the sign of rotation of plane-polarized light by the compound, with (\u2212) or l meaning that the compound is levorotatory. A compound prefixed with (+) or d is dextrorotatory. For a given chemical structure, these stereoisomers are identical except that they are mirror images of one another. A specific stereoisomer may also be referred to as an enantiomer, and a mixture of such isomers is often called an enantiomeric mixture. A 50:50 mixture of enantiomers is referred to as a racemic mixture or a racemate, which may occur where there has been no stereoselection or stereospecificity in a chemical reaction or process. The terms \u201cracemic mixture\u201d and \u201cracemate\u201d refer to an equimolar mixture of two enantiomeric species, devoid of optical activity.","The term \u201ctautomer\u201d or \u201ctautomeric form\u201d refers to structural isomers of different energies which are interconvertible via a low energy barrier. For example, proton tautomers (also known as prototropic tautomers) include interconversions via migration of a proton, such as keto-enol and imine-enamine isomerizations. Valence tautomers include interconversions by reorganization of some of the bonding electrons.","The phrase \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable salt,\u201d as used herein, refers to pharmaceutically acceptable organic or inorganic salts of a compound of the invention. Exemplary salts include, but are not limited, to sulfate, citrate, acetate, oxalate, chloride, bromide, iodide, nitrate, bisulfate, phosphate, acid phosphate, isonicotinate, lactate, salicylate, acid citrate, tartrate, oleate, tannate, pantothenate, bitartrate, ascorbate, succinate, maleate, gentisinate, fumarate, gluconate, glucuronate, saccharate, formate, benzoate, glutamate, methanesulfonate, ethanesulfonate, benzenesulfonate, p-toluenesulfonate, and pamoate (i.e., 1,1\u2032-methylene-bis-(2-hydroxy-3-naphthoate)) salts. A pharmaceutically acceptable salt may involve the inclusion of another molecule such as an acetate ion, a succinate ion or other counter ion. The counter ion may be any organic or inorganic moiety that stabilizes the charge on the parent compound. Furthermore, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt may have more than one charged atom in its structure. Instances where multiple charged atoms are part of the pharmaceutically acceptable salt can have multiple counter ions. Hence, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt can have one or more charged atoms and\/or one or more counter ion.","The compounds of Formulas Ia and Ib also include other salts of such compounds which are not necessarily pharmaceutically acceptable salts, and which may be useful as intermediates for preparing and\/or purifying compounds of Formulas Ia or Ib and\/or for separating enantiomers of compounds of Formulas Ia or Ib.","If the compound of the invention is a base, the desired pharmaceutically acceptable salt may be prepared by any suitable method available in the art, for example, treatment of the free base with an inorganic acid, such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid and the like, or with an organic acid, such as acetic acid, maleic acid, succinic acid, mandelic acid, fumaric acid, malonic acid, pyruvic acid, oxalic acid, glycolic acid, salicylic acid, a pyranosidyl acid, such as glucuronic acid or galacturonic acid, an alpha hydroxy acid, such as citric acid or tartaric acid, an amino acid, such as aspartic acid or glutamic acid, an aromatic acid, such as benzoic acid or cinnamic acid, a sulfonic acid, such as p-toluenesulfonic acid or ethanesulfonic acid, or the like.","If the compound of the invention is an acid, the desired pharmaceutically acceptable salt may be prepared by any suitable method, for example, treatment of the free acid with an inorganic or organic base, such as an amine (primary, secondary or tertiary), an alkali metal hydroxide or alkaline earth metal hydroxide, or the like. Illustrative examples of suitable salts include, but are not limited to, organic salts derived from amino acids, such as glycine and arginine, ammonia, primary, secondary, and tertiary amines, and cyclic amines, such as piperidine, morpholine and piperazine, and inorganic salts derived from sodium, calcium, potassium, magnesium, manganese, iron, copper, zinc, aluminum and lithium.","The phrase \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable\u201d indicates that the substance or composition must be compatible chemically and\/or toxicologically, with the other ingredients comprising a formulation, and\/or the mammal being treated therewith.","A \u201csolvate\u201d refers to an association or complex of one or more solvent molecules and a compound of the invention. Examples of solvents that form solvates include, but are not limited to, water, isopropanol, ethanol, methanol, DMSO, ethyl acetate, acetic acid, and ethanolamine. The term \u201chydrate\u201d refers to the complex where the solvent molecule is water.","The term \u201cprotecting group\u201d or \u201cPg\u201d refers to a substituent that is commonly employed to block or protect a particular functionality while reacting other functional groups on the compound. For example, an \u201camino-protecting group\u201d is a substituent attached to an amino group that blocks or protects the amino functionality in the compound. Suitable amino-protecting groups include acetyl, trifluoroacetyl, t-butoxycarbonyl (BOC), benzyloxycarbonyl (CBZ) and 9-fluorenylmethylenoxycarbonyl (Fmoc). Similarly, a \u201chydroxy-protecting group\u201d refers to a substituent of a hydroxy group that blocks or protects the hydroxy functionality. Suitable protecting groups include acetyl and silyl. A \u201ccarboxy-protecting group\u201d refers to a substituent of the carboxy group that blocks or protects the carboxy functionality. Common carboxy-protecting groups include \u2014CHCHSOPh, cyanoethyl, 2-(trimethylsilyl)ethyl, 2-(trimethylsilyl)ethoxymethyl, 2-(p-toluenesulfonyl)ethyl, 2-(p-nitrophenylsulfenyl)ethyl, 2-(diphenylphosphino)-ethyl, nitroethyl and the like. For a general description of protecting groups and their use, see T. W. Greene, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, John Wiley & Sons, New York, 1991.","The terms \u201ccompound of this invention,\u201d and \u201ccompounds of the present invention\u201d and \u201ccompounds of Formula Ia and Ib\u201d include compounds of Formulas Ia and Ib and stereoisomers, geometric isomers, tautomers, solvates, metabolites, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts and prodrugs thereof.","The term \u201cmammal\u201d includes, but is not limited to, humans, dogs, cats, horses, cows, pigs, sheep, and poultry.","c-Met Inhibitor Compounds","The present invention provides heterobicyclic pyrazole compounds, and pharmaceutical formulations thereof, that are potentially useful in the treatment of diseases, conditions and\/or disorders modulated by c-Met.

The acid 84 may then be coupled to an appropriate aniline intermediate as in Schemes 7 or 14 to provide compounds of Formula I.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0431","num":"0429"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00109","num":"00109"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00109","he":"122.26mm","wi":"137.24mm","file":"US07723330-20100525-C00109.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"Scheme 27 shows a general scheme for the synthesis of intermediate 90, wherein Het is a substituted or unsubstituted 5-6 membered heteroaryl group having at least one ring nitrogen atom and optionally having a second ring heteroatom selected from N and O. Intermediate compounds 90 are useful for the synthesis of compounds of Formula I. As shown in Scheme 27, elaboration of the pyrazolopyridine 4-position phenoxy group into an amino linked heteroaryl amide may proceed via several pathways. Intermediate 85 bearing an appropriate leaving group Xmay be reacted with a heteroaryl amino ester 87 typically under transition metal catalysis to provide ester 89. Ester 89 may then be converted to compound 90 using standard ester hydrolysis conditions followed by standard amide bond forming conditions. Alternatively, 85 may be reacted with a heteroaryl amino amide 91 under transition metal catalysis to give intermediate 90 directly. Alternatively, the mode of coupling may be reversed, wherein an intermediate 86 bearing an amino group may be reacted with a heteroaryl ester 88 bearing leaving group Xtypically under transition metal catalyzed or thermal conditions to give intermediate 89. Intermediate 89 may then be converted to intermediate 90 using standard ester hydrolysis conditions followed by standard amide bond forming conditions. Alternatively, 86 may be reacted with a heteroaryl amide 92 bearing leaving group X, typically under transition metal catalyzed or thermal conditions to give intermediate 90 directly. When Ris an appropriate substituent, intermediate 90 may be deprotected to give final compounds of Formula I. If Ris a handle for further elaboration, intermediate 90 may be subjected to further elaboration as in Schemes 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 15 for example followed by deprotection to give compounds of Formula I.","Methods of Separation","In the methods of preparing the compounds of this invention, it may be advantageous to separate reaction products from one another and\/or from starting materials. The desired products of each step or series of steps is separated and\/or purified (hereinafter separated) to the desired degree of homogeneity by the techniques common in the art. Typically such separations involve multiphase extraction, crystallization from a solvent or solvent mixture, distillation, sublimation, or chromatography. Chromatography can involve any number of methods including, for example: reverse-phase and normal phase; size exclusion; ion exchange; high, medium and low pressure liquid chromatography methods and apparatus; small scale analytical; simulated moving bed (SMB) and preparative thin or thick layer chromatography, as well as techniques of small scale thin layer and flash chromatography.","Another class of separation methods involves treatment of a mixture with a reagent selected to bind to or render otherwise separable a desired product, unreacted starting material, reaction by product, or the like. Such reagents include adsorbents or absorbents such as activated carbon, molecular sieves, ion exchange media, or the like. Alternatively, the reagents can be acids in the case of a basic material, bases in the case of an acidic material, binding reagents such as antibodies, binding proteins, selective chelators such as crown ethers, liquid\/liquid ion extraction reagents (LIX), or the like.","Selection of appropriate methods of separation depends on the nature of the materials involved. For example, boiling point and molecular weight in distillation and sublimation, presence or absence of polar functional groups in chromatography, stability of materials in acidic and basic media in multiphase extraction, and the like. One skilled in the art will apply techniques most likely to achieve the desired separation.","Diastereomeric mixtures can be separated into their individual diastereomers on the basis of their physical chemical differences by methods well known to those skilled in the art, such as by chromatography and\/or fractional crystallization. Enantiomers can be separated by converting the enantiomeric mixture into a diastereomeric mixture by reaction with an appropriate optically active compound (e.g., chiral auxiliary such as a chiral alcohol or Mosher's acid chloride), separating the diastereomers and converting (e.g., hydrolyzing) the individual diastereoisomers to the corresponding pure enantiomers. Also, some of the compounds of the present invention may be atropisomers (e.g., substituted biaryls) and are considered as part of this invention. Enantiomers can also be separated by use of a chiral HPLC column.","A single stereoisomer, e.g., an enantiomer, substantially free of its stereoisomer may be obtained by resolution of the racemic mixture using a method such as formation of diastereomers using optically active resolving agents (Eliel, E. and Wilen, S. \u201cStereochemistry of Organic Compounds,\u201d John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, 1994; Lochmuller, C. H., (1975) J. Chromatogr., 113(3):283-302). Racemic mixtures of chiral compounds of the invention can be separated and isolated by any suitable method, including: (1) formation of ionic, diastereomeric salts with chiral compounds and separation by fractional crystallization or other methods, (2) formation of diastereomeric compounds with chiral derivatizing reagents, separation of the diastereomers, and conversion to the pure stereoisomers, and (3) separation of the substantially pure or enriched stereoisomers directly under chiral conditions. See: \u201cDrug Stereochemistry, Analytical Methods and Pharmacology,\u201d Irving W. Wainer, Ed., Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York (1993).","Under method (1), diastereomeric salts can be formed by reaction of enantiomerically pure chiral bases such as brucine, quinine, ephedrine, strychnine, \u03b1-methyl-\u03b2-phenylethylamine (amphetamine), and the like with asymmetric compounds bearing acidic functionality, such as carboxylic acid and sulfonic acid. The diastereomeric salts may be induced to separate by fractional crystallization or ionic chromatography. For separation of the optical isomers of amino compounds, addition of chiral carboxylic or sulfonic acids, such as camphorsulfonic acid, tartaric acid, mandelic acid, or lactic acid can result in formation of the diastereomeric salts.","Alternatively, by method (2), the substrate to be resolved is reacted with one enantiomer of a chiral compound to form a diastereomeric pair (E. and Wilen, S. \u201cStereochemistry of Organic Compounds\u201d, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 1994, p. 322). Diastereomeric compounds can be formed by reacting asymmetric compounds with enantiomerically pure chiral derivatizing reagents, such as menthyl derivatives, followed by separation of the diastereomers and hydrolysis to yield the pure or enriched enantiomer. A method of determining optical purity involves making chiral esters, such as a menthyl ester, e.g., (\u2212) menthyl chloroformate in the presence of base, or Mosher ester, \u03b1-methoxy-\u03b1-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl acetate (Jacob III. J. Org. Chem., (1982) 47:4165), of the racemic mixture, and analyzing the H NMR spectrum for the presence of the two atropisomeric enantiomers or diastereomers. Stable diastereomers of atropisomeric compounds can be separated and isolated by normal- and reverse-phase chromatography following methods for separation of atropisomeric naphthyl-isoquinolines (WO 96\/15111). By method (3), a racemic mixture of two enantiomers can be separated by chromatography using a chiral stationary phase (\u201cChiral Liquid Chromatography\u201d (1989) W. J. Lough, Ed., Chapman and Hall, New York; Okamoto, J. Chromatogr., (1990) 513:375-378). Enriched or purified enantiomers can be distinguished by methods used to distinguish other chiral molecules with asymmetric carbon atoms, such as optical rotation and circular dichroism.","Biological Evaluation","Determination of the activity of c-Met kinase activity of a compound of Formula Ia or Ib is possible by a number of direct and indirect detection methods. One example of an assay used for the determination of c-Met kinase activity is based on an enzyme linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA). The assay includes a compound of Formula Ia or Ib, c-Met (His-tagged recombinant human Met (amino acids 974-end), expressed by baculovirus), and ATP in assay buffer, as described in Example A.","In MKN45 cells, the activity of cMet inhibitors of Formulas Ia and Ib was determined by the in vitro fluorescence assay as described in Example B.","Certain exemplary compounds described herein were prepared, characterized, and assayed for their c-Met binding activity and in vitro activity against tumor cells. The range of c-Met binding activities was less than 1 nM to about 10 \u03bcM. Certain exemplary compounds of the invention had c-Met binding activity ICvalues less than 10 nM. Certain compounds of the invention had MKN45 cell-based activity ICvalues less than 100 nM.","Administration of Compounds of Formulas Ia and Ib","The compounds of the invention may be administered by any route appropriate to the condition to be treated. Suitable routes include oral, parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous, intraarterial, intradermal, intrathecal and epidural), transdermal, rectal, nasal, topical (including buccal and sublingual), vaginal, intraperitoneal, intrapulmonary and intranasal. For local immunosuppressive treatment, the compounds may be administered by intralesional administration, including perfusing or otherwise contacting the graft with the inhibitor before transplantation. It will be appreciated that the preferred route may vary with for example the condition of the recipient. Where the compound is administered orally, it may be formulated as a pill, capsule, tablet, etc. with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient. Where the compound is administered parenterally, it may be formulated with a pharmaceutically acceptable parenteral vehicle and in a unit dosage injectable form, as detailed below.","Methods of Treatment with Compounds of Formulas Ia or Ib","Compounds of the present invention are useful for treating diseases, conditions and\/or disorders including, but not limited to, those characterized by over expression of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK), e.g. c-Met kinase. Accordingly, another aspect of this invention includes methods of treating or preventing diseases or conditions that can be treated or prevented by inhibiting receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK), including c-Met.

Also provided is the use of a compound of this invention in the preparation of a medicament for the treatment of the diseases and conditions described herein in a warm-blooded animal, such as a mammal, for example a human, suffering from such disorder.","Pharmaceutical Formulations","In order to use a compound of this invention for the therapeutic treatment (including prophylactic treatment) of mammals including humans, it is normally formulated in accordance with standard pharmaceutical practice as a pharmaceutical composition. According to this aspect of the invention there is provided a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of this invention in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent or carrier.","A typical formulation is prepared by mixing a compound of the present invention and a carrier, diluent or excipient. Suitable carriers, diluents and excipients are well known to those skilled in the art and include materials such as carbohydrates, waxes, water soluble and\/or swellable polymers, hydrophilic or hydrophobic materials, gelatin, oils, solvents, water and the like. The particular carrier, diluent or excipient used will depend upon the means and purpose for which the compound of the present invention is being applied. Solvents are generally selected based on solvents recognized by persons skilled in the art as safe (GRAS) to be administered to a mammal. In general, safe solvents are non-toxic aqueous solvents such as water and other non-toxic solvents that are soluble or miscible in water. Suitable aqueous solvents include water, ethanol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycols (e.g., PEG 400, PEG 300), etc. and mixtures thereof. The formulations may also include one or more buffers, stabilizing agents, surfactants, wetting agents, lubricating agents, emulsifiers, suspending agents, preservatives, antioxidants, opaquing agents, glidants, processing aids, colorants, sweeteners, perfuming agents, flavoring agents and other known additives to provide an elegant presentation of the drug (i.e., a compound of the present invention or pharmaceutical composition thereof) or aid in the manufacturing of the pharmaceutical product (i.e., medicament).","The formulations may be prepared using conventional dissolution and mixing procedures. For example, the bulk drug substance (i.e., compound of the present invention or stabilized form of the compound (e.g., complex with a cyclodextrin derivative or other known complexation agent) is dissolved in a suitable solvent in the presence of one or more of the excipients described above. The compound of the present invention is typically formulated into pharmaceutical dosage forms to provide an easily controllable dosage of the drug and to enable patient compliance with the prescribed regimen.","The pharmaceutical composition (or formulation) for application may be packaged in a variety of ways depending upon the method used for administering the drug. Generally, an article for distribution includes a container having deposited therein the pharmaceutical formulation in an appropriate form. Suitable containers are well known to those skilled in the art and include materials such as bottles (plastic and glass), sachets, ampoules, plastic bags, metal cylinders, and the like. The container may also include a tamper-proof assemblage to prevent indiscreet access to the contents of the package. In addition, the container has deposited thereon a label that describes the contents of the container. The label may also include appropriate warnings.","Pharmaceutical formulations of the compounds of the present invention may be prepared for various routes and types of administration. For example, a compound of Formula Ia or Ib having the desired degree of purity may optionally be mixed with pharmaceutically acceptable diluents, carriers, excipients or stabilizers (Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (1980) 16th edition, Osol, A. Ed.), in the form of a lyophilized formulation, milled powder, or an aqueous solution. Formulation may be conducted by mixing at ambient temperature at the appropriate pH, and at the desired degree of purity, with physiologically acceptable carriers, i.e., carriers that are non-toxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed. The pH of the formulation depends mainly on the particular use and the concentration of compound, but may range from about 3 to about 8. Formulation in an acetate buffer at pH 5 is a suitable embodiment.","The compound of this invention for use herein is preferably sterile. In particular, formulations to be used for in vivo administration must be sterile. Such sterilization is readily accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration membranes.","The compound ordinarily can be stored as a solid composition, a lyophilized formulation or as an aqueous solution.","The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention will be formulated, dosed and administered in a fashion, i.e., amounts, concentrations, schedules, course, vehicles and route of administration, consistent with good medical practice. Factors for consideration in this context include the particular disorder being treated, the particular mammal being treated, the clinical condition of the individual patient, the cause of the disorder, the site of delivery of the agent, the method of administration, the scheduling of administration, and other factors known to medical practitioners. The \u201ctherapeutically effective amount\u201d of the compound to be administered will be governed by such considerations, and is the minimum amount necessary to prevent, ameliorate, or treat the coagulation factor mediated disorder. Such amount is preferably below the amount that is toxic to the host or renders the host significantly more susceptible to bleeding.","As a general proposition, the initial pharmaceutically effective amount of the inhibitor administered parenterally per dose will be in the range of about 0.01-100 mg\/kg, namely about 0.1 to 20 mg\/kg of patient body weight per day, with the typical initial range of compound used being 0.3 to 15 mg\/kg\/day.","Acceptable diluents, carriers, excipients and stabilizers are nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed, and include buffers such as phosphate, citrate and other organic acids; antioxidants including ascorbic acid and methionine; preservatives (such as octadecyldimethylbenzyl ammonium chloride; hexamethonium chloride; benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride; phenol, butyl or benzyl alcohol; alkyl parabens such as methyl or propyl paraben; catechol; resorcinol; cyclohexanol; 3-pentanol; and m-cresol); low molecular weight (less than about 10 residues) polypeptides; proteins, such as serum albumin, gelatin, or immunoglobulins; hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone; amino acids such as glycine, glutamine, asparagine, histidine, arginine, or lysine; monosaccharides, disaccharides and other carbohydrates including glucose, mannose, or dextrins; chelating agents such as EDTA; sugars such as sucrose, mannitol, trehalose or sorbitol; salt-forming counter-ions such as sodium; metal complexes (e.g., Zn-protein complexes); and\/or non-ionic surfactants such as TWEEN\u2122, PLURONICS\u2122 or polyethylene glycol (PEG). The active pharmaceutical ingredients may also be entrapped in microcapsules prepared, for example, by coacervation techniques or by interfacial polymerization, for example, hydroxymethylcellulose or gelatin-microcapsules and poly-(methylmethacylate) microcapsules, respectively, in colloidal drug delivery systems (for example, liposomes, albumin microspheres, microemulsions, nano-particles and nanocapsules) or in macroemulsions. Such techniques are disclosed in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences 16th edition, Osol, A. Ed. (1980).","Sustained-release preparations of compounds of Formulas I may be prepared. Suitable examples of sustained-release preparations include semipermeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing a compound of Formula Ia or Ib, which matrices are in the form of shaped articles, e.g., films, or microcapsules. Examples of sustained-release matrices include polyesters, hydrogels (for example, poly(2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate), or poly(vinyl alcohol)), polylactides (U.S. Pat. No. 3,773,919), copolymers of L-glutamic acid and gamma-ethyl-L-glutamate, non-degradable ethylene-vinyl acetate, degradable lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymers such as the LUPRON DEPOT\u00ae (injectable microspheres composed of lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymer and leuprolide acetate) and poly-D-(\u2212)-3-hydroxybutyric acid.","The formulations include those suitable for the administration routes detailed herein. The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. Techniques and formulations generally are found in (Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa.). Such methods include the step of bringing into association the active ingredient with the carrier which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. In general the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active ingredient with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product.","Formulations of a compound of Formula Ia or Ib suitable for oral administration may be prepared as discrete units such as pills, capsules, cachets or tablets each containing a predetermined amount of a compound of Formula Ia or Ib.","Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active ingredient in a free-flowing form such as a powder or granules, optionally mixed with a binder, lubricant, inert diluent, preservative, surface active or dispersing agent. Molded tablets may be made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered active ingredient moistened with an inert liquid diluent. The tablets may optionally be coated or scored and optionally are formulated so as to provide slow or controlled release of the active ingredient therefrom.","Tablets, troches, lozenges, aqueous or oil suspensions, dispersible powders or granules, emulsions, hard or soft capsules, e.g., gelatin capsules, syrups or elixirs may be prepared for oral use. Formulations of compounds of Formula Ia or Ib intended for oral use may be prepared according to any method known to the art for the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions and such compositions may contain one or more agents including sweetening agents, flavoring agents, coloring agents and preserving agents, in order to provide a palatable preparation. Tablets containing the active ingredient in admixture with non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable excipient which are suitable for manufacture of tablets are acceptable. These excipients may be, for example, inert diluents, such as calcium or sodium carbonate, lactose, calcium or sodium phosphate; granulating and disintegrating agents, such as maize starch, or alginic acid; binding agents, such as starch, gelatin or acacia; and lubricating agents, such as magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc. Tablets may be uncoated or may be coated by known techniques including microencapsulation to delay disintegration and adsorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example, a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate alone or with a wax may be employed.","For treatment of the eye or other external tissues, e.g., mouth and skin, the formulations are preferably applied as a topical ointment or cream containing the active ingredient(s) in an amount of, for example, 0.075 to 20% w\/w. When formulated in an ointment, the active ingredients may be employed with either a paraffinic or a water-miscible ointment base. Alternatively, the active ingredients may be formulated in a cream with an oil-in-water cream base.","If desired, the aqueous phase of the cream base may include a polyhydric alcohol, i.e., an alcohol having two or more hydroxyl groups such as propylene glycol, butane 1,3-diol, mannitol, sorbitol, glycerol and polyethylene glycol (including PEG 400) and mixtures thereof. The topical formulations may desirably include a compound which enhances absorption or penetration of the active ingredient through the skin or other affected areas. Examples of such dermal penetration enhancers include dimethyl sulfoxide and related analogs.","The oily phase of the emulsions of this invention may be constituted from known ingredients in a known manner. While the phase may comprise merely an emulsifier, it desirably comprises a mixture of at least one emulsifier with a fat or an oil or with both a fat and an oil. Preferably, a hydrophilic emulsifier is included together with a lipophilic emulsifier which acts as a stabilizer. It is also preferred to include both an oil and a fat. Together, the emulsifier(s) with or without stabilizer(s) make up the so-called emulsifying wax, and the wax together with the oil and fat make up the so-called emulsifying ointment base which forms the oily dispersed phase of the cream formulations. Emulsifiers and emulsion stabilizers suitable for use in the formulation of the invention include Tween\u00ae 60, Span\u00ae 80, cetostearyl alcohol, benzyl alcohol, myristyl alcohol, glyceryl mono-stearate and sodium lauryl sulfate.","Aqueous suspensions of Formula Ia or Ib compounds contain the active materials in admixture with excipients suitable for the manufacture of aqueous suspensions. Such excipients include a suspending agent, such as sodium carboxymethylcellulose, croscarmellose, povidone, methylcellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, sodium alginate, polyvinylpyrrolidone, gum tragacanth and gum acacia, and dispersing or wetting agents such as a naturally occurring phosphatide (e.g., lecithin), a condensation product of an alkylene oxide with a fatty acid (e.g., polyoxyethylene stearate), a condensation product of ethylene oxide with a long chain aliphatic alcohol (e.g., heptadecaethyleneoxycetanol), a condensation product of ethylene oxide with a partial ester derived from a fatty acid and a hexitol anhydride (e.g., polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate). The aqueous suspension may also contain one or more preservatives such as ethyl or n-propyl p-hydroxybenzoate, one or more coloring agents, one or more flavoring agents and one or more sweetening agents, such as sucrose or saccharin.","The pharmaceutical compositions of compounds of Formula Ia or Ib may be in the form of a sterile injectable preparation, such as a sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspension. This suspension may be formulated according to the known art using those suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents which have been mentioned above. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, such as a solution in 1,3-butanediol or prepared as a lyophilized powder. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile fixed oils may conventionally be employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid may likewise be used in the preparation of injectables.","The amount of active ingredient that may be combined with the carrier material to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration. For example, a time-release formulation intended for oral administration to humans may contain approximately 1 to 1000 mg of active material compounded with an appropriate and convenient amount of carrier material which may vary from about 5 to about 95% of the total compositions (weight:weight). The pharmaceutical composition can be prepared to provide easily measurable amounts for administration. For example, an aqueous solution intended for intravenous infusion may contain from about 3 to 500 \u03bcg of the active ingredient per milliliter of solution in order that infusion of a suitable volume at a rate of about 30 mL\/hr can occur.","Formulations suitable for parenteral administration include aqueous and non-aqueous sterile injection solutions which may contain anti-oxidants, buffers, bacteriostats and solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient; and aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions which may include suspending agents and thickening agents.","Formulations suitable for topical administration to the eye also include eye drops wherein the active ingredient is dissolved or suspended in a suitable carrier, especially an aqueous solvent for the active ingredient. The active ingredient is preferably present in such formulations in a concentration of about 0.5 to 20% w\/w, for example about 0.5 to 10% w\/w, for example about 1.5% w\/w.","Formulations suitable for topical administration in the mouth include lozenges comprising the active ingredient in a flavored basis, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth; pastilles comprising the active ingredient in an inert basis such as gelatin and glycerin, or sucrose and acacia; and mouthwashes comprising the active ingredient in a suitable liquid carrier.","Formulations for rectal administration may be presented as a suppository with a suitable base comprising for example cocoa butter or a salicylate.","Formulations suitable for intrapulmonary or nasal administration have a particle size for example in the range of 0.1 to 500 microns (including particle sizes in a range between 0.1 and 500 microns in increments microns such as 0.5, 1, 30 microns, 35 microns, etc.), which is administered by rapid inhalation through the nasal passage or by inhalation through the mouth so as to reach the alveolar sacs. Suitable formulations include aqueous or oily solutions of the active ingredient. Formulations suitable for aerosol or dry powder administration may be prepared according to conventional methods and may be delivered with other therapeutic agents such as compounds heretofore used in the treatment or prophylaxis disorders as described below.","Formulations suitable for vaginal administration may be presented as pessaries, tampons, creams, gels, pastes, foams or spray formulations containing in addition to the active ingredient such carriers as are known in the art to be appropriate.","The formulations may be packaged in unit-dose or multi-dose containers, for example sealed ampoules and vials, and may be stored in a freeze-dried (lyophilized) condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example water, for injection immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions are prepared from sterile powders, granules and tablets of the kind previously described. Preferred unit dosage formulations are those containing a daily dose or unit daily sub-dose, as herein above recited, or an appropriate fraction thereof, of the active ingredient.","The invention further provides veterinary compositions comprising at least one active ingredient as above defined together with a veterinary carrier therefore. Veterinary carriers are materials useful for the purpose of administering the composition and may be solid, liquid or gaseous materials which are otherwise inert or acceptable in the veterinary art and are compatible with the active ingredient. These veterinary compositions may be administered parenterally, orally or by any other desired route.","Also provided are compositions comprising a compound of claim  in an amount to detectably inhibit Met kinase activity and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, adjuvant, or vehicle.","Combination Therapy","The compounds of Formulas Ia and Ib may be employed alone or in combination with other therapeutic agents for the treatment of a disease or disorder described herein, such as a hyperproliferative disorder (e.g., cancer). In certain embodiments, a compound of Formula Ia or Ib is combined in a pharmaceutical combination formulation, or dosing regimen as combination therapy, with a second compound that has anti-hyperproliferative properties or that is useful for treating a hyperproliferative disorder (e.g., cancer). The second compound of the pharmaceutical combination formulation or dosing regimen preferably has complementary activities to the compound of Formula Ia or Ib such that they do not adversely affect each other. Such compounds are suitably present in combination, in amounts that are effective for the purpose intended. In one embodiment, a composition of this invention comprises a compound of Formula Ia or Ib, or a stereoisomer, geometric isomer, tautomer, solvate, metabolite, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt or prodrug thereof, in combination with a chemotherapeutic agent such as described herein.","The combination therapy may be administered as a simultaneous or sequential regimen. When administered sequentially, the combination may be administered in two or more administrations. The combined administration includes coadministration, using separate formulations or a single pharmaceutical formulation, and consecutive administration in either order, wherein preferably there is a time period while both (or all) active agents simultaneously exert their biological activities.","Suitable dosages for any of the above coadministered agents are those presently used and may be lowered due to the combined action (synergy) of the newly identified agent and other chemotherapeutic agents or treatments.","The combination therapy may provide \u201csynergy\u201d and prove \u201csynergistic\u201d, i.e., the effect achieved when the active ingredients used together is greater than the sum of the effects that results from using the compounds separately. A synergistic effect may be attained when the active ingredients are: (1) co-formulated and administered or delivered simultaneously in a combined, unit dosage formulation; (2) delivered by alternation or in parallel as separate formulations; or (3) by some other regimen. When delivered in alternation therapy, a synergistic effect may be attained when the compounds are administered or delivered sequentially, e.g., by different injections in separate syringes. In general, during alternation therapy, an effective dosage of each active ingredient is administered sequentially, i.e., serially, whereas in combination therapy, effective dosages of two or more active ingredients are administered together.","In a particular embodiment of anti-cancer therapy, a compound of Formula Ia or Ib, or a stereoisomer, geometric isomer, tautomer, solvate, metabolite, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt or prodrug thereof, may be combined with other chemotherapeutic, hormonal or antibody agents such as those described herein, as well as combined with surgical therapy and radiotherapy. Combination therapies according to the present invention thus comprise the administration of at least one compound of Formula Ia or Ib, or a stereoisomer, geometric isomer, tautomer, solvate, metabolite, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt or prodrug thereof, and the use of at least one other cancer treatment method. The amounts of the compound(s) of Formula Ia or Ib and the other pharmaceutically active chemotherapeutic agent(s) and the relative timings of administration will be selected in order to achieve the desired combined therapeutic effect.","Also provided are compositions comprising a compound of Formula Ia or Ib in combination with an additional therapeutic agent selected from an anti-proliferative agent, an anti-inflammatory agent, an immunomodulatory agent, a neurotropic factor, an agent for treating cardiovascular disease, an agent for treating liver disease, an anti-viral agent, an agent for treating blood disorders, an agent for treating diabetes, or an agent for treating immunodeficiency disorders.","Metabolites of Compounds of Formulas Ia and Ib","Also falling within the scope of this invention are the in vivo metabolic products of heterobicyclic pyrazole compounds of Formulas Ia and Ib described herein. Such products may result for example from the oxidation, reduction, hydrolysis, amidation, deamidation, esterification, deesterification, enzymatic cleavage, and the like, of the administered compound. Accordingly, the invention includes metabolites of compounds of Formulas Ia and Ib, including compounds produced by a process comprising contacting a compound of this invention with a mammal for a period of time sufficient to yield a metabolic product thereof.","Metabolite products typically are identified by preparing a radiolabelled (e.g., C or H) isotope of a compound of the invention, administering it parenterally in a detectable dose (e.g., greater than about 0.5 mg\/kg) to an animal such as rat, mouse, guinea pig, monkey, or to man, allowing sufficient time for metabolism to occur (typically about 30 seconds to 30 hours) and isolating its conversion products from the urine, blood or other biological samples. These products are easily isolated since they are labeled (others are isolated by the use of antibodies capable of binding epitopes surviving in the metabolite). The metabolite structures are determined in conventional fashion, e.g., by MS, LC\/MS or NMR analysis. In general, analysis of metabolites is done in the same way as conventional drug metabolism studies well known to those skilled in the art. The metabolite products, so long as they are not otherwise found in vivo, are useful in diagnostic assays for therapeutic dosing of the compounds of the invention.","Prodrugs of Compounds of Formulas Ia and Ib","In addition to compounds of Formulas Ia and Ib, the invention also includes pharmaceutically acceptable prodrugs of such compounds. Prodrugs include compounds wherein an amino acid residue, or a polypeptide chain of two or more (e.g., two, three or four) amino acid residues, is covalently joined through an amide or ester bond to a free amino, hydroxy or carboxylic acid group of a compound of the present invention. The amino acid residues include but are not limited to the 20 naturally occurring amino acids commonly designated by three letter symbols and also includes phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, phosphotyrosine, 4-hydroxyproline, hydroxylysine, demosine, isodemosine, gamma-carboxyglutamate, hippuric acid, octahydroindole-2-carboxylic acid, statine, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid, penicillamine, ornithine, 3-methylhistidine, norvaline, beta-alanine, gamma-aminobutyric acid, cirtulline, homocysteine, homoserine, methyl-alanine, para-benzoylphenylalanine, phenylglycine, propargylglycine, sarcosine, methionine sulfone and tert-butylglycine.","Additional types of prodrugs are also encompassed. For instance, a free carboxyl group of a compound of Formula Ia or Ib can be derivatized as an amide or alkyl ester. As another example, compounds of this invention comprising free hydroxy groups may be derivatized as prodrugs by converting the hydroxy group into a group such as, but not limited to, a phosphate ester, hemisuccinate, dimethylaminoacetate, or phosphoryloxymethyloxycarbonyl group, as outlined in Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews, (1996) 19:115. Carbamate prodrugs of hydroxy and amino groups are also included, as are carbonate prodrugs, sulfonate esters and sulfate esters of hydroxy groups. Derivatization of hydroxy groups as (acyloxy)methyl and (acyloxy)ethyl ethers, wherein the acyl group may be an alkyl ester optionally substituted with groups including, but not limited to, ether, amine and carboxylic acid functionalities, or where the acyl group is an amino acid ester as described above, are also encompassed. Prodrugs of this type are described in J. Med. Chem., (1996), 39:10. More specific examples include replacement of the hydrogen atom of the alcohol group with a group such as (C-C)alkanoyloxymethyl, 1-((C-C)alkanoyloxy)ethyl, 1-methyl-1-((C-C)alkanoyloxy)ethyl, (C-C)alkoxycarbonyloxymethyl, N\u2014(C-C)alkoxycarbonylaminomethyl, succinoyl, (C-C)alkanoyl, \u03b1-amino(C-C)alkanoyl, arylacyl and \u03b1-aminoacyl, or \u03b1-aminoacyl-\u03b1-aminoacyl, where each \u03b1-aminoacyl group is independently selected from the naturally occurring L-amino acids, P(O)(OH), \u2014P(O)(O(C-C)alkyl)or glycosyl (the radical resulting from the removal of a hydroxyl group of the hemiacetal form of a carbohydrate).","Free amine groups of compounds of Formulas Ia and Ib can also be derivatized as amides, sulfonamides or phosphonamides. All of these moieties may incorporate groups including, but not limited to, ether, amine and carboxylic acid functionalities. For example, a prodrug can be formed by the replacement of a hydrogen atom in the amine group with a group such as R-carbonyl, RO-carbonyl, NRR\u2032-carbonyl, wherein R and R\u2032 are each independently (C-C)alkyl, (C-C)cycloalkyl, or benzyl, or R-carbonyl is a natural \u03b1-aminoacyl or natural \u03b1-aminoacyl-natural \u03b1-aminoacyl, \u2014C(OH)C(O)OY wherein Y is H, (C-C)alkyl or benzyl, \u2014C(OY)Ywherein Yis (C-C) alkyl and Yis (C-C)alkyl, carboxy(C-C)alkyl, amino(C-C)alkyl or mono-N\u2014 or di-N,N\u2014(C-C)alkylaminoalkyl, or \u2014C(Y)Ywherein Yis H or methyl and Yis mono-N\u2014 or di-N,N\u2014(C-C)alkylamino, morpholino, piperidin-1-yl or pyrrolidin-1-yl.","For additional examples of prodrug derivatives, see, for example, a) , edited by H.

A compound of Formula I, 50 pM cMet (His-tagged recombinant human Met (amino acids 974-end), expressed by baculovirus), and 5 \u03bcM ATP in assay buffer (25 mM MOPS, pH 7.4, 5 mM MgCl, 0.5 mM MnCl, 100 \u03bcM Sodium Orthovanadate, 0.01% Triton X-100, 1 mM DTT, final DMSO concentration 1% (v\/v)) are incubated on a 0.25 mg\/mL PGT coated plates for 20 minutes at room temperature. The reaction mixture is removed by washing and the phosphorylated polymer substrate is detected with 0.2 \u03bcg\/mL phosphotyrosine specific monoclonal antibody (PY20) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP). After the addition of 1M phosphoric acid to stop the development, the chromogenic substrate (TMB) color is quantitated by spectrophotometry at 450 nm. Certain compounds of this invention had IC's of less than 1 \u03bcM in this assay.","The cellular activity of the compounds of the present invention may be determined by the following procedure. MKN45 cells were plated in Costar 3904 96-well plates in growth media (RPMI, 10% FBS) at a density of 15000 cells\/well and incubated at 37\u00b0 C., 5% COovernight. The following day, one-tenth volume of a 10\u00d7 concentration of compounds was added to the wells in a 11-point dilution series. The dilutions series was composed of an initial 1:3 dilution in DMSO, followed by a 1:20 dilution in HBSS, for a final DMSO concentration on cells of 0.5%. Control wells were treated with 0.5% DMSO. The typical range of dilution was 5 \u03bcM to 0.3 nM, which was expanded to 25 \u03bcM depending on the potency of the compound. Once compound was added to the cells, plates were incubated for one hour at 37\u00b0 C., 5% CO. Plates were then washed in PBS, fixed in 4% formaldehyde and rehydrated with a 10% methanol solution. The plates were then blocked with Licor blocking buffer. The total phosphorylated cMet levels were measured by incubating with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against phosphorylated cMet followed by an anti-rabbit antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 680. Signal was normalized for differences in cell number by reference to the levels of the housekeeping protein GAPDH. Cells were incubated with a mouse monoclonal antibody against GAPDH followed by an anti-mouse antibody labeled with IRdye 800. Signal was measured on the Licor. The overall fluorescent signal from the Alexa Fluor 680 is normalized by dividing the value by the fluorescent value of the IRdye 800 signal. The fluorescent signal of the control wells was defined as 100% and the percent of inhibition of phosphorylated cMet was expressed as percent of control. ICvalues were determined from the percent of control data using a standard 4-parameter logistical model.","The foregoing description is considered as illustrative only of the principles of the invention.
