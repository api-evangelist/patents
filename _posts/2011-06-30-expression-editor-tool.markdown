title: Expression editor tool
abstract: An expression editor tool allows a user to build an expression or calculation with a rule that specifies an action programmed to occur during execution of a target application. The expression editor tool allows a user to define an action point definition that specifies an action point located in the target application logic instructions. The expression editor tool determines from the action point definition a dataset that is in-context at the action point, provides an expression definition interface to obtain selected data fields from the dataset, and a selected logical operator to connect the selected data fields used to construct a new expression. The expression editor tool provides an outcome selection interface used to obtain a selected outcome for the new expression in order to create a rule including the new expression and the selected outcome, and store the rule in the database linked to the action point definition.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATIONS","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND INFORMATION","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61\/470,265, filed Mar. 31, 2011, which is also incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","This disclosure relates to an application development tool. More specifically, this disclosure relates an expression editor tool that allows a user to build a rule that specifies an action programmed to occur during execution of a target application.","Explosive growth in digital processing technology has led to the ubiquitous presence of applications of every kind running on an immense spectrum of devices. Unfortunately, organizations do not have the application tools to effectively manage and\/or leverage existing or newly developed applications. Current application development and management tools do not allow users to modify or create different outcomes for target application without expensive software development efforts. An expression editor tool allows a user to build a rule that specifies an action that may occur during execution of a target application.","Application development and maintenance professionals spend considerable time and effort to analyze a target application before modifying the logic of the target application to produce a different action or outcome. In addition, available tools do not provide an easy way to confirm the context in which an action may occur and the variables available in the context, during execution of the target application so that a proper new action or outcome may be implemented efficiently.","A need exists to solve this problem and others previously experienced with application design.","An expression editor tool allows a user to build a rule that specifies an action that may occur during execution of a target application. The expression editor tool is implemented using a computer system (i.e., the expression editor system) that includes a computer memory operable to store the expression editor tool, and a database operable to store an action point definition that includes an action point identifier that specifies an action point located in application program code of the target application. The expression editor system includes a processor in communication with the memory and the database. The processor is operable to read the action point definition from the database, determine from the action point definition a dataset that is in-context at the action point in the application program code, and execute the expression editor tool. The expression editor tool is operable to display an expression definition interface that includes data source selectors for obtaining selected data fields from among the dataset, and an operator selector for obtaining a selected logical operator to connect the selected data fields. The expression editor tool is operable to construct a new expression from the selected data fields and the selected logical operator, display an outcome selection interface that includes an outcome selector for obtaining a selected outcome for the new expression, create a rule that includes the new expression and the selected outcome, and store the rule in the database linked to the action point definition.","Other systems, methods, features and advantages may be, or may become, apparent to one with skill in the art upon examination of the following figures and detailed description. It is intended that all such additional systems, methods, features and advantages be included within this description, be within the scope of the invention, and be protected by the following claims.","The expression editor tool allows a user to build a rule that specifies an action programmed to occur during execution of a target application. The expression editor tool is implemented using a computer system (i.e., the expression editor system) that includes a computer memory operable to store the expression editor tool, and a database operable to store an action point definition that includes an action point identifier that specifies an action point located in application program code of the target application. The expression editor system includes a processor in communication with the memory and the database. The processor is operable to read the action point definition from the database, determine from the action point definition a dataset that is in-context at the action point in the application program code, and execute the expression editor tool. The expression editor tool is operable to display an expression definition interface that includes data source selectors for obtaining selected data fields from among the dataset, and an operator selector for obtaining a selected logical operator to connect the selected data fields. The expression editor tool is operable to construct a new expression from the selected data fields and the selected logical operator, display an outcome selection interface that includes an outcome selector for obtaining a selected outcome for the new expression, create a rule that includes the new expression and the selected outcome, and store the rule in the database linked to the action point definition.","The expression editor tool allows a user, also referred to as a configurator, to build an expression in the context of an action point. The expression editor uses a set of navigable pages and a scoped search overlay (e.g., searchable fields) designed to allow the configurator to view and edit expressions and calculations. Expressions and calculations can be re-used and expressions and calculations may be viewed or edited in the context of a specific action point. An action point is a point in the logic of an application where an event occurs. An application developer inserts action points and definitions of action points into a data model, along with definitional metadata, for a target application that the developer intends to create or modify expressions for by using the expression editor. The developer may include an action point call in the target application code similar to a function call that specifies the action point unique identifier. Additionally, although the expressions and calculations are displayed the same to the configurator, expressions and calculations are created to either run on a server or on a browser, based on the related action point. An expression may be a named set of one-to-many conditions which evaluate to true or false. The configurator uses the expressions to drive application behaviors, for example, showing and hiding custom data fields on a page, creating events, or other outcomes. The configurator may assign the output of the expression as the output of the action point.","For a particular action point, a set of data is in context and defined in the database. Given a particular context, only certain fields of an application may be useable at certain action points, and the expression editor may constrain the user to a meaningful set of variables and guide the user logically through user enterable fields so that the user may define or modify expressions for a target application. Expressions are created using the expression editor. The expression is always in the context of a particular \u201caction point\u201d. An action point is a point in an application where one or more expressions are evaluated. Each action point has a set of data \u201cin context,\u201d which can be requested and then set up through a database. When an expression is created, the data that is in context for the action point is available. Logical operators defined in the expression depend on the \u2018field\u2019 value selected. For example, if the field is of \u201cbusiness data type\u201d number, then the available operators are greater than, less than, greater or equal to, less than or equal to, equal, and not equal. For the remaining business data types, the available operators are equal and not equal. An expression may be expressed as <Field><logical operator><value>. Using the expression editor, two or more of expressions may be combined into a \u201ccombined expression\u201d. A user may define expressions by selecting different data sources such as another expression or function. The expression editor defines functions as another form of evaluating data, such as count numbered of items in a list, does the list contains, and get sum of items in the list. When the user selects a function, the user then selects the list to evaluate and the selection replaces the value of <Field> in the structure of the expression: <Field><logical operator><value>.","Action points determine the variables that are available for use in an expression. An action point is a point in the application programming logic where an event occurs (e.g., where one or more expressions may be evaluated). Examples of action points include configuring how and\/or when a web page appears, how Graphical User Interface (GUI) elements appear, or some other action. Action points are points in the logic of the application where rules are evaluated. The rules may relate to anything, for example, the selection of a GUI element. Because action points are tightly coupled to the application, action points may not be created in the console of the expression editor in some implementations.","During coding, the developer may specify an action point that is invoked, for example by the click of a button on a particular user interface screen. The action point is specified by a unique identifier, which is a primary key for the action point in the database. Each unique identifier identifies a link between a point in the programming logic (code) and an action point. For example, the user may want to invoke action point \u2018validation action point\u2019 that is linked to a corresponding unique action point identifier and action point record with the action point description \u2018validation action point\u2019 in the database, along with corresponding metadata, (e.g., name, description, data in context, as well as other information about the action point). An action point call appears in the code similar to a function call that specifies the action point unique identifier.","The database definition of an action point is referred to as an extension point in the action point expression framework (AEF) database. In order to define the data available to the user, the expression editor provides an extension point input table (e.g., EXTPT_INPT) that allows the user to define an extension point, a data item for each of the application fields and data objects linked to the action point (expression). The EXTPT_INPT table associates action points to data items. The data item column of the EXTPT_INPT table is a reference to a data item table. The data item table stores data about all the data objects and fields in the application of interest. While the expression editor provides separate tables for associating data items to fields, the data item table stores all the raw unassociated data objects and fields.","In order to link an expression to an action point a rule is defined for the action point. A rule defines one or more outcomes that may happen when an expression valuates to true or false. For example, possible outcomes resulting from applying a rule include hiding a field, sending an email, invoking another action point, showing an error message, or populating a field.","The expression editor provides an \u2018edit existing rule\u2014rule details\u2019 page that includes a summary of the expression incorporating the rule and the outcomes for the expression. The expression editor may present the rule summary to the user as read only. The rule summary shows a combination of the expression and the outcomes for the expression when the rule valuates to true. The expression section shows the expression, and when a user selects the expression (e.g., a hyperlink of the expression name) the expression editor navigates the user to the \u2018select existing\u2019 page and presents the expression to the user to edit.","The outcomes may evaluate to true or false (Boolean). A \u2018page action point\u2019 may include an outcome, one per page, executed when the corresponding application page is loaded. A \u2018show, hide, enable, and disable\u2019 action point may be called before a page is displayed, in order to configure the page, and the action point may have four possible outcome types, including show, hide, enable, and disable a page. A business service action point located in the application code may retrieve a result of a calculation, display an error message, invoke another action point, populate a field, send email, or perform a page navigation.","The expression editor provides an \u2018Add Outcome\u2019 page for a user to define outcomes for action points. Outcome types may be presented in a drop down selectable menu, based on the type of action point (e.g., page vs. business). The expression editor populates the configuration section of the action point page for an action point based on the outcome type corresponding to the action point.","The expression editor uses an EXPRSN table to store expressions, and all the information about the expression, while the actual expression may be stored in the T_EXPRSN_STMNT field as the actual syntax of the expression. The expression editor uses local tables to store information exposed to the user in the configuration console based on a local ID (e.g., English, US, French, FR), so that the expression editor displays the names of action points according to the local ID.","A calculation is a special case of an expression in which the conditions evaluate to a numeric value. The configurator normally uses calculations within the context of an expression to simplify the creation of a complex expression. For example, a calculation such as Total Financials for Line might add up specific field values related to financials for a line. The calculations may contain other calculations, but may not contain expressions. The configurator uses the output of a calculation in an expression. In some implementations, the configurator assigns the output of a calculation as the output of an action point.","The complexity of an expression can range from very simple (e.g., If Field \u2018A\u2019>0) to very complex. The complexity of an expression can include calculations, numerous expressions, and conditions. In some cases, setting the order of the evaluation is important. The expression editor is designed to allow the configurator to support the full range of these requirements. The expression editor includes four pages that the user may navigate through in a wizard-like fashion or move around in the order that the pages are selected. The expression editor does not have to utilize all of the pages unless otherwise required by the user.","The fields, expressions, calculations and functions which are made available to a configurator in the edit or addition of an expression are limited to those fields that are considered available in \u201ccontext\u201d for that action point.","For a server side action point, data may be considered in context from three sources. The first source of context is the definition of the action point in the console database, and includes zero to many data items. Second, a data item or field may be considered in context because the data item or field was added to context by the configurator through the use of actions and outcomes. Finally, the context includes custom fields for which the context data from the two previous sources includes the key to the logical table. The context information is stored in the DATAITEM_TBL.","The \u201ccontext\u201d of a page (browser side) action point includes all of the standard fields associated with the page through the PAGE_CLS_CTRL table and all of the custom fields associated to display groups through the DSPLY_GRP_DATAITEM table. Date type fields may be unavailable to use in an expression created in the context of a page action point, even if the date is in context. Similarly, in one implementation, no calculations may be used in expressions for page action points.","To support more complicated expressions, the expression editor allows the configurator to build an expression list as the configurator traverses through the expression pages. The expression list displays as a portlet on the right for the \u2018select existing expressions\u2019 page, \u2018define calculations\u2019 page and Single Expression page. When the configurator has completed the expression list, the configurator uses the Combine Expressions page to name the expression list, order items on the expression list and save the expression list to the database. The configurator may also modify the order of the expression list and control the order of operation by using the Combine Expressions page. As mentioned previously, the configuration items made available to the configurator are based on the action point context.","The expression editor includes four pages including the \u2018select existing\u2019 page, the \u2018define calculations\u2019 page, the \u2018define single expressions\u2019 page, and the \u2018combine expressions\u2019 page. The \u2018select existing\u2019 page includes a scoped search of existing expressions, allowing the user to select one or more for inclusion. For all action points except page type, the \u2018select existing\u2019 page includes a scoped search of calculations, allowing the user to navigate to the \u2018define calculations\u2019 page to modify an existing calculation. The \u2018define calculations\u2019 page allows the user to create new calculations, and load the calculations into the expression editor in order to edit an existing calculation. The \u2018define calculations\u2019 page does not apply to page type (browser) action points. The \u2018define single expressions\u2019 page allows the user to create a new single expression. The expression may be named and saved as a re-usable expression or simply included in the expression list. The \u2018define single expressions\u2019 page contains an area for defining the left side of an expression, a combo box to select the logical operator, and another area for defining the right side of an expression. The \u2018define single expressions\u2019 page also contains an optional section to allow the configurator to name of the expression. A single expression contains one and only one logical operator. The right and left side of the expression can be made up of only one item, and thus does not include arithmetic operations. The configurator may include a calculation in the expression for the purpose of including arithmetic operations. Also, the \u2018define single expressions\u2019 page may be used to edit unnamed expressions of an expression the configurator is creating. The \u2018combine expressions\u2019 page applies only to expressions made up of more than one expression combined with logical operators. In order to control the order of operation, and remove selected expressions, the \u2018combine expressions\u2019 page allows the user to modify the properties of the expressions of a combination of expressions and the order of the expressions, and group (or ungroup) the expressions. The configurator may use links to allow the user to navigate to expressions to edit. Once the configurator completes the edits of an expression, the expression editor persists the expression to the database.","For the expression editor pages, wherever a calculation or expression is displayed, the calculation or expression is shown with the expression display name. The expression editor may use hover text to display the calculation or expression detail including detail at the field level. For example, the expression list may display \u201cIs Claim Workers Comp\u201d which is an expression display name. The hover text for that item might be \u201cClaim. Claim Loss State=\u2018Nevada\u2019\u201d. In another example, a calculation may be displayed on the grid as Calculation 1 on one line and Calculation 2 on a second line of the grid. The expression editor pages may display identically for browser-side and server-side expressions and calculations, except that functions may not be available for browser-side expressions or calculations. The expression editor may indicate to the configurator when functions are a valid data source, based on context information.","When the configurator navigates to an expression editor page to edit an existing expression, and more than one row is displayed in the expression list, the expression editor loads with the \u2018name selected list\u2019 page. The expression editor loads the \u2018single expression page, and prompts the user with a \u2018dirty flag\u2019 warning message if appropriate, when only one line is displayed in the expression list.","The expression is one of the two unique configuration items in which multiple \u201cversions\u201d of the same item may be stored in the database simultaneously. The EXPRSN_LCL table stores multiple versions of the same item using a primary key D_BEG in the EXPRSN_LCL table. The EXPRSN_LCL table stores the actual expression or calculation. Modifications to the data elements related to an expression or calculation (i.e., expression metadata) stored in the EXPRSN table may not be \u201cversioned.\u201d","When the configurator modifies a calculation or expression, the configurator may modify the \u2018effective date\u2019 field in order to create a new \u201cversion\u201d of the item. The \u2018effective date\u2019 may not be modified to before the current date or after the \u2018expiration date\u2019. If the \u2018effective date\u2019 is modified, the previous \u201cversion\u201d of the expression or calculation expires. The date used by the expression editor is set to one day less than the \u2018effective date\u2019 of the new item so that the expression editor prevents overlaps between the \u201cversions\u201d.","The configurator may modify an expression, calculation, the description and\/or display name of an expression or calculation. If the configurator does not modify the \u2018effective date\u2019 of the modification, the expression editor overlays the previous values of the expression, calculation, description and\/or display name with the new modified values, and the expression editor may not make the previous values accessible.","In another example, the configurator may capture the previous values for an expression, calculation, display name, and description, and modify the \u2018effective date\u2019, and because the \u2018effective date\u2019 value is part of the primary key of the EXPRSN_LCL table, the expression editor creates a new database record for the newly entered data, and causes the existing row (database record) for the expression to expire. Thus, the database stores the previous expression, calculation, display name, and description values reusing the same N_EXPRSN_ID with a different \u2018effective date\u2019 value.","The expression editor allows the configurator to create multiple \u201cversions\u201d of an expression and\/or a calculation in the future. For example, the configurator may create a database record in the EXPRSN_LCL table using dates Mar. 1, 2010 to Jun. 1, 2010 and another record using Jun. 2, 2010 to \u2018max\u2019 date, as long as the effective dates otherwise follow other stated business rules.","The expression editor includes rules to determine when to display a \u2018dirty flag\u2019 warning. The \u2018dirty flag\u2019 warning is a status indicator that indicates to the configurator that the expression editor has pending changes (unpersisted) that have not been persisted to the database and the user may be about to perform an operation that may cause those unpersisted changes to be lost. The rules to determine when to display a \u2018dirty flag\u2019 warning may be more complicated for the expression editor to perform. For example, because the four pages of the expression editor may function as an application wizard, standard architecture tools may be inadequate to assist in making the \u2018dirty flag\u2019 warning determination. The expression editor may include programming logic coded to work in coordination with various database architecture tools that manage the commit and rollback functions (i.e., functions that identify persisted and unpersisted data), so that the expression editor may properly determine when to set the status of a page to \u201cdirty\u201d and issue a \u2018dirty flag\u2019 warning.","The expression editor uses the term \u201cdirty\u201d to identify a new expression that has not been added to database yet, when one of the following conditions is met: 1) an item is added to the \u2018selected list\u2019; and 2) the page the user is on is dirty. The expression editor uses the term \u201cdirty\u201d to identify an existing expression, when one of the following conditions is met: 1) the combine expressions page is dirty; and 2) the page the user on is dirty. The expression editor prompts the user with the dirty warning message when the user clicks on and\/or selects the \u2018cancel\u2019 button, links to another expression from the \u2018combine expressions\u2019 page, \u2018any bread crumb\u2019, \u2018secondary navigation on left\u2019, or \u2018primary navigation on top\u2019 and one of the following conditions is met: A) adding a \u201cnew\u201d expression which has not been persisted to the database, and the page is dirty as defined below or any items (e.g., expressions) have been added to the selected list or B) editing an existing expression, and the page is dirty as defined below, an item has been added or removed from the selected list, or a modification has to the existing expression.","In one implementation, if both a single page is dirty and the expression editor is in a dirty state, then clearing the page level dirty flag may also clear the expression editor dirty flag. For example, if the user is on the \u2018define calculations\u2019 page of the expression editor, and the \u2018define calculations\u2019 page is dirty and the expression editor is also dirty because the user added 2 more expressions to the list, then if the user clicks the breadcrumb, the user is presented with a dirty flag. If the user clicks okay, both page level changes and expression editor changes may be discarded and\/or lost.","An expression editor page may be defined as dirty when a user is on the \u2018select existing\u2019 expression page, and a search result item has been checked but the \u201cAdd To List\u201d has not been clicked (selected), or when the user is on the \u2018define calculations\u2019 page and at least one field on the \u2018define calculations\u2019 page has been modified (e.g., including adding or removing items through the overlay). The \u201cDrag and Drop\u201d reordering feature of the expression editor may not create a dirty flag because drag-and-drop reordering is persisted separately to the database on the drop. The \u2018Define Single Expression\u2019 page may be defined as dirty when at least one field on the page has been modified through user interaction. The \u2018combine expressions\u2019 page may be defined as dirty when any expression has been added or removed from the \u2018selected list\u2019 on the page, or when at least one field on the page has been modified through user interaction. Selecting the \u2018complete\u2019 button does not create a dirty warning message.","Selecting the \u2018select existing\u2019 button of the expression editor, may cause a dirty flag to be created, if an expression is selected and the expression editor does not list any other expressions in the \u2018selected list\u2019, the expression editor returns the listed expression to the calling page. If one or more expressions are selected, and\/or at least one other expression exists in the Selected List, the expression editor validates that the Combine Expressions data is complete. The expression editor otherwise provides errors and\/or saves the data as appropriate. If the expression editor determines that the data is valid, the expression editor returns the expression to the calling page. If the expression editor determines that the Define Calculation page is dirty, the expression editor validates and saves the data on the page. If no expressions are in the expression list, the expression editor provides a warning indicating that no expression has been selected. If the expression editor shows an expression in the Selected List, the expression editor returns that expression to the calling page. If the more than one expression is in the Selected List, the expression editor validates that the Combined Expressions data is complete. The expression editor otherwise provides errors and\/or saves the data as appropriate. If the expression editor determines that the expression data is valid, the expression editor returns that expression to the calling page. If the expression editor determines that the Define Single Expression page is dirty, the expression editor validates and saves the data on the page. If the expression editor shows no other expressions in the Selected List, the expression editor returns that expression to the calling page. If the expression editor shows at least one other expression in the Selected List, the expression editor adds the expression to the Selected List and validates that the Combined Expressions data is complete. The expression editor otherwise provides errors and\/or saves the data as appropriate. If the expression is valid, the expression editor returns that expression to the calling page. If the expression is dirty, the expression editor validates whether the data is complete, and provides errors and\/or saves the data as appropriate. If the expression is valid, the expression editor returns that expression to the calling page. Selecting the \u2018Continue\u2019 is configurable to either create or never create a dirty warning message. Selecting the Select Existing adds any selected expressions (check box is checked) to the Selected List. If the Define Calculation page is dirty, the expression editor validates and saves that calculation. If the Define Single Expression page is dirty, the expression editor validates and saves that calculation, and adds the expression to the Expression list if the expression has not already been added. Any of the 4 links to the expression editor pages: If the user clicks on the same page the user is already on (except for Combine Expressions), the expression editor may provide a dirty flag if that page is dirty as defined. If the user selects\/clicks okay, the expression editor functions as follows for each page: The Select Existing, Define Calculation page may load as if for first time (not populated). The Define Single Expression may load with the page not populated, even if the first time loaded was editing a specific expression. Selecting the combine expressions page may not give a dirty flag, and the combine expressions page may load with all the fields unchanged. The data in the page may always be persisted. If the user clicks on a different page (except for Combine Expressions) the expression editor provides a dirty flag if that page is dirty as defined on the left for each page. The expression editor includes four pages including the \u2018select existing\u2019 page, the \u2018define calculations\u2019 page, the \u2018define single expressions\u2019 page, and the \u2018combine expressions\u2019 page that may cause dirty flag issues to arise during the user interactions for which the expression editor may use various techniques to address.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0088","num":"0087"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102","114","116","100","114","116","110","108"]},"The expression editor allows the user to navigate between user selectable pages to create a new expression, and select and modify an existing expression. The combine expressions link is enabled when more than one selected expressions in the expression list. The expression editor user interface includes \u2018cancel\u2019 button , \u2018continue\u2019 button  and \u2018complete\u2019 button  function the same on each page, unless otherwise indicated by the expression editor . The complete button  validates that the configuration of an expression is complete. If the expression configuration is complete, the expression editor persists any un-persisted data and returns to the calling page with the expression. If an expression includes more than one item in the selected expression list , then the user may use the \u2018combine expressions\u2019 page to populate the expression property fields before the new expression is added to the repository of existing expressions. If a user clicks the \u2018complete\u2019 button  without first naming the expression, then the expression editor may prompt the user with the following error message, \u201cPlease provide a name for the expression.\u201d Similarly, if the user clicks the \u2018complete\u2019 button  when no item is listed in the expression list, the expression editor may prompt the user with the following error message, \u201cPlease either select at least one expression or click Cancel.\u201d If only one expression is displayed in the selected expression list and the expression is a named expression, then the expression editor returns the expression to the calling page. The \u2018continue\u2019 button navigates to the next enabled page within the expression editor, and cause the expression editor to persist un-persisted data. The \u2018cancel\u2019 button causes the expression editor to navigate back to the page that called the expression editor, and causes the expression editor to not persist un-persisted data, but does not cause the expression editor to roll back data that has already been saved. The expression list portal displays the named expressions and \u201csnippets\u201d (i.e., non-named single expressions) that have been selected for inclusion in the expression. The expression list portal also displays the logical operator associated with each expression. The expression list may be read-only and not include links to other expressions. A separate database table may be used in the configuration console database to support the functionality of expression list portal.

The action point causes the architecture to execute a specific piece of code which may be described as an activity, although the expression editor console may not display the terminology. Activities available to the configurator include those which are part of the architecture or the application. Data describing the input and output criteria of the activity is stored in the expression editor console database but may not be used in the actual execution of the activity items. Additional activities may be made available to the configurator, by configuring code from an alternative using application. The configuration architecture has a set of activities that is available for use by the configurator. The action\/outcome page is designed specifically to support these architecture activities. Although there is some metadata included to describe each architecture activity, the action page may not load from the data. Instead, the page may be coded to support those items which have been made available by the architecture. An outcome is defined as an \u201cactivity\u201d which is configured to run as the result of the evaluation of an expression. An outcome is considered part of a rule (which includes an expression and outcomes). An action is defined as an \u201cactivity\u201d which is configured to run in the action point and is not dependent on the evaluation of an expression. The action\/outcome page always loads as part of a specific action point. Both outcomes and actions are stored in the EXTPT_ACTN table. Outcomes also have data in the EXTPT_ACTN_ACTY table. The database defines 5 different types of action\/outcomes which are described in the Activity Type Info tab. The definitions of the action\/outcomes describe functionality offered by the architecture and reflect the database design. The console may abstract the information to create one activity list which may be offered to the user. Behind the scenes, the console logic may utilize the APIs to appropriately persist the configuration settings to the database. The Activity List tab includes the activity list. Additionally, there is a wireframe to illustrate how the action\/outcome page may load for each of these selections. The fields made available to a configurator in the configuration of input fields are limited to those which are considered available in \u201ccontext\u201d for that action point. There expression editor employs six architecture variables that are available for use as input for configuration (both server side and page action points), including Business Function (ArchBusinessFunction), Client IP Address (ArchClientIPAddress), Current Date and Time (ArchCurrentDateTime), Locale ID (ArchLocaleId), Locale ID (ArchUILocaleId) and User Name (ArchUserName). One or more of the six architecture variables of the expression editor may be exposed to the configurator. For a server side action point, data may be considered in context from three sources. The first source is the definition of the action point in the expression editor console database and may include zero to many data items. Second, a data item or field may be considered in context because the data item or field was added to context by the configurator through the use of actions and outcomes. Finally, all of the custom fields for which the context data for the action point includes the key to the logical table. The correlation between the data items and the logical tables for which the data items contain the key is in the DATAITEM_TBL table. (a variable data type may be utilized to determine which logical tables are supported by that data item). The \u201ccontext\u201d of a page (browser side) action point includes standard fields associated to the page through the PAGE_CLS_CTRL table and all of the custom fields associated to display groups through the DSPLY_GRP_DATAITEM table. Several of the available action\/outcomes return a value. If the data type of the action\/outcomes value matches the action point data type, the data type may be automatically assigned to the action point output and the assignment may function based on the action point definition. If the action point output is one item (EXECONE), the value may override any previous value to which the action point output may have been set. If the action point output is many items (EXECMANY), the expression editor may append the action\/outcome output to the list. Note that the output cannot be assigned to any of the architecture variables. In some cases, the configurator may need to temporarily capture the output of an action\/outcome. For example, if the output is needed as the input to another action\/outcome. The functionality is available for some of the action\/outcomes as indicated in the wireframes. If an output field is assigned, the output of that action\/outcome, may not be passed automatically to the output of the action point even if the data type matches. Instead, the data item to which the action\/outcome output has been assigned may be considered as part of the \u201ccontext\u201d of the action point. The expression editor console may keep knowledge of the \u201ccontext\u201d and display the \u201ccontext\u201d to the configurator. However, the expression editor may not track whether the configurator uses the data in a step which precedes the step which added data item. For example, if the data is added to context in the second action in the action point, but the first action in the action point is edited later to use the data, the configurator may not receive an error or warning, depending on a configurable option to disable providing a warning. The configurator may create a variable for use as output of activities and actions. Fields made available to the configurator for configuration may be limited to those in context as defined above, and may also be limited by the data type of the field.

An expression  (e.g., a new expressions , and an existing expressions ) specifies an action  (e.g., a new action , and an existing action ) that may occur during execution of a target application . A rule (e.g., , , ) is the combination of an expression (e.g., , , ) and outcomes (e.g., , , ) of the rule. The expression editor system  includes a computer memory (e.g., ) operable to store an expression editor tool , at least one database ,  operable to store an action point definition (e.g., , , ) that includes an action point identifier that specifies an action point  located in a target application program segment of code , and a processor  in communication with the memory  and the database , . The processor  of the expression editor system  is operable to read the action point definition (e.g., , , ) from the database , , and determine from the action point definition (e.g., , , ) a dataset  that is in-context at the action point  in the application program code . The processor  is further operable to execute, from the computer memory , the expression editor tool , which when executed is operable to obtain data field selections from the dataset that is in-context at the action point in the application program code. The expression editor tool  includes four pages including the \u2018select existing\u2019  page, the \u2018define calculations\u2019  page, the \u2018define single expressions\u2019  page, and the \u2018combine expressions\u2019  page that may cause dirty flag  issues to arise during the user interactions for which the expression editor tool  may use various techniques to address. The scoped search  provided by the expression editor allows the user  to search for existing expressions for which the fields are in context. The expression editor tool  is operable to graphically build an expression (e.g., , , ) including the data field selections, graphically build an outcome that executes depending on the evaluation of the expression, link the outcome (e.g., , , ) and the expression to form an action point rule (e.g., , , ) for the action point (e.g., , , ), and save the action point rule in the database ,  for execution when the application program code  reaches the action point .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0174","num":"0173"},"figref":"FIG. 48","b":["4802","4804","4806","4808","4810","4812","4814","4816","4818","4820"]},"Table 13 illustrates a list of example expression editor tables.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0176","num":"0175"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00013","num":"00013"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"441pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 13"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"List of example expression editor tables"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"7"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"112pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"84pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"84pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Physical",{},"Logical",{},{},{},{}]},{"entry":["Table",{},"Table","Subject","RefData","Add",{}]},{"entry":["Name","Table Comment","Name","Area","Category","Records?","Family"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"7","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["ACTN_TYP","This table defines the","Action","Logic","AEFActionTypes","N","AEF"]},{"entry":[{},"different types of","Type","Engine",{},{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"\u201cactions\u201d that can",{},{},{},{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"occur at extension",{},{},{},{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"points.

A processor may be implemented as a controller, microprocessor, microcontroller, application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), discrete logic, or a combination of other types of circuits or logic. Similarly, memories may be DRAM, SRAM, Flash, or other types of memory. Parameters (e.g., conditions and thresholds) and other data structures may be separately stored and managed, may be incorporated into a single memory or database, or may be logically and physically organized in many different ways. Programs and instructions may be parts of a single program, separate programs, implemented in libraries such as Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs), or distributed across several memories and processors.","While various embodiments of the invention have been described, it may be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that many more embodiments and implementations are possible within the scope of the invention.
