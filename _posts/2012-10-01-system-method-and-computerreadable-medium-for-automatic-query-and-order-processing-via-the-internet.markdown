{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This application is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 12\/505,109 filed Jul. 17, 2009, entitled SYSTEM, METHOD, AND COMPUTER-READABLE MEDIUM FOR AUTOMATIC QUERY AND ORDER PROCESSING VIA THE INTERNET, now issued U.S. Pat. No. 8,280,780, issued on Oct. 2, 2012, which is incorporated herein in its entirety.","The present invention is generally related to network technologies and, more particularly, to mechanisms for processing product orders via network systems.","Various contemporary mechanisms exist that allow users to connect with companies via the Internet. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,125,391 to Meltzer, et al., describes a system that allows businesses to connect with potential customers. In the described system, XML based documents or schemas describe how two or more entities, such as a manufacturer and a supplier, communicate to initiate and conclude certain transactions for goods and\/or services. A Business Information Document (BID) provides a common format that describes how the parties will communicate. Each of the entities interested in communicating via the Internet must adhere to the BID to ensure compliance with a process that must be agreed to ahead of time.","Microsoft Corporation has made significant investments for many years on business-to-business e-commerce applications. For example, Microsoft has defined an Application Integration Framework (AIF) that defines how data is exchanged. Also, in a related field, Microsoft has produced systems and methods for the design of electronic forms that pertain to visual elements and the creation of hierarchical schemas in creation of forms. However, no current applications exist that pertain to the interaction of remote websites and an application that is able to process data that has been entered into a form.","Various other patents, patent applications, and white papers relating to buyers and sellers and communications therebetween exist. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,976,006 to Verma, et al., describes a method and apparatus designed to facilitate price comparison via a buyer and that is presented to the buyer via the World Wide Web. U.S. Pat. No. 5,592,375 to Salmon, et al., describes a computer-implemented system of displaying products to potential sellers via the World Wide Web thereby allowing the user to select and review the product description. U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2007\/0130044 to Rowan, et al., describes a system that takes in a buyer's requirements and immediately constructs options specific to the buyer's needs based on broader inputs from any number of sellers. Any of these options can then be purchased immediately.","While these documents address connecting buyers with sellers, none of the cited references address communications between a buyer and seller once the seller has sent responses to the buyer or address a process whereby a user can enter values and wherein an item can be automatically ordered if the results from the seller fall within the values.","Therefore, what is needed is a mechanism that overcomes the described problems and limitations.","The present invention provides a system, method, and computer readable medium that provide mechanisms to enable a user to interact with numerous product suppliers to determine which supplier to utilize for ordering a product based on various parameters, and in situations where product query results are incomplete. A user may interact with one or more suppliers using similar or different parameters for each supplier within the same application without having to switch to another external application. Results are provided in a visually appealing and logical manner and automate the ordering of an item if that item is found at a particular supplier within predefined thresholds specified by the user. In this manner, orders may be submitted at the moment order thresholds are met, and decisions may be made automatically by one or more of the system, the user, or on an interaction by the user and another individual.","In one embodiment of the disclosure, a method of processing product queries in a network system is provided. The method includes providing a graphical user interface at a client data processing system, entering, by a user of the client data processing system, parameters associated with a product desired to be ordered by the user in the graphical user interface, issuing, by the client data processing system, a query to a plurality of data processing systems of respective product suppliers, wherein the query is derived from the parameters entered by the user, receiving, by the client data processing system, results of the query issued by the plurality of supplier data processing systems, and organizing, by the client data processing system, the results according to results satisfying the parameters.","In a further embodiment of the disclosure, a computer-readable medium having computer-executable instructions for execution by a processing system, the computer-executable instructions for processing product queries in a network system, is provided. The instructions, when executed by the processing system, cause the processing system to provide a graphical user interface at a client data processing system, receive parameters associated with a product desired to be ordered by a user in the graphical user interface, wherein at least one or more of the parameters includes a respective equality condition associated therewith, issue, by the client data processing system, a query to a plurality of data processing systems of respective product suppliers, wherein the query is derived from the parameters, receive, by the client data processing system, results of the query issued by the plurality of supplier data processing systems, and organize, by the client data processing system, the results according to results satisfying the parameters.","In a further embodiment of the disclosure, a system for processing product queries is provided. The system includes a network system, a client data processing system communicatively coupled with the network system, and a plurality of product supplier data processing system communicatively coupled with the network system. The client data processing system provides a graphical user interface for entry of parameters associated with a product desired to be ordered, wherein at least one or more of the parameters includes a respective equality condition associated therewith. The client data processing system issues a query to the plurality of product supplier data processing systems that is derived from the parameters entered, receives results of the query issued by the plurality of supplier data processing systems, and organizes the results according to results satisfying the parameters.","It is to be understood that the following disclosure provides many different embodiments or examples for implementing different features of various embodiments. Specific examples of components and arrangements are described below to simplify the present disclosure. These are, of course, merely examples and are not intended to be limiting.","Various developments have been made on business-to-business e-commerce applications. An Application Integration Framework (AIF) has been introduced that defines how data is exchanged and formatted in XML. The AIF provides a format for exchanging data both internally within an organization, as well as externally with other entities. To facilitate integration with external systems, it has been recommended to utilize a Web Service. AIF includes support for Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) Web services that allow Microsoft Dynamics AX to exchange data with external systems. Current applications make integration between different entities easier but, however, do not assist a user in deeper integration once an initial communication has taken place. Further, the AIF must be adopted by all participants.","In accordance with disclosed embodiments, mechanisms are provided that facilitate querying for specific data from a user's input and processes surrounding the received results. The processes of the disclosed embodiments allow for easy communication with a remote entity to gather more details about missing data in the results, or to automatically place an order if one or more results fall within a predetermined range as described more fully hereinbelow.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","100","102","100","102"]},"A client data processing system , such as a mobile laptop device , a personal desktop computer , a cellular device , or any other suitable data processing system adapted to communicatively interface with network , may be utilized for implementations of disclosed embodiments.

As such, those fields may be left empty and all results would be provided to the user in an appropriate format to enable the user to make an informed decision.","The user may select the submit button  displayed in the advanced search window. Responsive thereto, the advanced search window may close and the contents of the individual textboxes are then used for the different parameters of the outgoing query message. The user may select the clear button  displayed in the advanced search window to clear all of the text input fields and may select the cancel button  displayed in the advanced search window to close out the search window and return to the previous window of the application.","Once a user submits the query, the application generates a query message. The query message is internal to the application and, in one embodiment, will not be altered by the user. The generated query message will utilize the Web Services that interact with the application according to disclosed embodiments. In another embodiment, users may alter the query message using available Web Services that allow the user to call specific objects on the Web Service with parameters and data provided by the user.","Implementations of disclosed embodiments may utilize knowledge of existing Web Services. Web services are based on standard protocols that serve to ensure that any Web service can be accessed by any client program, no matter what language the program is written in and no matter what platform the application is running on. Thus, for example, a client program written in Java may access and use a Web service written in VB.NET and that is deployed on a Windows server just as easily as a Windows program can use a Web service written in Java and running on a Linux Web server. Utilizing Web Services, a company may create and deploy on a server a set of services that any client can utilize to connect their client application with the server application. Since the Web Service uses a standard protocol, interworking the two separate applications is expedited. The published Web Services of each of the connecting companies will be utilized and interworking will be needed. The details of interworking with Web Services of various companies are known and well documented and thus will not be described in detail herein.","For the purposes of providing an example, the Amazon Web Service (version 4.0) will be used to describe certain functions. The Amazon Web Service is a widely utilized Web Service to query remote databases and is reflective of the published Web Services available today. In developing the client code to query the Amazon web site, various applications may be used that will interwork with the server Application Programming Interface (API). As an example, Microsoft's Visual Studio.NET is used. Once a new Web application is created, a Web reference to Amazon Web Services is added, and the address of the Web Services Description Language (WSDL) for the Amazon service is entered. Utilizing the GUI windows described hereinabove with reference to  to receive input from the user, the service to query the Amazon database is \u201cconnected\u201d to the submit button, e.g., button  of  or button  of , of the respective GUI window such that certain actions occur when the button is selected, e.g., \u201cclicked-on\u201d or otherwise accessed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["600","600","602"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"161pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 1"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Parameter","Description"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["SearchIndex","The Amazon store from which products are desired."]},{"entry":[{},"The list of available SearchIndex values, listed"]},{"entry":[{},"by locale, can be found on the search index"]},{"entry":[{},"values page."]},{"entry":["Keywords","Used to refine the searched item based on"]},{"entry":[{},"specific words or phrases.

For example, the user may input a query item, desired price, and a desired quantity. The application that provides the GUI window then formulates a query based on the user input (step ). The application then submits the generated query to one or more remote sites, e.g., vendor servers (steps  and ). The application then awaits a response from the queried servers (steps  and ). The application then builds a response from the results received from the queried vendor servers (step ). The response is then returned to the client application for display to the user (step ).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":["FIG. 8A","FIG. 5"],"b":["800","800","802","800","400","400","402","500","500"]},"Upon reception of the results from the remote applications, the results are sorted and displayed to the user. The results window  may include a query pane  that displays characteristics of the query, e.g., an item description , a desired quantity , and a desired price . Further, a response table  displays results of the query. In the illustrative example, the results table includes a supplier column , an item description column , a quantity on hand column , a price column , and a shipping terms column .","In accordance with an embodiment, the results display is provided such that the closest matching results are displayed at the top of the response table . For example, if the user searched for a large quantity of a particular item and requires the desired items in a certain amount of time (e.g., 5 days), the response table  displayed to the user may place the closest matching results at the top of the table, followed by the results that next matched the query in descending order.","When searching remote inventories, the search application may prioritize the order in which an item can be found. For instance, the data in the item description column  is first searched. If the particular item is found, then the application may attempt to match a second criteria, for instance, the \u201cDetails\u201d data, followed then by a third criteria, for instance, \u201cColor\u201d. This process may continue to attempt to find as close a match, and as many matches, as possible.","When returning results from a query, the data returned is formatted into the results table  which is logically ordered and visually appealing to the user. This allows the user to obtain a quick understanding of the results from the previously submitted query. Each of the columns of the results table  in the result window  may be sorted. For instance, the user may select a heading of an individual column, and the selected column may be sorted in ascending order. If the user selects the heading of the column again, the results may be displayed in a descending order of the selected column.","Assuming that exact matches will at times not be found, the results that most closely match the search string are displayed to the user. For instance, if the \u201cItem Description\u201d and \u201cPrice\u201d are matched, but the \u201cQuantity on Hand\u201d data is not, the results table  may contain the result with the matched columns and the closest approximation of the quantity available from the inventory for that item.","The sorting is performed through the values sent via the Web Service. For example, if the \u201cItemSearch\u201d object is used in a Web Service, the \u201cSort\u201d field of that object can be set to order the sorting of the resulting data returned from the Web Service call.","In accordance with disclosed embodiments, there are many possible parameters for sorting results according to what the user is searching for. For example, assume the user is searching for video games. Table 2 depicts possible sorting values that may be set for sorting the results of the query.
