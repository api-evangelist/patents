A simulation performs experiments on a model representing a real system (e.g. industrial control systems, machines, vehicles) to achieve findings and insights of the real system. The models like the systems can be huge, complicated and complex. Therefore the simulation will be executed by computer programs and computers.","The word \u201cSimulation\u201d in this connection subsumes the model set up, the calculation and the interpretation of the results whereas only the model set up and the interpretation of the results consume real manpower. By guess 50% of the whole development time of machine tools and production machines is spent for simulation today while approximately \u2154 of this are used for the model set up and \u2153 for the interpretation of the results. That means especially the effort for setting up simulation models is quite high today and will increase further in the future due to the increasing introduction of mechatronic simulation and more frequent validations of the discipline specific designs.","The patent application US20100082314-A1 discloses a system and methods to simulate the operation of a servo driven mechatronic system to tune the system based on components either manually selected by the user from a database or automatically selected from the database by the system.","According to various embodiments, an approach to reduce the effort for the set up of simulation models significantly can be provided.","According to an embodiment, a method for automatically generating a target simulation model for a defined object, may comprise: providing artefacts of the object originated during an engineering process, wherein the artefacts describing the structure, the behavior and the physics of elements of the simulation object, and wherein the artefacts comprise mechatronics simulation tags representing implicit indirect available engineering information regarding the simulation object; storing the artefacts in a data base; extracting out of the artefacts the information needed for generating the target simulation model based on a defined objective; mapping the elements of the simulation object needed for generating the target simulation model based on the defined objective into the elements of the target simulation model; and assembling the extracted information and the mapped elements to generate the target simulation model for the defined object.","According to a further embodiment, the step \u201cmapping the elements of the simulation object needed for generating the target simulation model based on the defined objective into the elements of the target simulation model\u201d can be performed by using a transformation matrix comprising rules for the transformation of structure, behavior and the physics of the elements of the simulation object into the target simulation model. According to a further embodiment, the artefacts may comprise a CAD model and the mechatronics simulation tags comprising lines and\/or points and\/or coordinate systems and\/or planes and\/or surfaces and\/or geometric objects. According to a further embodiment, the data base may be provided by a product data management system or an engineering data management system. According to a further embodiment, the generated target simulation model can be directly used in a simulation system for simulation and\/or validation of technical systems.","According to another embodiment, a computer readable medium may comprise instructions which, when executed by a suitable computer, cause the computer to perform the method as described above.","According to yet another embodiment, a computer program product may be directly loadable into the internal memory of a digital computer and comprise software code portions for performing the method steps as described above when said product runs on the computer.","According to yet another embodiment, an apparatus for automatically generating a target simulation model for a defined object, may comprise a creating unit for providing artefacts of the object in a data base, wherein the artefacts are designed during an engineering process, and wherein the artefacts describing the structure, the behavior and the physics of elements of the simulation object, and wherein the artefacts comprise mechatronics simulation tags representing implicit indirect available engineering information regarding the target simulation model; an extracting unit for extracting out of the artefacts the information needed for generating the target simulation model based on a defined objective; a mapping unit for mapping the elements of the simulation object needed for generating the target simulation model based on the defined objective of the target simulation model into the elements of the target simulation model; and an assembling unit for assembling the extracted information and the mapped elements to generate the target simulation model for the defined object.","According to a further embodiment of the apparatus, the mapping unit may use a transformation matrix comprising rules for the transformation of structure, behavior and the physics of the elements of the simulation object into the target simulation model. According to a further embodiment of the apparatus, the data base can be provided by a product data management system or an engineering data management system. According to a further embodiment of the apparatus, the generated target simulation model may be directly used in a simulation system for the simulation and\/or validation of technical systems such as machine tools, production machines, vehicles or medical equipment. According to a further embodiment of the apparatus, the artefacts can be generated by an engineering system, such as a CAD system. According to a further embodiment of the apparatus, the mechatronics simulation tags are generated and assigned to the respective artefacts by the engineering system.","The various embodiments may be implemented using hardware or software.","According to various embodiments, a method for automatically generating a target simulation model for a defined object, may comprise the following steps:","providing artefacts of the object originated during an engineering process, wherein the artefacts describing the structure, the behavior and the physics of elements of the simulation object, and wherein the artefacts comprise mechatronics simulation tags (MST) representing implicit indirect available engineering information regarding the simulation object;","storing the artefacts in a data base;","extracting out of the artefacts the information needed for generating the target simulation model based on a defined objective;","mapping the elements of the simulation object needed for generating the target simulation model based on the defined objective into the elements of the target simulation model; and","assembling the extracted information and the mapped elements to generate the target simulation model for the defined object. The method allows to automatically set up simulation models. This reduces the modeling time and saves manpower and efforts. Furthermore based on a created master model target models can be derived automatically based on said master model. The artefacts of the engineering process can be for example CAD models, circuit diagrams or excel documents. Examples of defined objects in an industrial environment can be conveyor belts, robotics, machines, manufacturing cells or whole plants. The method is applicable in manufacturing industries, process industries or other industries.","According to one embodiment, the step \u201cmapping the elements of the simulation object needed for generating the target simulation model based on the defined objective into the elements of the target simulation model\u201d is performed by using a transformation matrix comprising rules for the transformation of structure, behavior and the physics of the elements of the simulation object into the target simulation model. The transformation matrix comprises technical, engineering and domain Know How (like a decision table) and enables the automatic generation of the target simulation model by using a computer.","According to an embodiment, the artefacts comprise a CAD model and the mechatronics simulation tags (MST) comprising lines and\/or points and\/or coordinate systems and\/or planes and\/or surfaces and\/or geometric objects. In the case the artefact is a CAD model or comprises a CAD model, the CAD model can easily be enriched with mechatronics simulation tags (MST) representing lines and\/or points and\/or coordinate systems and\/or planes and\/or surfaces and\/or geometric objects since these objects intrinsic elements of CAD models. Furthermore there is no break in the methodology using CAD models by creating simulation models.","According to a further embodiment, the data base is provided by a product data management system (PDM) or an engineering data management system (EDM). The artefacts including the MSTs created by using the engineering system and stored in the data base can be directly used for the generation of the target simulation model. Engineering system and simulation system are integrated by accessing the same data base. This supports the method and tool integration by creating target simulation models. The proposed method can be used in a product lifecycle management (PLM) system. A PLM System supports the process of managing the entire lifecycle of a product starting from its conception, through design and manufacture, to service and disposal.","According to yet a further embodiment, the generated target simulation model is directly used in a simulation system for simulation and\/or validation of technical systems. This supports also the method and tool integration by creating target simulation models.","According to yet a further embodiment, a computer readable medium, has a program recorded thereon, wherein the program when executed is to make a computer execute the method steps of described above. The computer readable medium or storage medium may be a built-in medium installed inside a computer device main body or a removable medium arranged so that it can be separated from the computer device main body. Examples of the built-in medium include, but are not limited to, rewriteable non-volatile memories and flash memories, and hard disks. Examples of the removable medium include, but are not limited to, optical storage media such as CR-ROMs and DVDs; magneto-optical storage media, such as MOs; magnetism storage media, including but not limited to floppy disks, cassette tapes, and removable hard disks; media with a built-in rewriteable non-volatile memory, including but not limited to memory cards; and media with a built-in ROM, including but not limited to ROM cassettes; etc. Furthermore, various information regarding application data, application services, or common information models may be stored in any other form, or it may be provided in other ways.","According to yet a further embodiment, a computer program product is directly loadable into the internal memory of a digital computer, comprising software code portions for performing the method steps as described above when said product runs on the computer. Commercially available computers (e.g. Personal Computer, Laptop or Workstations) can be used for running and implementing the method steps as described above.","According to yet another further embodiment, an apparatus for automatically generating a target simulation model for a defined object, may comprise:","a creating unit for providing artefacts of the object in a data base,","wherein the artefacts are designed during an engineering process, and","wherein the artefacts describing the structure, the behavior and the physics of elements of the simulation object, and wherein the artefacts comprise mechatronics simulation tags (MST) representing implicit indirect available engineering information regarding the target simulation model;","an extracting unit for extracting out of the artefacts the information needed for generating the target simulation model based on a defined objective;","a mapping unit for mapping the elements of the simulation object needed for generating the target simulation model based on the defined objective of the target simulation model into the elements of the target simulation model; and","an assembling unit for assembling the extracted information and the mapped elements to generate the target simulation model for the defined object. The apparatus enables to automatically set up simulation models. The apparatus comprises one or more processing units. There can be different creating units for providing respective artefacts (e.g. CAD models, spread sheets). The proposed apparatus can be integrated in a product lifecycle management (PLM) system.","A further embodiment is that the mapping unit is using a transformation matrix comprising rules for the transformation of structure, behavior and the physics of the elements of the simulation object into the target simulation model. The transformation matrix comprises technical, engineering and domain Know How and expertise (like a decision table) and enables the automatic generation of the target simulation model by using a computer. The transformation matrix can be realized as one lookup table, wherein the mapping for each element of the original artefacts to the target simulation model is stored. In case the artefacts of the engineering process are stored in an object oriented PDM system, the transformation information can be attached to each base element directly.","A further embodiment is that the data base is provided by a product data management system (PDM) or an engineering data management system. The artefacts created by using the engineering system and stored in the data base can be directly used for the generation of the target simulation model. Engineering system and simulation system are integrated by accessing the same data base.","A further embodiment is that the generated target simulation model is directly used in a simulation system for the simulation and\/or validation of technical systems such as machine tools, production machines, vehicles or medical equipment. This supports also the method and tool integration by creating target simulation models.","A further embodiment is that the artefacts are generated by an engineering system, such as a CAD system. The artefacts can be generated by using hardware or software commodities for example by a commercially available CAD system.","A further embodiment is that the mechatronics simulation tags (MST) are generated and assigned to the respective artefacts by the engineering system. A conventional engineering system used for engineering and designing an industrial plant or machine can be used for generating the mechatronics simulation tags (MST) and enriching the engineering model with these tags.","It will be readily understood that the components of the present invention, as generally described and illustrated in the Figures herein, may be arranged and designed in a wide variety of different configurations. Thus, the following more detailed description of embodiments, as represented in , is not intended to limit the scope of the invention, as claimed, but is merely representative of selected embodiments of the invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":"1"},"In the following the main branch B of the simulation procedure is discussed in more detail. The first phase is the \u201cdescription of the objective\u201d. This is very important because based on the specification of the objective in the system analysis phase the questions have to be answered which components of the design or the real system are modelled, which physical effects have to be considered and especially which level of detail has to be achieved. The \u201cconceptual model\u201d as the result of the system analysis phase is a non-software-specific description of the simulation model that is to be developed, describing the objectives, inputs, outputs, content, assumptions and simplifications of the model. During the \u201cformalization of the model\u201d phase the \u201cconceptual model\u201d is transformed into a formal model. The formal model is a description that can be implemented without further technical clarification. The \u201cformalization\u201d phase is still tool independent. In real life the differentiation between \u201cconceptual model\u201d and \u201cformal model\u201d is floating. That means the \u201cconceptual model\u201d often already contains content of the \u201cformal model\u201d. The complete formal model is not realised normally. The implementation is the translation of the formal model into the language of the simulation tool. Most simulation tools come with large libraries of predefined components. In this context translation means to allocate the right library object to the function. In the \u201cexperiments and analysis\u201d phase the executable model and the prepared data are integrated.","The second branch B of the simulation procedure describes the processing of the data. It comprises the phases \u201cdata acquisition\u201d and \u201cdata preparation\u201d. In the \u201cdata acquisition\u201d phase all data is collocated that is used for the simulation experiment. The output usually is data that can not directly be reused for the simulation model. The transformation of the output of the \u201cdata acquisition\u201d phase into the correct format for the executable model is done during the \u201cdata preparation\u201d phase. The described workflow of a simulation job is to a large extent still a manual process today.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["1","2","1","2","1","2","1","2"]},"The enriched artefacts (artefacts) resp. the formal model can be stored by the engineering systems ES, ES in a data base DB where a generation unit GU has access to the formal model. The generation unit GU comprises an extracting unit EU for extracting out of the artefacts the information needed for generating the target simulation model based on a defined objective of the target simulation model TM, a mapping unit MU for mapping the elements of the simulation object needed for generating the target simulation model TM based on the defined objective of the target simulation model TM into the elements of the target simulation model TM, and an assembling unit AU for assembling the extracted information and the mapped elements to generate the target simulation model TM for the defined simulation object. Advantageously the mapping unit is using a transformation matrix comprising rules for the transformation of structure, behavior and the physics of the elements of the simulation object into the target simulation model TM.","It is also possible that the engineering systems ES, ES transfer the formal model directly (e.g. wired) or via an Internet connection to the generation unit GU. The generation unit GU provides the target simulation model TM for the simulation system SS. With the information of the mechatronic simulation tags (MST) the formal model is machine readable. A software application generates from the formal model the executable model of the simulation system SS. Therefore the model set up for the simulation model can be performed automatically. This quickens for example the engineering of industrial plants and increases the quality of the engineering since less manual errors can occur.","In a further embodiment the generation unit GU can be integrated in the simulation system SS. The simulation system SS can be represented by commercial off the shelf software (e.g. simulation software for virtual commissioning or finite element analysis model (FEA model)).","The creating units CU, CU, the extracting unit EU, the mapping unit MU, and the assembling unit AU can be realized by software programs or spread sheet applications having suitable macros.","The engineering systems ES, ES and the simulation system SS having input means T, T, T (e.g. keyboard, mouse), output means M, M, M (e.g. monitor, printer), storage means, processing means (CPU) and communication means for transferring data (e.g. connection to the internet).","According to various embodiments, the simulation process shown in  can be automated, starting from the existing \u201cspecification of objective\u201d and ending with the \u201cexecutable model\u201d and enable to automatically generate a simulation model. In principle the presented approach can be used for all kind of models and all domains. For manageability and performance reasons advantageously the following assumptions are made:\n\n","In other words, the objective of the method is to automate an established simulation job. An example out of the machine tool industry: if a new machine tool is developed, then if the new design exists, i.e. the CAD model exists, a mechatronic simulation is performed to evaluate the dynamic behaviour of the new design. For that from the CAD model a FEA model is derived and coupled with the predefined model of the closed loop control system. This is a recurring, well known simulation job. The set up of the model is more or less always the same.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0060"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["1","3","1","2"],"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004","list-style":"none"},"li":["1. Explicit availability: Explicit means that an export interface exists. Typical data that is explicit available are geometry, IO tables and kinematics.","2. Implicit direct availability: Implicit direct means that an intermediate step has to be performed to get the information out of the system. Examples therefore are to get the inertia of a component out of a CAD model or to get a parameter out of a component. In the first example first the inertia has to be calculated by an integrated functionality. Then the inertia can be exported. In the second example the value of the parameter can be exported by \u201ccopy & past\u201d or with respect to automatic model generation the API (Application Programming Interface) of the tool has to be use to program an algorithm that extracts the parameter automatically.","3. Implicit indirect availability: These information are available but can not be extracted by a tool automatically. Today this information can only be lifted by the know-how of an engineer. For example, a FEA model of a machine tool should be set up based on a 3D CAD model. Out of the 3D geometry for the engineer it is obvious where the carriages of the linear guideways are. Based on the visual inspection the simulation engineer models a spring in the appropriate position in the FEA model. Or another example, a virtual commissioning model should be set up also based on a 3D CAD model. Here the CAD model is a conveyor. And the CAD model also shows a sensor, either as 3D geometry or as marker. The sensor has to be modelled in the virtual commissioning model too. But as in the previous example the translation of the 3D geometry into the sensor in the virtual commissioning model today can only be done by an engineer."]}}}},"With respect to the automatic model generation for case one nothing has to be done. The information of type two, implicit direct, cause no problems either, if the authoring tool of the artefact has an open and appropriate API (Application Programming Interface). In this case an algorithm has to be developed that extracts the needed information. The information of the third case is the challenge for the to the automatic model generation. Here model information has to be made machine readable. Since the artefacts and the related tools are quite different from today's view a general approach does not exist. For each implicit indirect information an individual solution has to be developed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0065"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["1","2","1","2"]},"First the transition from CAD to virtual commissioning (example E) is explained. The first picture P shows the CAD model before automatic model generation. You can see a conveyor belt CB. A cylinder C represents a sensor. Besides the 3D geometry the conveyor in the virtual commissioning model is defined through a material entry position SP, a material exit position EP, a sensor S and the information whether he is powered or not. To get this information out of the CAD model the CAD model is enriched with so called Mechatronics Simulation Tags (MST). Mechatronics Simulation Tags in a CAD model can be lines, points, coordinate systems, planes, surfaces or whole geometric objects. In  (picture P) at the material entry position SP and at the material exit position EP of the conveyor CB\u2032 the CAD feature \u201cline\u201d was added. Further on a \u201cpoint\u201d was positioned to mark a motor M. The motor marker makes clear that this conveyor CB\u2032 is powered. And to make the geometric object \u201ccylinder\u201d C recognisable as sensor S a tag is added.","The same mechanism was used in the CAD-FEA example E to make a cuboid (picture ) recognizable as carriage of a guideway for the later FEA model (picture ), the tag \u201ccarriage15Npm\u201d (picture ) was added. The tags make the markers identifiable. In our example the tags are \u201cend_pos\u201d, \u201clight_barrier\u201d, \u201cmot_mount\u201d and so on. For the simulation expert it is clear (assumptions  and ) that in the FEA model (picture P) the cuboid \u201ccarriage15Npm\u201d is replaced through a force element.","As described before the markers that make the information machine readable have to be defined for each automatic model generation task individually. Here the combination of the tag with the CAD feature is the \u201cMechatronics Simulation Tag\u201d (MST). For the automatic model generation the artefacts have to be made intelligent through Mechatronic Simulation Tags (MST). These advanced artefacts are called \u201cartefact\u201d.","The column in the middle of  shows the principle approach according to various embodiments: Creating an original model OM comprising artefacts, enriching the original model with mechatronic simulation tags (MST) to build advanced artefacts, so called artefact, transformation to the target model TM.","To come back to the main concept shown in  the artefacts are the source for the structure, behaviour and physics that is needed to set up the simulation model. As explained this information exists in the artefacts but in most cases it is not explicit available and therefore it has to be made machine readable by Mechatronics Simulation Tags (MST) first. The information that is needed to set up the target model can be extracted by an algorithm implemented in software. Which information has to be extracted is known from the daily modelling work.","The next step in the concept is the mapping of the original elements into the elements of the target model. For this the so called \u201cTransformation Matrix\u201d is used (see ). This can be explained in more detail by referring to the CAD-FEA example of  (example E). For the simulation expert it is clear (assumptions  and ) that in the FEA model the cuboid \u201ccarriage15Npm\u201d is replaced through a force element. For the automatic model generation the Transformation Matrix does this job. Out of the Transformation Matrix the algorithm gets the association of the cuboid to a definite force element. Another transformation would be the mapping of the boundary of the upper and lower surfaces of the cuboid into meshing areas. The parameterization can be derived from the tag. The parameterization is normally not part of the CAD model. But based on the tag the parameterization can be extracted out of another database. The Transformation Matrix for the automatic model generation consists of rules for the transformation of structure, behaviour and physics. The example makes clear that the set up of the Transformation Matrix can only be done by the know-how of the simulation engineers. Further on the Transformation Matrix can have intelligence. For example during the transition from the formal model to the executable model the granularity of the model can be changed. An example out of the hydraulics would be that in a process and instrumentation diagram drains for service are drawn. For the simulation model they do not have any relevance, in contrast they can raise the calculation time significantly. So the transformation matrix could recognize drains and replace them through a pipe without drain. In this case a model reduction was performed.","The last step of the concept is the assembly of the target model TM from the extracted and transformed information of the previous steps. The format is given through the target system. For the example regarding the carriage from  (example 2) the assembly step consists of the following actions: first the mesh generator is activated. The mesh areas out of the transformation step force the mesh generator to place nodes on the lines. Based on the nodes the force element is generated and parameterized.","During the set up of simulation models the simulation engineer has to decide which effects have to be considered in the simulation model. Then he has to define how they are modeled. And last but not least he has to set up the model. For this the know-how of an engineer is needed. And that is the reason why the model set up is performed manually today.","In principle of various embodiments can be applied for all kinds of models and domains. For performance reasons advantageously various embodiments are focused for the model set up on a very specific model (see assumptions in point ). Then the engineer defines based on his know-how a master model only once. Based on the master model further simulation models can be generated automatically. Another aspect of various embodiments is to define the elements of the master model and how to transform them into the target model TM.","As described before today a lot of time is spend for setting up simulation models. According to various embodiments, the modelling effort can be reduced drastically. The reduction of modelling time is direct saving of real manpower, time and with this saving money.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0071","num":"0076"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["51","54","51","52","53","54"],"sup":["+","+","+"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0072","num":"0077"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6"]},"A method and an apparatus for automatically generating a target simulation model for a defined simulation object, the method comprising the following steps:","providing artefacts of the simulation object in a data base, wherein the artefacts describing the structure, the behavior and the physics of elements of the simulation object, and wherein the artefacts comprise mechatronics simulation tags (MST) representing implicit indirect available engineering information regarding the simulation object; extracting out of the artefacts the information needed for generating the target simulation model based on a defined objective of the target simulation model; mapping the elements of the simulation object needed for generating the target simulation model based on the defined objective of the target simulation model into the elements of the target simulation model; and assembling the extracted information and the mapped elements to generate the target simulation model for the defined simulation object.
