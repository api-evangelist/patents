Thereafter, the INTZRASF signal rises from the L-level to the H-level, and the ZRASACT signal rises from the L-level to the H-level. As a result, the CME signal rises from the L-level to the H-level, and subsequently is achieved entry into a state in which no change in the five addresses is accepted. Therefore, the data, which have previously been written in the normal operation, are maintained as they are, preventing the data from being destroyed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0080","num":"0079"},"figref":"FIG. 13","b":["158","100","1"]},"Referring to , the SETS2 signal of an the H-level pulse is generated in response to the ZREF-SETF signal of an the L-level pulse, and thereafter, the ZREF-SET signal of the L-level pulse is generated. In accordance with this, the ZREFACT signal falls from the H-level to the L-level, and subsequently, the ZS\u03c6-END signal, which is the L-level pulse, is generated. In response to this, the ZREF-RST signal of an the L-level pulse is generated, and the ZREFACT signal rises from the L-level to the H-level. As a result, the refresh operation of the memory cell array  is activated.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0082","num":"0081"},"figref":"FIG. 14","b":["158","100","1"]},"Referring to , when the CME signal rises from the L-level to the H-level, the ZREF-SETF signal, which is the L-level pulse, is generated. In accordance with this, the SETS2 signal of an the H-level pulse is generated. At this time, since the CME signal is at the H-level, the ZREF-SET signal having the L-level is not generated, and therefore, the ZREFACT signal having the L-level is not generated. Therefore, the memory cell array  is not refreshed in the command mode, and the data, which have previously been written in the normal operation, are maintained as they are in the command mode, preventing the data from being destroyed.","As described above, according to the present preferred embodiments, in response to the sequence of entry into the non-normal operation mode such as the test mode and the command mode based on the predetermined command signal, the non-normal operation mode is started. After the non-normal operation mode is set in response to the sequence of setting the non-normal operation mode based on another predetermined command signal, the operation of the set non-normal operation mode is executed in correspondence. Subsequently, control is executed so as to release the non-normal operation mode by the non-normal operation mode release process based on another predetermined command signal, and control is executed so as to prohibit the activation process of the memory cell array during the interval when the non-normal operation mode is set. Therefore, the result of the execution of write in the normal operation mode can be prevented from being destroyed even in the state on the way to the entry into the operation mode of, for example, the test mode or the command mode, different from the normal operation mode. Moreover, in this case, the control circuit can be prevented from entering a freeze state in which the circuit is uncontrollable due to the timing shift of the plurality of internal control signals.","In the aforementioned preferred embodiment, neither write into the memory cell array  nor the refresh of the memory cell array is executed in the operation mode such as the test mode or the command mode different from the normal operation mode, and the data that have previously been written in the normal operation mode are maintained as they are, allowing the data to be prevented from being destroyed. In this case, the operation mode different from the normal operation mode is limited to neither of the test mode and the command mode, and the operation mode may be another operation mode different from the normal operation mode.","As described in detail above, according to the semiconductor memory device of the present preferred embodiments, there is provided a semiconductor memory device equipped with a memory cell array including memory cells being arranged in a shape of matrix and requiring a refresh operation.
