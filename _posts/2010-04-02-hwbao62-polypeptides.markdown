Each of the above referenced patents and patent applications is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.","This application refers to a \u201cSequence Listing\u201d listed below, which is provided as a text file. The text file contains a document entitled \u201cPS960_SeqList.txt\u201d (473,508 bytes, created Apr. 2, 2010), which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.","The present invention relates to novel proteins\/polypeptides (such as human secreted proteins\/polypeptides), and isolated nucleic acid molecules encoding said proteins\/polypeptides, useful for detecting, preventing, diagnosing, prognosticating, treating, and\/or ameliorating diseases and disorders related to said proteins\/polypeptides (relatedness may be by direct or indirect association, by cause, by consequence, or by effect on said diseases and disorders), such as immune, cardiovascular, cancer, and other proliferative disorders and diseases. Antibodies that bind these polypeptides are also encompassed by the present invention. Also encompassed by the invention are vectors, host cells, and recombinant and synthetic methods for producing said polynucleotides, polypeptides, and\/or antibodies. The invention further encompasses screening methods for identifying agonists and antagonists of polynucleotides and polypeptides of the invention. The present invention further encompasses methods and compositions for inhibiting or enhancing the production and function of the polypeptides of the present invention. The invention further relates to diagnostic and therapeutic methods useful for diagnosing and treating diseases, disorders, and\/or conditions related to these novel human secreted proteins.","Unlike bacterium, which exist as a single compartment surrounded by a membrane, human cells and other eukaryotes are subdivided by membranes into many functionally distinct compartments. Each membrane-bounded compartment, or organelle, contains different proteins essential for the function of the organelle. The cell uses \u201csorting signals,\u201d which are amino acid motifs located within the protein, to target proteins to particular cellular organelles.","One type of sorting signal, called a signal sequence, a signal peptide, or a leader sequence, directs a class of proteins to an organelle called the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The ER separates the membrane-bounded proteins from all other types of proteins. Once localized to the ER, both groups of proteins can be further directed to another organelle called the Golgi apparatus. Here, the Golgi distributes the proteins to vesicles, including secretory vesicles, the cell membrane, lysosomes, and the other organelles.","Proteins targeted to the ER by a signal sequence can be released into the extracellular space as a secreted protein. For example, vesicles containing secreted proteins can fuse with the cell membrane and release their contents into the extracellular space\u2014a process called exocytosis. Exocytosis can occur constitutively or after receipt of a triggering signal. In the latter case, the proteins are stored in secretory vesicles (or secretory granules) until exocytosis is triggered. Similarly, proteins residing on the cell membrane can also be secreted into the extracellular space by proteolytic cleavage of a \u201clinker\u201d holding the protein to the membrane.","Thus there exists a clear need for identifying and using novel secreted polynucleotides and polypeptides. Identification and sequencing of human genes is a major goal of modern scientific research. For example, by identifying genes and determining their sequences, scientists have been able to make large quantities of valuable human \u201cgene products.\u201d These include human insulin, interferon, Factor VIII, tumor necrosis factor, human growth hormone, tissue plasminogen activator, erythropoietin, and numerous other compounds. Thus, in light of the pervasive role of secreted proteins in human physiology, a need exists for identifying and characterizing novel human secreted proteins and the genes that encode them. This knowledge will allow one to detect, to treat, and to prevent medical diseases, disorders, and\/or conditions by using secreted proteins or the genes that encode them. Additionally, knowledge of gene sequences can provide the key to treatment or cure of genetic diseases (such as muscular dystrophy and cystic fibrosis).","Immune-Related Polynucleotides and Polypeptides","The immune system is an intricate network of cells, tissues and soluble molecules that function to protect the body from invasion by foreign substances and pathogens. The major cells of the immune system are lymphocytes, including B cells and T cells, and myeloid cells, including basophils, eosinophils, neutrophils, mast cells, monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells. In addition to these cellular components of the immune system, soluble molecules\u2014such as antibodies, complement proteins, and cytokines\u2014circulate in lymph and blood plasma, and play important roles in immunity.","The immune system can be subdivided into the acquired and innate immune systems. The cells of the innate immune system (e.g., neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, mast cells) are not antigen specific and their action is not enhanced by repeated exposure to the same antigen. The cells of the acquired immune system (B and T cells) are antigen specific. Repeated exposure of B and T cells to an antigen results in improved immune responses (memory responses) produced by these cell types. The cells and products of the acquired immune system can recruit components of the innate system to mount a focused immune response. For a more extensive review of the immune system, see 4th edition, Ed. William Paul, Lippincott-Raven Pub. (1998).","An immune response is seldom carried out by a single cell type, but rather requires the coordinated efforts of several cell types. In order to coordinate an immune response, it is necessary that cells of the immune system communicate with each other and with other cells of the body. Communication between cells may be made by cell-cell contact, between membrane bound molecules on each cell, or by the interaction of soluble components of the immune system with cellular receptors. Signaling between cell types may have one or more of a variety of consequences, including activation, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Activation and differentiation of immune cells may result in the expression or secretion of polypeptides, or other molecules, which in turn affect the function of other cells and\/or molecules of the immune system.","Molecules which stimulate or suppress immune system function are known as immunomodulators. These molecules, which include endogenous proteins (e.g., cytokines, cytokine receptors, and intracellular signal transduction molecules), molecules derived from microorganisms, and synthetic agents, may exert their modulatory effects at one or more stages of the immune response, such as antigen recognition, stimulation of cytokine production and release, and\/or activation\/differentiation of lymphocytes and myeloid cells. Immunomodulators may enhance (immunoprophylaxis, immunostimulation), restore (immunosubstitution, immunorestoration) or suppress (immunosuppression, immunodeviation) immunological functions or activities.","Immunomodulatory compounds have many important applications in clinical practice. For example, immunosuppressing agents (which attenuate or prevent unwanted immune responses) can be used to prevent tissue rejection during organ transplantation, to prevent Rh hemolytic disease of the newborn, or to treat autoimmune disorders. A mechanism of action common to many immunosuppressants is the inhibition of T cell activation and\/or differentiation. Antilymphocyte antibodies have also been used to attenuate immune system functions. Currently-used immunosuppressive agents can produce a number of side effects which limit their use. Among the most serious secondary effects include kidney and liver toxicity, increased risk of infection, hyperglycemia, neoplasia, and osteoporosis (see, e.g., Freeman, Clin. Biochem. 24(1):9-14 (1991); Mitchison, Dig. Dis. 11(2):78-101 (1993)).","Immunostimulants, which enhance the activity of immune cells and molecules, comprise another class of immunomodulatory agents with important clinical applications. Such applications include, for example, the treatment of immunodeficiency disorders (e.g. AIDS and severe combined immunodeficiency), chronic infectious diseases (e.g. viral hepatitis, papillomavirus, and herpesvirus), and cancer. An important class of endogenous immunostimulants is the cytokines. These soluble signaling molecules are produced by a number of cell types, and are critical to the regulation of the immune response. Immunostimulatory mechanisms can include proliferation, differentiation and\/or activation of immune cells or progenitors of immune cells. For example, interleukin-2 (IL-2) binds to IL-2 receptors on T lymphocytes and induces proliferation and differentiation. Another cytokine, interferon alpha, stimulates the immune system through a variety of mechanisms, including activation of macrophages, T lymphocytes, and natural killer cells. Interferon alpha also induces the expression of antiviral proteins (see Chapter 509Edition, Eds. Hardman, Limbird, Molinoff, Ruddon, and Gilman, McGraw Hill (1996)). Limitations of current immunostimulant therapies include anaphylaxis, pulmonary edema, and renal toxicity, to name a few.","The discovery of new human immune related polynucleotides, the polypeptides encoded by them, and antibodies that immunospecifically bind these polypeptides, satisfies a need in the art by providing new compositions which are useful in the diagnosis, treatment, prevention and\/or prognosis of disorders of the immune system, including, but not limited to, autoimmune disorders (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and multiple sclerosis), immunodeficiencies (e.g., X-linked agammaglobulinemia, severe combined immunodeficiency, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, and ataxia telangiectasia), chronic infections (e.g., HIV, viral hepatitis, and herpesvirus), and neoplastic disorders. See, e.g. \u201cImmune Activity\u201d section infra. Additionally, immune related molecules would be useful as agents to boost immune responsiveness to pathogens or to suppress immune reactions, for example as is necessary in conjunction with organ transplantation.","Cardiovascular-Related Polynucleotides and Polypeptides","The cardiovascular system is a component of a complex physiological network involved in maintaining the oxygen and nutrient supply to tissues of the body. The heart is the anatomical and functional centerpiece of the cardiovascular system. Weighing only 250-350 grams (less than a pound), the heart is one of our strongest and hardest working organs. It is composed of innervated muscle tissue with unique properties; e.g., it can pace itself in contraction. The main center of rhythm regulation is the sinoatrial (SA) node. Certain cardiac cells repeatedly fire impulses that trigger heart contractions. These autorhythmic cells have two important functions. One is to act as a pacemaker (set the pace for the entire heart), and the other is to form a conduction system, the route for conducting impulses throughout the heart muscle. This conduction system controls the pattern of blood flow through the heart.","The heart pumps at least five quarts of blood through a full circuit of the body every minute. The heart consists of two pumps, side by side. The pump on the right side moves blood to the lungs, where waste gases, such as carbon dioxide, are removed and oxygen is added. Freshly oxygenated blood returns to the pump on the left side, which moves it out into the rest of the body. Blood flows away from the heart to the lungs or to the rest of your body, though blood vessels called arteries. Arteries branch extensively, each branch become smaller, forming blood vessels called arterioles. Arterioles also become repeatedly smaller and smaller until they are tiny vessels called capillaries. Throughout the arteries and smaller vessels that stem from them, the blood delivers nutrients and oxygen to the tissues and picks up waste. This task is completed in the capillaries. As the blood moves on through the capillaries the blood vessels gradually become larger, eventually becoming veins. Veins ultimately carry blood back to the heart. The cycle then begins again.","Disorders of the cardiovascular system are many and varied, killing more Americans each year than any other category of disorders. For example, damage to the conduction system leads to arrhythmia, an irregular beating of the heart. If left untreated, the heart becomes unable to effectively pump blood, frequently leading to permanent heart damage and\/or cardiac arrest.","One of the most prevalent conditions in industrialized countries today is atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is the buildup of fatty deposits in the intima of large and medium-sized arteries. The buildup of deposits narrowing of the arteries, reducing or potentially blocking the ability of blood to flow through the arteries. Untreated, atherosclerosis typically results in cardiac arrest and, frequently, death.","Clearly, the discovery of new human cardiovascular-associated polynucleotides, the polypeptides encoded by them, and antibodies that immunospecifically bind these polypeptides, satisfies a need in the art by providing new compositions which are useful in the diagnosis, treatment, prevention and\/or prognosis of cardiovascular disorders.","Cardiovascular disorders include, but are not limited to, stroke, cardiovascular abnormalities, such as arterio-arterial fistula, arteriovenous fistula, cerebral arteriovenous malformations, congenital heart defects, pulmonary atresia, and Scimitar Syndrome.

The human body is composed of many different cell types, e.g. liver cells, muscle cells, brain cells, etc. Normally, these cells grow and divide to produce more cells only as the body needs them (e.g. to regenerate blood cells or replace epithelial cells lining the stomach). Sometimes, however, cells begin to divide unchecked even though new cells are not needed. These extra cells accumulate and form a mass of tissue, called a tumor. Although each of the over 200 cell types in the body can potentially become cancerous, some cell types become cancerous at relatively high rates while many other cell types rarely become cancerous.","Tumors are either benign or malignant. Benign tumors are not cancerous; they can usually be removed, they do not spread to other parts of the body and, they rarely threaten life. Malignant tumors, however, are cancerous. Cells in malignant tumors can invade and damage nearby or distant tissues and organs. The spread of cancerous cells is called metastasis. Malignant (or metastatic) cells can invade adjacent organs by proliferating directly from the primary tumor. Additionally, malignant cells can also metastasize to distant organs by breaking away from the primary tumor, entering the bloodstream or lymphatic system, and settling down in a new organ or tissue to produce a secondary tumor. The origin of secondary tumors is established by comparing cells comprising these tumors to cells in the original (primary) tumor.","In contrast to solid organ cancers (such as cancer in the liver, lung, and brain) cancer can also develop in blood-forming cells. These cancers are referred to as leukemias or lymphomas. Leukemia refers to cancer of blood forming cells such as red blood cells, platelets, and plasma cells. Lymphomas are a subset of leukemias, primarily involving white blood cells, in which the cancerous cells originated in, or are associated with, the lymph system and lymph organs (e.g. T-lymphocytes in the lymph nodes, spleen, or thymus).","In 1999 over 1.1 million people were newly diagnosed with 23 different types of cancer. The vast majority of these cases (\u02dc75%) involved cancers of the prostate, breast, lung, colon, or urinary tract, or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Among the most fatal cancers are pancreatic, liver, esophageal, lung, stomach, and brain cancers, having up to 96% mortality rates depending on the specific cancer. In all, some 23 different types of cancer are expected to kill over 86,000 people each year.","Most cancers are treated with one or a combination therapies consisting of surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, and\/or biological therapy. These five therapeutic modes are either local or systemic treatment strategies. Local treatments affect cancer cells in the tumor and immediately adjacent areas (for example, surgical tumor removal is a local treatment as are most radiation treatments). In contrast, systemic treatments travel through the bloodstream, and reach cancer and other cells all over the body. Chemotherapy, hormone therapy, and biological therapy are examples of systemic treatments.","Whether systemic or local, it is often difficult or impossible to protect healthy cells from the harmful effects of cancer treatment; healthy cells and tissues are inevitably damaged in the process of treating the cancerous cells. Damage and disruption of the normal functioning of healthy cells and tissues often produces the undesirable side effects experienced by patients undergoing cancer treatment.","Recombinant polypeptides and polynucleotides derived from naturally occurring molecules, as well as antibodies specifically targeted to these molecules, used alone or in conjunction with other existing therapies, hold great promise as improved therapeutic agents for the treatment of neoplastic disorders. Currently, most biological therapy can be classified as immunotherapy because these treatments often use naturally occurring molecules to assist the body's immune system in fighting the disease or in protecting the body from side effects of other cancer treatment(s). Among the most commonly used compounds in biological therapies are proteins called cytokines (e.g. interferons, interleukins, and colony stimulating factors) and monoclonal antibodies (targeted to particular cancer cells). Side effects caused by these commonly used biological therapies range from flu-like symptoms (chills, fever, muscle aches, weakness, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea) to rashes, swelling, easy bruising, or bleeding.","The discovery of human secreted proteins associated with initiation, progression, characterization, and\/or distinction of neoplastic diseases (including antibodies that immunospecifically bind these polypeptides), satisfies a need in the art by providing new compositions useful in the detection, prevention, diagnosis, treatment, prevention, prognosis, and treatment of hyperproliferative disorders.","The present invention relates to novel secreted proteins\/polypeptides (such as human proteins\/polypeptides). More specifically, isolated nucleic acid molecules are provided encoding novel secreted polypeptides. Novel polypeptides and antibodies that bind to these polypeptides are provided. Also provided are vectors, host cells, and recombinant and synthetic methods for producing human polynucleotides, polypeptides, and\/or antibodies. The invention further relates to diagnostic and therapeutic methods useful for detecting, preventing, diagnosing, prognosticating, treating, and\/or ameliorating diseases and disorders related to said proteins\/polypeptides (relatedness may be by direct or indirect association, or by cause, consequence, or effect on said diseases and disorders), such as immune, cardiovascular, cancer, and other proliferative disorders and diseases.

Polypeptides encoded by these polynucleotides are also encompassed by the invention.","Also as mentioned above, even if deletion of one or more amino acids from the C-terminus of a protein results in modification of loss of one or more biological functions of the protein (e.g., ability to inhibit the Mixed Lymphocyte Reaction), other functional activities (e.g., biological activities, ability to multimerize, ability to bind ligand, ability to generate antibodies, ability to bind antibodies) may still be retained. For example, the ability of the shortened polypeptide to induce and\/or bind to antibodies which recognize the complete or mature forms of the polypeptide generally will be retained when less than the majority of the residues of the complete or mature polypeptide are removed from the C-terminus. Whether a particular polypeptide lacking C-terminal residues of a complete polypeptide retains such immunologic activities can readily be determined by routine methods described herein and otherwise known in the art. It is not unlikely that a polypeptide with a large number of deleted C-terminal amino acid residues may retain some biological or immunogenic activities.

Moreover, such disorders may predispose increased susceptibility to viral and bacterial infections of the skin (i.e. cold sores, warts, chickenpox, molluscum contagiosum, herpes zoster, boils, cellulitis, erysipelas, impetigo, tinea, athletes foot, and ringworm). Moreover, expression within endothelial cells and pancreatic tissues indicates that the protein product of this gene may be useful in the treatment and\/or prevention of a variety of vascular disorders, particularly those involving highly vascularized tissues, which include, but are not limited to, embolism, aneurysm, stroke, atherosclerosis, and microvascular disease. Protein, as well as, antibodies directed against the protein may show utility as a tumor marker and\/or immunotherapy targets for the above listed tissues.","Moreover, the protein may represent a secreted factor that influences the differentiation or behavior of other blood cells, or that recruits hematopoietic cells to sites of injury. In addition, this gene product may have commercial utility in the expansion of stem cells and committed progenitors of various blood lineages, and in the differentiation and\/or proliferation of various cell types. The secreted protein can be used to determine biological activity, to raise antibodies, as tissue markers, to isolate cognate ligands or receptors, to identify agents that modulate their interactions and as nutritional supplements. It may also have a very wide range of biological activities although no evidence for any is provided in the specification. Typical of these are cytokine, cell proliferation\/differentiation modulating activity or induction of other cytokines; immunostimulating\/immunosuppressant activities (e.g., for treating human immunodeficiency-virus infection, cancer, autoimmune diseases and allergy); regulation of haematopoiesis (e.g., for treating anaemia or as adjunct to chemotherapy); stimulation of growth of bone, cartilage, tendons, ligaments and\/or nerves (e.g., for treating wounds, stimulation of follicle stimulating hormone (for control of fertility); chemotactic and chemokinetic activities (e.g., for treating infections, tumours); haemostatic or thrombolytic activity (e.g., for treating haemophilia, cardiac infarction etc.); anti-inflammatory activity (e.g., for treating septic shock, Crohn's disease); as antimicrobials; for treating psoriasis or other hyperproliferative disease; for regulation of metabolism, behaviour, and many others. Also contemplated is the use of the corresponding nucleic acid in gene therapy procedures. Protein, as well as, antibodies directed against the protein may show utility as a tumor marker and\/or immunotherapy targets for the above listed tissues.","Many polynucleotide sequences, such as EST sequences, are publicly available and accessible through sequence databases.

Antibodies that bind polypeptides of the invention are also encompassed by the invention. Polynucleotides encoding these polypeptides are also encompassed by the invention.","Also as mentioned above, even if deletion of one or more amino acids from the C terminus of a protein results in modification or loss of one or more biological functions of the protein (e.g., ability to induce hematopoiesis), other functional activities (e.g., biological activities, ability to multimerize, ability to bind receptors, ability to activate receptors, ability to bind and block receptor activation, ability to inhibit receptor activation without binding (e.g., as a dominant negative inhibitor of oligomeric complexes), ability to generate antibodies, ability to bind antibodies) may still be retained. For example the ability of the shortened polypeptide to induce and\/or bind to antibodies which recognize the complete or mature forms of the polypeptide generally will be retained when less than the majority of the residues of the complete or mature polypeptide are removed from the C terminus. Whether a particular polypeptide lacking C terminal residues of a complete polypeptide retains such immunologic activities can readily be determined by routine methods described herein and otherwise known in the art. It is not unlikely that a polypeptide with a large number of deleted C terminal amino acid residues may retain some biological or immunogenic activities. In fact, peptides composed of as few as six amino acid residues may often evoke an immune response.","Accordingly, the present invention further provides polypeptides having one or more residues deleted from the carboxyl terminus of the amino acid sequence of the polypeptide shown in  (SEQ ID NO:21), as described by the general formula 1\u2212n, where n is an integer from 6 to 135, where n corresponds to the position of the amino acid residue identified in SEQ ID NO:21.

Furthermore, polypeptides of this invention may be involved in the regulation of cytokine production, antigen presentation, or other processes useful for treatment of cancer, particularly leukemia (e.g., by boosting immune responses, suppressing hyperproliferative activity, or enhancing recovery of healthy hematopoietic cell populations during or following chemotherapy). Moreover, the polynucleotides and polypeptides of this invention, as well as antibodies against the polypeptides of this invention, may be useful for treating immunological and hematopoietic disorders; such as for examples, arthritis, asthma, immunodeficiency diseases (e.g. AIDS), leukemia, rheumatoid arthritis, granulomatous disease, inflammatory bowel disease, sepsis, acne, neutropenia, neutrophilia, psoriasis, hypersensitivities, such as T-cell mediated cytotoxicity; immune reactions to transplanted organs and tissues, such as host-versus-graft and graft-versus-host diseases, or autoimmunity disorders, demyelination, systemic lupus erythematosis, drug induced hemolytic anemia, rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren's disease, and scleroderma. Moreover, the polypeptide of this invention represents a secreted factor that is likely to have activity in stimulating the differentiation of blood cells, or recruiting immune and hematopoietic cells to sites of injury.

Moreover, expression within fetal tissue indicates that this protein may play a role in the regulation of cellular division, and may show utility in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer and other proliferative disorders.

Alternatively, given the tissue distribution indicated by Northern analysis, the translation product of this gene is thought to be a growth factor functioning in the brain and lung that may be useful in treating neurodegeneration and lung disorder. For example, the protein product of this gene is useful for the detection and treatment of disorders associated with developing lungs, particularly in premature infants where the lungs are the last tissues to develop. Furthermore, the tissue distribution indicates that the protein product of this gene is useful for the diagnosis and intervention of lung tumors, since the gene may be involved in the regulation of cell division. Additionally, expression in the brain indicates that it may be involved in neuronal survival; synapse formation; conductance; neural differentiation, etc. Such involvement may impact many processes, such as learning and cognition. It may also be useful in the treatment of such neurodegenerative disorders as schizophrenia; ALS; or Alzheimer's.","Polynucleotides and polypeptides corresponding to this gene are useful for the treatment and diagnosis of hematopoietic related disorders such as anemia, pancytopenia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia or leukemia since stromal cells are important in the production of cells of hematopoietic lineages.

Briefly, the uses include bone marrow cell ex-vivo culture, bone marrow transplantation, bone marrow reconstitution, radiotherapy or chemotherapy of neoplasia. The gene product may also be involved in lymphopoiesis, therefore, it can be used in immune disorders such as infection, inflammation, allergy, immunodeficiency etc. In addition, this gene product may have commercial utility in the expansion of stem cells and committed progenitors of various blood lineages, and in the differentiation and\/or proliferation of various cell types.","Protein, as well as, antibodies directed against the protein may show utility as a tissue-specific marker and\/or immunotherapy target for the above listed tissues.","Many polynucleotide sequences, such as EST sequences, are publicly available and accessible through sequence databases.

Thus, it is likely that this gene activates leukemia cells through the Jak-STAT signal transduction pathway. The interferon-sensitive response element is a promoter element found upstream of many genes which are involved in the Jak-STAT pathway. The Jak-STAT pathway is a large, signal transduction pathway involved in the differentiation and proliferation of cells. Therefore, activation of the Jak-STAT pathway, reflected by the binding of the ISRE element, can be used to indicate proteins involved in the proliferation and differentiation of cells.","This gene is expressed primarily in adult brain, and to a lesser extent in fetal lung.","Polynucleotides and polypeptides of the invention would be useful as reagents for differential identification of the tissue(s) or cell type(s) present in a biological sample and for diagnosis of diseases and conditions which include, but are not limited to, autoimmune disorders.

Protein, as well as, antibodies directed against the protein may show utility as a tumor marker and\/or immunotherapy targets for the above listed tumors and tissues. In addition, this gene product may have commercial utility in the expansion of stem cells and committed progenitors of various blood lineages, and in the differentiation and\/or proliferation of various cell types.

For example the ability of the shortened polypeptide to induce and\/or bind to antibodies which recognize the complete or mature forms of the polypeptide generally will be retained when less than the majority of the residues of the complete or mature polypeptide are removed from the C terminus. Whether a particular polypeptide lacking C terminal residues of a complete polypeptide retains such immunologic activities can readily be determined by routine methods described herein and otherwise known in the art.

439-444 (2000). Polynucleotides encoding these polypeptides are also encompassed by the invention, as are antibodies that bind one or more of these polypeptides.","Thus, the fragment, derivative or analog of the polypeptide of  (SEQ ID NO:135), or that encoded by the deposited cDNA plasmid, may be (i) one in which one or more of the amino acid residues are substituted with a conserved or non conserved amino acid residue (preferably a conserved amino acid residue) and such substituted amino acid residue may or may not be one encoded by the genetic code, or (ii) one in which one or more of the amino acid residues includes a substituent group, or (iii) one in which the extracellular domain of the polypeptide is fused with another compound, such as a compound to increase the half life of the polypeptide (for example, polyethylene glycol), or (iv) one in which the additional amino acids are fused to the extracellular domain of the polypeptide, such as an IgG Fc fusion region peptide or leader or secretory sequence or a sequence which is employed for purification of the extracellular domain of the polypeptide or a proprotein sequence. Such fragments, derivatives and analogs are deemed to be within the scope of those skilled in the art from the teachings herein.","The present invention further includes compositions comprising the polypeptides of the present invention fused or conjugated to antibody domains other than the variable regions. For example, the polypeptides of the present invention may be fused or conjugated to an antibody Fc region, or portion thereof. The antibody portion fused to a polypeptide of the present invention may comprise the constant region, hinge region, CH1 domain, CH2 domain, and CH3 domain or any combination of whole domains or portions thereof. The polypeptides may also be fused or conjugated to the above antibody portions to form multimers. For example, Fc portions fused to the polypeptides of the present invention can form dimers through disulfide bonding between the Fc portions. Higher multimeric forms can be made by fusing the polypeptides to portions of IgA and IgM. Methods for fusing or conjugating the polypeptides of the present invention to antibody portions are known in the art. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,336,603; 5,622,929; 5,359,046; 5,349,053; 5,447,851; 5,112,946; EP 307,434; EP 367,166; PCT publications WO 96\/04388; WO 91\/06570; Ashkenazi et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

USA 89:11337-11341 (1992) (said references incorporated by reference in their entireties).","As one of skill in the art will appreciate, and as discussed above, the polypeptides of the present invention (e.g., those comprising an immunogenic or antigenic epitope) can be fused to heterologous polypeptide sequences. For example, polypeptides of the present invention (including fragments or variants thereof), may be fused with the constant domain of immunoglobulins (IgA, IgE, IgG, IgM), or portions thereof (CH1, CH2, CH3, or any combination thereof and portions thereof, resulting in chimeric polypeptides. By way of another non-limiting example, polypeptides and\/or antibodies of the present invention (including fragments or variants thereof) may be fused with albumin (including but not limited to recombinant human serum albumin or fragments or variants thereof (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,876,969, issued Mar. 2, 1999, EP Patent 0 413 622, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,766,883, issued Jun. 16, 1998, herein incorporated by reference in their entirety)). In a preferred embodiment, polypeptides and\/or antibodies of the present invention (including fragments or variants thereof) are fused with the mature form of human serum albumin (i.e., amino acids 1-585 of human serum albumin as shown in FIGS. 1 and 2 of EP Patent 0 322 094) which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. In another preferred embodiment, polypeptides and\/or antibodies of the present invention (including fragments or variants thereof) are fused with polypeptide fragments comprising, or alternatively consisting of, amino acid residues 1\u2212z of human serum albumin, where z is an integer from 369 to 419, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,766,883 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. Polypeptides and\/or antibodies of the present invention (including fragments or variants thereof) may be fused to either the N- or C-terminal end of the heterologous protein (e.g., immunoglobulin Fc polypeptide or human serum albumin polypeptide). Polynucleotides encoding fusion proteins of the invention are also encompassed by the invention.","Such fusion proteins as those described above may facilitate purification and may increase half-life in vivo. This has been shown for chimeric proteins consisting of the first two domains of the human CD4-polypeptide and various domains of the constant regions of the heavy or light chains of mammalian immunoglobulins. See, e.g., EP 394,827; Traunecker et al., Nature, 331:84-86 (1988). Enhanced delivery of an antigen across the epithelial barrier to the immune system has been demonstrated for antigens (e.g., insulin) conjugated to an FcRn binding partner such as IgG or Fc fragments (see, e.g., PCT Publications WO 96\/22024 and WO 99\/04813). IgG Fusion proteins that have a disulfide-linked dimeric structure due to the IgG portion desulfide bonds have also been found to be more efficient in binding and neutralizing other molecules than monomeric polypeptides or fragments thereof alone. See, e.g., Fountoulakis et al., J. Biochem., 270:3958-3964 (1995). Nucleic acids encoding the above epitopes can also be recombined with a gene of interest as an epitope tag (e.g., the hemagglutinin (\u00ecHA\u00ee) tag or flag tag) to aid in detection and purification of the expressed polypeptide. For example, a system described by Janknecht et al. allows for the ready purification of non-denatured fusion proteins expressed in human cell lines (Janknecht et al., 1991, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88:8972-897). In this system, the gene of interest is subcloned into a vaccinia recombination plasmid such that the open reading frame of the gene is translationally fused to an amino-terminal tag consisting of six histidine residues. The tag serves as a matrix binding domain for the fusion protein. Extracts from cells infected with the recombinant vaccinia virus are loaded onto Ni2+ nitriloacetic acid-agarose column and histidine-tagged proteins can be selectively eluted with imidazole-containing buffers.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0288","num":"0287"},"figref":"FIGS. 7A-C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0289","num":"0288"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},"The data presented in  are also represented in tabular form in Table 9.

L-466 to C-473; W-467 to C-473; and T-468 to C-473 of SEQ ID NO:135. Polypeptides encoded by these polynucleotides are also encompassed by the invention. Moreover, fragments and variants of these polypeptides (such as, for example, fragments as described herein, polypeptides at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% identical to these polypeptides and polypeptides encoded by the polynucleotide which hybridizes, under stringent conditions, to the polynucleotide encoding these polypeptides, or the complement thereof) are encompassed by the invention. Antibodies that bind polypeptides of the invention are also encompassed by the invention. Polynucleotides encoding these polypeptides are also encompassed by the invention.","Also as mentioned above, even if deletion of one or more amino acids from the C terminus of a protein results in modification of loss of one or more biological functions of the protein (e.g., modulation of neurite growth, including, but not limited to, inhibitory activity and\/or antiinflammatory activity), other functional activities (e.g., biological activities, ability to multimerize, ability to bind ligand, ability to generate antibodies, ability to bind antibodies) may still be retained. For example the ability of the shortened polypeptide to induce and\/or bind to antibodies which recognize the complete or mature forms of the polypeptide generally will be retained when less than the majority of the residues of the complete or mature polypeptide are removed from the C terminus. Whether a particular polypeptide lacking C terminal residues of a complete polypeptide retains such immunologic activities can readily be determined by routine methods described herein and otherwise known in the art. It is not unlikely that a polypeptide with a large number of deleted C terminal amino acid residues may retain some biological or immunogenic activities. In fact, peptides composed of as few as six amino acid residues may often evoke an immune response.","Accordingly, the present invention further provides polypeptides having one or more residues deleted from the carboxy terminus of the amino acid sequence of the polypeptide shown in  (SEQ ID NO:135), as described by the general formula 1\u2212n, where n is an integer from 6 to 472, where n corresponds to the position of the amino acid residue identified in SEQ ID NO:135.

Accordingly, polynucleotides related to this invention are useful as a marker in linkage analysis for chromosome 22.","As described herein or otherwise known in the art, the polynucleotides of the invention have uses that include, but are not limited to, serving as probes or primers in chromosome identification, chromosome mapping, and linkage analysis.","Polynucleotides and polypeptides of the invention are useful as reagents for differential identification of the tissue(s) or cell type(s) present in a biological sample and for diagnosis of diseases and conditions which include, but are not limited to, neurodegenerative diseases, growth deficiencies, osteoporosis, catabolic disorders, diabetes, ovarian cancer, neuronal injury spinal injury, post-spinal trauma neurite outgrowth, inflammation, and neuronal injury, and disorders of the central and peripheral nervous system. Similarly, polypeptides and antibodies directed to these polypeptides are useful in providing immunological probes for differential identification of the tissue(s) or cell type(s). For a number of disorders of the above tissues or cells, particularly of the nervous system and other peripheral tissues, expression of this gene at significantly higher or lower levels may be routinely detected in certain tissues or cell types (e.g., neural, neuronal, proliferating, and\/or other tissues) or bodily fluids (e.g., lymph, serum, plasma, urine, synovial fluid and spinal fluid) or another tissue or cell sample taken from an individual having such a disorder, relative to the standard gene expression level, i.e., the expression level in healthy tissue or bodily fluid from an individual not having the disorder.","The tissue distribution cerebellum and homology to ALS (Acid Labile Subunit of Insulin-Like Growth Factor) indicates that polynucleotides and polypeptides corresponding to this gene are useful for the treatment and diagnosis of a variety of metabolic disorders, growth deficiencies, osteoporosis, catabolic disorders (including AIDS) and diabetes. Nearly all of the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) in the circulation is bound in a heterotrimeric complex composed of IGF, IGF-binding protein-3, and the acid-labile subunit (ALS). The protein product of this gene therefore may afford the ability to potentiate the biological actions of IGF or similar growth factors and cytokines. Studies which demonstrate the beneficial effect of IGF-I in amyotrophic lateral-sclerosis, would suggest a role in this disease as well. Alternatively, the tissue distribution in cancerous ovarian tissue indicates polynucleotides and polypeptides corresponding to this gene are useful for the treatment, diagnosis, and\/or prevention of various skin disorders. Furthermore, the protein may also be used to determine biological activity, raise antibodies, as tissue markers, to isolate cognate ligands or receptors, to identify agents that modulate their interactions, in addition to its use as a nutritional supplement.

By a fragment of an isolated DNA molecule having the nucleotide sequence of the deposited cDNA or the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:159 is intended DNA fragments at least about 15 nt, and more preferably at least about 20 nt, still more preferably at least about 30 nt, and even more preferably, at least about 40 nt in length which are useful as diagnostic probes and primers as discussed herein. Of course, larger fragments 50-1500 nt in length are also useful according to the present invention, as are fragments corresponding to most, if not all, of the nucleotide sequence of the deposited cDNA or as shown in SEQ ID NO:159.

In additional embodiments, the polynucleotides of the invention encode functional attributes of the corresponding protein.","Preferred polypeptide fragments include the secreted protein as well as the mature form. Further preferred polypeptide fragments include the secreted protein or the mature form having a continuous series of deleted residues from the amino or the carboxy terminus, or both. For example, any number of amino acids, ranging from 1-60, can be deleted from the amino terminus of either the secreted polypeptide or the mature form. Similarly, any number of amino acids, ranging from 1-30, can be deleted from the carboxy terminus of the secreted protein or mature form. Furthermore, any combination of the above amino and carboxy terminus deletions are preferred. Similarly, polynucleotides encoding these polypeptide fragments are also preferred.","Preferably, the polynucleotide fragments of the invention encode a polypeptide which demonstrates a functional activity. By a polypeptide demonstrating a \u201cfunctional activity\u201d is meant to be a polypeptide capable of displaying one or more known functional activities associated with a full-length (complete) or mature-form of the protein. Such functional activities include, but are not limited to, biological activity (e.g., ability to regulate (e.g., stimulate) hematopoiesis in vitro or in vivo), antigenicity, and immunogenicity. The functional activity of polypeptides of the invention, and fragments, variants derivatives, and analogs thereof, can be assayed by various methods described herein.","In addition, assays described herein and otherwise known in the art may routinely be applied to measure biological activity of polypeptides and fragments of the invention, variants derivatives and analogs thereof (e.g., to regulate (e.g., to stimulate or inhibit) hematopoiesis in vitro or in vivo). For example, techniques known in the art (such as for example assaying for thymidine incorporation), may be applied or routinely modified to assay for the ability of the compositions of the invention to inhibit proliferation of hematopoietic cells. Other methods will be known to the skilled artisan and are within the scope of the invention.","Even if deletion of one or more amino acids from the N-terminus of a protein results in modification of loss of one or more biological functions of the protein, other functional activities (e.g., biological activities, ability to multimerize, etc.) may still be retained. For example, the ability of shortened muteins to induce and\/or bind to antibodies which recognize the complete or mature forms of the polypeptides generally will be retained when less than the majority of the residues of the complete or mature polypeptide are removed from the N-terminus. Whether a particular polypeptide lacking N-terminal residues of a complete polypeptide retains such immunologic activities can readily be determined by routine methods described herein and otherwise known in the art. It is not unlikely that a mutein with a large number of deleted N-terminal amino acid residues may retain some biological or immunogenic activities. In fact, peptides composed of as few as six amino acid residues may often evoke an immune response.","Accordingly, the present invention further provides polypeptides having one or more residues deleted from the amino terminus of the amino acid sequence shown in  (i.e., SEQ ID NO:159), up to the Glu residue at position number 185 and polynucleotides encoding such polypeptides.","Particularly, N-terminal deletions of the polypeptide can be described by the general formula m\u2212190, where m is an integer from 2 to 184, where m corresponds to the position of the amino acid residue identified in SEQ ID NO:160.

Antibodies that bind polypeptides of the invention are also encompassed by the invention. Polynucleotides encoding these polypeptides are also encompassed by the invention.","Also as mentioned above, even if deletion of one or more amino acids from the C terminus of a protein results in modification of loss of one or more biological functions of the protein, other functional activities (e.g., biological activities, ability to multimerize, ability to bind ligand) may still be retained. For example the ability of the shortened mutein to induce and\/or bind to antibodies which recognize the complete or mature forms of the polypeptide generally will be retained when less than the majority of the residues of the complete or mature polypeptide are removed from the C terminus. Whether a particular polypeptide lacking C terminal residues of a complete polypeptide retains such immunologic activities can readily be determined by routine methods described herein and otherwise known in the art. It is not unlikely that an mutein with a large number of deleted C terminal amino acid residues may retain some biological or immunogenic activities. In fact, peptides composed of as few as six amino acid residues may often evoke an immune response.","Accordingly, the present invention further provides polypeptides having one or more residues deleted from the carboxy terminus of the amino acid sequence of the polypeptide shown in  (SEQ ID NO:160), as described by the general formula 1\u2212n, where n is an integer from 6 to 184 where n corresponds to the position of amino acid residue identified in SEQ ID NO:160.

In preferred embodiments, the application is directed to proteins containing polypeptides at least 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% identical to polypeptides having the amino acid sequence of the specific N and C terminal deletions recited herein. Polynucleotides encoding these polypeptides are also encompassed by the invention.","Polynucleotides and polypeptides of the invention are useful as reagents for differential identification of the tissue(s) or cell type(s) present in a biological sample and for diagnosis of diseases and conditions which include, but are not limited to, disorders affecting the immune and hematopoietic systems, particularly hematopoiesis. Similarly, polypeptides and antibodies directed to these polypeptides are useful in providing immunological probes for differential identification of the tissue(s) or cell type(s). For a number of disorders of the above tissues or cells, particularly of the immune system and hematopoeitic system, expression of this gene at significantly higher or lower levels may be routinely detected in certain tissues or cell types (e.g., immune, hematopoietic, and cancerous and wounded tissues) or bodily fluids (e.g., lymph, serum, plasma, urine, synovial fluid and spinal fluid) or another tissue or cell sample taken from an individual having such a disorder, relative to the standard gene expression level, i.e., the expression level in healthy tissue or bodily fluid from an individual not having the disorder.","This gene has been found to stimulate the proliferation of bone marrow CD34+ cells. This assay which is described in Example 52 herein is based on the ability of human CD34+ to proliferate in presence of hematopoietic growth factors and evaluates the ability of the polypeptides of the invention, and agonists and antagonists thereof, to stimulate or inhibit this proliferation.","The tissue distribution in immune and hematopoietic cells and tissues and the ability to stimulate the proliferation of bone marrow CD34+ cells indicates that polynucleotides and polypeptides corresponding to this gene are useful for the diagnosis and treatment of disorders affecting the immune system and hematopoiesis. Representative uses are described in the \u201cImmune Activity\u201d and \u201cInfectious Disease\u201d sections below, in Examples 17, 42, 44, 45, 47, 49, 50, and 51 and elsewhere herein. Briefly, the expression of this gene product indicates a role in regulating the proliferation; survival; differentiation; and\/or activation of hematopoietic cell lineages, including blood stem cells. Moreover, the protein represents a secreted factor that influences the differentiation or behavior of other blood cells, or that recruits hematopoietic cells to sites of injury. Thus, this gene product is thought to be useful in the expansion of stem cells and committed progenitors of various blood lineages, and in the differentiation and\/or proliferation of various cell types.","The polynucleotides and\/or polypeptides of the invention and\/or agonists and\/or antagonists thereof, can also be employed to inhibit the proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic cells and therefore may be employed to protect bone marrow stem cells from chemotherapeutic agents during chemotherapy. This antiproliferative effect may allow administration of higher doses of chemotherapeutic agents and, therefore, more effective chemotherapeutic treatment.","The polynucleotides and\/or polypeptides of the invention and\/or agonists and\/or antagonists thereof, may also be employed for the expansion of immature hematopoietic progenitor cells, for example, granulocytes, macrophages or monocytes, by temporarily preventing their differentiation. These bone marrow cells may be cultured in vitro. Thus, polynucleotides and\/or polypeptides of the invention, or agonists or antagonists thereof, may be useful as a modulator of hematopoietic stem cells in vitro for the purpose of bone marrow transplantation and\/or gene therapy. Since stem cells are rare and are most useful for introducing genes into for gene therapy, polynucleotides and\/or polypeptides of the invention can be used to isolate enriched populations of stem cells. Stem cells can be enriched by culturing cells in the presence of cytotoxins, such as 5-Fu, which kills rapidly dividing cells, where as the stem cells will be protected by polynucleotides and\/or polypeptides of the invention. These stem cells can be returned to a bone marrow transplant patient or can then be used for transfection of the desired gene for gene therapy. In addition, this gene can be injected into animals which results in the release of stem cells from the bone marrow of the animal into the peripheral blood. These stem cells can be isolated for the purpose of autologous bone marrow transplantation or manipulation for gene therapy. After the patient has finished chemotherapy or radiation treatment, the isolated stem cells can be returned to the patient.","Polynucleotides and polypeptides corresponding to this gene are useful for the treatment and diagnosis of hematopoietic related disorders such as anemia, pancytopenia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia or leukemia since stromal cells are important in the production of cells of hematopoietic lineages. The uses include bone marrow cell ex-vivo culture, bone marrow transplantation, bone marrow reconstitution, radiotherapy or chemotherapy of neoplasia.","This gene product may also be involved in the regulation of cytokine production, antigen presentation, or other processes suggesting a usefulness in the treatment of cancer (e.g. by boosting immune responses). Since the gene is expressed in cells of lymphoid origin, the natural gene product is involved in immune functions. Therefore it is also useful as an agent for immunological disorders including arthritis, asthma, immunodeficiency diseases such as AIDS, leukemia, rheumatoid arthritis, granulomatous disease, inflammatory bowel disease, sepsis, acne, neutropenia, neutrophilia, psoriasis, hypersensitivities, such as T-cell mediated cytotoxicity; immune reactions to transplanted organs and tissues, such as host-versus-graft and graft-versus-host diseases, or autoimmunity disorders, such as autoimmune infertility, lense tissue injury, demyelination, systemic lupus erythematosis, drug induced hemolytic anemia, rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren's disease, and scleroderma.","This gene may also have a very wide range of biological activities. Representative uses are described in the \u201cChemotaxis\u201d and \u201cBinding Activity\u201d sections below, in Examples 31, 42, 44, 45, 46, 47, 49, 50, and 51, and elsewhere herein. Briefly, the protein may possess the following activities: cytokine, cell proliferation\/differentiation modulating activity or induction of other cytokines; immunostimulating\/immunosuppressant activities (e.g. for treating human immunodeficiency virus infection, cancer, autoimmune diseases and allergy); regulation of hematopoiesis (e.g. for treating anemia or as adjunct to chemotherapy); stimulation or growth of bone, cartilage, tendons, ligaments and\/or nerves (e.g. for treating wounds, stimulation of follicle stimulating hormone (for control of fertility); chemotactic and chemokinetic activities (e.g. for treating infections, tumors); hemostatic or thrombolytic activity (e.g. for treating hemophilia, cardiac infarction etc.); anti-inflammatory activity (e.g. for treating septic shock, Crohn's disease); as antimicrobials; for treating psoriasis or other hyperproliferative diseases; for regulation of metabolism, and behavior. Also contemplated is the use of the corresponding nucleic acid in gene therapy procedures. Based upon the proteins immune cell specific message distribution, it may be involved in many aspects of the immune response, especially its initial stages, inflammation, allograft rejection, infectious disease response etc. It is frequently found in the hematopoietic cell cDNA libraries. Thus, this factor could be involved in the control of hematopoietic cell proliferation, differentiation, and function. Based on this one can postulate its use in the management of anemias, leukemias, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, autoimmune diseases, blood tissue engraftment, and poikilothromerythromatosis. Furthermore, the protein may also be used to determine biological activity, raise antibodies, as tissue markers, to isolate cognate ligands or receptors, to identify agents that modulate their interactions, in addition to its use as a nutritional supplement. Protein, as well as, antibodies directed against the protein may show utility as a tumor marker and\/or immunotherapy targets for the above listed tissues.","The gene encoding the disclosed cDNA is believed to reside on chromosome 7.

Similarly, polypeptides and antibodies directed to these polypeptides are useful in providing immunological probes for differential identification of the tissue(s) or cell type(s).

Similarly, the tissue distribution indicates that polynucleotides and polypeptides corresponding to this gene are useful for the diagnosis and treatment of cancer and other proliferative disorders. Expression within placental tissue and other cellular sources marked by proliferating cells indicates that this protein may play a role in the regulation of cellular division. Similarly, embryonic development also involves decisions involving cell differentiation and\/or apoptosis in pattern formation.

The polypeptide of the present invention has been putatively identified as a human integrin alpha 11 homolog derived from a human osteoblast II cDNA library. More particularly, the polypeptide of the present invention has been putatively identified as a human integrin alpha 11-subunit homolog, sometimes hereafter referred to as \u201cintegrin alpha 11\u201d, \u201cintegrin alpha 11-subunit\u201d, \u201ca11\u201d, \u201cA11-subunit\u201d, and\/or \u201cIntegrin all-subunit\u201d. The invention also relates to inhibiting the action of such polypeptides. The integrins are a large family of cell adhesion molecules consisting of noncovalently associated ab heterodimers.","We have cloned and sequenced a novel human integrin \u03b1-subunit cDNA, designated a11. The all cDNA encodes a protein with a 22 amino acid signal peptide, a large 1120 residue extracellular domain that contains an I-domain of 207 residues and is linked by a transmembrane domain to a short cytoplasmic domain of 24 amino acids. The deduced all protein shows the typical structural features of integrin a-subunits and is similar to a distinct group of a-subunits from collagen-binding integrins. However, it differs from most integrin a-chains by an incompletely preserved cytoplasmic GFFKR motif.","The human ITGA11 gene was located to bands q22.3-23 on chromosome 15, and its transcripts were found predominantly in bone, cartilage as well as in cardiac and skeletal muscle. Expression of the 5.5 kilobase all mRNA was also detectable in ovary and small intestine.","All vertebrate cells express members of the integrin family of cell adhesion molecules, which mediate cellular adhesion to other cells and extracellular subtratum, cell migration and participate in important physiologic processes from signal transduction to cell proliferation and differentiation (Hynes, 92; Springer, 92).","Integrins are structurally homologous heterodimeric type-I membrane glycoproteins formed by the noncovalent association of one of eight b-subunits with one of the 17 different a-subunits described to date, resulting in at least 22 different ab complexes. Their binding specificities for cellular and extracellular ligands are determined by both subunits and are dynamically regulated in a cell-type-specific mode by the cellular environment as well as by the developmental and activation state of the cell (Diamond and Springer, 94). In integrin a-subunits, the aminoterminal region of the large extracellular domain consists of a seven-fold repeated structure which is predicted to fold into a b-propeller domain (Corbi et al., 1987; Springer, 1997). The three or four C-terminal repeats contain putative divalent cation binding motifs that are thought to be important for ligand binding and subunit association (Diamond and Springer, 94). The a1, a2, a 10, aD, aE, aL, aM and aX-subunits contain an approximately 200 amino acid I-domain inserted between the second and third repeat that is not present in other a-chains (Larson et al., 1989). Several isolated I-domains have been shown to independently bind the ligands of the parent integrin heterodimer (Kamata and Takada, 1994; Randi and Hogg, 1994). The a3, a5-8, aIIb and aV-subunits are proteolytically processed at a conserved site into disulphide-linked heavy and light chains, while the a4-subunit is cleaved at a more aminoterminal site into two fragments that remain noncovalently associated (Hemler et al., 90). Additional a-subunit variants are generated by alternative splicing of primary transcripts (Ziober et al., 93; Delwel et al., 95; Leung et al., 98).","The extracellular domains of a-integrin subunits are connected by a single spanning transmembrane domain to short, diverse cytoplasmic domains whose only conserved feature is a membrane-proximal KXGFF(K\/R)R motif (Sastry and Horwitz, 1993). The cytoplasmic domains have been implicated in the cell-type-specific modulation of integrin affinity states (Williams et al., 1994).","The polypeptide of the present invention has been putatively identified as a member of the integrin family and has been termed integrin alpha 11 subunit (\u201ca11\u201d).

Since the location of these domains have been predicted by computer analysis, one of ordinary skill would appreciate that the amino acid residues constituting these domains may vary slightly (e.g., by about 1 to 15 amino acid residues) depending on the criteria used to define each domain. In additional embodiments, the polynucleotides of the invention encode functional attributes of a11.","Preferred embodiments of the invention in this regard include fragments that comprise alpha-helix and alpha-helix forming regions (\u201calpha-regions\u201d), beta-sheet and beta-sheet forming regions (\u201cbeta-regions\u201d), turn and turn-forming regions (\u201cturn-regions\u201d), coil and coil-forming regions (\u201ccoil-regions\u201d), hydrophilic regions, hydrophobic regions, alpha amphipathic regions, beta amphipathic regions, flexible regions, surface-forming regions and high antigenic index regions of the present invention.","The data representing the structural or functional attributes of all set forth in  and\/or Table 13, as described above, was generated using the various modules and algorithms of the DNA*STAR set on default parameters. In a preferred embodiment, the data presented in columns VIII, IX, XIII, and XIV of Table 13 can be used to determine regions of all which exhibit a high degree of potential for antigenicity. Regions of high antigenicity are determined from the data presented in columns VIII, IX, XIII, and\/or XIV by choosing values which represent regions of the polypeptide which are likely to be exposed on the surface of the polypeptide in an environment in which antigen recognition may occur in the process of initiation of an immune response.","Certain preferred regions in these regards are set out in , but may, as shown in Table 13, be represented or identified by using tabular representations of the data presented in . The DNA*STAR computer algorithm used to generate  (set on the original default parameters) was used to present the data in  in a tabular format (See Table 13). The tabular format of the data in  is used to easily determine specific boundaries of a preferred region. The above-mentioned preferred regions set out in  and in Table 13 include, but are not limited to, regions of the aforementioned types identified by analysis of the amino acid sequence set out in . As set out in  and in Table 13, such preferred regions include Garnier-Robson alpha-regions, beta-regions, turn-regions, and coil-regions, Chou-Fasman alpha-regions, beta-regions, and turn-regions, Kyte-Doolittle hydrophilic regions and Hopp-Woods hydrophobic regions, Eisenberg alpha- and beta-amphipathic regions, Karplus-Schulz flexible regions, Jameson-Wolf regions of high antigenic index and Emini surface-forming regions. Even if deletion of one or more amino acids from the N-terminus of a protein results in modification of loss of one or more biological functions of the protein, other functional activities (e.g., biological activities, ability to multimerize, etc.) may still be retained. For example, the ability of shortened all muteins to induce and\/or bind to antibodies which recognize the complete or mature forms of the polypeptides generally will be retained when less than the majority of the residues of the complete or mature polypeptide are removed from the N-terminus. Whether a particular polypeptide lacking N-terminal residues of a complete polypeptide retains such immunologic activities can readily be determined by routine methods described herein and otherwise known in the art. It is not unlikely that an all mutein with a large number of deleted N-terminal amino acid residues may retain some biological or immunogenic activities. In fact, peptides composed of as few as six all amino acid residues may often evoke an immune response.","Accordingly, the present invention further provides polypeptides having one or more residues deleted from the amino terminus of the all amino acid sequence shown in , up to the threonine residue at position number 1184 and polynucleotides encoding such polypeptides. In particular, the present invention provides polypeptides comprising the amino acid sequence of residues n1-1189 of , where n1 is an integer from 2 to 1184 corresponding to the position of the amino acid residue in  (which is identical to the sequence shown as SEQ ID NO:187). In another embodiment, N-terminal deletions of the all polypeptide can be described by the general formula n2\u22121189, where n2 is a number from 2 to 1184, corresponding to the position of amino acid identified in . N-terminal deletions of the a11 polypeptide of the invention shown as SEQ ID NO:187 include polypeptides comprising the amino acid sequence of residues: N-terminal deletions of the a11 polypeptide of the invention shown as SEQ ID NO:187 include polypeptides comprising the amino acid sequence of residues: D-2 to E-1189;

Polynucleotides encoding these polypeptides are also encompassed by the invention, as are antibodies that bind one or more of these polypeptides. Moreover, fragments and variants of these polypeptides (e.g., fragments as described herein, polypeptides at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% identical to these polypeptides and polypeptides encoded by the polynucleotide which hybridizes, under stringent conditions, to the polynucleotide encoding these polypeptides, or the complement thereof) are encompassed by the invention. Antibodies that bind these fragments and variants of the invention are also encompassed by the invention. Polynucleotides encoding these fragments and variants are also encompassed by the invention.","Also as mentioned above, even if deletion of one or more amino acids from the C-terminus of a protein results in modification or loss of one or more biological functions of the protein, other functional activities (e.g., biological activities (e.g., ability to illicit mitogenic activity, induce differentiation of normal or malignant cells, ability to multimerize, etc.) may still be retained. For example the ability of the shortened all mutein to induce and\/or bind to antibodies which recognize the complete or mature forms of the polypeptide generally will be retained when less than the majority of the residues of the complete or mature polypeptide are removed from the C-terminus. Whether a particular polypeptide lacking C-terminal residues of a complete polypeptide retains such immunologic activities can readily be determined by routine methods described herein and otherwise known in the art. It is not unlikely that an all mutein with a large number of deleted C-terminal amino acid residues may retain some biological or immunogenic activities. In fact, peptides composed of as few as six all amino acid residues may often evoke an immune response.","Accordingly, the present invention further provides polypeptides having one or more residues deleted from the carboxy terminus of the amino acid sequence of the a11 polypeptide shown in , up to the glycine residue at position number 6, and polynucleotides encoding such polypeptides. In particular, the present invention provides polypeptides comprising the amino acid sequence of residues 1\u2212m1 of , where m1 is an integer from 6 to 1189 corresponding to the position of the amino acid residue in . Moreover, the invention provides polynucleotides encoding polypeptides comprising, or alternatively consisting of, the amino acid sequence of C-terminal deletions of the a11 polypeptide of the invention shown as SEQ ID NO:187 include polypeptides comprising the amino acid sequence of residues: M-1 to L-1188;

The polynucleotide of this invention was discovered in a human osteoblast II cDNA library.","Based on the sequence similarity to the human integrin alpha 1 subunit, translation product of this gene is expected to share at least some biological activities with integrin proteins, and specifically the integrin alpha 1 protein. Such activities are known in the art, some of which are described elsewhere herein.","Specifically, polynucleotides and polypeptides of the invention, including antibodies, are also useful for modulating the differentiation of normal and malignant cells, modulating the proliferation and\/or differentiation of cancer and neoplastic cells, and modulating the immune response. Polynucleotides and polypeptides of the invention may represent a diagnostic marker for hematopoietic and immune diseases and\/or disorders. The full-length protein should be a secreted protein, based upon homology to the integrin family. Therefore, it is secreted into serum, urine, or feces and thus the levels is assayable from patient samples. Assuming specific expression levels are reflective of the presence of immune disorders, this protein would provide a convenient diagnostic for early detection. In addition, expression of this gene product may also be linked to the progression of immune diseases, and therefore may itself actually represent a therapeutic or therapeutic target for the treatment of cancer.","Polynucleotides and polypeptides of the invention may play an important role in the pathogenesis of human cancers and cellular transformation, particularly those of the immune and hematopoietic systems. Polynucleotides and polypeptides of the invention may also be involved in the pathogenesis of developmental abnormalities based upon its potential effects on proliferation and differentiation of cells and tissue cell types. Due to the potential proliferating and differentiating activity of said polynucleotides and polypeptides, the invention is useful as a therapeutic agent in inducing tissue regeneration, for treating inflammatory conditions (e.g., inflammatory bowel syndrome, diverticulitis, etc.). Moreover, the invention is useful in modulating the immune response to aberrant polypeptides, as may exist in rapidly proliferating cells and tissue cell types, particularly in adenocarcinoma cells, and other cancers.","Alternatively, the expression within cellular sources marked by proliferating cells indicates this protein may play a role in the regulation of cellular division, and may show utility in the diagnosis, treatment, and\/or prevention of developmental diseases and disorders, including cancer, and other proliferative conditions. Representative uses are described in the \u201cHyperproliferative Disorders\u201d and \u201cRegeneration\u201d sections below and elsewhere herein. Briefly, developmental tissues rely on decisions involving cell differentiation and\/or apoptosis in pattern formation.","Dysregulation of apoptosis can result in inappropriate suppression of cell death, as occurs in the development of some cancers, or in failure to control the extent of cell death, as is believed to occur in acquired immunodeficiency and certain neurodegenerative disorders, such as spinal muscular atrophy (SMA).","Alternatively, this gene product is involved in the pattern of cellular proliferation that accompanies early embryogenesis. Thus, aberrant expression of this gene product in tissues\u2014particularly adult tissues\u2014may correlate with patterns of abnormal cellular proliferation, such as found in various cancers. Because of potential roles in proliferation and differentiation, this gene product may have applications in the adult for tissue regeneration and the treatment of cancers. It may also act as a morphogen to control cell and tissue type specification. Therefore, the polynucleotides and polypeptides of the present invention are useful in treating, detecting, and\/or preventing said disorders and conditions, in addition to other types of degenerative conditions. Thus, this protein may modulate apoptosis or tissue differentiation and is useful in the detection, treatment, and\/or prevention of degenerative or proliferative conditions and diseases. The protein is useful in modulating the immune response to aberrant polypeptides, as may exist in proliferating and cancerous cells and tissues. The protein can also be used to gain new insight into the regulation of cellular growth and proliferation. Furthermore, the protein may also be used to determine biological activity, to raise antibodies, as tissue markers, to isolate cognate ligands or receptors, to identify agents that modulate their interactions, in addition to its use as a nutritional supplement. Protein, as well as, antibodies directed against the protein may show utility as a tumor marker and\/or immunotherapy targets for the above listed tissues.","This gene is expressed almost exclusively in osteoblasts, human trabecular bone cells, mesangial cells, adipocytes, and to a lesser extent in osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma, breast cancer cells, and bone marrow.","Therefore, polynucleotides and polypeptides of the invention, including antibodies, are useful as reagents for differential identification of the tissue(s) or cell type(s) present in a biological sample and for diagnosis of the following diseases and conditions which include, but are not limited to, disorders of the skeletal system, connective tissues, and immune and hematopoietic diseases and\/or disorders. Similarly, polypeptides and antibodies directed to these polypeptides are useful to provide immunological probes for differential identification of the tissue(s) or cell type(s). For a number of disorders of the above tissues or cells, particularly of the connective tissue and skeletal system, expression of this gene at significantly higher or lower levels is detected in certain tissues or cell types (e.g. immune, hematopoietic, skeletal, bone, cartilage, developmental, reproductive, secretory, and cancerous and wounded tissues) or bodily fluids or cell types (e.g., lymph, serum, plasma, urine, synovial fluid or spinal fluid) or another tissue or cell sample taken from an individual having such a disorder, relative to the standard gene expression level, i.e., the expression level in healthy tissue from an individual not having the disorder.","The tissue distribution in osteoblasts and homology to integrin alpha subunit 10 indicates that the protein products of this gene are useful for the treatment of disorders and conditions affecting the skeletal system, in particular osteoporosis as well as disorders afflicting connective tissues (e.g., arthritis, trauma, tendonitis, chrondomalacia and inflammation), such as in the diagnosis and treatment of various autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, scleroderma, and dermatomyositis as well as dwarfism, spinal deformation, and specific joint abnormalities as well as chondrodysplasias (i.e., spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita, familial osteoarthritis, Atelosteogenesis type II, metaphyseal chondrodysplasia type Schmid). polynucleotides and polypeptides corresponding to this gene are useful for the treatment and diagnosis of hematopoietic related disorders such as anemia, pancytopenia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia or leukemia since stromal cells are important in the production of cells of hematopoietic lineages. Such a use is consistent with the observed homology to integrin family members, in conjunction with the tissue distribution in bone marrow cells.","Integrins play pivotal roles in cell migration, inflammation, proliferation, and cellular infiltration. Thus, the present invention is expected to share at least some of these activities. Representative uses are described in the \u201cImmune Activity\u201d and \u201cinfectious disease\u201d sections below, in Examples 17, 42, 44, 45, 47, 49, 50, and 51, and elsewhere herein. Briefly, the uses include bone marrow cell ex-vivo culture, bone marrow transplantation, bone marrow reconstitution, radiotherapy or chemotherapy of neoplasia. The gene product may also be involved in lymphopoiesis, therefore, it can be used in immune disorders such as infection, inflammation, allergy, immunodeficiency etc. In addition, this gene product may have commercial utility in the expansion of stem cells and committed progenitors of various blood lineages, and in the differentiation and\/or proliferation of various cell types. Based upon the tissue distribution of this protein, antagonists directed against this protein is useful in blocking the activity of this protein. Accordingly, preferred are antibodies which specifically bind a portion of the translation product of this gene.","Also provided is a kit for detecting tumors in which expression of this protein occurs. Such a kit comprises in one embodiment an antibody specific for the translation product of this gene bound to a solid support. Also provided is a method of detecting these tumors in an individual which comprises a step of contacting an antibody specific for the translation product of this gene to a bodily fluid from the individual, preferably serum, and ascertaining whether antibody binds to an antigen found in the bodily fluid. Preferably the antibody is bound to a solid support and the bodily fluid is serum. The above embodiments, as well as other treatments and diagnostic tests (kits and methods), are more particularly described elsewhere herein.","Furthermore, the protein may also be used to determine biological activity, to raise antibodies, as tissue markers, to isolate cognate ligands or receptors, to identify agents that modulate their interactions, in addition to its use as a nutritional supplement. Protein, as well as, antibodies directed against the protein may show utility as a tumor marker and\/or immunotherapy targets for the above listed tissues.","Many polynucleotide sequences, such as EST sequences, are publicly available and accessible through sequence databases. Some of these sequences are related to SEQ ID NO:186 and may have been publicly available prior to conception of the present invention. Preferably, such related polynucleotides are specifically excluded from the scope of the present invention. To list every related sequence is cumbersome. Accordingly, preferably excluded from the present invention are one or more polynucleotides comprising a nucleotide sequence described by the general formula of a\u2212b, where a is any integer between 1 to 4981 of SEQ ID NO:186, b is an integer of 15 to 4995, where both a and b correspond to the positions of nucleotide residues shown in SEQ ID NO:186, and where b is greater than or equal to a+14.","Tables","Description of Table 1A","Table 1A summarizes information concerning certain polynucleotides and polypeptides of the invention. The first column provides the gene number in the application for each clone identifier. The second column provides a unique clone identifier, \u201ccDNA Clone ID\u201d, for a cDNA clone related to each contig sequence disclosed in Table 1A. The cDNA Clones identified in the second column were deposited as indicated in the third column (i.e. by ATCC\u2122 Deposit No: Z and deposit date). Some of the deposits contain multiple different clones corresponding to the same gene. In the fourth column, \u201cVector\u201d refers to the type of vector contained in the corresponding cDNA Clone identified in the second column. In the fifth column, the nucleotide sequence identified as \u201cNT SEQ ID NO:X\u201d was assembled from partially homologous (\u201coverlapping\u201d) sequences obtained from the corresponding cDNA clone identified in the second column and, in some cases, from additional related cDNA clones. The overlapping sequences were assembled into a single contiguous sequence of high redundancy (usually three to five overlapping sequences at each nucleotide position), resulting in a final sequence identified as SEQ ID NO:X. In the sixth column, \u201cTotal NT Seq.\u201d refers to the total number of nucleotides in the contig sequence identified as SEQ ID NO:X.\u201d The deposited clone may contain all or most of these sequences, reflected by the nucleotide position indicated as \u201c5\u2032 NT of Clone Seq.\u201d (seventh column) and the \u201c3\u2032 NT of Clone Seq.\u201d (eighth column) of SEQ ID NO:X. In the ninth column, the nucleotide position of SEQ ID NO:X of the putative start codon (methionine) is identified as \u201c5\u2032 NT of Start Codon.\u201d Similarly, in column ten, the nucleotide position of SEQ ID NO:X of the predicted signal sequence is identified as \u201c5\u2032 NT of First AA of Signal Pep.\u201d In the eleventh column, the translated amino acid sequence, beginning with the methionine, is identified as \u201cAA SEQ ID NO:Y,\u201d although other reading frames can also be routinely translated using known molecular biology techniques. The polypeptides produced by these alternative open reading frames are specifically contemplated by the present invention.","In the twelfth and thirteenth columns of Table 1A, the first and last amino acid position of SEQ ID NO:Y of the predicted signal peptide is identified as \u201cFirst AA of Sig Pep\u201d and \u201cLast AA of Sig Pep.\u201d In the fourteenth column, the predicted first amino acid position of SEQ ID NO:Y of the secreted portion is identified as \u201cPredicted First AA of Secreted Portion\u201d. The amino acid position of SEQ ID NO:Y of the last amino acid encoded by the open reading frame is identified in the fifteenth column as \u201cLast AA of ORF\u201d.","SEQ ID NO:X (where X may be any of the polynucleotide sequences disclosed in the sequence listing) and the translated SEQ ID NO:Y (where Y may be any of the polypeptide sequences disclosed in the sequence listing) are sufficiently accurate and otherwise suitable for a variety of uses well known in the art and described further below. For instance, SEQ ID NO:X is useful for designing nucleic acid hybridization probes that will detect nucleic acid sequences contained in SEQ ID NO:X or the cDNA contained in the deposited clone. These probes will also hybridize to nucleic acid molecules in biological samples, thereby enabling a variety of forensic and diagnostic methods of the invention. Similarly, polypeptides identified from SEQ ID NO:Y may be used, for example, to generate antibodies which bind specifically to proteins containing the polypeptides and the secreted proteins encoded by the cDNA clones identified in Table 1A and\/or elsewhere herein.","Nevertheless, DNA sequences generated by sequencing reactions can contain sequencing errors. The errors exist as misidentified nucleotides, or as insertions or deletions of nucleotides in the generated DNA sequence. The erroneously inserted or deleted nucleotides cause frame shifts in the reading frames of the predicted amino acid sequence. In these cases, the predicted amino acid sequence diverges from the actual amino acid sequence, even though the generated DNA sequence may be greater than 99.9% identical to the actual DNA sequence (for example, one base insertion or deletion in an open reading frame of over 1000 bases).","Accordingly, for those applications requiring precision in the nucleotide sequence or the amino acid sequence, the present invention provides not only the generated nucleotide sequence identified as SEQ ID NO:X, and the predicted translated amino acid sequence identified as SEQ ID NO:Y, but also a sample of plasmid DNA containing a human cDNA of the invention deposited with the ATCC\u2122, as set forth in Table 1A. The nucleotide sequence of each deposited plasmid can readily be determined by sequencing the deposited plasmid in accordance with known methods","The predicted amino acid sequence can then be verified from such deposits. Moreover, the amino acid sequence of the protein encoded by a particular plasmid can also be directly determined by peptide sequencing or by expressing the protein in a suitable host cell containing the deposited human cDNA, collecting the protein, and determining its sequence.","Also provided in Table 1A is the name of the vector which contains the cDNA plasmid.

Column 7 of Table 1B.1 lists residues comprising predicted epitopes contained in the polypeptides encoded by each of the preferred ORFs (SEQ ID NO:Y). Identification of potential immunogenic regions was performed according to the method of Jameson and Wolf (CABIOS, 4; 181-186 (1988)); specifically, the Genetics Computer Group (GCG) implementation of this algorithm, embodied in the program PEPTIDESTRUCTURE (Wisconsin Package v10.0, Genetics Computer Group (GCG), Madison, Wis.).

Column 8 of Table 1B.1 (\u201cCytologic Band\u201d) provides the chromosomal location of polynucleotides corresponding to SEQ ID NO:X. Chromosomal location was determined by finding exact matches to EST and cDNA sequences contained in the NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) UniGene database.

The second number in column 5 (following the colon), represents the number of times a sequence corresponding to the reference polynucleotide sequence (e.g., SEQ ID NO:X) was identified in the corresponding tissue\/cell source. Those tissue\/cell source identifier codes in which the first two letters are \u201cAR\u201d designate information generated using DNA array technology. Utilizing this technology, cDNAs were amplified by PCR and then transferred, in duplicate, onto the array. Gene expression was assayed through hybridization of first strand cDNA probes to the DNA array. cDNA probes were generated from total RNA extracted from a variety of different tissues and cell lines. Probe synthesis was performed in the presence of P dCTP, using oligo(dT) to prime reverse transcription. After hybridization, high stringency washing conditions were employed to remove non-specific hybrids from the array. The remaining signal, emanating from each gene target, was measured using a Phosphorimager. Gene expression was reported as Phosphor Stimulating Luminescence (PSL) which reflects the level of phosphor signal generated from the probe hybridized to each of the gene targets represented on the array. A local background signal subtraction was performed before the total signal generated from each array was used to normalize gene expression between the different hybridizations.

Fluorometric microvolume assay technology (FMAT) is a fluorescence-based system that provides a means to perform nonradioactive cell- and bead-based assays to detect activation of cell signal transduction pathways. This technology was designed specifically for ligand binding and immunological assays. Using this technology, fluorescent cells or beads at the bottom of the well are detected as localized areas of concentrated fluorescence using a data processing system. Unbound fluorophore comprising the background signal is ignored, allowing for a wide variety of homogeneous assays. FMAT technology may be used for peptide ligand binding assays, immunofluorescence, apoptosis, cytotoxicity, and bead-based immunocapture assays. See, Miraglia S et. al., \u201cHomogeneous cell and bead based assays for high throughput screening using fluorometric microvolume assay technology,\u201d Journal of Biomolecular Screening; 4:193-204 (1999). In particular, FMAT technology may be used to test, confirm, and\/or identify the ability of polypeptides (including polypeptide fragments and variants) to activate signal transduction pathways. For example, FMAT technology may be used to test, confirm, and\/or identify the ability of polypeptides to upregulate production of immunomodulatory proteins (such as, for example, interleukins, GM-CSF, Rantes, and Tumor Necrosis factors, as well as other cellular regulators (e.g. insulin)).","Tables 1E, 1E.1, and 1E.2 also describe the use of kinase assays for testing, demonstrating, or quantifying biological activity. In this regard, the phosphorylation and de-phosphorylation of specific amino acid residues (e.g. Tyrosine, Serine, Threonine) on cell-signal transduction proteins provides a fast, reversible means for activation and de-activation of cellular signal transduction pathways. Moreover, cell signal transduction via phosphorylation\/de-phosphorylation is crucial to the regulation of a wide variety of cellular processes (e.g. proliferation, differentiation, migration, apoptosis, etc.). Accordingly, kinase assays provide a powerful tool useful for testing, confirming, and\/or identifying polypeptides (including polypeptide fragments and variants) that mediate cell signal transduction events via protein phosphorylation. See e.g., Forrer, P., Tamaskovic R., and Jaussi, R. \u201cEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay for Measurement of JNK, ERK, and p38 Kinase Activities\u201d Biol. Chem. 379(8-9): 1101-1110 (1998).","Description of Table 1F","Polynucleotides encoding polypeptides of the present invention can be used in assays to test for one or more biological activities. One such biological activity which may be tested includes the ability of polynucleotides and polypeptides of the invention to stimulate up-regulation or down-regulation of expression of particular genes and proteins. Hence, if polynucleotides and polypeptides of the present invention exhibit activity in altering particular gene and protein expression patterns, it is likely that these polynucleotides and polypeptides of the present invention may be involved in, or capable of effecting changes in, diseases associated with the altered gene and protein expression profiles. Hence, polynucleotides, polypeptides, or antibodies of the present invention could be used to treat said associated diseases.","TaqMan\u00ae assays may be performed to assess the ability of polynucleotides (and polypeptides they encode) to alter the expression pattern of particular \u201ctarget\u201d genes. TaqMan\u00ae reactions are performed to evaluate the ability of a test agent to induce or repress expression of specific genes in different cell types. TaqMan\u00ae gene expression quantification assays (\u201cTaqMan\u00ae assays\u201d) are well known to, and routinely performed by, those of ordinary skill in the art. TaqMan\u00ae assays are performed in a two step reverse transcription\/polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In the first (RT) step, cDNA is reverse transcribed from total RNA samples using random hexamer primers. In the second (PCR) step, PCR products are synthesized from the cDNA using gene specific primers.","To quantify gene expression the TaqMan\u00ae PCR reaction exploits the 5\u2032 nuclease activity of AmpliTaq Gold\u00ae DNA Polymerase to cleave a TaqMan\u00ae probe (distinct from the primers) during PCR. The TaqMan\u00ae probe contains a reporter dye at the 5\u2032-end of the probe and a quencher dye at the 3\u2032 end of the probe. When the probe is intact, the proximity of the reporter dye to the quencher dye results in suppression of the reporter fluorescence. During PCR, if the target of interest is present, the probe specifically anneals between the forward and reverse primer sites. AmpliTaq Gold\u00ae DNA Polymerase then cleaves the probe between the reporter and quencher when the probe hybridizes to the target, resulting in increased fluorescence of the reporter (see ). Accumulation of PCR products is detected directly by monitoring the increase in fluorescence of the reporter dye.","After the probe fragments are displaced from the target, polymerization of the strand continues. The 3\u2032-end of the probe is blocked to prevent extension of the probe during PCR. This process occurs in every cycle and does not interfere with the exponential accumulation of product. The increase in fluorescence signal is detected only if the target sequence is complementary to the probe and is amplified during PCR. Because of these requirements, any nonspecific amplification is not detected.","For test sample preparation, vector controls or constructs containing the coding sequence for the gene of interest are transfected into cells, such as for example 293T cells, and supernatants collected after 48 hours. For cell treatment and RNA isolation, multiple primary human cells or human cell lines are used; such cells may include but are not limited to, Normal Human Dermal Fibroblasts, Aortic Smooth Muscle, Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells, HepG2, Daudi, Jurkat, U937, Caco, and THP-1 cell lines. Cells are plated in growth media and growth is arrested by culturing without media change for 3 days, or by switching cells to low serum media and incubating overnight.

The second column indicates the catalogued tissue description for the corresponding libraries. The third column indicates the vector containing the corresponding clones. The fourth column shows the ATCC\u2122 deposit designation for each library clone as indicated by the deposit information in Table 6.","The following definitions are provided to facilitate understanding of certain terms used throughout this specification.","In the present invention, \u201cisolated\u201d refers to material removed from its original environment (e.g., the natural environment if it is naturally occurring), and thus is altered \u201cby the hand of man\u201d from its natural state. For example, an isolated polynucleotide could be part of a vector or a composition of matter, or could be contained within a cell, and still be \u201cisolated\u201d because that vector, composition of matter, or particular cell is not the original environment of the polynucleotide. The term \u201cisolated\u201d does not refer to genomic or cDNA libraries, whole cell total or mRNA preparations, genomic DNA preparations (including those separated by electrophoresis and transferred onto blots), sheared whole cell genomic DNA preparations or other compositions where the art demonstrates no distinguishing features of the polynucleotide\/sequences of the present invention.","In the present invention, a \u201csecreted\u201d protein refers to those proteins capable of being directed to the ER, secretory vesicles, or the extracellular space as a result of a signal sequence, as well as those proteins released into the extracellular space without necessarily containing a signal sequence. If the secreted protein is released into the extracellular space, the secreted protein can undergo extracellular processing to produce a \u201cmature\u201d protein. Release into the extracellular space can occur by many mechanisms, including exocytosis and proteolytic cleavage.","As used herein, a \u201cpolynucleotide\u201d refers to a molecule having a nucleic acid sequence encoding SEQ ID NO:Y or a fragment or variant thereof (e.g., the polypeptide delineated in columns fourteen and fifteen of Table 1A); a nucleic acid sequence contained in SEQ ID NO:X (as described in column 5 of Table 1A and\/or column 4 of Tables 1B.1 and 1B.2) or the complement thereof a cDNA sequence contained in Clone ID: (as described in column 2 of Table 1A and\/or Tables 1B.1 and 1B.2 and contained within a library deposited with the ATCC\u2122); a nucleotide sequence encoding the polypeptide encoded by a nucleotide sequence in SEQ ID NO:B as defined in column 6 (EXON From-To) of Table 1C or a fragment or variant thereof or a nucleotide coding sequence in SEQ ID NO:B as defined in column 6 of Table 1C or the complement thereof. For example, the polynucleotide can contain the nucleotide sequence of the full length cDNA sequence, including the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 untranslated sequences, the coding region (with or without a natural or artificial signal sequence), the protein coding region as well as fragments, epitopes, domains, and variants of the nucleic acid sequence. Moreover, as used herein, a \u201cpolypeptide\u201d refers to a molecule having an amino acid sequence encoded by a polynucleotide of the invention as broadly defined (obviously excluding poly-Phenylalanine or poly-Lysine peptide sequences which result from translation of a polyA tail of a sequence corresponding to a cDNA).","In the present invention, \u201cSEQ ID NO:X\u201d was often generated by overlapping sequences contained in multiple clones (contig analysis). A representative clone containing all or most of the sequence for SEQ ID NO:X is deposited at Human Genome Sciences, Inc. (HGS) in a catalogued and archived library. As shown, for example, in column 2 of Tables 1B.1 and 1B.2, each clone is identified by a cDNA Clone ID (identifier generally referred to herein as Clone ID:). Each Clone ID is unique to an individual clone and the Clone ID is all the information needed to retrieve a given clone from the HGS library. Table 7 provides a list of the deposited cDNA libraries. One can use the Clone ID: to determine the library source by reference to Tables 6 and 7. Table 7 lists the deposited cDNA libraries by name and links each library to an ATCC\u2122 Deposit. Library names contain four characters, for example, \u201cHTWE.\u201d The name of a cDNA clone (Clone ID) isolated from that library begins with the same four characters, for example \u201cHTWEP07\u201d. As mentioned below, Tables 1A, 1B.1 and 1B.2 correlate the Clone ID names with SEQ ID NO:X. Thus, starting with an SEQ ID NO:X, one can use Tables 1A, 1B.1, 1B.2, 6, and 7 to determine the corresponding Clone ID, which library it came from and which ATCC\u2122 deposit the library is contained in. Furthermore, it is possible to retrieve a given cDNA clone from the source library by techniques known in the art and described elsewhere herein. The ATCC\u2122 is located at 10801 University Boulevard, Manassas, Va. 20110-2209, USA. The ATCC\u2122 deposits were made pursuant to the terms of the Budapest Treaty on the international recognition of the deposit of microorganisms for the purposes of patent procedure.","In specific embodiments, the polynucleotides of the invention are at least 15, at least 30, at least 50, at least 100, at least 125, at least 500, or at least 1000 continuous nucleotides but are less than or equal to 300 kb, 200 kb, 100 kb, 50 kb, 15 kb, 10 kb, 7.5 kb, 5 kb, 2.5 kb, 2.0 kb, or 1 kb, in length. In a further embodiment, polynucleotides of the invention comprise a portion of the coding sequences, as disclosed herein, but do not comprise all or a portion of any intron. In another embodiment, the polynucleotides comprising coding sequences do not contain coding sequences of a genomic flanking gene (i.e., 5\u2032 or 3\u2032 to the gene of interest in the genome). In other embodiments, the polynucleotides of the invention do not contain the coding sequence of more than 1000, 500, 250, 100, 50, 25, 20, 15, 10, 5, 4, 3, 2, or 1 genomic flanking gene(s).","A \u201cpolynucleotide\u201d of the present invention also includes those polynucleotides capable of hybridizing, under stringent hybridization conditions, to sequences contained in SEQ ID NO:X, or the complement thereof (e.g., the complement of any one, two, three, four, or more of the polynucleotide fragments described herein), the polynucleotide sequence delineated in columns 7 and 8 of Table 1A or the complement thereof, the polynucleotide sequence delineated in columns 8 and 9 of Table 2 or the complement thereof, and\/or cDNA sequences contained in Clone ID: (e.g., the complement of any one, two, three, four, or more of the polynucleotide fragments, or the cDNA clone within the pool of cDNA clones deposited with the ATCC\u2122, described herein), and\/or the polynucleotide sequence delineated in column 6 of Table 1C or the complement thereof. \u201cStringent hybridization conditions\u201d refers to an overnight incubation at 42 degree C. in a solution comprising 50% formamide, 5\u00d7SSC (750 mM NaCl, 75 mM trisodium citrate), 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.6), 5\u00d7Denhardt's solution, 10% dextran sulfate, and 20 \u03bcg\/ml denatured, sheared salmon sperm DNA, followed by washing the filters in 0.1\u00d7SSC at about 65 degree C.","Also contemplated are nucleic acid molecules that hybridize to the polynucleotides of the present invention at lower stringency hybridization conditions. Changes in the stringency of hybridization and signal detection are primarily accomplished through the manipulation of formamide concentration (lower percentages of formamide result in lowered stringency); salt conditions, or temperature. For example, lower stringency conditions include an overnight incubation at 37 degree C. in a solution comprising 6\u00d7SSPE (20\u00d7SSPE=3M NaCl; 0.2M NaHPO; 0.02M EDTA, pH 7.4), 0.5% SDS, 30% formamide, 100 \u03bcg\/ml salmon sperm blocking DNA; followed by washes at 50 degree C. with 1\u00d7SSPE, 0.1% SDS. In addition, to achieve even lower stringency, washes performed following stringent hybridization can be done at higher salt concentrations (e.g. 5\u00d7SSC).","Note that variations in the above conditions may be accomplished through the inclusion and\/or substitution of alternate blocking reagents used to suppress background in hybridization experiments. Typical blocking reagents include Denhardt's reagent, BLOTTO, heparin, denatured salmon sperm DNA, and commercially available proprietary formulations. The inclusion of specific blocking reagents may require modification of the hybridization conditions described above, due to problems with compatibility.","Of course, a polynucleotide which hybridizes only to polyA+ sequences (such as any 3\u2032 terminal polyA+ tract of a cDNA shown in the sequence listing), or to a complementary stretch of T (or U) residues, would not be included in the definition of \u201cpolynucleotide,\u201d since such a polynucleotide would hybridize to any nucleic acid molecule containing a poly (A) stretch or the complement thereof (e.g., practically any double-stranded cDNA clone generated using oligo dT as a primer).","The polynucleotide of the present invention can be composed of any polyribonucleotide or polydeoxyribonucleotide, which may be unmodified RNA or DNA or modified RNA or DNA. For example, polynucleotides can be composed of single- and double-stranded DNA, DNA that is a mixture of single- and double-stranded regions, single- and double-stranded RNA, and RNA that is mixture of single- and double-stranded regions, hybrid molecules comprising DNA and RNA that may be single-stranded or, more typically, double-stranded or a mixture of single- and double-stranded regions. In addition, the polynucleotide can be composed of triple-stranded regions comprising RNA or DNA or both RNA and DNA. A polynucleotide may also contain one or more modified bases or DNA or RNA backbones modified for stability or for other reasons. \u201cModified\u201d bases include, for example, tritylated bases and unusual bases such as inosine. A variety of modifications can be made to DNA and RNA; thus, \u201cpolynucleotide\u201d embraces chemically, enzymatically, or metabolically modified forms.","In specific embodiments, the polynucleotides of the invention are at least 15, at least 30, at least 50, at least 100, at least 125, at least 500, or at least 1000 continuous nucleotides but are less than or equal to 300 kb, 200 kb, 100 kb, 50 kb, 15 kb, 10 kb, 7.5 kb, 5 kb, 2.5 kb, 2.0 kb, or 1 kb, in length.

The polypeptides may be modified by either natural processes, such as posttranslational processing, or by chemical modification techniques which are well known in the art. Such modifications are well described in basic texts and in more detailed monographs, as well as in a voluminous research literature. Modifications can occur anywhere in a polypeptide, including the peptide backbone, the amino acid side-chains and the amino or carboxyl termini. It will be appreciated that the same type of modification may be present in the same or varying degrees at several sites in a given polypeptide. Also, a given polypeptide may contain many types of modifications. Polypeptides may be branched, for example, as a result of ubiquitination, and they may be cyclic, with or without branching. Cyclic, branched, and branched cyclic polypeptides may result from posttranslation natural processes or may be made by synthetic methods. Modifications include acetylation, acylation, ADP-ribosylation, amidation, covalent attachment of flavin, covalent attachment of a heme moiety, covalent attachment of a nucleotide or nucleotide derivative, covalent attachment of a lipid or lipid derivative, covalent attachment of phosphotidylinositol, cross-linking, cyclization, disulfide bond formation, demethylation, formation of covalent cross-links, formation of cysteine, formation of pyroglutamate, formylation, gamma-carboxylation, glycosylation, GPI anchor formation, hydroxylation, iodination, methylation, myristoylation, oxidation, pegylation, proteolytic processing, phosphorylation, prenylation, racemization, selenoylation, sulfation, transfer-RNA mediated addition of amino acids to proteins such as arginylation, and ubiquitination.

Third column, the cDNA Clones identified in the second column were deposited as indicated in the third column (i.e. by ATCC\u2122 Deposit No:Z and deposit date). Some of the deposits contain multiple different clones corresponding to the same gene. In the fourth column, \u201cVector\u201d refers to the type of vector contained in the corresponding cDNA Clone identified in the second column. In the fifth column, the nucleotide sequence identified as \u201cNT SEQ ID NO:X\u201d was assembled from partially homologous (\u201coverlapping\u201d) sequences obtained from the corresponding cDNA clone identified in the second column and, in some cases, from additional related cDNA clones. The overlapping sequences were assembled into a single contiguous sequence of high redundancy (usually three to five overlapping sequences at each nucleotide position), resulting in a final sequence identified as SEQ ID NO:X. In the sixth column, \u201cTotal NT Seq.\u201d refers to the total number of nucleotides in the contig sequence identified as SEQ ID NO:X.\u201d The deposited clone may contain all or most of these sequences, reflected by the nucleotide position indicated as \u201c5\u2032 NT of Clone Seq.\u201d (seventh column) and the \u201c3\u2032 NT of Clone Seq.\u201d (eighth column) of SEQ ID NO:X. In the ninth column, the nucleotide position of SEQ ID NO:X of the putative start codon (methionine) is identified as \u201c5\u2032 NT of Start Codon.\u201d Similarly, in column ten, the nucleotide position of SEQ ID NO:X of the predicted signal sequence is identified as \u201c5\u2032 NT of First AA of Signal Pep.\u201d In the eleventh column, the translated amino acid sequence, beginning with the methionine, is identified as \u201cAA SEQ ID NO:Y,\u201d although other reading frames can also be routinely translated using known molecular biology techniques. The polypeptides produced by these alternative open reading frames are specifically contemplated by the present invention.","In the twelfth and thirteenth columns of Table 1A, the first and last amino acid position of SEQ ID NO:Y of the predicted signal peptide is identified as \u201cFirst AA of Sig Pep\u201d and \u201cLast AA of Sig Pep.\u201d In the fourteenth column, the predicted first amino acid position of SEQ ID NO:Y of the secreted portion is identified as \u201cPredicted First AA of Secreted Portion\u201d. The amino acid position of SEQ ID NO:Y of the last amino acid encoded by the open reading frame is identified in the fifteenth column as \u201cLast AA of ORF\u201d.","SEQ ID NO:X (where X may be any of the polynucleotide sequences disclosed in the sequence listing) and the translated SEQ ID NO:Y (where Y may be any of the polypeptide sequences disclosed in the sequence listing) are sufficiently accurate and otherwise suitable for a variety of uses well known in the art and described further below. For instance, SEQ ID NO:X is useful for designing nucleic acid hybridization probes that will detect nucleic acid sequences contained in SEQ ID NO:X or the cDNA contained in the deposited clone. These probes will also hybridize to nucleic acid molecules in biological samples, thereby enabling a variety of forensic and diagnostic methods of the invention. Similarly, polypeptides identified from SEQ ID NO:Y may be used, for example, to generate antibodies which bind specifically to proteins containing the polypeptides and the secreted proteins encoded by the cDNA clones identified in Table 1A and\/or elsewhere herein.","Nevertheless, DNA sequences generated by sequencing reactions can contain sequencing errors. The errors exist as misidentified nucleotides, or as insertions or deletions of nucleotides in the generated DNA sequence. The erroneously inserted or deleted nucleotides cause frame shifts in the reading frames of the predicted amino acid sequence. In these cases, the predicted amino acid sequence diverges from the actual amino acid sequence, even though the generated DNA sequence may be greater than 99.9% identical to the actual DNA sequence (for example, one base insertion or deletion in an open reading frame of over 1000 bases).","Accordingly, for those applications requiring precision in the nucleotide sequence or the amino acid sequence, the present invention provides not only the generated nucleotide sequence identified as SEQ ID NO:X, and the predicted translated amino acid sequence identified as SEQ ID NO:Y, but also a sample of plasmid DNA containing a human cDNA of the invention deposited with the ATCC\u2122, as set forth in Table 1A. The nucleotide sequence of each deposited plasmid can readily be determined by sequencing the deposited plasmid in accordance with known methods","The predicted amino acid sequence can then be verified from such deposits. Moreover, the amino acid sequence of the protein encoded by a particular plasmid can also be directly determined by peptide sequencing or by expressing the protein in a suitable host cell containing the deposited human cDNA, collecting the protein, and determining its sequence.","Also provided in Table 1A is the name of the vector which contains the cDNA plasmid. Each vector is routinely used in the art. The following additional information is provided for convenience.","Vectors Lambda Zap (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,128,256 and 5,286,636), Uni-Zap XR (U.S. Pat.

corresponding to the clone identifier. The second column in Tables 1B.1 and 1B.2 provides a unique \u201cClone ID:\u201d for the cDNA clone related to each contig sequence disclosed in Tables 1B.1 and 1B.2. This clone ID references the cDNA clone which contains at least the 5\u2032 most sequence of the assembled contig and at least a portion of SEQ ID NO:X was determined by directly sequencing the referenced clone. The referenced clone may have more sequence than described in the sequence listing or the clone may have less. In the vast majority of cases, however, the clone is believed to encode a full-length polypeptide. In the case where a clone is not full-length, a full-length cDNA can be obtained by methods described elsewhere herein. The third column in Tables 1B.1 and 1B.2 provides a unique \u201cContig ID\u201d identification for each contig sequence. The fourth column in Tables 1B.1 and 1B.2 provides the \u201cSEQ ID NO:\u201d identifier for each of the contig polynucleotide sequences disclosed in Tables 1B.1 and 1B.2.","Table 1B.1","The fifth column in Table 1B.1, \u201cORF (From-To)\u201d, provides the location (i.e., nucleotide position numbers) within the polynucleotide sequence \u201cSEQ ID NO:X\u201d that delineate the preferred open reading frame (ORF) shown in the sequence listing and referenced in Table 1B.1, column 6, as SEQ ID NO:Y. Where the nucleotide position number \u201cTo\u201d is lower than the nucleotide position number \u201cFrom\u201d, the preferred ORF is the reverse complement of the referenced polynucleotide sequence. The sixth column in Table 1B.1 provides the corresponding SEQ ID NO:Y for the polypeptide sequence encoded by the preferred ORF delineated in column 5. In one embodiment, the invention provides an amino acid sequence comprising, or alternatively consisting of, a polypeptide encoded by the portion of SEQ ID NO:X delineated by \u201cORF (From-To)\u201d. Also provided are polynucleotides encoding such amino acid sequences and the complementary strand thereto. Column 7 in Table 1B.1 lists residues comprising epitopes contained in the polypeptides encoded by the preferred ORF (SEQ ID NO:Y), as predicted using the algorithm of Jameson and Wolf, (1988) Comp. Appl. Biosci. 4:181-186. The Jameson-Wolf antigenic analysis was performed using the computer program PROTEAN (Version 3.11 for the Power MacIntosh, DNASTAR, Inc., 1228 South Park Street Madison, Wis.). In specific embodiments, polypeptides of the invention comprise, or alternatively consist of, at least one, two, three, four, five or more of the predicted epitopes as described in Table 1B.1. It will be appreciated that depending on the analytical criteria used to predict antigenic determinants, the exact address of the determinant may vary slightly.","Column 8 in Table 1B.1 (\u201cCytologic Band\u201d) provides a chromosomal map location for certain polynucleotides of the invention (e.g., polynucleotides corresponding to SEQ ID NO:X). Chromosomal location was determined by finding exact matches to EST and cDNA sequences contained in the NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) UniGene database. Each sequence in the UniGene database is assigned to a \u201ccluster\u201d; all of the ESTs, cDNAs, and STSs in a cluster are believed to be derived from a single gene. Chromosomal mapping data is often available for one or more sequence(s) in a UniGene cluster; this data (if consistent) is then applied to the cluster as a whole. Thus, it is possible to infer the chromosomal location of a new polynucleotide sequence by determining its identity with a mapped UniGene cluster.","A modified version of the computer program BLASTN (Altshul, et al., J. Mol. Biol. 215:403-410 (1990), and Gish, and States, Nat. Genet. 3:266-272) (1993) was used to search the UniGene database for EST or cDNA sequences that contain exact or near-exact matches to a polynucleotide sequence of the invention (the \u2018Query\u2019). A sequence from the UniGene database (the \u2018Subject\u2019) was said to be an exact match if it contained a segment of 50 nucleotides in length such that 48 of those nucleotides were in the same order as found in the Query sequence. If all of the matches that met this criteria were in the same UniGene cluster, and mapping data was available for this cluster, it is indicated in Table 1B.1 under the heading \u201cCytologic Band\u201d. Where a cluster had been further localized to a distinct cytologic band, that band is disclosed; where no banding information was available, but the gene had been localized to a single chromosome, the chromosome is disclosed.","Once a presumptive chromosomal location was determined for a polynucleotide of the invention, an associated disease locus was identified by comparison with a database of diseases which have been experimentally associated with genetic loci. The database used was the Morbid Map, derived from OMIM\u2122 (\u201cOnline Mendelian Inheritance in Man\u201d; McKusick-Nathans Institute for Genetic Medicine, Johns Hopkins University (Baltimore, Md.) and National Center for Biotechnology Information, National Library of Medicine (Bethesda, Md.) 2000; world wide web at ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/omim\/). If the putative chromosomal location of a polynucleotide of the invention (Query sequence) was associated with a disease in the Morbid Map database, an OMIM reference identification number was noted in column 9, Table 1B.1, labeled \u201cOMIM Disease Reference(s). Table 5 is a key to the OMIM reference identification numbers (Table 5, column 1), and provides a description of the associated disease in Table 5, column 2.","Table 1B.2","Column 5, in Table 1B.2, provides an expression profile and library code:count for each of the contig sequences (SEQ ID NO:X) disclosed in Table 1B.2, which can routinely be combined with the information provided in Table 4 and used to determine the tissues, cells, and\/or cell line libraries which predominantly express the polynucleotides of the invention. The first number in Table 1B.2, column 5 (preceding the colon), represents the tissue\/cell source identifier code corresponding to the code and description provided in Table 4. The second number in column 5 (following the colon) represents the number of times a sequence corresponding to the reference polynucleotide sequence was identified in the corresponding tissue\/cell source. Those tissue\/cell source identifier codes in which the first two letters are \u201cAR\u201d designate information generated using DNA array technology. Utilizing this technology, cDNAs were amplified by PCR and then transferred, in duplicate, onto the array. Gene expression was assayed through hybridization of first strand cDNA probes to the DNA array. cDNA probes were generated from total RNA extracted from a variety of different tissues and cell lines. Probe synthesis was performed in the presence of P dCTP, using oligo (dT) to prime reverse transcription. After hybridization, high stringency washing conditions were employed to remove non-specific hybrids from the array. The remaining signal, emanating from each gene target, was measured using a Phosphorimager. Gene expression was reported as Phosphor Stimulating Luminescence (PSL) which reflects the level of phosphor signal generated from the probe hybridized to each of the gene targets represented on the array. A local background signal subtraction was performed before the total signal generated from each array was used to normalize gene expression between the different hybridizations. The value presented after \u201c[array code]:\u201d represents the mean of the duplicate values, following background subtraction and probe normalization. One of skill in the art could routinely use this information to identify normal and\/or diseased tissue(s) which show a predominant expression pattern of the corresponding polynucleotide of the invention or to identify polynucleotides which show predominant and\/or specific tissue and\/or cell expression.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0527","num":"0526"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00031","num":"00031"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"9"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"8","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"9","colwidth":"91pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE
