No. 07\/632,184, filed Dec. 21, 1990, now abandoned, which claimed priority of Israeli Patent Application No. 92,952, filed Jan. 3, 1990, the contents of all of which are hereby incorporated by reference.","Throughout this application, various references are referred to. Disclosures of these publications in their entireties are hereby incorporated by reference into this application to more fully describe the state of the art to which this invention pertains.","I.","The subject invention is in the field of selective irreversible inhibitors of the enzyme monoamine oxidase (hereinafter MAO) and provides the R(+) enantiomer of N-propargyl-1-aminoindan (also referred to herein as PAI) which is a selective irreversible inhibitor of the B-form of monoamine oxidase enzyme (hereinafter MAO-B). The subject invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions containing R(+)PAI which are particularly useful for the treatment of Parkinson's disease, a memory disorder, dementia, depression, hyperactive syndrome, an affective illness, a neurodegenerative disease, a neurotoxic injury, stroke, brain ischemia, a head trauma injury, a spinal trauma injury, neurotrauma, schizophrenia, an attention deficit disorder, multiple sclerosis, and withdrawal symptoms.","II.","Parkinson's disease is widely considered to be the result of degradation of the pre-synaptic dopaminergic neurons in the brain, with a subsequent decrease in the amount of the neurotransmitter dopamine being released. Inadequate dopamine release, therefore, leads to the onset of disturbances of voluntary muscle control, which disturbances are symptomatic of Parkinson's disease.","Various methods of treating Parkinson's disease have been established and are currently in widespread use, including, for example, the administration of L-DOPA together with a decarboxylase inhibitor such as L-carbidopa or benserazide. The decarboxylase inhibitor protects the L-DOPA molecule from peripheral decarboxylation and thus ensures L-DOPA uptake by the remaining dopaminergic neurons in the striatum of the brain. Here, the L-DOPA is converted into dopamine resulting in increased levels of dopamine in these neurons. In response to physiological impulses, these neurons are therefore capable of releasing larger amounts of dopamine at levels which approximate the normal required levels. L-DOPA treatment thus alleviates the symptoms of the disease and contributes to the well-being of the patient.","However, L-DOPA treatment has its drawbacks, the main one being that its effectiveness is optimal only during the first few years of treatment. After this period, the clinical response diminishes and is accompanied by adverse side effects which include dyskinesia, fluctuation in efficacy throughout the day (\u201con-off effect\u201d) and psychiatric symptoms such as confusional states, paranoia, and hallucinations. This decrease in the effect of L-DOPA treatment is attributed to a number of factors, including the natural progression of the disease, alteration in dopamine receptors as a consequence of increased dopamine production or increased levels of dopamine metabolites, and pharmacokinetic problems of L-DOPA absorption (reviewed by Youdim, et al., Progress in Medicinal Chemistry, 21, 138-167 (1984)).","In order to overcome the drawbacks of L-DOPA treatment, various treatments have been devised in which L-DOPA is combined with MAO inhibitors with the aim of reducing the metabolic breakdown of newly formed dopamine (see for example, Chiese, P., U.S. Pat. No. 4,826,875, issued May 2, 1989).","MAO exists in two forms known as MAO-A and MAO-B which are selective for different substrates and inhibitors. For example, MAO-B more efficiently metabolizes substrates such as 2-phenylethylamine, and is selectively and irreversibly inhibited by (\u2212)-deprenyl as described below.","It should be noted, however, that treatments combining L-DOPA with an inhibitor of both MAO-A and MAO-B are undesirable, as they lead to adverse side effects related to an increased level of catecholamines throughout the neuraxis. Furthermore, complete inhibition of MAO is also undesirable as it potentiates the action of sympathomimetic amines such as tyramine, leading to the so-called \u201ccheese effect\u201d (reviewed by Youdim et al., Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology, ed. by Trendelenburg and Weiner, Springer-Verlag, 90, ch. 3 (1988)). As MAO-B was shown to be the predominant form of MAO in the brain, selective inhibitors for this form are thus considered to be a possible tool for achieving a decrease in dopamine breakdown on the one hand, together with a minimization of the systemic effects of total MAO inhibition on the other.","Many inhibitors of MAO are chiral molecules. Although one enantiomer often shows some stereoselectivity in relative potency towards MAO-A and -B, a given enantiomeric configuration is not always more selective than its mirror image isomer in discriminating between MAO-A and MAO-B.","Table I lists the IC(mmol\/L) of enantiomeric pairs of propargyl amines in a rat brain preparation of MAO. These results show small differences in potency in MAO-B inhibition between the R and S enantiomers. (B. Hazelhoff, et al., Naunyn-Schmeideberg's Arch. Pharmacol., 330, 50 (1985)). Both enantiomers are selective for MAO-B. In 1967, Magyar, et al. reported that R-(\u2212)-deprenyl is 500 times more potent than the S-(+) enantiomer in inhibiting the oxidative deamination of tyramine by rat brain homogenate. (K. Magyar, et al., Act. Physiol. Acad. Sci., Hung., 32, 377 (1967)).","In rat liver homogenate, R-deprenyl is only 15 times as potent as the S enantiomer. In other pharmacological activity assays, such as for the inhibition of tyramine uptake, deprenyl shows different stereoselectivities. The S form is in certain cases the more potent epimer. (J. Knoll and K. Macyar, Advances in Biochemical Psychopharmacology, 5, 393 (1972)).","N-Methyl-N-propargyl-1-aminotetralin (2-MPAT) is a close structural analogue of deprenyl. The absolute stereo-chemistry of 2-MPAT has not been assigned. However, the (+) isomer is selective for MAO-B and the (\u2212) isomer is selective for MAO-A. The difference in potency between the 2-MPAT enantiomers is less than 5-fold. (B. Hazelhoff, et al., id.). The enantiomers of N-propargyl-1-aminotetralin (1-PAT) are also similar in activity. The lack of data in Table I showing clear structure-activity relationships between isolated (+) or (\u2212)-2-MPAT makes it impossible to predict the absolute stereochemistry thereof.","After extensive computer modeling, Polymeropoulos recently predicted that (R)-N-methyl-N-propargyl-1-aminoindan (R-1-MPAI) would be more potent than (S) as a MAO-B inhibitor. (E. Polymeropoulos, Inhibitors of Monoamine Oxidase B, I. Szelenyi, ed., Birkhauser Verlag, p. 110 (1993)). However, experiments described show that R-1-MPAI is a slightly more potent inhibitor of MAO-B than S-1-MPAI, but is an even more potent inhibitor of MAO-A. Both the selectivity between MAO-A and -B and the relative potency of the R and S epimers are low. Thus, contrary to expectations in the art, 1-MPAI is useless as a pharmaceutical agent.","The data presented below demonstrate that high selectivity for MAO of one enantiomer versus the other cannot be predicted. The structure of the MAO active site is not well enough understood to permit the prediction of the relative potency or selectivity of any given compound or pair or enantiomers thereof.","III.","Brain stroke is the third leading cause of death in the developed countries. Survivors often suffer from neurological and motor disabilities. The majority of CNS strokes are regarded as localized tissue anemia following obstruction of arterial blood flow which causes oxygen and glucose deprivation. Occlusion of the middle cerebral artery in the rat (MCAO) is a common experimental procedure that is assumed to represent stroke in humans. It has been proposed that the neurological lesion caused by proximal occlusion of this artery in the rat corresponds to a large focal cerebral infarct in humans (Yamori et al., 1976). This correspondence has been based on similarities between cranial circulation in the two species. Other animal models of stroke have been described by Stefanovich (1983).","The histological changes described by Tamura et al. (1981) who were the first to introduce the MCAO procedure, were commonly seen in the cortex of the frontal (100%), sensimotor (75%) and auditory (75%) areas and to a lesser extent in the occipital lobe cortex (25%). In addition, damage was observed in the lateral segment of the caudate nucleus (100%), and only to a variable extent in its medial portion (38%). Concomitantly, the following disorders were reported in MCAO animals: neurological deficits (Menzies et al., 1992), cognitive disturbances (Yamamoto et al., 1988), brain edema (Young et al., 1993; Matsui et al., 1993; Saur et al., 1993), decreased cerebral blood flow (Teasdale et al., 1983), catecholamine fluctuations. (Cechetto et al., 1989). Any of these disorders might be indicative of the severity and extent of brain damage that follow MCAO in the rat. Conversely, a drug with a potential to limit or abort a given disorder may be considered as a candidate for the treatment of stroke in humans.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE IA"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"IC(mmol\/L) Data for Rat Brain MAO Inhibition by"},{"entry":"Propargylamines"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"147pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"70pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"RELATIVE"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"70pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":["COM-",{},{},"INHIBITION","POTENCY"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"7"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["POUND","REF","EPIMER","A","B","A\/B","A +\/\u2212 B"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"7","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"8"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"28pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"21pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"28pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"21pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"8","colwidth":"21pt","align":"char","char":"."}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["2-MPAI","a","+","140","16","8.8","3","0.2"]},{"entry":[{},{},"\u2212","46","88","0.5"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"7"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"28pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"21pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"28pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":["DEPRENYL","a","S","3600","16","120","R\/S"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"8"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"28pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"21pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"28pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"21pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"8","colwidth":"21pt","align":"char","char":"."}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},{},"R","450","6","75","80","2.6"]},{"entry":["1-MPAI","b","S","70","50","1.4","23","5"]},{"entry":[{},{},"R","3","10","0.3"]},{"entry":["1-PAT","c","S","3800","50","76","4","0.5"]},{"entry":[{},{},"R","900","90","10"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"8","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"a.

"}]}}]}}},"One selective MAO-B inhibitor, (\u2212)-deprenyl, has been extensively studied and used as a MAO-B inhibitor to augment L-DOPA treatment. This treatment with (\u2212)-deprenyl is generally favorable and does not cause the \u201ccheese effect\u201d at doses causing nearly complete inhibition of MAO-B (Elsworth, et al., Psychopharmacology, 57, 33 (1978)). Furthermore, the addition of (\u2212)-deprenyl to a combination of L-DOPA and a decarboxylase inhibitor administered to Parkinsons's patients leads to improvements in akinesia and overall functional capacity, as well as the elimination of \u201con-off\u201d type fluctuations (reviewed by Birkmayer & Riederer in \u201cParkinson's Disease,\u201d Springer-Verlag, pp. 138-149 (1983)). Thus, (\u2212)-deprenyl (a) enhances and prolongs the effect of L-DOPA, and (b) does not increase the adverse effects of L-DOPA treatment.","However, (\u2212)-deprenyl is not without its own adverse sides effects, which include activation of pre-existing gastric ulcers and occasional hypertensive episodes. Furthermore, (\u2212)-deprenyl is an amphetamine derivative and is metabolized to amphetamine and methamphetamines, which substances may lead to undesirable side effects such as increased heart rate (Simpson, Biochemical Pharmacology, 27, 1951 (1978); Finberg, et al., in \u201cMonoamine Oxidase Inhibitors\u2014The State of the Art,\u201d Youdim and Paykel, eds., Wiley, pp. 31-43 (1981)).","Other compounds have been described that are selective irreversible inhibitors of MAO-B but which are free of the undesirable effects associated with (\u2212)-deprenyl. One such compound, namely N-propargyl-1-aminoindan.HCl (racemic PAI.HCl), was described in GB 1,003,686 and GB 1,037,014 and U.S. Pat. No. 3,513,244, issued May 19, 1970. Racemic PAI.HCl is a potent, selective, irreversible inhibitor of MAO-B, is not metabolized to amphetamines, and does not give rise to unwanted sympathomimetic effects.","In comparative animal tests, racemic PAI was shown to have considerable advantages over (\u2212)-deprenyl. For example, racemic PAI produces no significant tachycardia, does not increase blood pressure (effects produced by doses of 5 mg\/kg of (\u2212)-deprenyl), and does not lead to contraction of nictitating membrane or to an increase in heart rate at doses of up to 5 mg\/kg (effects caused by (\u2212)-deprenyl at doses over 0.5 mg\/kg). Furthermore, racemic PAI.HCl does not potentiate the cardiovascular effects of tyramine (Finberg, et al., in \u201cEnzymes and Neurotransmitters in Mental Disease,\u201d pp. 205-219 (1980), Usdin, et al., Eds., Wiley, New York; Finberg, et al. (1981), in \u201cMonoamine oxidase Inhibitors\u2014The State of the Art,\u201d ibid.; Finberg and Youdim, British Journal Pharmacol., 85, 451 (1985)).","One underlying object of this invention was to separate the racemic PAI. compounds and to obtain an enantiomer with MAO-B inhibition activity which would be free of any undesirable side effects associated with the other enantiomer.","Since deprenyl has a similar structure to PAI and it is known that the (\u2212)-enantiomer of deprenyl, i.e. (\u2212)-deprenyl, is considerably more pharmaceutically active than the (+)-enantiomer, the (\u2212) enantiomer of PAI would be expected to be the more active MAO-B inhibitor.","However, contrary to such expectations, upon resolution of the enantiomers, it was found that the (+)-PAI enantiomer is in fact the active MAO-B inhibitor while the (\u2212)-enantiomer shows extremely low MAO-B inhibitory activity. Furthermore, the (+)-PAI enantiomer also has a degree of selectivity for MAO-B inhibition surprisingly higher than that of the corresponding racemic form, and should thus have fewer undesirable side effects in the treatment of the indicated diseases than would the racemic mixture. These findings are based on both in vitro and in vivo experiments as discussed in greater detail infra.","It was subsequently shown that (+)-PAI has the R absolute configuration. This finding was also surprising based on the expected structural similarity of (+)-PAI analogy with deprenyl and the amphetamines.","The high degree of stereoselectivity of pharmacological activity between R(+)-PAI and the S(\u2212) enantiomer as discussed hereinbelow is also remarkable. The compound R(+)-PAI is nearly four orders of magnitude more active than the S(\u2212) enantiomer in MAO-B inhibition. This ratio is significantly higher than that observed between the two deprenyl enantiomers (Knoll and Magyar, Adv. Biochem. Psychopharmacol., 5, 393 (1972); Magyar, et al., Acta Physiol. Acad. Sci. Hung., 32, 377 (1967)). Furthermore, in some physiological tests, (+)-deprenyl was reported to have activity equal to or even higher than that of the (\u2212) enantiomer (Tekes, et al., Pol. J. Pharmacol. Pharm., 40, 653 (1988)).","MPAI is a more potent inhibitor of MAO activity, but with lower selectivity for MAO-B over A (Tipton, et al., Biochem. Pharmacol., 31, 1250 (1982)). As only a small degree of difference in the relative activities of the two resolved enantiomers was surprisingly observed with MPAI, the remarkable behavior of R(+)PAI is further emphasized (See Table 1B).","The subject invention also provides methods of using the pharmaceutically active PAI-enantiomer alone (without L-DOPA) for treatment of Parkinson's disease, a memory disorder, dementia, depression, hyperactive syndrome, an affective illness, a neurodegenerative disease, a neurotoxic injury, brain ischemia, a head trauma injury, a spinal trauma injury, schizophrenia, an attention deficit disorder, multiple sclerosis, or withdrawal symptoms (see review by Youdim, et al., in Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology, Trendelenberg and Wiener, eds., 90\/I, ch. 3 (1988)).","The subject invention further provides a method of using the pharmaceutically active PAI-enantiomer alone for pre-treatment of Parkinson's disease. The subject invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising R(+)PAI and synergistic agents such as levodopa. The use of such agents has been studied with respect to (\u2212)-deprenyl which was shown to be effective when administered alone to early Parkinson's patients, and may also have a synergistic effect in these patients when administered together with \u03b1-tocopherol, a vitamin E derivative (The Parkinson's Study Group, New England J. Med., 321(20), 1364-1371 (1989)).","In addition to its usefulness in treating Parkinson's disease, (\u2212)-deprenyl has also been shown to be useful in the treatment of patients with dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT) (Tariot, et al., Psychopharmacology, 91, 489-495 (1987)), and in the treatment of depression (Mendelewicz and Youdim, Brit. J. Psychiat. 142, 508-511 (1983)). The R(+)PAI compound of this invention, and particularly the mesylate salt thereof, has been shown to restore memory. R(+)PAI thus has potential for the treatment of mentory disorders, dementia, especially of the Alzheimer's type, and hyperactive syndrome in children.","Finally, the subject invention provides highly stable salts of R(+)PAI with superior pharmaceutical properties. The mesylate salt is especially stable, shows unexpectedly greater selectivity, and shows significantly fewer side effects than do the corresponding racemic salts.","The subject invention provides R(+)-N-propargyl-1-aminoindan having the structure: \n\n","The subject invention further provides a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of R(+)-N-propargyl-1-aminoindan.","The subject invention further provides a pharmaceutical composition which comprises a therapeutically effective amount of R(+)-N-propargyl-1-aminoindan or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.","The subject invention further provides a method of treating a subject afflicted with Parkinson's disease which comprises administering to the subject an amount of R(+)-N-propargyl-1-aminoindan or the pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof of the subject invention effective to treat Parkinson's disease in the subject.","The subject invention further provides a method of treating a subject afflicted with a memory disorder which comprises administering to the subject an amount of R(+)-N-propargyl-1-aminoindan or the pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof of the subject invention effective to treat the memory disorder in the subject.","The subject invention further provides a method of treating a subject afflicted with dementia which comprises administering to the subject an amount of R(+)-N-propargyl-1-aminoindan or the pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof of the subject invention effective to treat dementia in the subject.

racemic N-propargyl-1-aminoindan, and isolating the racemic N-propargyl-1-aminoindan formed thereby.","Finally, the subject invention provides a method of preparing an R(+)-N-propargyl-1-aminoindan salt which comprises contacting racemic N-propargyl-1-aminoindan with an optically active acid so as to form two diastereomeric N-propargyl-1-aminoindan salts, and isolating R(+)-N-propargyl-1-aminoindan salt from the diastereomeric N-propargyl-1-aminoindan salts so formed.","The subject invention provides R(+)-N-propargyl-1-aminoindan having the structure: \n\n","As demonstrated in the Experimental Examples hereinbelow, R(+)PAI is nearly 7,000 times more active as an inhibitor of MAO-B than is S(\u2212)PAI. In view of known MAO-B inhibitors in the art which possess low selectivity between MAO-A and MAO-B, and which do not show predictable trends in potency as a function of R or S configuration, the selectivity of R(+)PAI is unexpected.","R(+)PAI may be obtained by optical resolution of racemic mixtures of R- and S-enantiomers of PAI. Such a resolution can be accomplished by any conventional resolution method well known to a person skilled in the art, such as those described in J. Jacques, A. Collet and S. Wilen, \u201cEnantiomers, Racemates and Resolutions,\u201d Wiley, New York (1981). For example, the resolution may be carried out by preparative chromatography on a chiral column. Another example of a suitable resolution method is the formation of diastereomeric salts with a chiral acid such as tartaric, malic, mandelic acid or N-acetyl derivatives of amino acids, such as N-acetyl leucine, followed by recrystallisation to isolate the diastereomeric salt of the desired R enantiomer.","The racemic mixture of R and S enantiomers of PAI may be prepared, for example, as described in GB 1,003,676 and GB 1,037,014. The racemic mixture of PAI can also be prepared by reacting 1-chloroindan with propargylamine. Alternatively, this racemate may be prepared by reacting propargylamine with 1-indanone to form the corresponding imine, followed by reduction of the carbon-nitrogen double bond of the imine with a suitable agent, such as sodium borohydride.","In accordance with this invention, the R enantiomer of PAI can also be prepared directly from the optically active R-enantiomer of 1-aminoindan by reaction with propargyl bromide or propargyl chloride in the presence of an organic or inorganic base, and optionally in the presence of a suitable solvent.","Suitable organic or inorganic bases for use in the above reaction include, by way of example, triethylamine, pyridine, alkali metal carbonates, and bicarbonates. If the reaction is conducted in the presence of a solvent, the solvent may be chosen from, e.g., toluene, methylene chloride, and acetonitrile. One method of preparing R(+)PAI is to react R-1-aminoindan with propargyl chloride using potassium bicarbonate as a base and acetonitrile as solvent.","The above-described reaction of 1-aminoindan generally results in a mixture of unreacted primary amine, the desired secondary amine and the tertiary amine N,N-bispropargylamino product. The desired secondary amine, i.e., N-propargyl-1-aminoindan, can be separated from this mixture by a conventional separation method including, by way of example, chromatography, distillation and selective extraction.","The R-1-aminoindan starting material can be prepared by methods known in the art which include, by way of example, the method of Lawson and Rao, Biochemistry, 19, 2133 (1980), methods in references cited therein, and the method of European Patent No. 235,590.","R-1-aminoindan can also be prepared by resolution of a racemic mixture of the R and S enantiomers, which involves, for example, the tormation of diastereomeric salts with chiral acids, or any other known method such as those reported in J. Jacques, et al., ibid. Alternatively, R-1-aminoindan may be prepared by reacting 1-indanone with an optically active amine, followed by reduction of the carbon nitrogen double bond of the resulting imine by hydrogenation over a suitable catalyst, such as palladium on carbon, platinum oxide or Raney nickel. Suitable optically active amines include, for example, one of the antipodes of phenethylamine or an ester of an amino acid, such as valine or phenylalanine. The benzylic N\u2014C bond may be cleaved subsequently by hydrogenation under non-vigorous conditions.","An additional method for preparing R-1-aminoindan is the hydrogenation of indan-1-one oxime ethers as described above, wherein the alkyl portion of the ether contains an optically pure chiral center. Alternatively, a non-chiral derivative of indan-1-one containing a carbon-nitrogen double bond, such as an imine or oxime, can be reduced with a chiral reducing agent, e.g., a complex of lithium aluminum-hydride and ephedrine.","The subject invention further provides a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of R(+)-N-propargyl-1-aminoindan.","In the practice of this invention, pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, but are not limited to, the mesylate, maleate, fumarate, tartrate, hydrochloride, hydrobromide, esylate, p-toluenesulfonate, benzoate, acetate, phosphate and sulfate salts.","In one embodiment, the salt is selected from the group consisting of the mesylate salt of R(+)-N-propargyl-1-aminoindan, the esylate salt of R(+)-N-propargyl-1-aminoindan, and the sulfate salt of R(+)-N-propargyl-1-aminoindan.","As demonstrated in the Experimental Examples hereinbelow, the mesylate salt is highly stable to thermal degradation, and shows unexpectedly superior selectivity for MAO-B over the racemic salt.","For the preparation of pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of the compound of R(+)PAI, the free base can be reacted with the desired acids in the presence of a suitable solvent by conventional methods. Similarly, an acid addition salt may be converted to the free base form in a known manner.","A preferred mode of preparing the mesylate salt of (R)-PAI comprises (a) adding an aqueous solution of 15% sodium hydroxide to a solution of propargyl benzenesulfonate (or tosylate or mesylate) in toluene; (b) stirring for 5 hours; (c) adding additional toluene and water; (d) separating and washing the organic phase with 10% sodium hydroxide, and then diluting with water; (e) adjusting the pH of the mixture to 3.2 by adding 10% aqueous sulfuric acid; (f) separating the aqueous phase and adjusting the pH to 7.3 with 10% sodium hydroxide; (g) extracting three times with toluene while maintaining constant pH; (h) concentrating combined organic layers in vacuo to give a yellow oil; (i) dissolving the oil and L-tartaric acid in isopropanol; (j) heating to reflux for 1 hour; (k) cooling to room temperature and collecting the precipitate by filtration; (1) recrystallizing the crude di-propargylaminoindan tartrate from methanol\/isopropanol (1:1) to give di(R(+)-N-propargyl-1-aminoindan) tartrate; (m) dissolving the tartrate salt and methanesulfonic acid in isopropanol, and heating to reflux for 30 minutes; and (n) cooling to room temperature, and collecting the precipitated R(+)-N-propargyl-1-aminoindan.","The subject invention further provides a pharmaceutical composition which comprises a therapeutically effective amount of R(+)-N-propargyl-1-aminoindan or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.

The supernatant was diluted appropriately in 0.05M phosphate buffer, and pre-incubated with serial dilutions of compounds: R(+)-PAI, S(\u2212)-PAI and racemic PAI for 20 minutes at 37\u00b0 C. C-Labelled substrates (2-phenylethylamine, hereinafter PEA; 5-hydroxytryptamine, hereinafter 5-HT) were then added, and the incubation continued for a further 20 minutes (PEA), or 30-45 minutes (5-HT). Substrate concentrations used were 50 uM (PEA) and 1 mM (5-HT). In the case of PEA, enzyme concentration was chosen so that not more than 10% of the substrate was metabolized during the course of the reaction. The reaction was then stopped by addition of tranylcypromine (to a final concentration of 1 mM), and the incubate filtered over a small column of Amberlite CG-50 buffered to pH 6.3. The column was washed with 1.5 ml water, the eluates pooled and the radioactive content determined by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Since the amine substrates are totally retained on the column, radioactivity in the eluate indicates the production of neutral and acidic metabolites formed as a result of MAO activity. Activity of MAO in the sample was expressed as a percentage of control activity in the absence of inhibitors after subtraction of appropriate blank values. The activity determined using PEA as substrate is referred to as MAO-B, and that determined using 5-HT as MAO-A.","Results","Inhibitory activity of R(+)-PAI, S(\u2212)-PAI and racemic-PAI were examined separately in vitro, and the results of typical experimental runs are shown in .

Activity of MAO in tissues from animals treated with inhibitors was expressed as a percentage of the enzyme activity in a group of control animals administered vehicle (water for oral administration, 0.9% saline for ip injection) and killed as above.","Results","None of the dose levels used with the inhibitor drugs produced any obvious behavioral alteration. The results are depicted in  to . Following i.p. administration, compound R(+)PAI produced 90% inhibition of brain MAO-B activity at a dose of 0.5 mg\/kg. The same dose produced only 20% inhibition of MAO-A activity. By oral administration, the same dose of R(+)PAI produced 80% inhibition of MAO-B with no detectable inhibition of MAO-A. Essentially similar results were seen for inhibition of hepatic MAO, as for brain MAO. The doses producing 50% inhibition of MAO-A and MAO-B (IC-50) were calculated from the inhibition curves, and are shown in Table 2. These data show: (a) that MAO inhibitory activity of R(+)PAI is maintained in vivo in the rat; (b) that selectivity for inhibition of MAO-B, as opposed to MAO-A, by R(+)PAI is maintained in vivo; (c) that the much greater activity of the (+)-enantiomer as opposed to the (\u2212)-enantiomer, is maintained in vivo; (d) that the compounds are effectively absorbed after oral administration; and (e) that the compounds effectively pass the blood-brain barrier, and effectively inhibit brain MAO. The fact that R(+)-PAI was about twice as active as the racemic compound for inhibition of MAO-B is a reflection of the extremely low activity of S(\u2212)-PAI for inhibition of MAO-B.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0188","num":"0190"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00017","num":"00017"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 2"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"IC-50 VALUES (mg\/kg) FOR INHIBITION OF MAO-A"},{"entry":"AND MAO-B BY R(+)-PAI, S(\u2212)-PAI OR RACEMIC-PAI,"},{"entry":"IN THE RAT FOLLOWING INTRAPERITONEAL (I.P.)"},{"entry":"INJECTION OR ORAL ADMINISTRATION (P.O.)"},{"entry":"IC-50 (mg\/kg)"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"77pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"98pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"MAO-A",{}]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"98pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"S (\u2212)",{},{},"MAO-B"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"7"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Compound:","PAI","R (+) PAI","Rac","S (\u2212) PAI","R (+) PAI","Rac"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"7","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"7"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"21pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"21pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"35pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"35pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"28pt","align":"char","char":"."}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["I.P.

A crucial initial step in the mechanism of its neurotoxicity involves conversion of MPTP to its toxic metabolite 1-methyl-4-phenyl pyridinium ion (MPP+). This reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme MAO-B and probably takes place outside of dopaminergic neurons, mainly in glia. It is known that MPTP is both a substrate and an irreversible inhibitor of MAO-B. Pretreatment of experimental animals with MAO-B inhibitors such as deprenyl or pargyline protects against and prevents the MPTP-induced damage to nigrostriatal neurons because the oxidative conversion of MPTP to MPP+ is blocked. The progressive nigrostriatal degeneration in Parkinson's may be due to exposure to environmentally-derived exogenous MPTP-like neurotoxins. In such cases, there is an additional strong indication of initiation of sustained treatment with an MAO-B inhibitor from the very early stages of Parkinson's disease in the hope that it will neutralize the damaging effects of such yet putative MPTP-toxins, and thus arrest or slow down the progression of the illness. A successful MAO-B inhibitor drug is currently judged by its ability to block MPTP-induced damage to nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons in vivo. The (\u2212) and (+) enantiomers of PAI were therefore tested for their potency in preventing or attenuating the MPTP-induced striatal dopamine depletions in mice.","Experimental Protocol","Male C57 black mice (20-25 g weight) were (a) injected with MPTP.HCl (30 mg\/kg dissolved in distilled water, s.c.), or vehicle alone, or one hour after pretreatment with the (\u2212) or (+) isomers of PAI (2.5 mg\/kg, i.p.), or with deprenyl (5 mg\/kg, i.p.), and (b) decapitated 5 days later. Brains were removed and corpora striata dissected on an ice-cold glass plate and frozen on dry ice. Striatal tissues were homogenized in 0.1 M perchloric acid, and deproteinized aliquots containing dihydroxybenzylamine as an internal standard were assayed for dopamine and its major metabolite 3,4-dihydroxy-phenylacetic acid (DOPAC) using HPLC with electrochemical detection.","Results","Table 4 shows the results of this experiment. Treatment with MPTP alone produced marked striatal dopamine (DA) and DOPAC depletions. Treatment with the (\u2212) and (+) enantiomers of PAI or with (\u2212) deprenyl did not affect striatal DA concentrations. Pretreatment with the (\u2212) isomer of PAI did not affect the MPTP-induced DA and DOPAC levels in the striatum. The (+)-isomer of PAI given before MPTP completely abolished the reduction in striatal DA and DOPAC levels produced by the toxin.

Of these three salts, mesylate is preferable due to its excellent stability even under destructive conditions.","Male, ICR mice 25-30 g each, were pretreated with either of the following drugs: Saline, (R)-PAI mesylate, or racemic-PAI mesylate. All drugs were administered i.p. in a volume of 0.2 mL. Two hours later, haloperidol was injected s.c. at a dose of 6 mg\/kg in a volume of 0.1-0.2 mL. Motor coordination tests were made at 3 hours after giving haloperidol, that is, 5 hours after administering the presumed protective drugs.","Motor coordination tests and rigidity were quantified according to three different parameters: (a) ability to walk the length of a horizontal rod, 80 cm-long; (b) ability to climb down, face down, a vertical rod, 80 cm-long; (c) duration of immobility in an unnatural sitting posture whereby the abdomen of the mouse is pressed against a \u201cwall.\u201d Full performance as in haloperidol-untreated mice is given the score of 4 in each test, or a total of 12 in all tests. Poor performance is given a score from 1 to 3. A key to score ratings is given in Table 9A. The effects of the various agents in antagonizing haloperidol-induced catalepsy are given in Table 11. At three hours after haloperidol, (R)-PAI mesylate conferred protection against haloueridol at 5-15 mg\/kg, reaching a peak after effect at 7.5-10 mg\/kg (activity score\u201494% of saline control). Racemic PAI mesylate conferred partial protection in the range of 7.5-15 mg\/kg, and was not active at 5 mg\/kg. From , it can been seen that the dose-effect profile of either (R)-PAI mesylate or racemic PAI is such that an increase in dose beyond 10 mg\/kg entails a decrease in effect, but that the racemic mixture is less potent throughout. This means that racemic PAI mesylate at twice the dose of (R)-PAI mesylate will always be less active than the (R) enantiomer.","Reversal of \u03b1-MpT-Induced Hypokinesia in Rats","The drug \u03b1-MpT is assumed to inhibit the formation of L-DOPA from tyrosine, and consequently the formation of dopamine itself. Lack of CNS dopamine is expressed as hypoactivity. Six month-old male Wistar rats (from Harlan Orkack, UK) were pretreated with saline, (R)-PAI Mesylate or Rac PAI Mesylate, at the indicated doses. Two hours later they received i.p. \u03b1-MpT at a dose of 100 mg\/kg in 0.3-0.5 mL. Controls received saline. Following this, motor activity was recorded in a computerized activity cage for the duration of 10 hours. The results are given in Table 12 and FIG. . At 2 mg\/kg, (R)-PAI Mesylate restored the level of activity to about 90% of the saline-treated rats, but Rac PAI Mesylate was not active. In either case, the profile of the dose-effect curve was bell-shaped, suggesting a decrease in effect with an increase in dose beyond a peak of 2-5 mg\/kg. At 5 mg\/kg Rac PAI Mesylate could not elicit a level of activity comparable to that of (R)-PAI Mesylate at 2 mg\/kg.","From these measurements, (R)-PAI Mesylate and Rac PAI Mesylate do not share a similar pattern of activity in the restoration of normokinesia in haloperidol-treated mice and \u03b1-Mpt-treated rats. At all doses studied, (R)-PAI Mesylate is always more potent that Rac PAI Mesylate at the corresponding dose. Also, peak activity of Rac PAI Mesylate is always lower than peak activity of (R)-PAI Mesylate. Thus, Rac PAI Mesylate at a given dose is always less effective than (R)-PAI Mesylate at half the same dose. Doubling the dose of Rac PAI Mesylate with respect to (R)-PAI Mesylate does not produce an effect equivalent to that of (R)-PAI Mesylate.","Pharmacologically, Rac PAI Mesylate cannot be considered as consisting of 50% active ingredient which is (R)-PAI Mesylate and 50% inert material as diluent. The presence of (S)-PAI in Rac PAI Mesylate has an adverse effect on the activity of (R)-PAI, resulting in a more than two-fold decrease in potency. The decrease may be due to a direct adverse effect of (S)-PAI on behavioral parameters.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0243","num":"0245"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00026","num":"00026"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 11"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"REVERSAL OF HALOPERIDOL-INDUCED CATALEPSY"},{"entry":"IN MICE WITH (R)-PAI MESYLATE AND RACEMIC"},{"entry":"MESYLATE"},{"entry":"Mice received each of the test drugs i.p. at"},{"entry":"the indicated doses.

Induction of Trauma","Head trauma was induced in male rats under ether anesthesia by a well calibrated weight-drop device that falls over the exposed skull, covering the left cerebral hemisphere, 1-2 mm lateral to the midline, in the midcoronal plane.","2. Evaluation of Motor Function","One hour after induction of trauma, the rats were tested by a set of criteria which evaluated their neurologic outcome (the criteria described by Shohami, et al., J. Neurotrauma, 10, 113 (1993)). These criteria, referred to as the Neurological Severity Score (NSS), consist of a series of reflexes and motor functions. Points are given based on deficits in these criteria. At 24 h the rats were re-evaluated.","3. Evaluation of Brain Edema","The brains were removed after the second evaluation of motor function (24 h). A piece of tissue (\u221220 mg) was weighed to yield wet weight (WW). After drying in a desiccator oven for 24 h at 95\u00b0 C., it was reweighed to yield dry weight (DW). Water percentage in the tissue was calculated as (WW-DW)\u00d7100\/WW.","4. Drug Treatment","(R)-PAI Mesylate was dissolved in water. The rats were injected intraperitoneally at a dose of 0.1 mg\/kg, 0, 4, 8 and 12 h after induction of head trauma. Control rats were treated with water at the same times.","Results","The NSS, which measures the \u201cclinical\u201d status of the rats, was almost identical in the treated and nontreated groups at 1 hour after the head injury, but significantly lower at 24 hours in the (R)-PAI mesylate-treated rats (Table 13). These results indicate that PAI mesylate is effective in improving motor function recovery following closed head injury in rats.","At 24 hours after trauma, a major edema was found in the hemisphere (85.4% water in the brain of control rats vs. 78.5% in undamaged brain tissue). PAI mesylate was effective in reducing edema as verified by its effect on the percent of water.","In conclusion, the results reported herein demonstrate that (R)-PAI mesylate has neuroprotective properties in a model intended to mimic human nerve injury and to induce trauma to a closed skull.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0254","num":"0256"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00029","num":"00029"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"7pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},"TABLE 13"]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"NSS",{},"\u0394 NSS","% HO"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"1 h","24 h","(1 h-24 h)","in the brain"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"6"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"control","15.6","12.3","4.3 \u00b1 0.5","85.4 \u00b1 0.4"]},{"entry":[{},"(n = 6)"]},{"entry":[{},"(R)-PAI","16.7","10.2","6.5 \u00b1 0.7*","82.1 \u00b1 0.6**"]},{"entry":[{},"Mesylate"]},{"entry":[{},"(n = 6)"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"*P < 0.05 (Mann Whitney U-test) "]},{"entry":[{},"**P < 0.005 (t-test) "]}]}}]}}},"Results of in Vitro Assays","Procedures: Cultures of mechanically dissociated neonatal rat cerebellum.

The cerebella are then dissociated after 20-25 passages through a sterile 13 gauge, 10 cm long stainless steel needle attached to a 5 ml syringe with an inserted 45 \u03bcm pore size nylon sieve. The dissociated cells are centrifuged at 200 g for 5 minutes, the supernatant discarded and the cells resuspended in enriched medium. The cell viability is determined by the trypan blue exclusion test. The cells are then plated at a density of 200\/mmon poly-L-lysine-coated surfaces (Poly-L-lysine-coated glass coverslips are prepared at least 1 hour before plating, by immersing in a sterile distilled water solution containing 15 \u03bcg\/ml poly-L-lysine, and just before use, washing with sterile water and drying), covered with enriched medium, and incubated at 37\u00b0 C. in an atmosphere of 5% COin air and 100% humidity. After 4 days in culture, the media are replaced with media containing the desired test compounds. Experiments are done in duplicate and repeated 2 or 3 times. After determining the test compound toxic dose-response, four groups are compared: (I) control (enriched medium alone), (II) test compound (one subgroup for each concentration (2 concentrations are tested)), (III) N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA, exposure to a concentration of 1 mM for 3 h) as the cytotoxic challenge, (IV) test compound plus NMDA (one subgroup for each of the 2 concentrations of test compounds), (V) control group to test the effect of solvent (in which the test compound is dissolved), and (VI) an additional \u201cpositive control\u201d group of spermine (0.01 \u03bcM dissolved in culture medium) plus NMDA.

Short-term effects were measured metabolically, and long-term effects electrophysiologically.","Methods","1. Metabolic Measurements","a) General. The method is described by Yoles, et al., Investigative Ophthalmology & Visual Science, 33, 3586-91 (1992). At short terms, metabolic measurements were monitored in terms of the mitochondrial NADH\/NAD ratio, which depends on the activity of the electron transport system, and thus indicate levels of energy production. Changes in ability of the nerve to produce energy as a consequence of injury were determined by comparing NADH levels in response to artificial transient anoxic insult before and after the injury.","b) Surface fluorometry\u2014reflectometry. Monitoring of the intramitochondrial NADH redox state is based on the fact that NADH, unlike the oxidized form NAD, fluoresces when illuminated at 450 nm. A flexible Y-shaped bundle of optic fibers (light guide) was used to transmit the light to and from the optic nerve. The light emitted from the nerve was measured at two wavelengths: 366 nm (reflected light) and 450 nm (fluorescent light). Changes in the reflected light were correlated with changes in tissue absorption caused by hemodynamic effects and with movements of the optic nerve secondary to alterations in arterial blood pressure and nerve volume. The fluorescence measurements were found to be adequately corrected for NADH redox state measurements by subtraction of the reflected light (366 nm) from the fluorescent light (1:1 ratio) to obtain the corrected fluorescence signal.","c) Animal preparation. Animal utilization was in accord with the ARVO Resolution on the use of animals in research. Male Sprague-Dawley (SPD) rats weighing 300-400 g were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbitone (50 mg\/kg intraperitoneally). With the animal's head held in place by a head holder, a lateral canthotomy was performed under a binocular operating microscope and the conjuctiva was incised lateral to the cornea. After separation of the retractor bulbi muscles, the optic nerve was identified and a length of 3-3.5 mm was exposed near the eyeball by blunt dissection. The dura was left intact and care was taken not to injure the nerve. A special light-guide holder was implanted around the optic nerve in such a way that the light guide was located on the surface of the optic nerve 1 mm distal to the injury site. Animals, while still anesthetized, were allowed to recover for 30 minutes from the surgical procedures and were then exposed to anoxic conditions. An anoxic state was achieved by having the rat breathe in an atmosphere of 100% nitrogen for 2 minutes, after which time it was returned to air. In order to evaluate the metabolic activity of the optic nerve, the relative changes in reflected and fluorescent light intensities in response to anoxia were measured before and after crush injury.","d) Experimental protocol for crush injury and metabolic measurements. With the aid of calibrated cross-section forceps, a moderate crush injury was inflicted on the nerve between the eye and the light guide holder at a pressure corresponding to 120 g for 30 sec. Immediately after injury, animals received intraperitoneal injections of water with and without (R)-PAI Mesylate (2 mg\/kg). To assess the activity of the energy production system, NADH response to 2 minutes of anoxia was measured in all animals prior to injury, 30 minutes after injury, and thereafter at hourly intervals up to 4 hours (see FIG. ).","2. Electrophysiological Measurements. This method is described by Assia, et al., Brain Res., 476, 205-212 (1989). Animal preparation and optic nerve injury were preferred as in the metabolic studies. Immediately after injury, animals received a single injection of water with or without (R)-PAI Mesylate (0.5 mg\/kg). Fourteen days after injury and treatment, the optic nerves were excised and measured electrophysiologically. Prior to removal of optic nerves for electrophysiological measurement, the rats were deeply anesthetized with 70 mg\/kg pentobarbitone. The skin was removed from the skull and the optic nerves were detached from the eyeballs. Subtotal decapitation was performed and the skull was opened with a rongeur. The cerebrum was displaced laterally, exposing the intracranial portion of the optic nerve. Dissection was at the level of the nerve, which was transferred to vials containing fresh salt solution consisting of NaCl (126 mM), KCl (3 mM), NaHPO(1.25 mM), NaHCO(26 mM), MgSO(2 mM), CaCl(2 mM), and D-glucose (10 mM), and aerated with 95% Oand 5% COat room temperature. The nerves were kept in this solution, in which electrical activity remained stable for at least 3-4 hours. After 0.5 hours of recovery at room temperature, electrophysiological recordings were obtained from the nerve distal to the crush lesion. The nerve ends were then connected to two suction Ag\u2014AgCl electrodes immersed in a bathing solution at 37\u00b0 C. A stimulating pulse was applied through the electrode at the proximal end and the action potential was recorded by the distal electrode. A Grass SD9 stimulator was used for supramaximal electrical stimulation (0.5 pps). The measured signal was transmitted to a Medelec PA36 preamplifier and then to an electromyograph (Medelec MS7, AA7T amplifier). The solution, stimulator and amplifier had a common ground. The maximum amplitude of eight averaged compound action potentials (CAPs) was recorded and photographed with a Polaroid camera.

In mice (i.p. administration) in the maximal electroshock test (MES test), (S)-PAI HCl has greater anticonvulsant activity (ED=57 mg\/kg) than (R)-PAI HCl (ED=79 mg\/kg). Analogous results were observed in rats (p.o. administration). Four out of four rats were protected from seizures in the MES test when 50 mg\/kg of (S)-PAI HCl was administered, whereas three out of four mice were protected after the same dose of (R)-PAI HCl. With respect to efficacy for Parkinson's disease, the enhanced anticonvulsant activity is a detrimental side effect. The same trend occurs with the mesylate salts. (S)-PAI Mesylate has greater anticonvulsant activity than (R)-PAI Mesylate in the MES test. At doses of 100 mg\/kg, (S)-PAI Mesylate protected three out of three mice, whereas only one out of three mice was protected with (R)-PAI Mesylate.","The MES test is a classical model to indicate efficacy for partial and generalized seizures in humans. The agents' mechanism of action is via their ability to prevent the spread of seizures. Some agents, however, that prevent seizure spread have the side effect of lowering seizure threshold. These agents therefore have both proconvulsive and anticonvulsive side effects.","Results herein show that (S)-PAI Mesylate has proconvulsive activity. In the Timed Intravenous Infusion of Metrazol test, 141 mg\/kg of (S)-PAI Mesylate reduces the time, and therefore the amount of Metrazol, required to induce the appearance of both the first focal seizure and the onset of clonus. Other agents that are classically used for partial and generalized seizures, such as phenytoin and carbamazepine, do not show this effect. (H. J. Kupferberg, Epilepsia, 30, s51-s56 (1989)). Likewise, (S)-PAI Mesylate showed a significantly higher acute neurotoxicity than (R)-PAI Mesylate. At 300 mg\/kg, (R)-PAI Mesylate did not show any neurotoxicity with mice in the rotorod ataxia test. With (S)-PAI Mesylate, four out of four mice showed neurotoxicity and spasticity.","Methods","TD(median toxic dose). This test measures neurological deficits by the rotorod ataxia test. A mouse is placed on a knurled rod rotating at 6 rpm. It is then determined whether a mouse has the ability to maintain its equilibrium and stay on the rod for one minute in each of three trials.","Timed Intravenous Infusion of Metrazol Test. This test measures the minimal seizure threshold of each animal. Metrazol is infused at 0.185 mg\/ml into the tail veins of mice. The time is then recorded (sec) from the start of infusion until the appearance of the first twitch (first focal seizure) and onset of clonus (clonic seizure). Proconvulsants require less Metrazol to produce these symptoms and therefore show endpoints at a shorter period of time.","Peripheral effects of the hydrochloride salts of the enantiomers of PAI were determined in isolated rabbit or guinea-pig small intestine. These observations provide useful information on their relative peripheral side effects in humans. The first point of contact of the subject with an orally administered drug is the gastrointestinal tract where concentrations of the drug are much higher than after absorption and distribution. In the case of PAI hydrochloride (MW=208), a 10 mg oral dose contained in a liquid volume of about 100 ml would be equivalent to a concentration of about 0.5 mM. In contrast, the therapeutic plasma concentration of (R)-PAI hydrochloride is in the nanomolar range.","The effect of the enantiomers of PAI in the isolated rabbit jejunum and the guinea-pig ileum were determined so as to find out whether the intake of (S)-PAI together with (R)-PAI (as found in racemic PAI) would produce side effects absent in the administration of pure (R)-PAI. (R)-PAI is the preferred enantiomer for the inhibition ox MAO-B in the brain, in view of its potency and high selectivity towards this form of the enzyme. (S)-PAI is much less potent than (R)-PAI in this respect and is also not selective toward MAO-B. In principle, its presence in PAI racemate might be tolerated or overlooked provided (S)-PAI is inert at the recommended doses of (R)-PAI. The results provided in Tables 16-19 show that (S)-PAI is not an inert substance. On the contrary, in the guinea-pig ileum, it is a more potent relaxant than (R)-PAI. Hence its peripheral effects cannot be discounted as negligible. These data show that there would be fewer peripheral side effects in the administration of pure (R)-PAI than in the administration of racemic PAI containing an equivalent dose of (R)-PAI.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0277","num":"0279"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00032","num":"00032"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 16"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"TYRAMINE POTENTIATION BY EACH OF THE TWO"},{"entry":"ENANTIOMERS OF PAI HCl IN RATE JEJUNUM"},{"entry":"PREPARATION"},{"entry":"A stretch of rabbit jejunum, mounted in an organ bath,"},{"entry":"displays rhythmic contractions that are inhibited by"},{"entry":"norepinephrine but not by tyramine.

Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion (MCAO) in the Rat.","A modification of the procedure described by Tamura et al (1981) was used. Male Wistar rats (Olac England-Jerusalem) 300-400 g each were anesthetized with a solution of Equitesine administered i.p. at a dose of 3 mL\/kg. Equitesine consists of 13.5 mL sodium pentothal solution (60 mg\/mL), 3.5 g chloral hydrate, 1.75 g MgSO, 33 mL propylene glycol, 8.3 mL absolute alcohol made up to 83 mL with distilled water. Surgery was performed with the use of a high magnification operating microscope, model SMZ-2B, type 102 (Nikon, Japan). In order to expose the left middle cerebral artery, a cut was made in the temporal muscle. The tip of the coronoid process of mandible was excised as well and removed with a fine rongeur. Craniectomy was made with a dental drill at the junction between the median wall and the roof of the inferotemporal fossa. The dura matter was opened carefully using a 27 gauge needle. The MCA was permanently occluded by microbipolar coagulation at low power setting, beginning 2-3 mm medial to the olfactory tract between its corzical branch to the rhinal cortex and the laterate striate arteries.","After coagulation, the MCA was severed with microscissors and divided to ensure complete occlusion. Following this, the temporalis muscle was sutured and laid over the craniectomy site. The skin was closed with a running 3-0 silk suture. A sham craniectomy operation was performed on a parallel group of rats, but without cauterization of the MCA. During the entire surgical operation (20-25 min) in either group, body temperature was maintained at 37 to 38\u00b0 C. by means of a body-temperature regulator (Kyoristsu, Japan) consisting of a self-regulating heating pad connected to a rectal thermistor. At 24 hours post surgery a neurological score was taken in order to assess the severity of the injury in the drug-treated rats with respect to their untreated controls. At 48 hours, the animals were anesthetized with Equitesine and the severity of the injury was visualized by an MRI procedure. The volume of brain tissue incurring damage following ischemia was determined.","1.2. Drug Administration","[R](+)PAI Mesylate was administered as an i.p. injection in 0.3-0.4 mL distilled water, according to the following schedule:\n\n","All experiments were performed using a 4.7 T BIOSPEC system (BRUKER) (See T. Back, et al., \u201cDiffusion Nuclear Magnetic Resnonance Imaging in Experimental Stroke: Correlation with Cerebral Metabolites,\u201d (February 1994) 25: 494-500). Forty-eight hours after MCAO or sham operation, every animal was subjected to a fast multislices T1 weighted imaging (TR\/TE), (500\/25) for positioning. Then multislices T2-weighted images (3000\/80) were acquired (5 contiguous slices, 3 mm thick).","The size and severity of the infarcted area was estimated using the hyperintensity observed in the T2 weighted MRI at 48 hours post-occlusion or post sham-operation. The following MRI parameters were determined for each group of rats:\n\n","The use of contiguous slices allows the conversion of area units into volume units by simply multiplying the area value by the slice thickness.","1.4. Neurological Score","The neurological score consists of the sum total of a series of ratings assigned to the performance of specific locomotor activities in a given rat. The scale runs from 0 (fully normal rats) to 13 (fully incapacitated rats). Most parameters are rated as either 0 (normal), or 1 (incapacitated); others are graded. The following tests were used in the present study:","General Observational Tests: Hypoactivity; Sedation; Piloerection","Motor reflex. Rats were lifted by the tail about 15 cm above the floor. Normal rats assume a posture in which they extend both forelimbs towards the floor and spread the hind limbs to the sides in a trapeze-like manner.

This is seen as the ability to grasp a rod 1 cm in diameter by the contralateral limb for 5-15 sec when the rat is left hanging on the rod through the arm pit.","Motor coordination. Normal rats are able to walk up and down a beam 5 cm wide placed at a moderate slant. Failure to walk the beam in either direction reveals some motor incoordination, lack of balance and limb weakness.","Gait.
