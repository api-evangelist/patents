{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application is a continuation of currently pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13\/443,418, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.","This invention was made with government support under contract numbers: N66001-00-C-8003 and N66001-04-C-8032 of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). The government has certain rights to this invention.","1. Technical Field","The invention generally relates to the integrated circuit fabrication and, more specifically, to bonding of substrates having metal-dielectric patterns.","2. Background Art","In the integrated circuit fabrication industry, substrate bonding is used to join various parts of an integrated circuit (IC) together. Thermal-compression bonding is one type of bonding that is advantageous because it allows the use of metals at the bonding interface rather than just dielectrics. The metallic surface serves as a good bonding medium, and also provides additional functionality such as electrical signal propagation and thermal spreading. Unfortunately, thermal compression bonding presents many challenges in order to achieve a good quality bond.","One challenge is optimizing process parameters. Process parameters may include, for example, surface preparation before bonding such as cleans and wetting treatments, process conditions during bonding such as temperature, pressure, force, time, etc., and post-bonding treatments such as thermal cycles.","Another challenge is addressing patterned metal-dielectric mating surfaces that typically include topography, which prevents a reliable bond. In particular, metal-dielectric patterning is conventionally formed using damascene processing. Damascene processing involves fabricating interconnect metal lines by forming and filling trenches in a dielectric, and attempting to planarize the surface by chemical-mechanical polishing (CMP). Bonding of patterned surfaces takes place after the CMP step. CMP, however, leaves the metal surface non-uniform, e.g., the metal is typically concave and non-planar relative to the dielectric. As a result, the topographical differences between bonding metallic surfaces presents a challenge. Conventionally, the heating process during the bonding, which causes the reflow of the metallic pattern, has been considered sufficient to cause bonding. Unfortunately, the non-uniformity and the difference in the distances between bonding metallic surfaces does not always allow for adequate bonding via reflow, resulting in low yields.","Bonding of substrates including metal-dielectric patterns on a surface with the metal raised above the dielectric is disclosed. One method includes providing a first substrate having a metal-dielectric pattern on a surface thereof; providing a second substrate having a metal-dielectric pattern on a surface thereof; performing a process resulting in the metal being raised above the dielectric in at least one of the substrates; cleaning the metal; and bonding the first substrate to the second substrate. A related structure is also disclosed. The bonding of raised metal provides a strong bonding medium, and good electrical and thermal connections enabling creation of three dimensional integrated structures with enhanced functionality.","A first aspect of the invention includes a method comprising: providing a first substrate having a metal-dielectric pattern on a surface thereof; providing a second substrate having a metal-dielectric pattern on a surface thereof; performing a process resulting in the metal being raised above the dielectric in at least one of the substrates; cleaning the metal; and bonding the first substrate to the second substrate.","A second aspect of the invention includes a structure comprising: a substrate including a dielectric having a metal therein, the metal extending above a surface of the dielectric and including an upper surface having at least a portion thereof in a substantially convex form.","A third aspect of the invention includes a method comprising: providing a first substrate having a metal-dielectric pattern on a surface thereof;

cleaning the metal; bonding the first substrate to the second substrate; and annealing the first substrate and the second substrate.","A fourth aspect of the invention includes a method comprising: providing a first substrate including a dielectric having a metal-dielectric pattern on a surface thereof with metal recessed; providing a second substrate having a metal-dielectric pattern on a surface thereof with dielectric recessed below metal by performing chemical mechanical polishing of the dielectric, and performing an etch;

and a metal positioned substantially below the dielectric below the dielectric of the second substrate, wherein the first substrate and the second substrate are bonded at the metal from the first substrate and the metal from the second substrate.","A seventh aspect of the invention includes a structure having: a first substrate having a metal-dielectric pattern on a surface thereof, the metal-dielectric pattern including: a metal having a concave upper surface;
