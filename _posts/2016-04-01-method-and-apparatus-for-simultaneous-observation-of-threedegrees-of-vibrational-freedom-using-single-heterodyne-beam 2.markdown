title: Method and apparatus for simultaneous observation of three-degrees of vibrational freedom using single heterodyne beam
abstract: A laboratory system has demonstrated the measurement of three degrees of vibrational freedom simultaneously using a single beam through heterodyne speckle imaging. The random interference pattern generated by the illumination of a rough surface with coherent light can be exploited to extract information about the surface motion. The optical speckle pattern is heterodyne mixed with a coherent reference. The recorded optical data is then processed to extract three dimensions of surface motion. Axial velocity is measured by demodulating the received time-varying intensity of high amplitude pixels. Tilt, a gradient of surface velocity, is calculated by measuring speckle translation following reconstruction of the speckle pattern from the mixed signal.

Various techniques are utilized to observe surface motion. These techniques include, but are not limited to heterodyne laser Doppler vibrometry (e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,834,111 A Khanna et al.) for observation of surface velocity in the axial dimension of the interrogation beam, shearography (e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,011,280 A Hung) for observation of the gradient of displacement in two dimensions, electronic speckle pattern interferometry (e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,018,531 A Leendertz) for in-plane or out of plane displacement or out of plane displacement gradients, and speckle pattern imaging for out of plane displacements. The techniques listed are generally used for observation of one or two degrees of freedom. Variations using multiple coherent beams (e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 7,242,481 B2 Shpantzer et al.) have been used to observe three degrees of freedom.","It is of interest to simultaneously observe three-degrees of freedom using a single coherent beam.","The current invention combines elements of heterodyne Doppler vibrometry and digital speckle photography along with signal processing routines to simultaneously observe velocity in the axial dimension of the interrogation beam and out of plane tilts of the illuminated region. This provides the ability to observe three-degrees of freedom using a single coherent beam.","The disclosure relates to measuring the motion of a surface plane by imaging optical speckle that has been modulated by a heterodyne process. A process takes the sequence of heterodyne images and extracts motion with three degrees of freedom. The device takes advantage of a probing optical field that illuminates the rough surface. The spatial optical field is described based on previous work. (See, e.g., P. Hariharan, Basics of Interferometry, Academic Press, 2007; P. Jacquot and J. M. Fournier, Interferometry in Speckle Light: Theory and Applications, Springer, 2000; H. J. Tiziani, \u201cAnalysis of Mechanical Oscillations by Speckling,\u201d Applied Optics, vol. 11, no. 12, pp. 2911-2917, 1972; and R. Jones and C. Wykes, \u201cHolographic and Speckle Interferometry,\u201d Cambridge University Press, 1983.) These models are typically independent of time, but this invention takes advantage of surface motion that affects the probe beam by causing a phase shift due to path length change over time. The invention adds an optical frequency shift to observe these phase and amplitude shifts creating a heterodyne system.","The moving surface alters the path length of a probe beam in time. To aid in understanding this invention, it is useful to define the geometry of this moving surface. This surface is described in a {\u03be,\u03b7,z} coordinate system, where \u03be and \u03b7 are in the surface plane and z is orthogonal to the plane. The sensor can determine two types of motion; out of plane pistoning in the axial direction z, and tilting of the plane in two directions. Out of plane motion results in a Doppler phase shift and tilting results in a translation of the speckle image. (See, e.g., R. Jones and C. Wykes, \u201cHolographic and Speckle Interferometry,\u201d Cambridge University Press, 1983, incorporated herein by reference.) A single dimension of tilting \u03b8 is presented to simplify illustration, however, the addition of a second tilting degree-of-freedom \u03c6 parallels the picture below and is superimposed in the section detailing the invention. The moving surface has a pivot point that is allowed to translate in the z direction, but is otherwise located at a fixed position \u03be=\u03be. The position of a scattering point P, originally on the z=0 plane at {\u03be,0,0}, will be moved to a new location P, . This motion extends the path length of reflected light; the path length is used to determine the speckle image resulting from these two locations in a method paralleling Tiziani. (See, e.g., H. J. Tiziani, \u201cAnalysis of Mechanical Oscillations by Speckling,\u201d Applied Optics, vol. 11, no. 12, pp. 2911-2917, 1972, incorporated herein by reference.)","In one aspect, an exemplary heterodyne speckle imaging sensor system is disclosed. In another aspect, an exemplary method for simultaneous observation of three-degrees of vibrational freedom is disclosed based on a heterodyne speckle imaging sensor system.","Finally, an exemplary signal processing method is disclosed for computing three-degrees of vibrational freedom using a heterodyne beam. Such a signal processing method comprises the steps of accessing a complete measurement of temporal spatial irradiance data obtained using a heterodyne beam as stored as pixel frames of image data on a computer; high-pass filtering each pixel independently to isolate heterodyne signal from the complete measurement to output heterodyne information at a local oscillator frequency; applying a computation process for sequential estimates of a detected probe speckle pattern amplitude to compute two dimensions of tilt based on time sequences; applying a parallel demodulation process based on an arctangent demodulation for Doppler shifted heterodyne signals applied to each pixel to calculate z-axis velocity; and displaying a representation of the computed tilt based on time sequences and the calculated z-axis velocity on a data display device.","Before entering into the detailed description of one embodiment of the present invention according to the accompanying Figures, the theory of the present invention will be explained hereinafter.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":"100","sub":["0","P","1 "]},"The variation in path length \u0394P due to tilt and translation is a combination of the incoming and outgoing light.
