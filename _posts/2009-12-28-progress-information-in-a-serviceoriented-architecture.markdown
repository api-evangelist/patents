No. 12\/647,815 filed on even date herewith and entitled \u201cProcess-Driven Progress Information in a Service-Oriented Architecture\u201d","Some embodiments relate to a service-oriented architecture to provide software services. More specifically, some embodiments relate to the provision of progress information to a service client during service fulfillment.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0004","num":"0003"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","110","120","110","120"]},"For example, a user may manipulate a user interface of client  to input an instruction (e.g., update inventory). Client , in response, may transmit a corresponding HTTP service request to service-oriented architecture  as illustrated. Service-oriented architecture  conducts any processing required by the request (e.g., updating a list of inventory) and, after completing the processing, provides a response to client .","Client  does not receive any indication from service-oriented architecture  during the above-mentioned processing. Accordingly, after inputting the instruction and before receiving the response, the user is left to wonder whether any processing is occurring as a result of the instruction, whether service-oriented architecture  is non-responsive, or whether a network error has occurred between client  and service-oriented architecture . Service requests which require lengthy processing exacerbate this dilemma.","Due to the request\/response nature of HTTP, the foregoing cannot be addressed simply by programming service-oriented architecture  to send some sort of progress indicator to client . Accordingly, what is needed is a system to provide meaningful progress information to a client of a service-oriented architecture.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["200","200","210","220","210"]},"Generally, business process platform  may provide services to client  according to some embodiments. Such services may comprise Web services and client  may therefore comprise a Web client. Examples of a Web client include, but are not limited to, a Web browser, an execution engine (e.g., JAVA, Flash, Silverlight) to execute associated code in a Web browser, and a dedicated standalone application.","Business process platform  includes software work process  and software work process . Each of software work processes  and  may independently execute tasks required of business process platform . Business process platform  may support more than two simultaneous software work processes according to some embodiments.","Business process platform  also includes shared memory , which may be implemented in Random Access Memory, persistent storage (e.g., hard disks) and\/or in any other suitable electronic memory. Each of software work processes  and  is in (i.e., capable of) communication with shared memory .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","210","300","300","300"]},"Initially, an instruction to execute a business process is received from a client application at S. The instruction may comprise a Web service call according to some embodiments. The instruction may be transmitted by the client application in response to user manipulation of a user interface presented by the client application.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","300","220","400","400","210"]},"Therefore, prior to S, the user navigates to user interface  and completes the inputs fields thereof. The user then selects \u201cHire Employee\u201d icon , causing client  to transmit an instruction to business process platform  (e.g., via HTTP) to create a new employee. This instruction is received by business process platform  at S.","The instruction may include a session identifier (e.g., cookie) per the HTTP protocol. Business process platform  assigns the instruction to work process  and the session identifier is associated with the \u201ccreate employee\u201d business process to be performed by work process .","Accordingly, work process  executes the business process at S. Execution of the business process may include, but is not limited to, instantiating, populating and manipulating business objects within business process platform . A business object may comprise a class defining data and methods associated with a business entity. For example, S may include creation of an employee business object, an employment business object, a work agreement business object, a compensation agreement business object, etc., as well as definition of dependencies therebetween.","During execution of the business process, work process  stores corresponding progress information in shared memory . Detailed examples of generation and storage of the progress information are provided below. According to some embodiments, the progress information is stored in shared memory  in association with the session identifier. Such storage enables retrieval of the progress information from shared memory  based on the session identifier.","Next, at S, it is determined whether the business process is complete. If not, flow returns to S to continue execution of the business process as described above. Stated differently, flow cycles between S and S until the business process is complete.","During the aforementioned cycling between S and S, progress information need not be stored into shared memory  continuously. Work process  may store progress information at S only upon determining, based on the ongoing execution of the business process, that the progress information should be updated. The updated progress information is also stored in association with the session identifier at S. It may be preferable to overwrite previously-stored progress information to avoid confusion as to which is most recent.","Process  continues as described above until it is determined at S that the business process is complete. In response, work process  may issue an instruction at S to release the area of shared memory  reserved for storing progress information.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","210","500"]},"Process  may be performed in parallel with process  of . Generally, as progress information is stored and updated in a shared memory according to process , the progress information may be retrieved therefrom and provided to a client application according to process . In some embodiments, the progress information is stored and updated by a first software work process (e.g., work process ) and is retrieved and provided to the client application by a second software work process (e.g., work process ).","Initially, at S, a progress request and a session identifier are received from a client application. For example, client  may send a progress request and the session identifier to business process platform  from the same client session used to send the instruction received at S. Client  may send the progress request at a pre-designated interval (e.g., 1 second) after sending the instruction.","Business process platform  assigns the progress request to work process  and, at S, work process  retrieves the progress information from shared memory . Work process  may use the received session identifier as a key to retrieve the progress information from shared memory  at S.","Next, at S, second work process  provides the progress information to the client application. Such provision may proceed according to the standard HTTP request\/response protocol. More specifically, the progress information is sent via an HTTP response corresponding to the HTTP progress request received at S.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 4"],"b":["600","220","530","600","400","610","610","220","530","500","610","615","530"]},"Flow returns from S to S to await another progress request. If another request and session identifier are received, progress information is again retrieved from shared memory  at S as described above. Due to concurrent execution of process , the now-retrieved progress information may be different from the progress information retrieved in response to the last progress request.","The now-retrieved progress information is provided to the client application at S. Continuing with the present example,  is a view of user interface  displayed by client  after S according to some embodiments. User interface  includes progress information window , the contents of which have changed since the time represented in .","Specifically, window  includes the text \u201cCreating Employment Agreement . . . \u201d and progress bar  is more advanced than shown in . User interface  thereby provides a visual indication of advancing progress according to some embodiments.

Business process platform  includes dispatcher process  to receive HTTP requests from client  and to forward the requests to appropriate work processes. For example, dispatcher process  may receive an HTTP request associated with user interface floorplan functionality and may dispatch the request to ABAP dialog process . Based on the type of request, ABAP dialog process  calls an HTTP Handler (UI).","Local Client Proxy (LCP) Wrapper of ABAP dialog process  forwards the request to an Enterprise Services Framework (ESF). As is known in the art, the ESF manipulates business objects (BOs) to provide enterprise services. The ESF may also issue requests to an Enterprise Controller Object (ECO) associated with the currently-viewed UI floorplan. The ECO may provide additional business knowledge and functionality behind the operation of the UI floorplan.","Progress information service , as will be described in detail below, receives information generated by one or more BOs of process  and provides the information to the ECO. Progress information service  may also receive progress information from the ECO and store the progress information in shared memory. Progress information service  may provide an application programming interface of static class methods to facilitate this operation according to some embodiments.","Upon receiving a request for progress information, dispatcher process  may dispatch the request to ABAP dialog process . In turn, ABAP dialog process  calls an HTTP Handler (Progress). As will be described below, the HTTP Handler (Progress) uses progress information service  to retrieve the progress information from shared memory  and returns the progress information to client .","Client  may comprise a Web client as described above. UI controller  of client  may comprise a software thread to control a user interface displayed by client . Requests related to user interface functionality are passed from UI controller  to HTTP connector UI communication thread  and on to platform . Similarly, UI controller  passes requests for progress information to HTTP connector progress communication thread .","System  may execute processes  and  according to some embodiments. In a specific example, an instruction to execute a business process associated with a UI floorplan is passed from UI controller  to HTTP connector UI communication thread , to dispatcher process , and is received by dialog process  at S.","The ECO may then call an interface of progress information service  to register therewith.
