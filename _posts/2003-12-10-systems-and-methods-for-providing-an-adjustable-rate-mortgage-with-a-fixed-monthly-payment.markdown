title: Systems and methods for providing an adjustable rate mortgage with a fixed monthly payment
abstract: Systems and methods are described for processing mortgage payments. In one embodiment, the method includes receiving a fixed payment for the mortgage, such fixed payment being based on an initial interest rate, with the initial interest rate serving as a maximum interest rate; determining a principal and interest payment amount based on a revised interest rate, the revised interest rate not exceeding the maximum interest rate; determining a difference between the fixed payment and the determined principal and interest amount, so that any difference may prepay the mortgage.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["I. Field of the Invention","The present invention generally relates to financial systems and to systems and methods for processing financial information. More particularly, the invention relates to systems and methods for providing an adjustable rate mortgage with a fixed payment.","II. Background and Material Information","In financial environments where interest rates rise and fall, borrowers frequently refinance their fixed-rate mortgages to take advantage of lower interest rates. Although in the end, the borrower may save money through reduced monthly payments, borrowers incur closing costs in order to refinance their mortgage. These costs may be significant and may include, for example, county recordation, settlement fees, appraisal fees, credit history fees, title insurance fees, and other loan fees. In many cases, it may be one or two years before a borrower is able to recoup these refinancing costs through lower monthly payments. In many situations, the borrower increases the outstanding debt owed by adding the cost of refinancing to the principal balance of the mortgage. Indeed, some borrowers may refinance one or more times within months of each refinance transaction, further compounding the costs and lengthening the time it takes to recoup refinancing costs. Additionally, refinancing of a mortgage will typically require the borrower to complete an application and provide documentation of income and employment, all of which take time and are generally inconvenient. In short, borrowers typically want to save money, have lower payments, repay the mortgage as quickly as possible, and have the peace of mind of knowing the payment amount for the entire term of the mortgage. For these reasons, when a borrower does choose to refinance, the borrower may prefer to have a fixed rate mortgage with a fixed payment at the lowest rate possible.","Refinancing may also present disadvantages to a lender. From a lender's prospective, the original mortgage note represents a future stream of income with a yield based generally on the interest rate of that mortgage. When a mortgage is refinanced, the income stream stops. Although in the example above a new fixed rate mortgage may take its place and provide another income stream, the new, refinanced mortgage is typically at a lower rate\u2014representing thus a lower yield. Moreover, lenders may sell (or securitize) one or more mortgage notes to investors. Like lenders, investors prefer higher yields and thus prefer to have a low refinancing turnover. Additionally, when a borrower refinances a mortgage, the borrower may refinance with a different lender, which reduces the original lender's servicing portfolio.","An alternative to a fixed-rate mortgage is the adjustable rate mortgage. Unlike the fixed-rate mortgage that has a fixed interest rate for the term of the mortgage (typically 15 to 30 years), the adjustable rate mortgage has an interest rate that is periodically adjusted (per the terms of the mortgage) to more closely coincide with the then current interest rates. For example, when interest rates fall during the interest rate reset period, the adjustable rate mortgage adjusts its interest rate lower, which results in lower monthly payments. On the other hand, when current interest rates rise during the interest rate reset period, the adjustable rate mortgage adjusts its interest rate higher, which results in higher monthly payments for the borrower.","In environments where current interest rates are falling, borrowers may use an adjustable rate mortgage to avoid refinancing their mortgage and to avoid the costs associated with refinancing. Nevertheless, in environments where current interest rates are rising (or are expected to rise), some borrowers view the adjustable rate mortgage as too risky because the interest rate and the corresponding monthly payments may be adjusted higher. Borrowers may also be concerned that they cannot afford the higher monthly payments. Accordingly, a mortgage product is needed that provides the borrower with some predictability and reduces the call for refinancing in both increasing and decreasing interest rate environments.","Accordingly, the present invention is directed to systems and methods for processing financial information and, more particularly, systems and methods for providing an adjustable rate mortgage with a fixed payment.","Systems and methods consistent with the present invention may receive a fixed payment for a mortgage, such fixed payment being based on an initial interest rate, with the initial interest rate serving as a maximum. Moreover, systems and methods consistent with the present invention may determine a principal and interest amount based on a revised interest rate with the revised interest rate not exceeding the maximum. Furthermore, systems and methods consistent with the present invention may determine a difference between the fixed payment and the principal and interest amount determined at the revised interest rate and then pay the mortgage based on the difference. Furthermore, in one embodiment, the term associated with the mortgage may be reduced by prepaying the mortgage based on the determined difference.","In another embodiment consistent with the systems and methods of the present invention, there is provided a mortgage product including a fixed payment obligation determined based on a first interest rate, wherein the fixed payment obligation requires a borrower to make a fixed payment for a term associated with the mortgage product. Moreover, the mortgage product includes an adjustable interest rate, wherein the adjustable interest rate may enable the borrower to reduce the term by prepaying the mortgage while making the fixed payment, and wherein the adjustable interest rate does not exceed the first interest rate.","Additional features and advantages of the invention will be set forth in part in the description which follows and in part will be obvious from the description, or may be learned by practice of the invention. The features and advantages of the invention may be realized and attained by the system and method particularly described in the written description and claims hereof as well as the appended drawings.","It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are not restrictive of the invention, as described. Further features and\/or variations may be provided in addition to those set forth herein. For example, the present invention may be directed to various combinations and subcombinations of the disclosed features and\/or combinations and subcombinations of several further features disclosed below in the detailed description.","Systems and methods consistent with the present invention may provide an adjustable rate mortgage (ARM) with a fixed payment (herein also referred to as a fixed payment ARM).","In one aspect of the invention, the adjustable rate mortgage includes a fixed payment that excludes taxes and insurance. The fixed payment is calculated based on an initial interest rate, initial loan amount, and a term or amortization period, which is determined at mortgage closing (or origination). If current interest rates fall below the initial interest rate, the lender, per the terms of the mortgage, may automatically lower the interest rate on the mortgage during the interest rate reset period. In another embodiment, the borrower may make a request to the lender to adjust the mortgage interest rate to a lower interest rate. Moreover, the borrower may be allowed to request a lower rate only at certain times, as specified in the mortgage. If the lender agrees to the lower interest rate and modifies the fixed payment ARM to take advantage of the revised, lower rate, the borrower continues to make the same, fixed payment. However, since the fixed payment is being applied to a mortgage loan with a revised, lower interest rate, the fixed payment amount will exceed the amount of principal and interest (P&I) required to satisfy the fixed payment ARM at the revised, lower interest rate. The difference between the fixed payment and the current P&I amount (determined at the revised, lower interest rate, the remaining principal balance, and the remaining term) may serve to prepay a greater amount of the principal balance of the mortgage. As such, if current interest rates fall, a borrower's payment would be applied as prepayments to the fixed payment ARM, so that the mortgage may be paid in a shorter time frame. For example, if the lender lowers the interest rate, the borrower may take advantage of a lower interest rate. When this is the case, the difference associated with the fixed payment and the determined P&I amount may permit the borrower to pay a 30-year mortgage in 25-years. Moreover, the borrower may be less likely to refinance, since the mortgage may take advantage of lower current interest rates without requiring a new mortgage with significant closing costs and fees.","One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the borrower may be permitted to make additional principal payments over and above the fixed payment\u2014enabling the mortgage to amortize (or liquidate) over a shorter term.","As used herein, the term \u201cmortgage\u201d means a temporary, conditional pledge of property, usually for a specific period of time (e.g., 30 years), to a creditor as security for performance of an obligation or repayment of a debt. Moreover, as used herein the term \u201cmortgage\u201d may include a paper, note, contract, security, or deed, all of which may represent the mortgage and\/or the terms of the mortgage.","As used herein, the term \u201cfixed payment\u201d means the maximum contractual payment of principal and interest that will be due on a mortgage. The maximum payment may be due at periodic time periods (e.g., yearly, monthly, or biweekly), as specified by the terms of the mortgage. In one embodiment, the fixed payment may be determined at the initial interest rate used when the mortgage is initially executed, for example, at mortgage close. The initial interest rate serves as a maximum (or cap) interest rate for the duration of the loan. As such, any principal and interest amounts due on an adjusted (or revised) interest rate may not exceed the fixed payment.","In one embodiment of the invention, if current interest rates increase, a lender may increase the interest rate of the fixed payment ARM. The lender may revise (or adjust) the interest rate higher, but this rate increase may not exceed the initial interest rate used to determine the fixed payment. As noted above, the initial interest rate effectively serves as a maximum (or \u201ccap\u201d) interest rate for the fixed payment ARM. Moreover, when the initial interest rate serves as a cap, each fixed payment made by the borrower will reduce the amount of principal owed on the mortgage, i.e., the mortgage will always amortize positively. For example, when a lender increases (but not exceeding the cap) the interest rate associated with the mortgage, the lender continues receiving the fixed payments that were determined at mortgage closing (or origination). The fixed payments are applied to the ARM at a revised, increased interest rate. Although the revised (or adjusted) interest rate is adjusted higher, it is still lower than the initial maximum interest rate used to initially determine the fixed payment amount. As such, the fixed payment amount will exceed the P&I amount determined at the revised, higher interest rate. As long as the revised interest rate associated with the fixed payment ARM remains below the initial interest rate (or cap), the borrower prepays the fixed payment ARM and reduces its term\u2014resulting in savings to the borrower.","On the other hand, if the interest rate of the fixed payment ARM is adjusted to equal the initial interest rate, the fixed payment does not serve to prepay the mortgage. In this case, however, the borrower is no worse off than when the fixed payment ARM mortgage was originated, since the mortgage will be paid within the loan term agreed to at closing. Moreover, since the initial interest rate serves as a cap (or maximum), the borrower will never pay more than the fixed payment that was determined based on the initial interest rate, the loan amount, and loan term. To illustrate this point by way of a non-limiting example, if interest rates do not fall or rise above the initial interest rate, the borrower makes fixed payments for the life (or term) of the fixed payment ARM, and it will be paid under its original terms, e.g., 30 years. On the other hand, if current interest rates fall, the borrower may lower the interest rate of the fixed payment ARM, and thus make fixed payments that serve to prepay the mortgage, reducing the term of the mortgage to, e.g., 25 years.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["1000","1600","1620","1500","1510","1400"]},"Lenders ,  may include a financial entity, such as a bank, mortgage bank, mortgage broker, mortgage originator, and\/or any other entity capable of providing an adjustable rate mortgage with a fixed payment.

Lender  may then apply any difference to prepay the remaining principal balance on the mortgage (step ).

The adjustable interest rate of the fixed payment ARM may also vary over the term of the mortgage. In one aspect of the invention, the adjustable interest rate of the fixed payment ARM may not exceed a maximum interest rate. In one embodiment, the maximum (or \u201ccap\u201d) interest rate is equal to the initial interest rate at which the fixed payment ARM was originated. For example, at origination (or closing) of the fixed payment ARM, the initial interest rate may be used to determine the fixed payment and may be used as the cap. Although the fixed payment amount may be determined in a variety of ways, such as through the use of an amortization table or equation, in one embodiment, the following equation is used:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":["Fixed","Payment","Amount"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}]},{"mi":["Loan","Amount"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u00d7"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},"mfrac":{"mrow":[{"mi":["Monthly","Interest"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}},{"mi":["Interest","Factor"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}}]}}],"mo":"="}},{"mrow":{"mi":"Equation","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},"mn":"1"}}]}}}},"br":[{},{},{}],"in-line-formulae":[{},{}],"sup":"\u2212Periods"},"To close on the adjustable rate mortgage (step ), lender  and borrower  execute documents indicating the completion of the transaction. At closing, lender  usually provides the loan amount to borrower  in exchange for a mortgage.","After closing, lender  may begin receiving fixed payments (or an indication that the payment has been received) from borrower  (step ). The fixed payments are applied to the mortgage. As fixed payments are made, a portion of the fixed payment reduces the outstanding mortgage principal, while another portion of the fixed payment is applied to satisfy the interest charges due on the mortgage. Over time, the fixed payment reduces the outstanding principal balance of the fixed payment ARM, such that the mortgage fully amortizes (paid to a zero balance) in accordance with the terms specified in the mortgage (if not sooner). Table 1 below shows an excerpt of an exemplary amortization table for a loan amount of $100,000, a 7% interest rate, a 30-year term, and a fixed payment of $664. TABLE 1 shows a fixed payment of about $664 (see also the sum of principal and interest) and a corresponding reduction in the remaining loan balance.

If current interest rates rise above the initial interest rate of the fixed payment ARM, neither borrower  nor lender  may adjust the interest rate above the initial interest rate, which is 7% in TABLE 1. As such, lender  receives fixed payments (e.g., $664) from borrower  for the life of the fixed rate ARM.","If current interest rates fall (step ), lender  may automatically reduce the interest rate or may receive from borrower  a request to adjust the interest rate lower (step ).

In one aspect of the invention, the interest rate may not, however, rise above a maximum interest rate, which may be set as the initial interest rate determined at closing of the fixed payment ARM. For example, if current interest rates rise immediately after closing, lender  may not be able to adjust the interest rate upwards, since the initial interest rate serves as a cap. However, if interest rates initially fall (and borrower  takes advantage of the lower interest rate by adjusting the interest rate on the fixed payment ARM through steps -), lender  may increase the interest rate associated with the fixed payment ARM and still not exceed the initial interest rate (or cap).","As current interest rates move higher, the fixed rate ARM may enable lender  to notify borrower  that the interest rate for the fixed payment ARM will increase (step ).

Referring to , lender  (or computing platform  therein) may receive from borrower , through communication channel  or regular mail, fixed payments (or indications of payments) that are applied to the fixed payment ARM (step ). If current interest rates fall (or decrease), lender  may automatically reduce the interest rate or receive from borrower  a request to adjust the interest rate of the adjustable rate mortgage to a revised, lower interest rate (step ). In this embodiment, lender  determines whether borrower  meets one or more terms and conditions, stored in database , before accepting a lower interest rate (step ). The exemplary terms and conditions are described in greater detail below. If borrower  meets the conditions at step , lender  may determine a P&I amount at the revised, lower interest rate (step ), and determine a difference (if any) between the fixed payment and the revised, lower interest P&I amount (step ).
