{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS","Overview","System Description","Method Description","Example"],"p":["The priority of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61\/059,716, filed on Jun. 6, 2008, is hereby claimed, and the specification thereof is incorporated herein by reference.","Not applicable.","The present invention relates generally to systems and methods for imaging a three-dimensional (\u201c3D\u201d) volume of geometrically irregular grid data representing a grid volume. More particularly, the present invention relates to imaging geometrically irregular grid data, in real-time, using various types of probes and corresponding displays.","Typical commercialized petroleum reservoir visualization software helps petroleum and reservoir engineers and geoscientists see the results from static or dynamic simulations and visually compare iterative \u201cwhat if\u201d scenarios. Many reservoir models are often described as a disconnected curvilinear grid volume, also called a \u201c3D grid,\u201d where each grid cell has clearly defined hexahedronal geometry. The software shows different views of the reservoir with particular attributes (e.g. gas saturation) of the reservoir. The edges, top, and bottom of the reservoir can be seen by rotating the view.","Visualization can be used at four different points in the reservoir characterization and simulation process: 1) after gridding, 2) after initialization, 3) during simulation, and 4) after simulation. Visualization software typically allows the representation of any simulation attribute, instant switching between attributes, and the ability to set data thresholds with unique displays of cells that are restricted to specified data ranges. A visualization model may include a single layer, or multi-layer views wherein cells are stripped away to reveal the inside of the model. They can also be constructed to show a full display of corner points and local refinement for grid volumes. The traditional approach to setting up a modeling framework is a step-wise, process, not done in real-time, that employs two-dimensional (\u201c2D\u201d) interface dialog boxes with input fields and progress bars.","Geoscientists examine a variety of data types in the effort to find oil or gas. Seismic data is generally used to identify continuous reflections (representing horizons) and discontinuities (representing faults or other structural components) that form the structural framework of reservoirs containing hydrocarbons. This data type provides high resolution horizontal information, but lacks vertical detail. During oil and gas exploration, well data provides petrophysical and geological information from wire-line logs and cores. This well data contains high resolution vertical information, but lacks horizontal detail between wells. Sophisticated earth modeling tools integrate information from these two data types thus, optimizing both horizontal and vertical resolution. The result is a static model that can be used to build reservoir models to predict the oil and\/or gas fluid flow and facilitate hydrocarbon production planning.","Visualization shows simulation effects on a specific area of the reservoir, represented in a model, through the use of 3D graphics objects. Simulation attributes display as color on the graphics objects and represent reservoir structure. As a result, physical changes in the reservoir, such as gas cap movement or pressure changes, can be easily evaluated. The ability to visualize a simulation model at any angle during the course of the simulation improves reservoir understanding.","A 3D reservoir model may be presented as hexahedral grid cells, which can be topologically structured or unstructured and geometrically regular or irregular. Curvilinear grid volumes, which are topologically structured and geometrically irregular, are more typical in reservoirs and are therefore, of particular interest. A 3D grid may be defined as:\n\ncell=()=()\n\nwhere v, v. . . and vare eight vertices for the cell and a, a. . . and aare attributes. 3D grids are I layers thick, J cells wide, K cells deep, which contain cells with coordinates (I, J, K) referred to as grid coordinates. Grid Coordinates (I, J, K) are typically used in an index domain, while Cartesian (world) coordinates (x, y, z) are typically used in a sampling domain.\n","Some commercial applications and research can visualize 3D grids and provide basic 3D scene interactive manipulations, such as rotation and zoom capabilities. However, 2D menus are used to define particular features, such as I, J, or K layers. For large or complicated volumes, image generation requires so much time that the software must display a progress bar. Although users can be trained to set parameters in 2D menus while working in 3D, they may become frustrated by this awkward interaction.","As referenced above, a 3D reservoir model is either topologically structured or unstructured, and volumes are geometrically regular or irregular. Unstructured volumes can easily be resampled to a regular structured volume using a rendering algorithm. Research for unstructured volume visualization includes the widely used Projected Tetrahedral technique. Many other extended and enhanced algorithms have also been published. Another algorithm used for visualizing geoscience data is incremental slicing, which was first introduced by Yagel, et al. in , IEEE Visualization, 1996, pp. 55-62. The basic idea behind this algorithm is to slice the whole grid volume along the viewing direction and render the slices from back to front. For surface volume rendering, the well-known Marching Cubes algorithm can be used for rendering both regular and irregular grid cells. The challenge of volume visualization, however, lies in determining which algorithm best fits a particular domain and task.","Volume roaming (resizing or moving a region) is a common visualization technique used to focus on a dynamic subvolume of the entire data set in several oil and gas applications. GeoProbe\u00ae, which is a commercial-software package marketed by Landmark Graphics Corporation for use in the oil and gas industry, employs this basic technique using a sampling probe. The Geoprobe\u00ae sampling probe is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,765,570, which is assigned to Landmark Graphics Corporation and is incorporated herein by reference. The sampling probe described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,765,570, however, only renders structured data (voxels) in real-time. In other words, the sampling probe does not address the need to render unstructured grids\u2014much less geometrically irregular grid data\u2014in real-time.","Although other publications (e.g. Speray and Kennon, in Volume Probes: Interactive Data Exploration on Arbitrary Grids, Computer Graphics, Vol. 24, No. 5 (November 1995, pp. 5-12)) describe a probe, none appear capable of rendering geometrically irregular grid data in real-time.","There is therefore, a need for imaging (rendering) 3D grids of geometrically irregular grid data in real-time.","The present invention meets the above needs and overcomes one or more deficiencies in the prior art by providing systems and methods for imaging 3D grids of geometrically irregular grid data in real-time.","In one embodiment the present invention includes a method for imaging a three-dimensional volume of geometrically irregular grid data representing a grid volume using a computer processor, which comprises: i) selecting a grid probe within the grid volume, the grid probe defined by a bounding box in a sampling domain, the grid volume comprising multiple cells and the grid data comprising a normal vector and a geometry for each face of each cell, split flag data for each cell, an attribute for each cell and an attribute data value for each cell wherein the split flag data comprises data representing each face of a respective cell and its position relative to a face of another cell; ii) mapping extents of the bounding box from the sampling domain to an index domain; iii) rendering an image of the grid probe within the grid volume, the image comprising the grid data only within at least a portion of the extents of the bounding box; and iv) repeating the rendering step in response to movement of the grid probe within the grid volume so that as the grid probe moves, the image of the grid probe is redrawn at a rate sufficiently fast to be perceived as moving in real-time.","In another embodiment the present invention includes a non-transitory program carrier device tangibly carrying computer executable instructions for imaging a three-dimensional volume of geometrically irregular grid data representing a grid volume. The instructions are executable to implement: i) selecting a grid probe within the grid volume, the grid probe defined by a bounding box in a sampling domain, the grid volume comprising multiple cells and the grid data comprising a normal vector and a geometry for each face of each cell, split flag data for each cell, an attribute for each cell and an attribute data value for each cell wherein the split flag data comprises data representing each face of a respective cell and its position relative to a face of another cell; ii) mapping extents of the bounding box from the sampling domain to an index domain; iii) rendering an image of the grid probe within the grid volume, the image comprising the grid data only within at least a portion of the extents of the bounding box; and iv) repeating the rendering step in response to movement of the grid probe within the grid volume so that as the grid probe moves, the image of the grid probe is redrawn at a rate sufficiently fast to be perceived as moving in real-time.","Additional aspects, advantages and embodiments of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the following description of the various embodiments and related drawings.","The subject matter of the present invention is described with specificity, however, the description itself is not intended to limit the scope of the invention. The subject matter thus, might also be embodied in other ways, to include different steps or combinations of steps similar to the ones described herein, in conjunction with other present or future technologies. Moreover, although the term \u201cstep\u201d may be used herein to describe different elements of methods employed, the term should not be interpreted as implying any particular order among or between various steps herein disclosed unless otherwise expressly limited by the description to a particular order. While the following description refers to the oil and gas industry, the systems and methods of the present invention are not limited thereto and may also be applied to other industries to achieve similar results.","The need for real-time displays in today's modeling world is critical; waiting even a single minute can often seem painful and frustrating. Therefore, the visualization design goal is to render large 3D grids of geometrically irregular grid data representing a grid volume responsive to input at rendering rates sufficiently fast to be perceived in real-time. To penetrate and analyze such data in real-time, a number of visualization techniques are addressed herein. In order to fully understand these techniques, it is necessary to describe some details around 3D grids and their topology.","Referring now to , a layer  of geometrically irregular grid data from a 3D grid is illustrated. The layer  may be used to map grid data from a grid volume onto a probe. To specify the continuity of adjacent cells, a byte, representing multiple split flags, is used. Six of the bits in a byte are used to indicate whether the cell split occurred left, right, up, down, near, or far, relative to adjacent cells. The seventh bit is used to specify a dead cell. The eighth bit is used for \u201cinactive\u201d cells. Inactive cells are not dead, but are invisible for particular probes. The data representing each bit (split flag) may be referred to collectively as split flag data.","Cell  has coordinates of (1,1,1). The only splits relative to cell  occurred left and up, which are shown by no cell to the left or above the cell .","Cells that do not exist, as in cell , are referred to as \u201cdead\u201d cells and are not displayed. The cells adjacent to the dead cells possibly represent geological discontinuities, such as faults, other structural features, or stratigraphic changes. Geological or petrophysical attributes are displayed as color on the cells. The shading and color must be per cell, but cannot be per vertex. Any form of interpolation of color or vertex is not desired, because petroleum geoscientists and engineers want to see and understand the attribute magnitude at each cell. Each cell therefore, includes an attribute and a corresponding attribute data value. In addition, each face of each cell represents a particular geometry and includes a normal vector that controls the shading for that face. Thus, each cell includes grid data associated therewith that comprises a normal vector and a geometry for each face of the cell, split flag data, an attribute and its corresponding data value. The attribute, and its corresponding data value, the geometry and the normal vector are commonly referred to as 3D graphics quads.","Cell  has coordinates of (1,4,1). The splits relative to cell  occurred left and down, which are shown by no cell to the left or below the cell .","Cell  has coordinates of (1,4,5). The splits relative to cell  occurred right and down, which are shown by no cell to the right or below the cell .","Cell  has coordinates of (1,4,6). The splits relative to cell  occurred left, right and down, which are shown by no cell to the left, right or below the cell .","Cell  has coordinates of (1,1,6). The splits relative to cell  occurred left, right and up, which are shown by no cell to the left, right or above the cell .","Because interpolation of vertices and colors should be avoided, polygon reduction (e.g. using a polygon for the faces of cells on the same plane) can not be applied. These requirements reaffirm the need for the different types of probes and displays provided herein by the present invention.","The present invention reduces image generation (rendering) time by use of a probe-based interface where users can identify the appropriate parameter selection without the need of a 2D interface. A probe-based interface, like the GeoProbe\u00ae sampling probe, renders a dynamic subset of the entire data volume, which may be used to focus on a region of interest. The present invention extends the probe concept to interface with grid data (including split flag data) from a grid volume comprising multiple cells. As used herein, the term probe refers to a grid probe, which may include, for example, a Box-Probe, a Quad-Probe, a Cut-Probe, a Slice-Probe, and a Filter-Probe.","Referring now to , an image  illustrates Local Grid Refinement (LGR), which is applied to add detail where it is justified by data availability and to keep coarse resolution where less data is available. To handle LGR, each probe contains multiple display objects, and each display object is connected with one LGR grid. A parent-child relationship between grid cells is passed into the display object. According to the parent range information, a child queries its own range from grid data, retrieves a sub-grid, and then builds geometry for a particular display. There are 18 LGR grid cells in the image .","Different types of visualization displays may be used in connection with certain probes, which include, for example, a ShellDisplay, a PlaneDisplay, a CellDisplay and a FilterDisplay. Each type of display may be used to examine different geological layering, the distribution of geological faces and their internal petrophysical properties such as, for example: outside geometry (ShellDisplay), layers or cross sections (PlaneDisplay), distribution of flow units or geobodies (FilterDisplay), or the internal grid cell geometry (CellDisplay). Each type of display may therefore, be used to validate or identify potential problems using the probe thereby, eliminating the need to stop, initiate a new set of commands, and then wait for a particular display to render. The present invention therefore, provides interactive, real-time images that respond to changes in the probe size, shape, and location.","The present invention may be implemented through a computer-executable program of instructions, such as program modules, generally referred to as software applications or application programs executed by a computer. The software may include, for example, routines, programs, objects, components, and data structures that perform particular tasks or implement particular abstract data types. The software forms an interface to allow a computer to react according to a source of input, Picasso, which is a commercial software application marketed by Landmark Graphics Corporation, may be used as an interface application to implement the present invention. The software may also cooperate with other code segments to initiate a variety of tasks in response to data received in conjunction with the source of the received data. The software may be stored and\/or carried on any variety of memory media such as CD-ROM, magnetic disk, bubble memory and semiconductor memory (e.g., various types of RAM or ROM). Furthermore, the software and its results may be transmitted over a variety of carrier media such as optical fiber, metallic wire, free space and\/or through any of a variety of networks such as the Internet.","Moreover, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the invention may be practiced with a variety of computer-system configurations, including hand-held devices, multiprocessor systems, microprocessor-based or programmable-consumer electronics, minicomputers, mainframe computers, and the like. Any number of computer-systems and computer networks are acceptable for use with the present invention. The invention may be practiced in distributed-computing environments where tasks are performed by remote-processing devices that are linked through a communications network. In a distributed-computing environment, program modules may be located in both local and remote computer-storage media including memory storage devices. The present invention may therefore, be implemented in connection with various hardware, software or a combination thereof, in a computer system or other processing system.","Referring now to , a block diagram of a system for implementing the present invention on a computer is illustrated. The system includes a computing unit, sometimes referred to a computing system, which contains memory, application programs, a client interface, and a processing unit. The computing unit is only one example of a suitable computing environment and is not intended to suggest any limitation as to the scope of use or functionality of the invention.","The memory primarily stores the application programs, which may also be described as program modules containing computer-executable instructions, executed by the computing unit for implementing the methods described herein and illustrated in . The memory therefore, includes a visualization module, referred to as the GridProbe Module in , which enables the methods illustrated and described in reference to . The GridProbe Module may also interact with Picasso and other related software applications as further described in reference to .","Although the computing unit is shown as having a generalized memory, the computing unit typically includes a variety of computer readable media. By way of example, and not limitation, computer readable media may comprise computer storage media and communication media. The computing system memory may include computer storage media in the form of volatile and\/or nonvolatile memory such as a read only memory (ROM) and random access memory (RAM). A basic input\/output system (BIOS), containing the basic routines that help to transfer information between elements within the computing unit, such as during start-up, is typically stored in ROM. The RAM typically contains data and\/or program modules that are immediately accessible to and\/or presently being operated on by the processing unit. By way of example, and not limitation, the computing unit includes an operating system, application programs, other program modules, and program data.","The components shown in the memory may also be included in other removable\/nonremovable, volatile\/nonvolatile computer storage media. For example only, a hard disk drive may read from or write to nonremovable, nonvolatile magnetic media, a magnetic disk drive may read from or write to a removable, non-volatile magnetic disk, and an optical disk drive may read from or write to a removable, nonvolatile optical disk such as a CD ROM or other optical media. Other removable\/non-removable, volatile\/non-volatile computer storage media that can be used in the exemplary operating environment may include, but are not limited to, magnetic tape cassettes, flash memory cards, digital versatile disks, digital video tape, solid state RAM, solid state ROM, and the like. The drives and their associated computer storage media discussed above provide storage of computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules and other data for the computing unit.","A client may enter commands and information into the computing unit through the client interface, which may be input devices such as a keyboard and pointing device, commonly referred to as a mouse, trackball or touch pad. Input devices may include a microphone, joystick, satellite dish, scanner, or the like.","These and other input devices are often connected to the processing unit through the client interface that is coupled to a system bus, but may be connected by other interface and bus structures, such as a parallel port or a universal serial bus (USB). A monitor or other type of display device may be connected to the system bus via an interface, such as a video interface. In addition to the monitor, computers may also include other peripheral output devices such as speakers and printer, which may be connected through an output peripheral interface.","Although many other internal components of the computing unit are not shown, those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that such components and their interconnection are well known.","Referring now to , a block diagram of a program for implementing the present invention on software is illustrated.","The present invention may be implemented using hardware, software or a combination thereof, and may be implemented in a computer system or other processing system. One embodiment of a software or program structure  for implementing the present invention is shown in . At the base of program structure  is an operating system . Suitable operating systems  include, for example, the UNIX\u00ae operating system, or Windows NT\u00ae from Microsoft Corporation, or other operating systems as would be apparent to one of skill in the relevant art.","Windowing software  overlays operating system . Windowing software  is used to provide various menus and windows to facilitate interaction with the user, and to obtain user input and instructions. Windowing software  can include, for example, Microsoft Windows\u2122, X Window System\u2122 (registered trademark of Massachusetts Institute of Technology), and MOTIF\u2122 (registered trademark of Open Software Foundation Inc.). As would be readily apparent to one of skill in the relevant art, other menu and windowing software could also be used.","A 3D graphics library  overlays Windowing software . The 3D graphics library  is an application programming interface (API) for 3D computer graphics. The functions performed by 3D graphics library  include, for example, geometric and raster primitives, RGBA or color index mode, display list or immediate mode, viewing and modeling transformations, lighting and shading, hidden surface removal, alpha blending (translucency), anti-aliasing, texture mapping, atmospheric effects (fog, smoke, haze), feedback and selection, stencil planes, and accumulation buffer.","A particularly preferred 3D graphics library  is OpenGL\u00ae. The OpenGL\u00ae API is a well known multi-platform industry standard that is hardware, window, and operating system independent. OpenGL\u00ae is designed to be callable from C, C++, FORTRAN, Ada and Java\u2122 programming languages. OpenGL\u00ae performs each of the functions listed above for 3D graphics library . Some commands in OpenGL\u00ae specify geometric objects to be drawn, and others control how the objects are handled. All elements of the OpenGL\u00ae state, even the contents of the texture memory and the frame buffer, can be obtained by a client application using OpenGL\u00ae. OpenGL\u00ae and the client application may operate on the same or different machines because OpenGL\u00ae is network transparent. OpenGL\u00ae is described in more detail in the OpenGL\u00ae Programming Guide (ISBN: 0-201-63274-8) and the OpenGL\u00ae Reference Manual (ISBN: 0-201-63276-4), the entirety of both of which are incorporated herein by reference.","3D graphics utilities  overlay the 3D graphics library . The 3D graphics utilities  is an API for creating real-time, multi-processed 3D visual simulation graphics applications. The 3D graphics utilities  provide functions that bundle together graphics library state control functions such as lighting, materials, texture, and transparency. These functions track state and the creation of display lists that can be rendered later. A particularly preferred set of 3D graphics utilities is offered in Picasso.","A GridProbe program  overlays 3D graphics utilities  and the 3D graphics library . The GridProbe program  interacts with, and uses the functions carried out by, each of the 3D graphics utilities , the 3D graphics library , the windowing software , and the operating system  in a manner known to one of skill in the relevant art.","The GridProbe program  of the present invention is preferably written in an object oriented programming language to allow the creation and use of objects and object functionality. A particularly preferred object oriented programming language is Java\u2122. In carrying out the present invention, the GridProbe program  creates one or more probe objects. As noted above, the probe objects created and used by the GridProbe program  are also referred to herein as grid probes or probes. GridProbe program  manipulates the probe objects so that they have the following attributes.","A probe corresponds to a sub-volume of a larger grid volume. Particularly, a probe defines a sub-set that is less than the complete data set of cells for a grid volume. A probe could be configured to be equal to or coextensive with the complete data set of cells for a grid volume, but the functionality of the present invention is best carried out when the probe corresponds to a sub-volume and defines a sub-set that is less than the complete data set of cells for a grid volume.","By using probes that are a sub-volume of the larger grid volume, the quantity of data that must be processed and re-drawn for each frame of an image is dramatically reduced, thereby increasing the speed with which the image can be re-drawn. The volume of a three-dimensional cube is proportional to the third power or \u201ccube\u201d of the dimensions of the three-dimensional cube. Likewise, the quantity of data in a grid volume is proportional to the third power or \u201ccube\u201d of its size. Therefore, the quantity of data in a sub-volume of a larger grid volume will be proportional to the \u201ccubed root\u201d (\u221a) of the quantity of data in the larger grid volume. As such, the quantity of data in a probe of the present invention may be proportional to the \u201ccubed root\u201d (\u221a) of the quantity of data in the grid volume of which it is a sub-volume. By only having to process the sub-set of data that relates to the sub-volume of the probe, the present invention can re-draw an image in response to user input at a rate sufficiently fast that the user perceives an instantaneous or real-time change in the image, without perceptible delay or lag. In other words, an image that is rendered at a rate of at least 10 frames per second.","The probes of the present invention can be interactively changed in shape and\/or size, and interactively moved within the larger grid volume. The outside geometry or surfaces of a probe can be interactively drawn while the probe is being changed in shape and\/or size or while the probe is being moved. As a result, the internal structures or features of the probe may be revealed.","A probe can be used to cut into another probe, and the intersection of the two probes can be imaged. A probe can also be used to filter data in accordance with filter criteria representing an attribute data range.","Referring now to , a block diagram of an architecture  for the program  in  is illustrated.","The 3D graphics utilities  include a User Interface Module (UIM) , a Graphics Processing Module (GPM) , and a Volume Sampling Module (VSM) . The GridProbe program  includes a GridProbe Module . UIM  and GPM  communicate via a bi-directional pathway . UIM  sends instructions and requests to VSM  through GPM  and GridProbe Module  via bi-directional pathways , . UIM  interacts with Grid Volume  through pathway .","Grid data from Grid Volume  is transferred to VSM  via pathway . VSM  transfers data to GPM  through GridProbe Module  via bi-directional pathways , . Grid Volume  stores the grid data in a manner well known to one of skill in the relevant art, which may include grid data representing multiple different volumes.","UIM  handles the user interface to receive commands, instructions, and input data from the user. UIM  interfaces with the user through a variety of menus through which the user can select various options and settings, either through keyboard selection or through one or more user-manipulated input devices, such as a mouse or a 3D pointing device. UIM  receives user input as the user manipulates the input device to move, size, shape, etc. a grid probe.","UIM  inputs the identification of one or more grid volumes from Grid Volume  to use for imaging and analysis. When a plurality of grid volumes are used, the data value for each of the plurality of grid volumes represents a different physical parameter or attribute for the same geographic space. By way of example, a plurality of grid volumes could include a geology volume, a temperature volume, and a water-saturation volume.","UIM  inputs information to create one or more probes. Such information may include, for example, probe type, size, shape, and location. Such information may also include, for example, the type of display and imaging attributes such as color, lighting, shading, and transparency (or opacity). By adjusting opacity as a function of data value, certain portions of the grid volume are more transparent, thereby allowing a viewer to see through surfaces. As would be readily apparent to one skilled in the art, data values with greater opacity (less transparency) will mask the imaging or display of data values with lower opacity (more transparency). Conversely, data values will less opacity and greater transparency will permit the imaging or display of data values with greater opacity and lower transparency.","UIM  receives input from the user for sizing and shaping the probes. As described in more detail below, in a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the shape and\/or size of a probe may be changed by clicking onto manipulators or the probe display and making changes in the dimensions of the probe in one or more directions. A manipulator refers to a designated graphical representation on a surface of the probe, which may be used to move, reshape or re-size the probe. Manipulators may also be used to identify boundaries or extents for creating certain types of probes. A manipulator is preferably displayed in a color that is different from the colors being used to display the features or physical parameters of the grid data. UIM  receives input from the user to move the position or location of a probe within the grid volume. In a preferred embodiment, a user manipulates a mouse to click onto a manipulator or the probe display and move or re-size the probe.","UIM  also receives input from the user regarding the content of the displayed image. For example, the user can preferably select the content of the displayed image. The content of the displayed image could include only the probe, i.e., its intersection with the grid volume. Additionally, the probe could be displayed either with or without a bounding box that defines the outer geometry of the probe.","To carry out the foregoing functions, UIM  sends a request to VSM  to load or attach the grid volumes identified by the user. UIM  communicates via bi-directional pathway  with GPM  that carries out the display and imaging.","GPM  processes data for imaging probes with the color, lighting, shading, transparency, and other attributes selected by the user. To do so, GPM  uses the functions available through 3D graphics library  and 3D graphics utilities  described above. The user can select (through UIM ) to display only the one or more probes that have been created. Alternatively, the user can select to display one or more probes, as well as the grid volume outside of the probes, i.e. cells within the grid volume that do not intersect any of the probes that are being displayed. Probes that are being displayed may be referred to herein as active probes.","GPM  processes the re-shaping and move requests that are received by UIM  from the user. GPM  draws the re-shaped probe in accordance with the user-selected attributes (color, lighting, shading, transparency, etc.). As the user inputs a change in shape for a probe, the image with selected attributes is re-drawn sufficiently fast to be perceived in real-time by the user. Similarly, GPM  draws the probe in the new position or location in accordance with the user-selected attributes (color, lighting, shading, transparency, etc.). As the user moves the probe through the grid volume, the image of the probe with selected attributes is re-drawn sufficiently fast to be perceived in real-time by the user.","To carry out the foregoing functions, GPM  communicates via bi-directional pathway  with UIM  so that the information requested by the user is imaged or displayed with the selected attributes. GPM  obtains the needed data from Grid Volume  by sending a data request through the GridProbe Module  and the VSM  via bi-directional pathways , , .","The GridProbe Module  selects bounding box extents in the sampling domain based on input received from UIM  through GPM  regarding the type of probe and display selected. The GridProbe Module  then maps (converts) the bounding box extents from the sampling domain to the index domain. The GridProbe Module  then sends a request to VSM  via bi-directional pathway  for grid data from Grid Volume  that corresponds to the selected bounding box extents. The GridProbe Module  receives grid data corresponding to the bounding box extents from VSM  via bi-directional pathway . The GridProbe Module then creates (builds) the selected probe and display using the grid data from VSM  and transmits the selected probe and display to GPM  for rendering an image of the selected probe and display.","The primary function of VSM  is therefore, to extract the appropriate grid data within the bounding box extents from Grid Volume  at the request of GridProbe Module . VSM  receives requests for grid data from GridProbe Module  through bi-directional pathway . VSM  extracts the required sub-grid within the probe bounding box extents from Grid Volume  and transfers it to GridProbe Module .
