title: Managing digital media presented in online digital media store
abstract: Systems, methods and computer program products are disclosed for managing digital media for an artist or author in an online digital media store using an automated data feed with a unique data structure or a web service having a simple and intuitive user interface. In some implementations, a webpage is provided by the web service that allows a user to request access to manage an artist or author. Upon such request, a rules-based vetting process is employed by the online digital media store for determining the eligibility of the user to manage the digital media of the artist or author.

One example of an online digital media store is the iTunes\u00ae store, operated by Apple Inc., Cupertino Calif. Some online digital media stores, such as the iTunes\u00ae store, allow content providers (e.g., music distributors) to provide and manage digital media using a web-based application or an automated data feed.","Systems, methods and computer program products are disclosed for managing digital media in an online digital media store using an automated data feed with a unique data structure or a web service. The automated data feed has a unique data structure that allows users to manage digital media for a large numbers of artists and to provide digital media to the online digital media store. The automated data feed can be controlled by the content provider using a command line interface or script file. The web service provides a user with a simple and intuitive user interface that allows the user to manage digital media associated with an artist presented on one or more pages in the online digital media store.","The web service also allows new users to be added and assigned one or more roles with various levels of access privileges to digital media or functions associated with an artist or author. A rules-based vetting process is used to determine whether a user is eligible to manage the digital media of an artist or author. The vetting process avoids conflicts between multiple users that claim to have legal rights to manage the digital media of the artist in the online digital media store.","In some implementations, a method of providing digital media to an online digital media store comprises: establishing an automated data feed with a client computer operated by a content provider; receiving a data structure over the automated data feed, the data structure including a first metadata or asset associated with a first digital media item, the first digital media item associated with an artist or author having a presence in the online digital media store; and presenting the first digital media item in the online digital media store.","In some implementations, a method of providing digital media to an online digital media store comprises: establishing a communication channel with a client computer operated by a content provider; receiving input through the communication channel, the input specifying an asset associated with an artist or author having a presence in the online digital media store; receiving the specified asset from the client computer; and presenting, or providing access to, the asset in the online digital media store.","In some implementations, a method of claiming an artist or author having a page presenting digital media in an online digital media store comprises: receiving a request from a user to manage an artist or author; determining if the artist or author is assigned to another user; if the artist or author is assigned to another user, rejecting the request; if the artist or author is not assigned to another user, determining if all content delivered to the online digital media store that is associated with the artist or author was provided by the user; if all the content was provided by the user, accepting the request; if all the content was not provided by the user, determining if one content item was provided by the user to the online digital media store within the past x months; if one content item was provided by the user within the past x months, accepting the request; if one content item was not provided by the user within the past x months, determining if the user provided the last content item to the online digital media store; if the user provided the last content item, accepting the request; and if the user did not provide the last content item, rejecting the request.","Other implementations are directed to systems, computer program products and computer-readable mediums.","Particular implementations disclosed herein provide one or more of the following advantages. Administrators, artist managers and other users are provided with an automated data feed with a unique data structure or web service with a simple and intuitive user interface for managing digital media of an artist or author presented on one or more pages of an online digital media store.","The details of the disclosed implementations are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, objects, and advantages will be apparent from the description and drawings, and from the claims.","The same reference symbol used in various drawings indicates like elements.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","104","106","108"]},"Content providers , can include various providers of digital media, such as record companies, artist managers, publishers, and any other individual or entity that is involved in the management of an artist or author (in the case of e-books). Content providers  are also referred to herein as \u201cusers.\u201d Digital media can include any digital content, including but not limited to music, video, artwork, e-books, podcasts, software applications and ring tones.","In the example shown, content provider is coupled to online digital media store  through network  and an automated data feed. An example of an automated data feed is an Extensible Markup Language (XML) feed.","Content provider is coupled to online digital media store  through network  through a web service. A web service is an application that is accessed over a network such as the Internet or an intranet using a browser.","Each of the content providers , can include computer systems or other devices (e.g., e-tablets, smart phones) that allow a human user to send digital media to online digital media store . For example, content provider can include a computer system that allows a user to create and edit XML documents and send those documents to online digital media store  using a command-line interface or script. Content provider can include a computer system with a browser application that allows a user to provide digital media through user interfaces (e.g., webpages) provided by a webpage server operated by or on behalf of the online digital media store .","Online digital media store  provides consumers access to various digital media items. Consumers can use consumer devices , (e.g., computers, smart phones, e-tablets) to stream or download digital media from online digital media store . Consumers can browse various webpages in store  or sections of the store  that are dedicated to artists or authors (e.g., an artist page or an author page). An artist page can include a variety of digital media, including artwork (e.g., album cover art), a biography of the artist, video clips and artist images. A playlist page can include elements for previewing songs of an album. An album or playlist page can display cover art for the artist's albums and allow a user to preview, purchase and download songs using their various consumer devices , ","A conventional artist page may use a stock image of an artist that is associated with all of the digital media of the artist. In many cases, however, this approach may be undesirable. For example, on an album webpage it may be more desirable to display a different artist image or gallery of images next to each album cover art. For example, an artist manager may find it desirable for marketing an album to place an image of the artist next to the album cover art that depicts the artist at his or her age when the album was first released. It may also be desirable to have a gallery of images of the artist in concert during a tour of the album.","System  provides an advantage over conventional data communication systems and methods by using an automated data feed with a unique data structure and a web service with a simple and intuitive user interface. These systems and methods allow administrators, artist managers and other users to add or replace or digital media (e.g., metadata, assets) of an artist or author on one or more webpages (e.g., artist page, album or playlist page) in an online digital media store.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","104","200","202","204","204","206","200","200","200","104"],"i":["a","c "]},"Album table  lists albums of the artist. Each row in album table  is associated with a single album and can include a thumbnail image of the album cover art, a vendor identification number, the number of galleries associated with the album and a the number of images associated with the album. Link  opens a page for managing album images.","In some implementations, artist page  can be used by an administrator, artist manager or other user to manage artist image  and gallery images -.

Text input fields  can include a caption field, a photographer attribution field, a location taken field, an artist name(s) field and a date taken field. Other text input fields are also possible. Caption field allows the user to specify a caption for the corresponding image . Photographer attribution field allows the user to specify the name of the photographer who took the image. Location taken field allows the user to specify the location where the image was taken. Artist name(s) field allows the user to specify the name of the artist or artists in the image.

The rows of table  correspond to the various digital media or functions arranged in categories. Some example categories are \u201csales and trends\u201d or \u201cpayments and financial reports.\u201d Other categories are also possible. The columns of table  correspond to the roles that can be assigned to a user. Some examples of roles are: administrator, legal, technical, financial, read only, sales, artist and encoder. Other roles are also possible. A colored checkmark in a cell of table  indicates read and write access (e.g., a green checkmark) or read-only access (e.g., a gray checkmark) for the role.

Error message  can be presented for several reasons. Some example reasons include but are not limited to: 1) the user is not eligible since no content has been provided by the user for this artist; 2) the artist was assigned to another user (e.g., assigned to another content provider), and the user has provided content (dispute link  is presented); 3) the artist is being managed by the user, and is already assigned to the user (a link to page  is presented); and 4) an inaccurate link (URL) to online digital media store  was input into text input field  (a link to a help manager is provided).","In the example shown, the artist was assigned to another content provider, and the user has provided digital media to online digital media store .

The features can be implemented in a computer program product tangibly embodied in an information carrier, e.g., in a machine-readable storage device, for execution by a programmable processor; and method steps can be performed by a programmable processor executing a program of instructions to perform functions of the described implementations by operating on input data and generating output.","The described features can be implemented advantageously in one or more computer programs that are executable on a programmable system including at least one programmable processor coupled to receive data and instructions from, and to transmit data and instructions to, a data storage system, at least one input device, and at least one output device. A computer program is a set of instructions that can be used, directly or indirectly, in a computer to perform a certain activity or bring about a certain result. A computer program can be written in any form of programming language (e.g., Objective-C, Java), including compiled or interpreted languages, and it can be deployed in any form, including as a stand-alone program or as a module, component, subroutine, or other unit suitable for use in a computing environment.","Suitable processors for the execution of a program of instructions include, by way of example, both general and special purpose microprocessors, and the sole processor or one of multiple processors or cores, of any kind of computer. Generally, a processor will receive instructions and data from a read-only memory or a random access memory or both. The essential elements of a computer are a processor for executing instructions and one or more memories for storing instructions and data. Generally, a computer can communicate with mass storage devices for storing data files. These mass storage devices can include magnetic disks, such as internal hard disks and removable disks; magneto-optical disks; and optical disks. Storage devices suitable for tangibly embodying computer program instructions and data include all forms of non-volatile memory, including by way of example semiconductor memory devices, such as EPROM, EEPROM, and flash memory devices; magnetic disks such as internal hard disks and removable disks; magneto-optical disks; and CD-ROM and DVD-ROM disks.

The components of the system can be connected by any form or medium of digital data communication such as a communication network. Examples of communication networks include a LAN, a WAN and the computers and networks forming the Internet.","The computer system can include clients and servers. A client and server are generally remote from each other and typically interact through a network. The relationship of client and server arises by virtue of computer programs running on the respective computers and having a client-server relationship to each other.","One or more features or steps of the disclosed embodiments can be implemented using an Application Programming Interface (API). For example, the data access daemon can be accessed by another application (e.g., a notes application) using an API. An API can define on or more parameters that are passed between a calling application and other software code (e.g., an operating system, library routine, function) that provides a service, that provides data, or that performs an operation or a computation.","The API can be implemented as one or more calls in program code that send or receive one or more parameters through a parameter list or other structure based on a call convention defined in an API specification document. A parameter can be a constant, a key, a data structure, an object, an object class, a variable, a data type, a pointer, an array, a list, or another call. API calls and parameters can be implemented in any programming language. The programming language can define the vocabulary and calling convention that a programmer will employ to access functions supporting the API.","In some implementations, an API call can report to an application the capabilities of a device running the application, such as input capability, output capability, processing capability, power capability, communications capability, etc.","A number of implementations have been described. Nevertheless, it will be understood that various modifications may be made. Elements of one or more implementations may be combined, deleted, modified, or supplemented to form further implementations. As yet another example, the logic flows depicted in the figures do not require the particular order shown, or sequential order, to achieve desirable results. In addition, other steps may be provided, or steps may be eliminated, from the described flows, and other components may be added to, or removed from, the described systems.
