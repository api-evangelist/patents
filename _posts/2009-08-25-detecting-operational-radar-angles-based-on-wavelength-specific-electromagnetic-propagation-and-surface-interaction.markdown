title: Detecting operational radar angles based on wavelength specific electromagnetic propagation and surface interaction
abstract: A detector apparatus, detection system, and method are provided for determining optimum operational angles based on the statistical correlation of wavelength-specific electromagnetic propagation and surface interaction. These techniques can be used within the radar community in both military and commercial radar applications for airborne radar system users to determine optimum operational depression angles based on the purpose of the effort, the operational frequency, and the terrain-type to be encountered. The method requires the user to interface with a standard computer equipped with the commercially available MATLABÂ® software package where the operation is presented as a graphic user interface (GUI) that once invoked allows the user to set specific parameters corresponding to the desired terrain type. Upon doing so, the algorithms are exercised and the results are displayed in a series of figures identifying the optimum operational angles.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured, used and licensed by or for the Government of the United States of America without the payment by the Government of any royalties thereon.","The present invention pertains generally to radar systems and methods. More particularly, the present invention pertains to devices and methods to detect a range of optimal depression angles.","Radar technology has transformed numerous aspects of travel and communications, including civilian and military air traffic control, defense equipment, and warfare, and has been adapted to many different applications. One particularly important application for radar is the airborne platform where the pilot or navigator can monitor other air traffic or locate a specific target, whether it is a civilian airport or an enemy encampment. The current practice for establishing airborne radar telemetry, or the radar's aspect to the ground or coverage area, is usually done prior to the mission without any meaningful consideration for optimum operational angles as a function of the purpose of the effort, the transmit frequency, and the anticipated terrain-type to be encountered. The users often improvise as to where they believe that the system will be most productive or employ trial and error techniques to estimate the operational angles, geographical parameters, and other factors. However, such estimates can be inaccurate because airborne radar systems invariably encounter a number of problems that are inherent with the airborne platform but not necessarily foreseeable during pre-flight mission planning, such as difficulties caused by signal degradation of RF transmission. This inaccuracy and lack of reliability also causes current airborne telemetry techniques to be inefficient from a time management and data collection point of view because the task needs to be repeated multiple times.","Although the basic phenomenology of radar returns is well-known to those skilled in the art and regularly employed to optimize the return signals within a single band, there has not yet been a systematic investigation of the correlation properties of returns generated within the same band using different polarization types. The lack of any systematic understanding of radar return correlation properties plus the current imprecise and ineffective trial and error approach to radar telemetry have led to numerous problems and difficulties with airborne radar systems. In order to overcome the prior art's difficulties, shortcomings, and limitations caused by the failure to systematically understand radar return correlation properties, the lack of accurate data collection, and the inefficiency of current data collection efforts, there has been a long-felt need for an airborne telemetry technique based on a more systematic understanding of radar return correlation properties that properly considers the optimum operational angles as a function of the purpose of the effort, the transmit frequency, and the terrain-type to be encountered during flight.","This invention's detection devices, apparatus, and methods resolve and overcome the long-standing disadvantages, shortcomings and limitations of the prior art's inaccurate and improvisational approach to airborne radar telemetry by providing airborne telemetry techniques that are based on a more systematic understanding of radar return correlation properties, and properly utilize optimum operational angles as a function of the purpose of the effort, the transmit frequency, and the terrain-type to be encountered during flight. The present invention provides an innovative optimum operational depression angle detector using a statistical cross-correlation metric and Graphical Use Interface (GUI) methodology that rapidly identifies a range of optimal depression angles where appreciable reflection can be expected. In accordance with the present invention, the detector and metric displayed in a GUI format allows the user to circumvent the constant questions and concerns about which type of polarization is more appropriate for a given a set of operational conditions. Up until now, this invention's correlation techniques have never been applied to difficulties with airborne radar systems. Not only does this invention provide optimum operational depression angle detector with statistical cross-correlation metric, and GUI methodology, but it is also statistically-based and much more efficient from a time management and data collection point of view.","Thus, it is an object of the present invention to provide a device to detect operational radar angles with a statistical cross-correlation metric.","It is still another object of the present invention to provide an operational radar angles detector apparatus using a statistical cross-correlation metric and GUI methodology that rapidly identifies a range of optimal depression angles where appreciable reflection can be expected.","It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a system for detecting operational radar angles using a statistical cross-correlation metric and GUI methodology that rapidly identifies a range of optimal depression angles based on wavelength specific electromagnetic propagation and surface interaction.","It is still a further object of the present invention to provide a method for detecting operational radar angles based on using a statistical cross-correlation metric and GUI methodology that rapidly identifies a range of optimal depression angles where appreciable reflection can be expected based on wavelength specific electromagnetic propagation and surface interaction.","These and other objects and advantages are provided by this invention's technique for detecting operational radar angles using a statistical cross-correlation metric that rapidly identifies a range of optimal depression angles where appreciable reflection can be expected based on wavelength specific electromagnetic propagation and surface interaction that generates a series of GUI computer screens for selecting the relevant airborne radar parameters, type of terrain, and other pertinent factors. The present invention uses the MATLAB\u00ae computer program organizing and selecting the relevant airborne radar parameters. The detector device, system, and method all provide a final output as automatic instructions to the airborne radar system and a computer screen display for the pilot or navigator. This invention is useful for both commercial and military airborne radar systems in that it provides a necessary understanding of the basic phenomenology involved in multi-band radar returns. The phenomenology provides insight into the independence or redundancy of multi-band returns for certain applications, and leads to possible criteria for optimal frequency band and depression angle selection.","The present invention encompasses an operational radar angles detector apparatus rapidly identify a range of optimum depression angles with GUI methodology, a storage medium encoded with machine-readable computer program code for an operational radar angle detection system computer to rapidly identify a range of optimum depression angles with GUI methodology, and a method for detecting operational radar angles to rapidly identify a range of optimum depression angles with a Graphical User Interface (GUI)","This invention's device to detect operational radar angles using a statistical cross-correlation metric and GUI methodology to rapidly identify a range of optimal depression angles overcome the prior art's shortcomings, disadvantages, and limitations and answers the long-felt need for airborne telemetry techniques that are based on a systematic understanding of radar return correlation properties that is statistically-based and much more efficient from a time management and data collection point of view. Radar telemetry refers to the radar's aspect to the ground or coverage area in focus sometimes called the \u201cground reference coverage area\u201d or GRCA. More specifically, radar, unlike an electro-optical system, does not have an infinite viewing plane due to the fact that its radiated energy attenuates as a function of range and atmospheric losses. Those skilled in the art readily appreciate that the airborne radar telemetry primarily embodies the depression angle and squint angle while maintaining cognizance of the aircraft's translation, i.e. altitude; ground speed; yaw; pitch; and roll.","This invention's techniques for detecting operational radar angles using a statistical cross-correlation metric to rapidly identify a range of optimal depression angles where appreciable reflection is expected due to wavelength specific electromagnetic propagation and surface interaction. This invention's detectors, systems, and methods all use the MATLAB\u00ae computer program to organize and select the relevant airborne radar parameters and advantageously generates a GUI computer screen with a series of drop down menus for selecting specific airborne radar parameters, type of terrain, and other pertinent factors. In accordance with the present invention, the detectors, systems, and methods all provide a final output as automatic instructions to the airborne radar system for making pre-flight, or even in-flight, adjustments as well as a computer screen display for the pilot or navigator.","Referring now to the drawings,  depict computer screens and charts that illustrate detailed aspects of this invention.  is a flow diagram illustrating the operation of this invention's operational radar angle detector apparatus to rapidly identify a range of optimum depression angles with a GUI in a computer .
