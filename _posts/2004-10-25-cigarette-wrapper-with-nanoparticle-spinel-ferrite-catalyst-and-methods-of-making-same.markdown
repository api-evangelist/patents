One constituent of both mainstream smoke and sidestream smoke is carbon monoxide (CO). The reduction of carbon monoxide in smoke is desirable.","Despite the developments to date, there remains a need for improved and more efficient methods and compositions for reducing the amount of carbon monoxide in the mainstream smoke of a smoking article during smoking.","A preferred embodiment of a smoking article comprises a cigarette tobacco rod having a wrapper, the wrapper including a web, an optional web-filler material, and a nanoparticle spinel ferrite catalyst.

The method optionally includes calcining the catalyst modified web-filler prior to step (iii). Preferably, the calcining comprises first heating in a reducing atmosphere and then heating in an oxidizing atmosphere.","A further preferred method of manufacturing cigarette paper including a catalyst modified web-filler comprises (i) supplying a cellulosic material to a first head box of a forming section of a papermaking machine, (ii) depositing an aqueous slurry from the first head box onto the forming section of the papermaking machine so as to form a base web of the cellulosic material, (iii) distributing a catalyst modified web-filler on the base web, the catalyst modified web-filler comprising a web-filler material supporting a nanoparticle spinel ferrite catalyst, and (iv) removing water from the base web so as to form an intermediate web. The method optionally includes calcining the catalyst modified web-filler prior to step (iii) and\/or distributing the catalyst modified web-filler within a fibrous network of the base web, wherein the layer forms a band, a stripe, or a lattice pattern on the intermediate web.","A preferred method of manufacturing a bilayer cigarette paper comprises (i) depositing a first layer of the bilayer cigarette paper from a first head box onto a wire of a papermaking machine, the first head box holding a first furnish composition (ii) depositing a second layer of the bilayer cigarette paper from a second head box onto a portion of the first layer, the second head box holding a second furnish composition, the second furnish composition including a catalyst modified web-filler comprising a web-filler material supporting a nanoparticle spinel ferrite catalyst, and (iii) removing water from the first layer and the second layer so as to form a single sheet of intermediate web. The method optionally includes calcining the catalyst modified web-filler.","A preferred method of manufacturing cigarette paper comprises (i) supplying a furnish including a cellulosic material to a first head box of a forming section of a papermaking machine, (ii) transporting a support web through the papermaking machine, (iii) depositing a catalyst modified web-filler onto the support web, the catalyst modified web-filler including a web-filler material supporting a nanoparticle spinel ferrite catalyst, (iv) depositing an aqueous slurry from the first head box onto the support web so as to form a base web of the cellulosic material with the support web embedded therein, (v) removing water from the base web so as to form a sheet, and (vi) taking up the sheet.","A preferred catalyst modified web-filler utilized in production of a wrapper for a smoking article comprises a web-filler material and a nanoparticle spinel ferrite catalyst supported on the web-filler material.","A preferred method of making a catalyst modified web-filler including a nanoparticle spinel ferrite catalyst supported on a web-filler material comprises (i) forming an aqueous slurry of the nanoparticle spinel ferrite catalyst and the web-filler material, (ii) optionally spreading the aqueous slurry on a support surface, and (iii) drying the aqueous slurry to evaporate water and to form a catalyst modified web-filler.","A further preferred method of making a catalyst modified web-filler including a nanoparticle spinel ferrite catalyst supported on a web-filler material comprises (i) precipitating the nanoparticle spinel ferrite catalyst from a liquid phase onto the web-filler material, (ii) removing at least a portion of the liquid phase, and (iii) drying the web-filler to evaporate a remainder of the liquid phase and to form the catalyst modified web-filler.","Another preferred method of making a catalyst modified web-filler including a nanoparticle spinel ferrite catalyst supported on a web-filler material comprises depositing the nanoparticle spinel ferrite catalyst from a vapor phase onto the web-filler material, wherein the nanoparticle spinel ferrite catalyst comprises copper manganese spinel ferrite, manganese oxide and iron oxide, and the web-filler material is selected from the group consisting of CaCO, TiO, SiO, AlO, MgCO, MgO and Mg(OH).","A preferred embodiment of a cigarette comprises a tobacco rod having a wrapper, the wrapper comprising a web of fibrous cellulosic material and a nanoparticle spinel ferrite catalyst. Optionally the wrapper can comprise a loading of web-filler material, at least some of the web-filler material supporting the nanoparticle spinel ferrite catalyst.","A preferred embodiment of a furnish for use in a papermaking process, the furnish comprising an aqueous slurry including a catalyst modified web-filler and a cellulosic material.","A preferred embodiment of a cigarette wrapper comprises a web having a web-filler material, at least some of the web-filler material comprising a manganese-copper-iron oxide.","Catalytic paper, compositions of catalyst modified web-filler, cigarettes, methods for making smoking articles which involve the use of nanoparticle additives incorporated into the wrapper as web-filler material are capable of acting as an oxidant for the conversion of carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide and\/or as a catalyst for the conversion of carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide. The nanoparticle additives reduce the amount of carbon monoxide in mainstream smoke.","The term \u201cmainstream\u201d smoke refers to the mixture of gases passing down the tobacco rod and issuing through the filter end, i.e., the amount of smoke issuing or drawn from the mouth end of a cigarette during smoking of the cigarette. The mainstream smoke contains smoke that is drawn in through both the lighted region, as well as through the cigarette paper wrapper.","Carbon monoxide (CO) oxidation catalysts, such as the nanoparticle spinel ferrite catalysts of the preferred embodiments, can be incorporated into the web-filler material of a wrapper of smoking articles, such as cigarettes and\/or into the tobacco cut filler of a smoking article. Such a wrapper is used to assemble the smoking article and is consumed during smoking. While not wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that during smoking, the incorporated nanoparticle catalyst catalyzes a constituent gas component in the gas stream, e.g., the carbon monoxide catalyst catalyzes CO to reduce the level of CO in the mainstream and sidestream cigarette smoke by reaction with oxygen (O) in the gas stream of the smoking article to form carbon dioxide (CO) following equation 1:\n\n2CO+O=2CO\u2003\u2003Eq. 1\n\nIt is also believed that subsequent to the catalytic reaction, the catalyst may also act as an oxidant, e.g., can oxidize CO in the absence of oxygen in the gas stream to reduce the level of CO in the mainstream and\/or sidestream smoke.\n","Referring to ), a preferred embodiment of a smoking article  has a tobacco rod portion  and filtering tip .

As shown in expanded view in ), the wrapper  includes a web of fibrous cellulosic material  in which is dispersed particles of web-filler material , such as calcium carbonate (CaCO). In practice, the web-filler material  serves as an agent for determining the permeability of the wrapper  (measured typically in units of CORESTA, which is defined as the amount of air, measured in cubic centimeters, that passes through one square centimeter of material in one minute at a pressure drop of 1.0 kilopascals) and also serves as a support for nanoparticles of the carbon monoxide catalyst, preferably nanoparticles of a manganese-copper-iron oxide. If desired, the wrapper  can optionally include a catalyst-free web-filler material . The web-filler material is a filler material utilized in production for the wrapper . If desired, the wrapper can optionally include nanoparticles of the carbon monoxide catalyst that are not supported on the web filler material.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIGS. 2(","FIG. 2(","FIG. 2("],"i":["a","b","a","b"],"b":["2","100","102","112","112","114","116","112","118","112","100","120","112","120","100","120","100","120","112","102"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIG. 3(","FIG. 3(","FIG. 3("],"i":["a","a","b"],"b":["100","102","122","122","124","126","122","128","122","122","130","132","130","132","100","130","132","102"]},"By \u201cnanoparticles\u201d is meant that the particles have an average particle diameter of less than a micron. The nanoparticle catalyst preferably has an average particle size of less than about 500 nm, further preferably less than about 300 to 400 nm, more preferably from 1 to 50 nm, even more preferably 1 to 10 nm, and most preferably less than about 5 nm. A bulk density of the nanoparticle catalyst is preferably less than 0.25 g\/cc, preferably about 0.05 g\/cc. The Brunauer, Emmett, and Teller (BET) surface area of preferred nanoparticle catalyst is about 10 m\/g to 50 m\/g, more preferably about 20 m\/g to about 40 m\/g. An example of a nanoparticle spinel ferrite catalyst includes a nanoparticle manganese-copper-iron oxide catalyst. A preferred nanoparticle manganese-copper-iron oxide catalyst is pigment Black-444, available from Shepherd Color Company. The nanoparticle manganese-copper-iron oxide catalyst can comprise copper manganese spinel ferrite, manganese oxide and iron oxide. The catalyst can comprise natural black iron oxide (natural magnetite) or synthetic black iron oxide in shapes such as cubical, spherical and\/or accicular particles.","The nanoparticle spinel ferrite catalyst can be incorporated into the wrapping paper by fixing the nanoparticle spinel ferrite catalyst to filler material utilized as web-filler material in the production of cigarette wrapping paper. The web-filler material can include an oxide, a carbonate, or a hydroxide of a Group II, Group III or Group IV metal, or the web-filler material can be selected from the group consisting of CaCO, TiO, silicates such as SiO, AlO, MgCO, MgO and Mg(OH). In a preferred example, the web-filler material is CaCOor other conventional filler material used in cigarette paper manufacture. If desired, the wrapper paper can include web-filler material which does not include the nanoparticle spinel ferrite catalyst or an unsupported catalyst can be incorporated in the cigarette wrapping paper with or without a web-filler such as calcium carbonate.","In a preferred embodiment of a smoking article, the nanoparticle manganese-copper-iron oxide catalyst includes copper manganese spinel ferrite, manganese oxide and iron oxide. The catalyst modified web-filler preferably comprises a nanoparticle manganese-copper-iron oxide catalyst fixed to filler particles selected from the group consisting of CaCO, TiO, silicates such as SiO, AlO, MgCO, MgO and Mg(OH). An average particle size of the catalyst modified paper web-filler is 0.1 to 10 microns, preferably less than or equal to 1.5 microns.","In another preferred embodiment, a total amount of nanoparticle spinel ferrite catalyst in the smoking article is an amount effective to convert at least some CO to CO. For cigarettes, a preferred amount of catalyst per cigarette is 1 to 100 mg, 1 to 50 mg or 50 to 100 mg, 2 to 25 mg or 25 to 50 mg, 1 to 15 mg or 15 to 40 mg, or 4 to 10 mg or 10 to 20 mg.","In one approach, the nanoparticle spinel ferrite catalyst, such as nanoparticle manganese-copper-iron oxide catalyst, is supported by web-filler material, such as CaCO, by forming an aqueous slurry of the nanoparticle spinel ferrite catalyst and the web-filler material. The CaCOused in this process can be the same as the filler material used in the papermaking process, such as ALBACAR\u00ae 5970 commercially available from Specialty Minerals of Bethlehem, Pa. The slurry is spread, by, for example, spreading the slurry with a doctor blade, and then dried to evaporate the water leaving behind a solid. One method to dry the slurry includes exposure in air while heated by a heat source, such as radiation lamp at 75\u00b0 C., although other methods such as vacuum filtering followed by drying can also be used.","The catalyst and filler can be provided in any desired amounts, e.g., 10 to 90% catalyst and 90 to 10% web-filler material. The dried slurry forms a powdery substance or a self-supporting solid mass, depending on the nanoparticle spinel ferrite catalyst loading of the slurry. For example, for a slurry containing less than about 50 to 60 wt. % catalyst loading of nanoparticle spinel ferrite on calcium carbonate, the slurry dries to a powdery substance; for a slurry containing greater than about 60 to 70 wt. % catalyst loading of the nanoparticle spinel ferrite on calcium carbonate, the slurry dries to a self-supporting solid mass. Prior to incorporating the catalyst modified web-filler into the wrapper, e.g., the web-filler material supporting nanoparticle spinel ferrite catalyst such as nanoparticle manganese-copper-iron oxide catalyst\/CaCOparticles, the average particle size of the catalyst modified web-filler can be reduced to an average particle size of 0.1 to 10 microns, preferably about 1 micron or less. For example, the catalyst modified web-filler can be ball milled to form a powder by milling, for example, with 1 cm agate milling balls for 2 to 4 hours at 100 to 300 rpm. Ball milling may not be necessary where the slurry dries to a powdery substance. Subsequently, the catalyst modified web-filler, e.g., nanoparticle spinel ferrite catalyst\/web-filler material, can be incorporated into the wrapper through a papermaking process. For example, the catalyst modified web-filler can be used as filler material in the papermaking processes. In a preferred embodiment, the level of web-filler material in the wrapper (both catalyst modified web-filler and\/or web-filler material without catalyst) can be from 3 to 50 wt. %.","In another approach, particles of web-filler material, such as CaCO, support the nanoparticle spinel ferrite catalyst, such as nanoparticle manganese-copper-iron oxide catalyst, by forming an aqueous slurry of the nanoparticle spinel ferrite catalyst and the web-filler material, drying the slurry to form the catalyst modified web-filler, and subsequently calcining the catalyst modified web-filler. The slurry is formed substantially as described above with respect to the first approach. After drying the slurry to form a self-supporting solid mass and ball milling to form a powder (if necessary to reduce the size of the catalyst modified web-filler), the catalyst modified web-filler is calcined by heating the catalyst modified web-filler to a suitable calcining temperature, e.g., up to 500\u00b0 C., preferably from 200\u00b0 C. to 400\u00b0 C., for a suitable period of time such as from 1 to 3 hours, preferably 2 hours.","The nanoparticle spinel ferrite catalyst can be fixed to the web-filler material by any suitable technique. For example, the nanoparticle spinel ferrite catalyst can be combined with the web-filler material by precipitating the catalyst from a liquid phase onto the web-filler material or depositing the catalyst from a vapor phase onto the web-filler material.","According to a preferred embodiment, the catalyst or catalyst modified web-filler, e.g., the nanoparticle spinel ferrite catalyst\/web-filler material, is incorporated in the wrapper through conventional papermaking processes. For example, the catalyst modified web-filler or spinel ferrite catalyst can be used as all or part of the filler material in the papermaking processes or can be distributed directly onto the wrapper, such as by spraying or coating onto wet or dry base web. In production of a smoking article such as a cigarette, the wrapper is wrapped around cut filler to form a tobacco rod portion of the smoking article by a cigarette making machine, which has previously been supplied or is continuously supplied with tobacco cut filler and one or more ribbons of wrapper. In a further embodiment, the catalyst can be incorporated in the tobacco cut filler.","Any suitable tobacco mixture may be used for the cut filler. Examples of suitable types of tobacco materials include flue-cured, Burley, Md. or Oriental tobaccos, the rare or specialty tobaccos, and blends thereof. The tobacco material can be provided in the form of tobacco lamina, processed tobacco materials such as volume expanded or puffed tobacco, processed tobacco stems such as cut-rolled or cut-puffed stems, reconstituted tobacco materials, or blends thereof. The tobacco can also include tobacco substitutes.","In cigarette manufacture, the tobacco is normally employed in the form of cut filler, i.e., in the form of shreds or strands cut into widths ranging from about 1\/10 inch to about 1\/20 inch or even 1\/40 inch. The lengths of the strands range from between about 0.25 inches to about 3.0 inches. The cigarettes may further comprise one or more flavorants or other additives (e.g., burn additives, combustion modifying agents, coloring agents, binders, etc.) known in the art.","A wrapper can be any wrapping surrounding the cut filler, including wrappers containing flax, hemp, kenaf, esparto grass, rice straw, cellulose and so forth. Optional filler materials, flavor additives, and burning additives can be included. When supplied to the cigarette making machine, the wrapper can be supplied from a single bobbin in a continuous sheet (a monowrap) or from multiple bobbins (a multiwrap, such as a dual wrap from two bobbins). Further, the wrapper can have more than one layer in cross-section, such as in a bilayer paper as disclosed in commonly-owned U.S. Pat. No. 5,143,098, issued to Rogers, the entire content of which is herein incorporated by reference.","The papermaking process can be carried out using conventional paper making equipment. An exemplary method of manufacturing paper wrapper, e.g., cigarette paper including catalyst modified web-filler comprising nanoparticle spinel ferrite catalyst supported by a web-filler material, comprises supplying the catalyst modified web-filler and a cellulosic material to a papermaking machine. For example, an aqueous slurry (or \u201cfurnish\u201d) including the catalyst modified web-filler and the cellulosic material can be supplied to a head box of a forming section of a Fourdrinier papermaking machine. The catalyst modified web-filler includes a nanoparticle spinel ferrite catalyst, e.g., nanoparticle manganese-copper-iron oxide catalyst, supported by a web-filler material, e.g., CaCO. For example, the catalyst modified web-filler can include nanoparticle manganese-copper-iron oxide catalyst\/CaCOparticles or any other suitable nanoparticle spinel ferrite catalyst and web-filler material, such as an oxide, a carbonate, or a hydroxide of a Group II, Group III or Group IV metal, CaCO, TiO, silicates such as SiO, AlO, MgCO, MgO and Mg(OH). The aqueous slurry can be supplied to the head box by a plurality of conduits which communicate with a source, such as a storage tank.","The exemplary method can optionally include calcining the catalyst modified web-filler in a step prior to supplying the furnish to the papermaking machine.","The catalyst modified web-filler can be supplied to the papermaking process in any suitable form, such as in the form of an aqueous slurry or in the form of a dry powder to be slurried during the papermaking process prior to addition to the head box. For example, the catalyst modified web-filler can be produced on site as a slurry. The aqueous slurry containing the catalyst modified web-filler can be used immediately or stored for future use. In a preferred embodiment, the head box is supplied with an aqueous slurry of furnish containing the catalyst modified web-filler and cellulosic material used to form a web. Optionally, an aqueous slurry of furnish containing catalyst modified web-filler and an aqueous slurry furnish of cellulosic material without catalyst modified web-filler or with a different concentration of catalyst modified web-filler can be supplied to separate head boxes or multiple head boxes.","An exemplary method deposits the aqueous slurry from the head box onto a forming section so as to form a base web of the cellulosic material and the catalyst modified web-filler. For example, in a typical Fourdrinier machine, the forming section is a Fourdrinier wire which is arranged as an endless forming wire immediately below the head box. A slice defined in a lower portion of the head box adjacent to the endless wire permits the aqueous slurry of catalyst modified web-filler and cellulosic material from the head box to flow through the slice onto the top surface of the endless wire to form a wet base web. Optionally, the aqueous slurry can be deposited onto a support web that is retained within the paper. For example, a support web can be transported through the forming section of a papermaking machine and can be a foundation on which the aqueous slurry is deposited. The aqueous slurry dries on the Fourdrinier wire in the forming section to an intermediate web, which may still retain an aqueous component, and is further processed to form a paper sheet (e.g., finished web) with the support web embedded therein. The support web can be a conventional web, such as a flax support web, or can include a web with an incorporated catalytic component, such as a nanoparticle spinel ferrite catalyst. If the support web includes a catalytic component, the incorporated catalytic component can be supported on a web-filler material or can be directly supported on the support web without a web-filler material.","After depositing the aqueous slurry onto the forming section, water is removed from the wet base web to form an intermediate web and, with additional processing such as further drying and pressing if necessary, forms a sheet of cigarette paper (e.g., finished web). The cigarette paper is subsequently taken up for storage or use, e.g., the cigarette paper is coiled in a sheet or roll.","Referring to , a cigarette papermaking machine  includes a head box  operatively located at one end of a Fourdrinier wire , and source of feed stock slurry such as a run tank  in communication with the head box . The head box  can be one typically utilized in the papermaking industry for laying down cellulosic pulp upon the Fourdrinier wire . In the usual context, the head box  is communicated to the run tank  through a plurality of conduits. The run tank  receives furnish from a furnish supply . Preferably, the feed stock from the run tank  is a refined cellulosic pulp such as a refined flax or wood pulp as is the common practice in the cigarette papermaking industry. Preferably, a chalk tank  (containing the catalyst modified web-filler described above) is communicated with the run tank  so as to establish a desired \u201cchalk\u201d level in the slurry supplied to the head box .","The Fourdrinier wire  carries the laid slurry pulp (e.g., base web) from the head box  along a path in the general direction of arrow A in , whereupon water is allowed to drain from the pulp through the wire  by the influence of gravity and (optionally) at some locations with the assistance of vacuum boxes , \u2032, \u2033 at various locations along the Fourdrinier wire  as is the established practice in the art of cigarette papermaking. At some point along the Fourdrinier wire , sufficient water is removed from the base web to establish what is commonly referred to as a dry line where the texture of the slurry transforms from one of a glossy, watery appearance to a surface appearance more approximating that of the finished base web (but in a wetted condition, e.g., an intermediate web). At and about the dry line, the moisture content of the pulp material is approximately 85 to 90%, which may vary depending upon operating conditions and the like.","Downstream of the dry line, the intermediate web  is separated from the Fourdrinier wire  at a couch roll . From there, the Fourdrinier wire  continues on the return loop of its endless path. Beyond the couch roll , the intermediate web  continues on through the remainder of the papermaking system which further dries and presses the intermediate web  and surface conditions the intermediate web  to a desired final moisture content and texture to form a paper  (e.g., finished web). Such drying apparatus are well known in the art of papermaking and may include drying section  including drying felts, vacuum devices, rolls and\/or presses, applied thermal energy, and the like.","The cigarette making machine  can optionally include more than one head box and\/or more than one Fourdrinier wire with either separate or common furnish supply. Referring to , the optional second head box \u2032, suitably integrated with a runtank and furnish supply, can lay slurry pulp onto the slurry pulp laid from the first head box  and carried along Fourdrinier wire . The second and\/or additional head box can be supplied with catalyst modified web filler to a desired \u201cchalk\u201d level or can be free of catalyst modified web-filler, as desired based on the number of layers of slurry pulp to be deposited and\/or the use of the wrapper formed from the papermaking process. Optionally and\/or in the alternative, some or all of the catalyst modified web-filler may be introduced from the first, upstream head box .","Referring to , the optional second Fourdrinier wire \u2032, suitably integrated with a head box \u2032 laying slurry pulp on the Fourdrinier wire \u2032 and draining and drying equipment, can form a second intermediate web \u2032. The second intermediate web \u2032 can be separated from the second Fourdrinier wire \u2032 at a second couch roll \u2032 and laid on the first intermediate web  from the Fourdrinier wire  to be processed into double layer paper. Multiple optional Fourdrinier wires can be employed to form multiple layer paper having any desired number of layers, such as three, four and so forth, up to ten to twelve layers.","Other papermaking processes can be used to make a wrapper with a nanoparticle spinel ferrite catalyst. For example, a laminated, bilayer or multilayer wrapper can be made. Examples of bilayer and multilayer wrappers are disclosed in commonly-owned U.S. Pat. No. 5,143,098, issued to Rogers. In an embodiment of a bilayer or multilayer wrapper including a nanoparticle spinel ferrite catalyst, at least one of a radially inner layer and\/or a radially outer layer can include the nanoparticle spinel ferrite catalyst as described in embodiments herein. Preferably, for cosmetic appearance due to darkening of paper containing catalyst modified web-filler with a spinel ferrite as the nanoparticle catalyst, a radially innermost layer of the multilayer paper adjacent the cut filler in the smoking article is the portion of the multilayer wrapper that includes the web-filler material that supports a nanoparticle spinel ferrite catalyst.","The bilayer or multilayer single sheet wrapper may be made using ordinary paper furnish such as pulped wood, flax fibers, or any standard cellulosic fiber. Preferably flax fibers are used. Different fillers, including different catalytic fillers such as the catalyst modified web-filler described herein, or different fibers may be used for each layer and may be contained in different head boxes, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,143,098. For example, a first head box can hold the materials for a wrapper that includes the nanoparticle spinel ferrite catalyst and a second head box can hold the materials for a conventional wrapper.","In another example of making bilayer or multilayer single sheet wrapper, the first head box can hold the materials for a wrapper that includes the nanoparticle spinel ferrite catalyst at a first concentration or loading level and a second head box can hold the materials for a wrapper that includes the nanoparticle spinel ferrite catalyst at a second concentration or loading level. In preferred embodiments, the first concentration or first loading level is different from the second concentration or second loading level. For example, the wrapper can have a radially inner layer and a radially outer layer, the radially inner layer having a first loading of the nanoparticle spinel ferrite catalyst and the radially outer layer having a second loading of the nanoparticle spinel ferrite catalyst. The first loading of the nanoparticle spinel ferrite catalyst can be greater than the second loading of the nanoparticle spinel ferrite catalyst. In one embodiment, the first loading of the nanoparticle spinel ferrite catalyst is up to 100 mg and the second loading of the nanoparticle spinel ferrite catalyst is less than 1 mg. Preferably, the second loading of the nanoparticle spinel ferrite catalyst is zero. In another embodiment a ratio, in weight percent, of the nanoparticle spinel ferrite catalyst to the web-filler material in the radially inner layer is from 0.1 to 10.0, more preferably from 0.1 to 1.0, most preferably from 0.33 to 1.0, and a total loading of the nanoparticle spinel ferrite catalyst in the radially outer layer is less than 1 mg, more preferably the total loading of the nanoparticle spinel ferrite catalyst in the radially outer layer is zero.","Additional examples of papermaking processes include the method for making banded smoking article wrappers disclosed in commonly-owned U.S. Pat. No. 5,342,484, the entire content of which is herein incorporated by reference, and the method for producing paper having a plurality of regions of variable basis weight in the cross direction disclosed in commonly-owned U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,474,095 and 5,997,691, the entire contents of which are herein incorporated by reference. Further and in the alternative to incorporating nanoparticle catalyst into the web of the wrapper in a papermaking process, it is contemplated that the paper (wrapper) can be manufactured first and the nanoparticle catalyst placed onto the surface. For example, the nanoparticles can be distributed directly onto the wrapper, such as by spraying or coating onto wet base web, the intermediate web or the finished web. Further, the nanoparticle can be coated and\/or printed (text or images) within the papermaking process or in a separate application of nanoparticle catalyst on-line during manufacture of the cigarette. The amount of printing and\/or the amount of catalyst can be varied to adjust the level of CO reduction.

Optionally, the outer wrapper  may be constructed similarly to include a nanocatalyst.","Optionally, the central tube can be constructed such that heat applied to an end of the tube will cause the end portion of the tube to collapse upon itself and seal off (or close) the end of the tube. The collapsing feature can be achieved by a number of different embodiments of the central tube.

Further, while one embodiment of a cigarette with a porous heat transfer tube is shown in , the catalytic paper disclosed herein can be used to surround the tobacco rod portion, or can be used as the wrapper, be incorporated into a cellulosic component of the filter portion, and\/or in place of paper layers in other porous heat transfer tube cigarette arrangements than shown in .","Referring now to the embodiment of ) and (), the inner wrapper and the outer wrapper are individual wrappers formed in separate papermaking processes and later wrapped around tobacco cut filler to from a cigarette tobacco rod. The inner wrapper, the outer wrapper or both wrappers can include the catalyst modified web-filler, e.g., the nanoparticle spinel ferrite catalyst supported by a web-filler material. In examples where both wrappers include a catalyst modified web-filler, the specific nanoparticle spinel ferrite catalyst and the catalyst loading in each wrapper can be the same or different. In some embodiments, the addition of a catalyst modified web-filler can discolor the wrapper, e.g., the wrapper becomes non-white or brown. For aesthetic reasons, an outer wrapper that is a conventional color, e.g., white, can be placed around the inner wrapper. Both the inner wrapper and the outer wrapper can be selected to give a desired smoking article performance with respect to smoking article properties, such as puff count, tar, burn rate, and ash appearance. Accordingly and as shown and described, for example, with reference to ) and (), preferred embodiments of smoking articles and methods of making smoking articles can include a tobacco rod portion of a cigarette with a nanoparticle spinel ferrite catalyst supported on the web-filler material of a first wrapper with a second outermost wrapper, which does not contain the catalyst modified web-filler. Also with reference to , the central tube formed with catalytic paper can satisfy aesthetics by placing the catalytic paper in the interior of the smoking article.","An exemplary wrapper for a smoking article comprises a paper web including cellulosic fibers and a catalyst modified web-filler incorporated into the paper web. The catalyst modified web-filler includes a web-filler material supporting a nanoparticle spinel ferrite catalyst or the spinel ferrite catalyst can be used as the web-filler.","The wrapper can be any suitable conventional wrapper. For example, a preferred wrapper can have a basis weight of from about 18 g\/mto about 60 g\/mand a permeability of from about 5 CORESTA units to about 80 CORESTA units. More preferably, the wrapper has a basis weight from about 30 g\/mto about 45 g\/mand the permeability is about 30 to 35 CORESTA units. However, any suitable basis weight for the wrapper can be selected. For example, a higher basis weight, e.g., 35 to 45 g\/m, can support a higher loading of catalyst. If a lower catalyst loading is selected, then a lower basis weight wrapper can be used.","Other permeabilities of the wrapper (as measured by CORESTA units) can be selected based on the application and location of the wrapper. For example, in multilayer wrappers the permeability of a first layer can be up to 30,000 CORESTA units, although a permeability that is lower or higher can be utilized. Thickness of single-layer wrapper can preferably be from 15 to 100 microns, more preferably from 20 to 50 microns. Additional layers in a multilayer wrapper can be from 0.1 to 10 times the permeability of the first layer and can have a thickness of from 0.1 to 2 times the thickness of the first layer. Both the permeability and the thickness of the first layer and the second layer can be selected to achieve a desired total air permeability and total thickness for the smoking article.","The nanoparticle spinel ferrite catalyst to web-filler material ratio can be varied by subjecting a slurry of nanoparticle spinel ferrite catalyst\/web-filler material, e.g., a slurry of nanoparticle manganese-copper-iron oxide catalyst\/CaCOor other catalyst modified web-filler, to calcining at different temperatures for different time periods. Also, the mixing conditions of the slurry can be selected to achieve a desired distribution of the web-filler material with the nanoparticle spinel ferrite catalyst. For example, the speed, time, blade type, and temperature can all be adjusted to achieve a desired uniformity of the nanoparticle spinel ferrite catalyst to web-filler material ratio. Alternatively, the nanoparticle spinel ferrite catalyst\/web-filler material can be co-precipitated to form a particle or a powder, e.g., chemical precipitation methods can be used, such as precipitating CaCOfrom CaClby adding a carbonate, such as NaCO. Gas phase precipitation methods to deposit nanoparticle spinel ferrite catalyst in-situ onto a web-filler material can also be employed. For example, vapor deposition or spray techniques can be used.","While not wishing to be bound by theory, it appears that CO catalyst in the form of nanoparticle spinel ferrite catalyst, starts to convert CO to COat a temperature above about 110\u00b0 C. Additionally, the conversion rate of CO to COby nanoparticle spinel ferrite catalyst is enhanced by the rapid and efficient transport of CO to the region of the nanoparticle spinel ferrite catalyst and COaway from the region of the catalyst, e.g., air flow within the smoking article. Together, the operating temperature and the air flow within the smoking article can affect the operation of the nanoparticle spinel ferrite catalyst.","During the puffing process, CO in mainstream smoke flows toward the filter end of a smoking article. As carbon monoxide travels within the smoking article, oxygen diffuses into and carbon monoxide diffuses out of the smoking article through the paper wrapper. After a typical 2-second puff of a cigarette, CO is concentrated in the periphery of the cigarette, e.g., near the cigarette wrapper, in front of the burn zone. The oxygen concentration is high in the same region as high CO concentration due to diffusion of Ofrom outside the cigarette. Airflow into the tobacco rod is largest near the burn zone on the periphery of the smoking article and is approximately commensurate with the gradient of temperature, e.g., larger airflow is associated with higher temperature gradients. Thus, the highest airflow is also the region of highest temperature gradient. For example in a typical smoking article, the highest temperature gradient is from >850-900\u00b0 C. at the periphery of the smoking article at the burn zone to approximately 300\u00b0 C. toward the center of the smoking article. The temperature further drops to near ambient near the filter end. Furthermore, the temperature drop at the lit end is very fast and within a couple of mm behind the burn zone in the axial direction the temperature drops from 900\u00b0 C. to 200\u00b0 C. Further information on airflow patterns, the formation of constituents in cigarettes during smoking and smoke formation and delivery can be found in Richard R. Baker, \u201cMechanism of Smoke Formation and Delivery\u201d, , vol. 6, pp. 184-224, (1980) and Richard R. Baker, \u201cVariation of the Gas Formation Regions within a Cigarette Combustion Coal during the Smoking Cycle\u201d, , vol. 11, no. 1, pp. 1-17, (1981), the contents of both are incorporated herein by reference.","The position and quantity of nanoparticle spinel ferrite catalyst in the wrapper and\/or tobacco rod can be selected as a function of the temperature and airflow characteristics exhibited in a burning cigarette in order to adjust, e.g., increase, decrease, minimize or maximize, the conversion rate of CO to CO, by depositing aqueous slurry with catalyst modified web-filler selectively during the papermaking process. For example, the solid coal in a smoking article reaches the peak temperature of greater than 850-900\u00b0 C. at about the burn zone, e.g., within about 2 mm of the burn zone, and is at 300\u00b0 C. to 400\u00b0 C. within 2 to 3 mm of the burn zone. Thus, a nanoparticle spinel ferrite catalyst can be selected that operates in a given temperature range, and a wrapper can be manufactured in which the catalyst modified web-filler, e.g., nanoparticle manganese-copper-iron oxide catalyst\/CaCO, can be incorporated in those portions of the wrapper that are predicted to coincide with the appropriate temperature for operation of the catalyst. The selective incorporation of catalyst modified web-filler can be realized, for example, by using different head boxes containing the selected concentration of catalyst modified web-filler and\/or locating head boxes with different concentrations of catalyst modified web-filler at selected positions in the papermaking process corresponding to selected locations of the catalytic paper to be produced.","For example, a preferred nanoparticle spinel ferrite catalyst for use in a wrapper for a smoking article is catalytically active at temperatures as low as ambient temperature and preferably does not deactivate even at temperatures as high as 900\u00b0 C. The preferred nanoparticle spinel ferrite catalyst can be positioned along the entire axial length of the anticipated burn zone, e.g., not only at the filter end of the smoking article, and can be catalytically active from the lit end to the filter end during use. The axial distribution of the nanoparticle spinel ferrite catalyst provides sufficient contact time between the mainstream smoke and the nanoparticle spinel ferrite catalyst for the CO to be converted to CO. An example of a preferred nanoparticle spinel ferrite catalyst includes Black-444, which starts to convert CO to COat a temperature above about 110\u00b0 C.","In a further example, a mixed catalyst, e.g., a catalyst that is a combination of individual catalyst compositions that each operate at a different temperature range or overlapping temperature ranges, can be used to broaden the temperature range at which conversion of CO to COcan occur and to increase the operating period of the catalyst as the smoking article burns. For example, a mixed catalyst may operate at both above about 500\u00b0 C. and at 300\u00b0 C. to 400\u00b0 C. and thus converts CO to COboth at the burn zone and behind the burn zone, effectively increasing the conversion time and the area of the wrapper at which conversion occurs.","Although the catalyst is described herein as having an operating temperature, the term operating temperature refers to the preferred temperature for conversion of CO to CO. The catalyst may still operate to convert CO to COoutside the described temperature range, but the conversion rate may affected.","A horizontal flow tube set-up as illustrated in  can be used to evaluate the CO oxidation efficacy of as-received nanoparticle spinel ferrite catalyst as well as heat treated (i.e., calcined) samples. A catalyst bed  containing about 100 mg of nanoparticles can be placed between two pieces of quartz wool  at the center of a 6 mm I.D. quartz tube . The quartz tube can be heated in a horizontal tube furnace  at a heating rate of from about 1 to 50\u00b0 C.\/min (e.g., 6, 10 or 20\u00b0 C.\/min) and the temperature of the catalyst can be measured using a thermocouple . A CO gas mixture (e.g., a CO\u2014O\u2014He mixture) can be introduced to the quartz tube  via gas flow inlet  and the composition of the effluent gases can be analyzed by an infra red detector .","A calcination process was investigated for heat treating the nanoparticle spinel ferrite. A reduction followed by oxidation type of heat treatment can be applied to as-received spinel ferrite nanoparticles. The calcination can comprise a reduction step under a 3.7% CO\u2014He gas flow (e.g., 300 sccm) for one hour at 400\u00b0 C.; a cooling step under pure He where the sample is cooled to ambient temperature; and an oxidation step under a 20% O\u2014He flow (e.g., 300 sccm) for from 1 to 6 hours at different temperatures (e.g., 200, 320 or 500\u00b0 C.). Without being held to any one theory, it is believed that a calcination step can improve the bonding between the catalyst and the web-filler material and that during the calcination step the catalyst surface is improved due to evaporation of bound water molecules.","The crystallographic structure of the catalysts was analyzed by x-ray diffraction (XRD) using a Philips X'Pert Pro Theta-Theta system (model PW 3040\/60) using Cu K radiation at an operating voltage of 45 kV and a tube current of 40 mA. The particle size, structure and morphology of the catalysts were examined using a Philips F20 field emission scanning electron microscope (HRTEM, Technai 200) and Topcan high resolution scanning electron microscope. The surface area of the catalysts was measured using the BET technique. Elemental composition was measured using ICP-AES (for metals) and combustion analysis (for carbon). The reducibility of the catalysts were characterized using a Temperature Programmed Reduction (TPR) technique (Micromeritics, model AutoChem II 2920) wherein hydrogen uptake by the catalysts is measured as a function of temperature.","The x-ray diffraction patterns for nanoparticle spinel ferrite catalysts are shown in . Curve A shows the diffraction pattern for the as-received (Black-444 powder) sample. The as-received sample comprises a spinel phase of CuMnO, \u03b1-FeO, \u03b2\u2033-FeOand MnO. HRTEM indicated that Fe was partially in solid solution in the copper manganese spinel ferrite. The composition of the as-received sample was (in weight percent) 17.7% Fe, 44.7% Mn and 37.6% Cu (with less than 0.5% each of C, Si and Zn). The surface area of the as-received catalyst was about 20 m\/g and comprised individual particles ranging in size from about 30 to 300 nm. Curve B shows the x-ray diffraction pattern after a reduction-oxidation calcination (oxidation at 320\u00b0 C. for 3 hours). The calcination effects a change in crystal morphology and grain size as indicated by peak broadening in XRD with reduced peak intensity. HRTEM of samples reduced and then oxidized at 320\u00b0 C. for 3 hours reveal surface clusters or domains of CuMnOhaving a size of about 5 nm. Preferably, the nanoparticle spinel ferrite catalysts comprise at least one surface domain with a size of about 5 nm.","The TPR profile for as-received catalyst is shown in  along with comparative TPR profiles for MnO, CuO and FeO. During the TPR measurement, samples were quenched from temperatures corresponding to points a, b and c and the quenched samples were studied using XRD. As shown in , the sample quenched from 240\u00b0 C. (Curve a) exhibits reflections from the spinel phase, MnOand FeOwhile the sample quenched from 350\u00b0 C. (Curve b) exhibits reflections from FeO, FeO, Cu, MnO and MnO. This suggests that reduction of the spinel phase starts during the first TPR peak shown in  at about 214\u00b0 C. and is complete after the second TPR peak at about 299\u00b0 C. The sample quenched from 750\u00b0 C. (Curve c) exhibits reflections from Cu, Fe and MnO.","The catalytic activity of as-received and calcined catalyst was tested in the presence of oxygen using a 4 vol. % CO:20 vol. % O(balance He) gas mixture at a total flow rate of 1 slm and a furnace heating rate of 12\u00b0 C.\/min. Percent CO conversion versus temperature is shown in . For the as-received catalyst, 2% CO conversion was achieved at 114\u00b0 C. and 50% CO conversion was achieved at 218\u00b0 C. The catalytic activity was improved after oxidation at 320\u00b0 C., which was a sufficiently high temperature to remove retained carbon and create surface clusters and an increased density of lattice defects. For example, complete CO conversion (100% conversion) was obtained for the sample oxidized at 320\u00b0 C. for 1 hour at 180\u00b0 C. Oxidation at higher temperatures (e.g., to 500\u00b0 C.) deteriorated the catalyst activity.","The catalytic activity of as-received catalyst was tested in the absence of oxygen using a 4 vol. % CO (balance He) gas mixture at a total flow rate of 300 sccm and a furnace heating rate of 6\u00b0 C.\/min. The concentration of CO and COare shown in . The depletion of CO (and the concomitant production of CO) reached a maximum at about 300\u00b0 C. suggesting that the as-received catalyst can oxidize CO (i.e., donate oxygen to promote the conversion of CO to CO) in the absence of an external source of oxygen.","The catalytic efficiency of supported and unsupported nanoparticle spinel ferrite catalysts was tested by incorporating the catalysts in the tobacco cut filler of a standard cigarette that was smoked in a conventional smoking machine. The effluent gases from the cigarette were analyzed by FTIR. An unsupported catalytic sample of 160 mg of Black-444 was incorporated into a test cigarette by sprinkling the spinel ferrite throughout the tobacco used to form the tobacco rod. A 43% reduction in CO was measured relative to a control sample for the unsupported catalyst. Nanoparticle spinel ferrite catalysts supported on alumina were also tested. Samples comprising 16 mg of Black-444 supported on 64 mg and 144 mg of alumina showed a 16% and 30% reduction in CO, respectively. Samples comprising 32 mg of Black-444 supported on 48 mg and 128 mg of alumina showed a 13% and 43% reduction in CO, respectively. Preferably the total loading per cigarette of the nanoparticle spinel ferrite catalyst (either supported or unsupported) is an amount effective to reduce the concentration in mainstream smoke of CO by at least 10% or by at least 30%.","In another exemplary embodiment, a nanoparticle spinel ferrite catalyst can be used in combination with another catalyst. Low temperature and even room temperature catalysts can extend the effective region of the reaction zone for CO to COconversion to the whole cigarette, provided the temperature rise due to the exothermic reaction remains below the ignition temperature of the wrapper.","In addition, any of the wrappers, smoking articles or methods described herein can include additional additives conventionally used in wrappers for smoking articles. These additives can include, for example, additives to control the appearance, e.g., color, of the wrapper, additives to control the burn rate of the wrapper, and\/or additives to result in a desired ash appearance and\/or web-fillers used in cigarette paper.","The method can be implemented in an easy to use and economical manner as explained herein. The catalyst modified web-filler can be used to: (1) remove carbon monoxide in the mainstream cigarette smoke or sidestream smoke of smoking articles; (2) reduce or eliminate particle entrainment since the catalyst is embedded in the wrapper; (3) remove a target constituent, such as carbon monoxide, highly selectively since the catalyst in the wrapper only catalyzes those gases that are near the wrapper and\/or for which the catalyst has an affinity; and\/or (4) easily implement in large scale production through the papermaking process.","The tobacco column preferably comprises cut filler of a blend of tobaccos typical of the industry, including blends comprising bright, burley and oriental tobaccos and other blend components, including traditional cigarette flavors. In the preferred embodiment, the shredded tobacco (cut filler) of the tobacco column comprises a blend of bright, burley and oriental tobaccos with or without inclusion of reconstituted tobaccos or any after cut flavorings. Optionally, an expanded tobacco component might be included in the blend to adjust rod density, and flavors may be added. Optionally, a single variety of the aforementioned tobaccos may be used instead of a blend.","While various embodiments have been described, it is to be understood that variations and modifications may be resorted to as will be apparent to those skilled in the art.
