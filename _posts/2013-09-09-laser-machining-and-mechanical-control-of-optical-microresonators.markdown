{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD OF INVENTION","TERMS OF ART","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION"],"p":["This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/698,741 filed on Sep. 10, 2012.","The invention described herein was made by an employee of the United States Government and which may be manufactured and used by the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefore.","This invention relates to the field of optical microresonators, and more specifically to rapid laser fabrication of optical microresonators","As used herein, the term \u201cmicroresonator\u201d refers to an optical device with the capability to support whispering gallery modes.","As used herein, the term \u201cpiezoelectric\u201d refers to a quality or the effect of inducing mechanical stress in a material by applying an electric voltage which leads to expansion of the material.","As used herein, the term \u201cplurality\u201d means a quantity of two or more.","As used herein, the term \u201cshape\u201d means the measurable physical characteristics of an optical microresonator including but not limited to thickness, diameter and radius of curvature.","Since their inception nearly 25 years ago, optical microresonators have had a major impact on many fields related to linear and non-linear optics. Optical microresonators are used in photonics technologies for laser stabilization, optical filtering and wavelength division multiplexing, as well as in nonlinear optics for Raman lasers, frequency comb generators, and Brillouin lasers. Optical microresonators are useful tools in cavity quantum electrodynamics and cavity optomechanics, where they couple mechanical motion with optical fields.","The capability for optical microresonators to achieve this result is due to the phenomena of the whispering gallery mode present in all microresonators. This phenomenon occurs when laser light is coupled into a circular waveguide, such as a glass ring or disk. When the light strikes the boundary of the waveguide at a grazing angle it is reflected back into the waveguide. The light wave can make many trips around the waveguide before it is absorbed, but only at frequencies of light that fit perfectly into the circumference of the waveguide. If the circumference is a whole number of wavelengths, the light waves superimpose perfectly each trip around.","The so-called \u201cwhispering gallery\u201d microresonators can even detect and measure individual nanoparticles. This creates a more reliable and accurate detector for nanoparticles, and may help establish better safety standards for industrial manufacturing of products containing nanoparticles. Medical applications of whispering gallery microresonators include nanoparticle detection within the body, ensuring that nanoparticles are present at treatment or diagnostic sites and absent from areas where they could cause health complications.","Some prior art microresonators are fabricated using advanced clean room techniques and require a large number of fabrication steps including optical and electron beam lithography and several etching steps. Another prior art technique for fabricating microresonators from crystalline materials requires cumbersome manual polishing of the microresonator material, which can take several days. These techniques significantly increase the complexity of fabrication, end cost, and overall time required for fabrication of microresonators, creating obstacles to more wide-scale use.","Control and stabilization of optical frequency combs enables a range of scientific and technological applications, including frequency metrology at high precision, spectroscopy of quantum gases and of molecules from visible wavelengths to the far infrared, searches for exoplanets, and photonic waveform synthesis. Recently, a new class of frequency combs based on monolithic microresonators has emerged, which offer significantly reduced bulk, cost, and complexity beyond what is possible with conventional femtosecond-laser technology. Such factors stand in the way of next generation applications that will require high-performance optical clocks for experiments outside the lab.","In microcomb systems, the comb generation relies on parametric conversion provided by nonlinear optical effects and is enabled by high-quality factors (Q) and small mode volumes of microresonators. To date, microcombs have been explored with a number of microresonator technologies, including microtoroids, crystalline microresonators, microrings, fiber cavities, machined disks, and disk microresonators. Unique comb spectra have been demonstrated, featuring octave spans and a wide range of line spacings.","Microcombs present a challenge for frequency stabilization. Specifically, the center frequency of a microcomb spectrum is matched to a pump laser, and line spacing must be controlled by changing the microresonator's physical properties. Future metrology applications of microcombs will require stabilization of the line spacing with respect to fixed-optical and microwave frequency standards. Hence, the key factors for stabilization are line spacing in the measurable 10's of GHz range, low intrinsic fluctuations, and the capability for fast modulation. Additionally, a threshold power for comb generation in the milliwatt range and the potential for integration with chip-based photonic circuits would enable portable applications.","In prior art, only thermal control via the power of a pump laser has been used in microresonators. However, this technique is not applicable in microresonators with small thermal effect or slow thermal response time.","It is desirable to create optical microresonators quickly and with a minimal number of processing steps.","It is also desirable to stabilize microcomb frequencies in optical microresonators without resorting to thermal control.","The invention is a novel device and technique to fabricate optical microresonators. The microresonators are fabricated from a glass preform mounted on a motor spindle. A laser is set perpendicular to the preforms's axis and focused onto the preform. The laser's focus position is controlled by changing the positioning of a lens mounted on a translation stage. Piezoelectric control elements may be mounted to finished microresonators to control the optical path length of a whispering gallery mode in the microresonators.","For the purpose of promoting an understanding of the present invention, references are made in the text to exemplary embodiments of a system for fabricating an optical microresonator, only some of which are described herein. It should be understood that no limitations on the scope of the invention are intended by describing these exemplary embodiments. One of ordinary skill in the art will readily appreciate that alternate but functionally equivalent components and methods may be used. The inclusion of additional elements may be deemed readily apparent and obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art. Specific elements disclosed herein are not to be interpreted as limiting, but rather as a basis for the claims and as a representative basis for teaching one of ordinary skill in the art to employ the present invention.","It should be understood that the drawings are not necessarily to scale. Instead, emphasis has been placed upon illustrating the principles of the invention. Like reference numerals in the various drawings refer to identical or nearly identical structural elements.","Moreover, the terms \u201csubstantially\u201d or \u201capproximately\u201d as used herein may be applied to modify any quantitative representation that could permissibly vary without resulting in a change in the basic function to which it is related.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","10","15","20","30","35","40","45","50","60","65","70","80"]},"Preform  is a preform of glassy material, such as, but not limited to, fused silica, fused quartz, erbium doped silica, ZBLAN, chalcogenide glasses, germanium oxide, ZBLAN or other glasses with high nonlinear coefficients and glassy materials with sufficient absorption at the wavelength of the laser  and low absorption at a different wavelength that can be coupled into a whispering gallery mode. Materials may be application specific. In various embodiments, materials may be used which have properties which correspond to the visible, ultra-violet, infrared and telecommunications wavelength ranges. The embodiment in  contemplates that the materials used have a measurable optical absorption that may be correlated for a desired wavelength. In various embodiments optical information may be obtained using known material properties and correlating these properties to known wavelength ranges.","Preform  can be pre-heated in order to avoid re-deposition of material during the fabrication process. While in the exemplary embodiment the preform  is a solid cylinder, other contemplated embodiments may have a different shape or may be hollow and pressurized from the inside in order to induce a bulge when heated. Preform  may have an initial diameter within the range of about 0.5 mm to about 10 mm. An optimum diameter range for a preform  of fused quartz material is about 2 mm to about 8 mm.","Motorized spindle  controls rotational speed of the preform . Rotational speed may be anywhere from about 10 revolutions per minute to 2000 revolutions per minute, with an optimum speed of about 800 revolutions per minute. This speed can be adjusted by computer control or manually to control the evaporation and\/or melting of preform . Motorized spindle  must have a low runout, or a low change in outer radius of preform  from the axis of rotation as preform  is rotated. Runout should be below 20 microns to ensure accurate fabrication. In an exemplary embodiment, motorized spindle  is a ball-bearing spindle known in the art. Other exemplary spindles may include, but are not limited to an air bearing spindle.","Fabrication laser  is a COlaser or another type of laser that operates at a wavelength with sufficient glass preform optical absorption. Fabrication laser  can be run in pulsed and\/or continuous wave mode. Fabrication laser  produces a laser beam  has a first beam diameter D, a horizontal position Xand a vertical position Y. Beam diameter may range from about 30 microns to about 300 microns. Focus and\/or power of fabrication laser  can be changed to control the melting and\/or evaporation of the material of the preform . The power may range from about 3 W to about 30 W. Additionally, laser beam  can be spread out into a plane that is non-parallel to the rotational axis of preform  in order to achieve a more uniform melting and\/or evaporation.","Focusing lens  may be made of, but is not limited to, a zinc-selenide (ZnSe) material. In use, focusing lens  is movable from a first position Posalong at least one axis perpendicular to said fabrication laser  to a plurality of subsequent positions Pos. Due to this movement, D, Xand Yare altered proportionately to D, Xand Yfor each of said plurality of positions Pos. Changing the position of the laser beam  relative to the preform  can be controlled, for example by changing the position of focusing lens  via translation stage . Translation stage  may be, but is not limited to, a manually-adjusted stage or a computer-controlled motor translation stage. This translation stage  may move focusing lens  in a sweeping pattern along preform . Sweep speed may range from 2 mm\/s to 25 microns\/s.","Imaging system  may be, but is not limited to, a microscope coupled to a CCD camera. The microscope is configured to have a lens which is optimized for a large depth of focus. High image resolution to observe the surface roughness of the microresonators is an important aspect of the imaging system . In other embodiments, it may also be advantageous to use a thermal imaging camera, such as a microbolometer array.","Imaging system  may be operatively coupled to a computer processing component adapted to take measurements of a shape of said glass preform while said laser beam  partially or fully impinges on the glass preform . These measurements may be, but are not limited to, a radius of curvature, a thickness and a diameter of said glass preform. These measurements can be compared to measurements previously entered into the computer processing component through a user interface. The computer processing components may also be used to monitor D, Xand Yfor each of said plurality of positions Pos.","Once measurements have been made and compared, the computer processing component may perform one of two output steps. It may output the current measurements, measurement comparison, and\/or initial measurements to a user output to permit the user to manually adjust the fabrication process. The computer processing component may also perform an automated adjustment of laser beam  by positioning focusing lens  to produce an optical microresonator to correspond to the input values. Once the process is complete, it may then power down laser beam .","Alignment laser  is contemplated for the exemplary system , if fabrication laser beam  is not visible to the eye and\/or camera. Alignment laser beam  is combined with laser beam  to produce a visible guide to the laser machining. A beam combiner  is positioned to combine the two laser beams before they are transmitted by focusing lens . Beam combiner  may be, but is not limited to, a zinc-selenide (ZnSe) combiner.","Fabrication chamber  serves to contain all of the above components and shield them from damage or interference during the fabrication process. Fabrication chamber  also prevents ablated material from spreading to the surrounding area and causing a safety hazard. Fabrication chamber  also allows fabrication of microresonator  to be performed in a surrounding gas with low humidity. This avoids a reduction in optical quality factor of the whispering gallery mode due to OH\u2014 and water absorption bands. The surrounding gas could be, but is not limited to, nitrogen, clean noble gasses or other inert gasses. Additionally, fabrication of microresonator  can be performed in a surrounding gas that is embedded into the microresonator material in order to change the optical material properties. Furthermore, an additional gas blown against the rotating preform  can be used to avoid re-deposition of evaporated material onto the preform . Finally, preform  can be immersed in a liquid during laser-shaping in order to control the melting and\/or evaporation process.","During fabrication using the exemplary system  of , glass preform  is preselected from a material having optical properties which correspond to desired wavelength ranges. The preform  is then mounted on motorized spindle  within fabrication chamber . Coarse alignment of laser beam  is supported by alignment laser beam  that is superimposed with beam combiner . The laser beams  and  are focused onto preform  with focusing lens  that is mounted on a translation stage  with micrometer resolution. In order to monitor the fabrication process, imaging system  is mounted on top of the preform . Fabrication laser  is used to evaporate and\/or melt preform  to fabricate a protrusion that supports an optical whispering gallery mode. There is a contrast in the refractive index of the microresonator material and the surrounding area.","In addition to shaping a microresonator, the laser  can also be used to change the diameter of the preform , exemplary embodiments of which are shown in . This is done by turning the preform  at approximately 800 RPM and slowly approaching the focusing lens  from below while sweeping it back and forth along the preform  axis (sweep speed 0.3 mm\/s; laser power approximately 30 W). All of the resulting microresonators  in  have been treated with this method in order to evaporate the surface layer and create a symmetric microresonator with respect to the rotation axis of the motorized spindle . The first two microresonators  in  have been shrunk more significantly, starting from a 2-mm-diameter preform  down to 170 microns and 860 microns, respectively. The final diameter of the preform  can be controlled to a level of 10 microns, corresponding to an approximately 160 MHz control of the microresonator's free spectral range in a 2 mm diameter device.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":["FIGS. 3-3","FIG. 3"],"b":["15","15","10"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":["FIGS. 3-3","FIG. 3","FIGS. 3and 3"],"b":["15","15","10","15","10","10","30","15","10"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":["FIGS. 4-4","FIG. 4"],"b":["15","100","15","15"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":"FIGS. 4and 4","b":["15","10","15"],"sup":["8","9 ","10"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":"FIGS. 4and 4","b":["15","15"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":["FIGS. 5-5","FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["15","15"],"sup":"8"},"As shown in , one may observe several orders of Brillouin sidebands.

The pump laser, a tunable semiconductor laser operating near 1560 nm, is amplified in erbium fiber and then spectrally filtered to remove noise from amplified spontaneous emission; 280 mW of light is available at the input to the tapered fiber. The microresonator is thermally self-locked to the pump laser, allowing stabilization of the microcomb center to an auxiliary laser, which in turn is frequency doubled and referenced to a rubidium (Rb) D transition at 780 nm. The Rb atoms provide an absolute fractional stability of approximately 10at 1 second, but the 1-s residual noise of <10-17 between the microcomb pump and the auxiliary laser indicates that much more stable references can be employed in the future. The spectrum of the comb, which spans about 100 nm, also reaches the corresponding wavelength (1590 nm) of Rb D lines at 795 nm. Stabilization of the 32.6-GHz line spacing is measured by photodetection. After conversion to baseband (described below), the line-spacing signal is analyzed with respect to ultralow phase- and frequency-noise hydrogen-maser oscillators. Line spacing is optimized using microresonator mode, taper-resonator coupling, and pump detuning and polarization, such that its spectrum exhibits only a single clean peak. Under different conditions, particularly at high pump power, multiple peaks are visible in the line-spacing signal. These effects prevent users from using 33-GHz microresonator combs with more continuous and smoother intensity envelopes, and bandwidths up to approximately 150 nm.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":"FIG. 6","sup":["\u22128 ","\u22127"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["15","90","15","90"]},"In use, a mechanical force from piezoelectric element  is used to control the optical path length of a whispering gallery mode in microresonator .
