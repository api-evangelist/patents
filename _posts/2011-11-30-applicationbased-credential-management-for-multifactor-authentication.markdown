title: Application-based credential management for multifactor authentication
abstract: A device receives a request to authenticate an end user of a user device to use an application, based on an application identifier and a user identifier included the request, and determines whether the application is authenticated based on the application identifier. The device also determines whether the user device is authenticated based on the user identifier and utilizing a generic bootstrapping architecture (GBA) authentication procedure, and determines whether the end user is authenticated based on a personal identification number (PIN) associated with the end user. The device further provides, to an application server device hosting the application, results of the authentications of the application, the user device, and the end user.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["A service provider is an entity (e.g., a business or an organization) that sells bandwidth of or access to a network (e.g., the Internet, a data network, a telecommunication network, etc.) associated with the service provider. Service providers may include telecommunications companies, data carriers, wireless communications providers, Internet service providers, cable television operators offering high-speed Internet access, etc. Service provider networks enable third party application developers to create applications that use network resources, such as location systems that determine locations of mobile communication devices. These applications make requests to a network device, such as a gateway. The network device processes the requests and sends the requests to service provider systems that provide services, such as determining the locations of mobile communication devices, messaging, and\/or other services. Such service provider systems may be referred to as enablers.","The service provider network defines application programming interfaces (APIs) for third party application developers to access the capabilities of enablers in the service provider network. A third party application often needs to authenticate a person (i.e., an end user) using the third party application, and often provides some form of authentication of the end user. However, in many cases, it is preferable to have the service provider network perform this function on behalf of the third party application. For example, if a developer would like the service provider to bill for an end user's use of their application, the service provider network needs to authenticate the end user of the application. The third party application not only needs to identify the end user, but also needs to receive a level of assurance for that identification. The end user, the application, and the service provider network need to form trust relationships. However, the APIs provided for the third party applications often do not provide an identifier for end users using the third party applications, making authentication of such end users very difficult.","The following detailed description refers to the accompanying drawings. The same reference numbers in different drawings may identify the same or similar elements.","Systems and\/or methods described herein may provide application-initiated user authentication for applications provided by a cloud computing environment (e.g., by a service provider) and\/or by a device, such as a mobile computation and\/or communication device. The systems and\/or methods may provide applications with a resilient user authentication mechanism, such as a user personal identification number (PIN). In one example implementation, a name or an identity of an application providing an authentication request may be used to determine how to access credentials for an authentication method required by the request. A user PIN may permit the application, requesting authentication, to authenticate a user of the application with a specific authentication request.","The systems and\/or methods may provide a multifactor authentication process for a user utilizing a user device to access an application. For example, the systems and\/or methods may first authenticate the application to be accessed by the user device. The systems and\/or methods may then authenticate the user device using a particular authentication method, such as the GBA authentication method. The GBA authentication method may generate a shared key that may be used to protect user-provided data, such as a user PIN, a user name and\/or password, etc. Finally, the systems and\/or methods may authenticate the user with the user-provided data.","The systems and\/or methods may determine user credentials for user authentication based on a name or identity of an application (e.g., an application identifier) and an application service provider. Alternatively, or additionally, the user credentials may be retrieved from the application service provider and\/or an entity that manages user credentials. Alternatively, or additionally, the user credentials may be retrieved based on an authentication method specified in an authentication request. For example, the systems and\/or methods may retrieve a user name and\/or password for a password authentication request, may retrieve a PIN string for a PIN authentication request, etc.","The term \u201ccomponent,\u201d as used herein, is intended to be broadly construed to include hardware (e.g., a processor, a microprocessor, an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC), a field-programmable gate array (FPGA), a chip, a memory device (e.g., a read only memory (ROM), a random access memory (RAM), etc.), etc.) or a combination of hardware and software (e.g., a processor, microprocessor, ASIC, etc. executing software contained in a memory device).","As used herein, the terms \u201cuser\u201d and\/or \u201cend user\u201d may be used interchangeably. Also, the terms \u201cuser\u201d and\/or \u201cend user\u201d are intended to be broadly interpreted to include a user device or a user of a user device.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","100","110","120","130","140","150","160","170","100","110","120","130","140","150","160","170","110","120","130","140","150","160","170"]},"User device  may include any device that is capable of communicating with gateway , application server , authentication enabler , and\/or other devices\/networks  via network . For example, user device  may include a mobile computation and\/or communication device, such as a radiotelephone, a personal communications system (PCS) terminal (e.g., that may combine a cellular radiotelephone with data processing and data communications capabilities), a personal digital assistant (PDA) (e.g., that can include a radiotelephone, a pager, Internet\/intranet access, etc.), a wireless device, a smartphone, a laptop computer (e.g., with a wireless air card), a global positioning system (GPS) device, a content recording device (e.g., a camera, a video camera, etc.), a set-top box (STB), a voice over Internet protocol (VoIP) device, an analog terminal adaptor (ATA), etc. In another example, user device  may include a fixed (e.g., provided in a particular location, such as within a user's home) computation and\/or communication device, such as a laptop computer, a personal computer, a tablet computer, a STB, a television, a gaming system, etc.","In one example implementation, user device  may include an authentication client that interfaces with an end user of user device , and communicates with gateway  and\/or authentication enabler  to perform authentications of the end user. The authentication client may reside in a storage device provided in user device  or may reside in an external storage device, such as a Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) card, an external hard drive, a flash memory data storage device, etc. The authentication client, via user device , may enable the end user to access one or more third party applications provided in application server  and described below.","Gateway  may include one or more computation and\/or communication devices that gather, process, search, and\/or provide information in a manner described herein. For example, gateway  may include one or more server devices, network devices (e.g., routers, switches, firewalls, network interface cards (NICs), hubs, bridges, optical add-drop multiplexers (OADMs), etc.), etc. In an example implementation, gateway  may receive requests from third party applications provided by application server , and may perform policy actions on the requests. Gateway  may forward the requests for further processing (if necessary), and may route the requests to authentication enabler . The authentication enabler  may return responses (for the requests) to the gateway , and gateway  may provide the responses to the requesting third party applications. Gateway  may be a functional entity that may include one or more processing elements and may provide policy decisions and enforcement.","Policies, which may be invoked by gateway , may include authentication rules, business rules, authorization, etc. Authentication rules may include user names, passwords, personal identification numbers (PINs), etc. Business rules may include operations, definitions, and\/or constraints that apply to an organization, and may apply to people, processes, corporate behavior and computing systems in an organization.","Application server  may include one or more server devices, or other types of computation or communication devices, that gather, process, search, and\/or provide information in a manner described herein.

The third party applications may include applications that determine locations of mobile communication devices (e.g., user device ), applications that connect calls between user device  and other user devices , voicemail applications, etc. The third party applications, via application server , may provide services to end users associated with user device , may make authentication requests to authentication enabler , and may make requests for other services to other enablers associated with the service provider network. The third party applications, via application server , may receive responses to such requests from gateway . Alternatively, or additionally, one or more of the third party applications may be permanently stored on user device  or may be retrieved from application server  and temporarily stored on user device .","Authentication enabler  may include one or more server devices, or other types of computation or communication devices, that gather, process, search, and\/or provide information in a manner described herein. In an example implementation, authentication enabler  may receive a request for authenticating user device , an end user of user device , and\/or a third party application being utilized by user device , and may perform the authentication requested by the request. Authentication enabler  may store session information associated with the authentication, and may generate a response indicating whether the authentication is successful (e.g., which may include the security, authentication, etc.) or is unsuccessful. In one example, authentication enabler  may utilize other devices\/networks  for performing authentications, such as using an instant messaging system to authenticate the end user or using a voice communication system to authenticate a voice of the end user.","Identity management database  may include one or more storage devices that store information provided by and\/or retrieved by gateway  and\/or authentication enabler . In one example implementation, identity management database  may store identity management information, such as user identities, user credentials, tokens, user profiles, authentication policies, etc.","Other devices\/networks  may include one or more computation or communication devices, or networks, that gather, process, search, and\/or provide information in a manner described herein.

Authentication enabler  may also enable the third party applications to request a type of authentication of the end user, such as via a user name and password. The third party applications, the end user, and the service provider network may implement policies that govern the authentication process performed by authentication enabler . For example, a third party application may require a two-factor authentication of the end user (e.g., something a user has and something a user knows), and may not explicitly request authentication when requesting other enablers, such as an instant messaging system, provided by other devices\/networks . Such an authentication process may be referred to as a policy-based authentication and may involve gateway . Alternatively, or additionally, the authentication process may be a combination of requested behavior and policy evaluations.","The authentication client, associated with user device , may receive challenges and may process information, such as username and password, received from the end user, user device , gateway , application server , and\/or other devices\/networks .
