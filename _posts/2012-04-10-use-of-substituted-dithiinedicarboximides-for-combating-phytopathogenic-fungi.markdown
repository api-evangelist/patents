compounds I and the compositions according to the invention, respectively, are suitable as fungicides. They are distinguished by an outstanding effectiveness against a broad spectrum of phytopathogenic fungi, including soil-borne fungi, which derive especially from the classes of the Plasmodiophoromycetes, Peronosporomycetes (syn. Oomycetes), Chytridiomycetes, Zygomycetes, Ascomycetes, Basidiomycetes and Deuteromycetes (syn. Fungi imperfecti). Some are systemically effective and they can be used in crop protection as foliar fungicides, fungicides for seed dressing and soil fungicides. Moreover, they are suitable for controlling harmful fungi, which inter alia occur in wood or roots of plants.","The compounds I and the compositions according to the invention are particularly important in the control of a multitude of phytopathogenic fungi on various cultivated plants, such as cereals, e.g. wheat, rye, barley, triticale, oats or rice; beet, e.g. sugar beet or fodder beet; fruits, such as pomes, stone fruits or soft fruits, e.g. apples, pears, plums, peaches, almonds, cherries, strawberries, raspberries, blackberries or gooseberries; leguminous plants, such as lentils, peas, alfalfa or soybeans; oil plants, such as rape, mustard, olives, sunflowers, coconut, cocoa beans, castor oil plants, oil palms, ground nuts or soybeans; cucurbits, such as squashes, cucumber or melons; fiber plants, such as cotton, flax, hemp or jute; citrus fruit, such as oranges, lemons, grapefruits or mandarins; vegetables, such as spinach, lettuce, asparagus, cabbages, carrots, onions, tomatoes, potatoes, cucurbits or paprika; lauraceous plants, such as avocados, cinnamon or camphor; energy and raw material plants, such as corn, soybean, rape, sugar cane or oil palm; corn; tobacco; nuts; coffee; tea; bananas; vines (table grapes and grape juice grape vines); hop; turf; sweet leaf (also called Stevia); natural rubber plants or ornamental and forestry plants, such as flowers, shrubs, broad-leaved trees or evergreens, e.g. conifers; and on the plant propagation material, such as seeds, and the crop material of these plants.","Preferably, compounds I and compositions thereof, respectively are used for controlling a multitude of fungi on field crops, such as potatoes sugar beets, tobacco, wheat, rye, barley, oats, rice, corn, cotton, soybeans, rape, legumes, sunflowers, coffee or sugar cane; fruits; vines; ornamentals; or vegetables, such as cucumbers, tomatoes, beans or squashes.","The term \u201cplant propagation material\u201d is to be understood to denote all the generative parts of the plant such as seeds and vegetative plant material such as cuttings and tubers (e.g. potatoes), which can be used for the multiplication of the plant. This includes seeds, roots, fruits, tubers, bulbs, rhizomes, shoots, sprouts and other parts of plants, including seedlings and young plants, which are to be transplanted after germination or after emergence from soil. These young plants may also be protected before transplantation by a total or partial treatment by immersion or pouring.","Preferably, treatment of plant propagation materials with compounds I and compositions thereof, respectively, is used for controlling a multitude of fungi on cereals, such as wheat, rye, barley and oats; rice, corn, cotton and soybeans.","The term \u201ccultivated plants\u201d is to be understood as including plants which have been modified by breeding, mutagenesis or genetic engineering including but not limiting to agricultural biotech products on the market or in development (cf. http:\/\/ceragmc.org\/, see GM crop database therein). Genetically modified plants are plants, which genetic material has been so modified by the use of recombinant DNA techniques that under natural circumstances cannot readily be obtained by cross breeding, mutations or natural recombination. Typically, one or more genes have been integrated into the genetic material of a genetically modified plant in order to improve certain properties of the plant. Such genetic modifications also include but are not limited to targeted posttranslational modification of protein(s), oligo- or polypeptides e.g. by glycosylation or polymer additions such as prenylated, acetylated or farnesylated moieties or PEG moieties.","The compounds I and compositions thereof, respectively, are particularly suitable for controlling the following plant diseases:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0078","num":"0093"},"i":["Albugo ","A. candida","A. tragopogonis","Alternana ","Alternaria ","A. brassicola ","brassicae","A. tenuis","A. solani ","A. alternata","A. solani ","A. alternata","Aphanomyces ","Ascochyta ","A. tritici ","A. hordei ","Bipolaris ","Drechslera ","Cochliobolus ","D. maydis","B. zeicola","B. sorokiniana","B. oryzae ","Blumeria ","Erysiphe","graminis ","Botrytis cinerea ","Botryotinia fuckeliana","Bremia lactucae ","Ceratocystis ","Ophiostoma","C. ulmi ","Cercospora ","Cercospora ","C. zeae","maydis","C. beticola","C. soljina ","C. kikuchii","Cladosporium ","C. fulvum","C. herbarum ","Claviceps purpurea ","Cochliobolus ","Helminthosporium ","Bipolaris","C. carbonum","C. sativus","B. sorodniana","C. miyabeanus","H. oryzae","Colletotrichum ","Glomerella","C. gossypii","C. graminicola","C. coccodes","C. lindemuthianum","C. truncatum ","C. gloeosporiodes","Corticium ","C. sasakii ","Corynespora cassilcola ","Cycloconium ","C. oleaginum ","Cylindrocarpon ","Nectria ","Neonectria ","C. liriodendri","Neonectria lifiodendri","Dematophora ","Rosellinia","Diaporthe ","D. phaseolorum ","Drechslera ","Helminthosporium","Pyrenophora","D. teres","D. tritici","repentis","Formitiporia ","Phellinus","punctata, F. mediterranea, Phaeomoniella chlamydospora ","Phaeoacremonium chlamydosporum","Phaeoacremonium aleophllum ","Botryosphaeria obtusa; Elsinoe ","E. pyre","E. veneta","E. ampelina","Entyloma oryzae ","Epicoccum ","Erysiphe ","E. betae","E. pisi","E. cichoracearum","E. cruciferarum","Eutypa lata ","Eutypa ","Cytosporina lata","Libertella blepharis","Exserohlium ","Helminthosporium","E. turcicum","Fusarium ","berella","F. graminearum ","F. culmorum ","F. oxysporum ","F. solani ","F. verticilliodes ","Gaeumannomyces graminis ","Gibberella ","G. zeae","G. fujikuroi","Glomerella cingulata ","G. gossypii ","Guignardia bewellii ","Gymnosporangium ","G. sabinae ","Helminthosporium ","Drechslera","Cochliobolus","Hemileia ","H. vastatrix ","Isariopsis clavispora ","Cladosporium vitis","Macrophomina phaseolina ","phaseoli","Microdochium ","Fusarium","nivale ","Microsphaera diffusa ","Monilinia ","M. laxa, M. fructicola ","M. fructigena ","Mycosphaerella ","M. graminicola ","Septoria tritici, Septoria ","M. fijiensis ","Peronospora ","P. brassicae","P. parasitica","P. destructor","P. tabacina","P. manshurica","Phakopsora pachyrhizi ","P. meibomiae ","Phialophora ","P. tracheiphda ","P. tetraspora","P. gregata","Phoma lingam ","P. betae ","Phomopsis ","P. viticola","P. phaseoli","Diaporthe phaseolorum","Physoderma maydis ","Phytophthora ","P. capsici","P. megasperma","P. sojae","P. infestans","P. ramorum","Plasmodiophora brassicae ","Plasmopara ","P. viticola ","P. halstedii ","Podosphaera ","P. leucotricha ","Polymyxa ","P. graminis","P. betae","Pseudocercosporella herpotrichoides ","Tapesia yallundae","Pseudoperonospora ","P. cubensis ","P. humili ","Pseudopezicula tracheiphila ","Phialophora","Puccinia ","P. triticina ","P. striiformis ","P. hordei ","P. graminis ","P. recondita ","P. kuehnii ","P. asparagi ","Pyrenophora ","Drechslera","tritici","repentis ","P. teres ","Pyriculana ","P. oryzae","Magnaporthe grisea","P. grisea ","Pythium ","P. ultimum ","P. aphandermatum","Ramularia ","R. collo","cygni ","Ramularia ","R. beticola ","Rhizoctonia ","R. solani ","R. solani ","R. cerealis ","Rhizoctonia ","Rhizopus stolonifer ","Rhynchosporium secalis ","Sarocladium oryzae ","S. attenuatum ","Sclerotinia ","S. sclerotiorum","S. rolfsii ","S. sclerotiorum","Septoria ","S. glycines ","S. tritici","Septoria ","S","Stagonospora","nodorum ","Stagonospora ","Uncinula ","Erysiphe","necator","Odium tuckeri","Setospaena ","S. turcicum","Helminthosporium turcicum","Sphacelotheca ","S. reiliana","Sphaerotheca fuliginea ","Spongospora subterranea ","Stagonospora ","S. nodorum ","Stagonospora ","Leptosphaeria ","Phaeosphaeria] nodorum","Synchytrium endobioticum ","Taphrina ","T. deformans ","T. pruni ","Thielaviopsis ","T. basicola ","Chalara elegans","Tilletia ","T. tritici ","T. caries","T. controversa ","Typhula incarnata ","Urocystis ","U. occulta ","Uromyces ","U. appendiculatus","U. phaseoli","U. betae","Ustilago ","U. nulla ","U. avaenae","U. maydis","Ventura ","V. inaequalis","Verticillium ","V. dahliae "]},"The compounds I and compositions thereof, respectively, may be used for improving the health of a plant.
