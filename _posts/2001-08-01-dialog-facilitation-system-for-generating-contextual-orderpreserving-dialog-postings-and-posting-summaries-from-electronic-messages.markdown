title: Dialog facilitation system for generating contextual order-preserving dialog postings and posting summaries from electronic messages
abstract: A dialog facilitator for preserving the spatial and temporal context of a dialog composed of a plurality of postings. The postings are packaged into messages having extended header information which are sent and received using a conventional messaging system. The dialog facilitator retrieves messages from the conventional messaging system, and uses information contained in the messages to populate a posting and a posting summary. Each posting contains detail information and an identifier uniquely identifying the posting., and each posting summary contains the posting identifier, content description information, and referential information identifying a relationship between postings. The referential information identifies whether the posting is related to other postings in the dialog store. Related posting include a commonly assigned dialog identifier. A media coordinator is provided for graphically depicting the spatial and temporal context of a selected dialog posting in relation to other postings belonging to a given dialog.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["The present invention relates to a communications system with a framework that journals each contribution to a subject matter exchange conducted over a conventional messaging system. More particularly, the present invention provides a framework that processes the implicit user-specified mapping instructions of each contribution, journals the outcome to preserve the contextual order of each contribution, and delivers \u201cartifacts\u201d that enable a dynamic network of participants to contribute, monitor, trace, and markup an ongoing exchange carried over an electronic communications network.","Conventional electronic messaging systems such as email, newsgroups, bulletin boards and such are an integral part of the modern workplace. For a number of tasks these communication tools offer unmatched efficiency. Conventional messaging systems all ultimately employ one of two basic models of communication that pre-date any electronic form: the post office and bulletin board. For a wide range of \u201csubject matter-based\u201d occupations, these communication models are failing to fully enable users to efficiently and effectively conduct subject matter exchanges.","Two Basic Models of Communication: Post Office or Bulletin Board","By emulating the post office model of communication, email offers an unmatched level of efficiency for basic information sharing tasks (e.g. document distribution) as well as one-touch response tasks such as request for status, request for information, and request for confirmation. On the other hand, by bringing the bulletin board model of communication into an electronic context, newsgroups offers an unmatched level of efficiency for subject matter based information sharing tasks based on communal interest (i.e. a Java newsgroup). With extensions to email to incorporate mailing list distribution capabilities (i.e. a project distribution list), email can provide advantages on par with newsgroups for subject matter based information sharing albeit with the caveat that such an extension can lead to more email clutter.","Other tasks where messaging systems are heavily employed are subject matter exchanges\u2014an effort where two or more parties exchange subject matter expertise often for some mutual benefit. While nothing precludes these exchanges from taking place outside of messaging systems, messaging systems make it possible for the parties to be dispersed and to participate on their own time (time-shifting).","Thread functionality provides support for the \u201ccontinual conversation\u201d, and has been incorporated into both the post office and the bulletin board form of messaging systems. Thread functionality attempts to present to users a set of exchanged messages as a hierarchy of replies. Conventional thread mechanisms have proven so rudimentary that those who choose to engage in subject matter exchanges via conventional messaging systems soon find themselves burdened with an overwhelming number of clerical time-consuming message management tasks.","Electronic bulletin boards typically use threads for the explicit purpose of enabling subject matter exchanges among like-minded electronic communities. With the lack of direct addressing inherent to the bulletin board model of communication, subject matter exchanges often take on a laissez-faire quality that is less than optimal in most workplaces. That is to say that in the workplace, subject matter experts need to directly address who they want to get involved in goal-driven subject matter exchanges\u2014exchanges where two or more parties draw upon each other's subject matter expertise long enough to produce the know-how needed to accomplish a goal or an aspect of a goal.","Conventional electronic mail systems also incorporate thread functionality, and support direct addressing by default. However, to overcome content distribution and addressing challenges, workplace email users rely heavily on distribution lists. As a result, threading with email and extensions for mailing list distribution capabilities take away the direct addressing capability leading to the same laissez-faire qualities of the bulletin board model.","While the notion of threads as a means to preserve context appears to be fundamental to subject matter exchanges, the mechanisms used to realize threading fail to preserve the integrity of the structure of a subject matter exchange. Consequently, in the workplace as subject matter experts primarily rely on email to conduct subject matter exchanges they find themselves also frequently taking on clerical message management tasks: 1) sorting (clustering) messages according to the subject matter exchanges they belong to; and 2) attempting to put the message back into the conversational context (ordering) of the subject matter exchange.","Conventional thread mechanisms in messaging systems are too rudimentary for subject matter exchanges. Notably conventional thread mechanisms are implemented as merely an extension of the message construct. A survey of the prior art illustrates how even those that attempt to address the failings of threads fall into the same trap.","U.S. Pat. No. 5,905,863 (Knowles) teaches that the use of the In-Reply-To field of a conventional email message to construct a message thread is unreliable. Further still, Knowles teaches away from reliance on user inserted structural information to construct threads. Instead, Knowles teaches re-constructing a message thread (automatically) using textual context and characteristics of messages.","In an article entitled \u201cUsing Collaborative Filtering To Weave An Information Tapestry\u201d, Communications of the ACM, December 1992, Vol. 35, No. 12, p 61\u201370, David Goldberg discloses an email system which filters (scans) email messages, selects interesting messages and places them in a user's inbox. The email system uses both content based filtering and collaborative filtering. Notably, the system provides the ability to annotate documents in support of moderated newsgroups, and select documents replied to by a given user. The system includes an indexer which reads documents, a document store, an annotation store, a filterer, a document queue (one for each user), and a remailer for periodically forwarding the contents of the document queue to the user via email. The system does not thread documents, but rather provides a framework for storing documents and a query language for interrogating the stored documents to retrieve documents containing desired keywords.","U.S. Pat. No. 6,073,165 (Narasimhan) shows a system for filtering email messages based on user defined filters which forwards select messages to a user's receiver. The system scans email messages to create filtered messages which are forwarded to a device such as a pager used to page a user when a selected email message (determined by filter) arrives.","As evident from the above-listed prior art survey, conventional messaging systems treat threads as a post-processing task from a list of currently available messages. The quality of the produced view relies on the completeness of the available content, i.e. whether the messaging client has access to all the messages, and on the correctness of the available message headers. Hence, the ability of a user to leverage the thread as a means to contribute to the exchange is dramatically impacted by an overburdening process of ensuring access to an accurate and up-to-date view of the exchange.","To overcome such deficiencies, a distinct facility responsible for the thread mechanism is needed to ensure that the structure is accurately maintained as the exchange carries on contribution by contribution.","Furthermore, it is important to observe that the referential information available in conventional message headers only provides relationship information on how a message is a reply to another message and possibly how a message references other messages. This referential information does not suffice in exactly describing the spatial and temporal relationships required to preserve the structural integrity of a subject-matter exchange as well as other relationships representative of user intents while contributing or participating to an exchange. Such complex set of relationships can only be achieved via a coordinate system that preserves the temporal and spatial order of contributions and represents the structure of a subject-matter exchange as a unique construct independent of the content.","Conventional communications systems have fundamentally overlooked the notion that the subject matter exchange and the thread are synonymous and inextricably bound and yet separate and distinct from the subject matter contributed. The inventors of the present invention have learned that preserving the integrity of a subject matter exchange by way of a thread structure requires promoting the thread to an entity in its own right with its own unique identifier. Specifically, in this advanced form the \u201cthreading entity\u201d assigns each message its own universal resource identifier (URI). The threading entity ensures that each contribution maintains not just its own identifier but also maintains a reference to the threading entity by recording the entity unique resource identifier so to provide a means to access the structural information in complete detail.","The approach disclosed and claimed herein enables users to trace the flow of an entire subject matter exchange from any point to any point. As used throughout the specification, the advanced notion of a thread is referred to as a dialog. A dialog is synonymous for a subject matter exchange. Each dialog is provided with a universal resource identifier (URI) which may be used to archive, retrieve, and categorize entire subject matter exchanges. The dialog concept and the use of a URI enables the active capture of subject matter exchanges as they occur.","The approach disclosed herein incorporates direct addressing to support goal-driven subject matter exchanges. Notably, the approach blends aspects of the post office model of communication with aspects of the bulletin board model of communication to create an automatic and implicit access control where any party directly addressed during any point of a subject matter exchange gains full access to the entire exchange. Finally, the dialog structuring mechanism captures structural information of the subject matter exchange in detail. As a result, terminal and branch points of the subject matter exchange can be quickly identified providing users with the ability to selectively monitor a more narrow portion of any particular subject matter exchange.","Accordingly, a first object of the present invention is to provide an improved communication system which is fully compatible with conventional messaging systems, and which enables users to conduct subject matter exchanges without manually clustering and ordering each contribution to the exchange.","More particularly, an object of the present invention is to provide a dialog facilitation system that represents and preserves the structural integrity of each subject matter exchange.","Another object of the present invention is to provide a dialog facilitation system which enables users to simultaneously monitor multiple subject matter exchanges.","Another object of the present invention is to provide a dialog facilitation system, which enables users to select the subject matter exchanges and the aspects of subject matter exchanges that they would like to monitor.","Another object of the present invention is to provide a dialog facilitation system, which enables users to search and retrieve an entire subject matter exchange and fully trace the exchange contribution-by-contribution.","Another object of the present invention is to provide a dialog facilitation system, which enables users to apply tags, either at the level ranging from the subject matter exchange itself or at the level of a contribution to the exchange, for the purpose of categorizing and archiving.","Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a dialog facilitation system, which enables users to share a subject matter exchange, or parts thereof, with others who were not participants to the exchange.","A dialog facilitator is provided which preserves the spatial and temporal context of postings within a given dialog. The postings are packaged into electronic messages having extended header information, and are sent and received using a conventional internet messaging protocols and systems.","The dialog facilitator includes a services gateway for retrieving messages from the conventional messaging system, and uses information contained in the message to populate a dialog posting. The services gateway uses information contained in the dialog posting to generate, for each dialog posting, a posting summary containing a posting identifier, content description information, and referential information identifying relationships to other postings.","A journal keeper receives the posting summary from the services gateway, maps it to the appropriate dialog and stores the summary in the dialog store. The journal keeper examines the referential information to determine whether the posting summary is related to other posting summaries in the dialog store. It assigns a unique dialog identifier to the posting summary if the posting summary is not related to another posting summary, and assigns the dialog identifier of the related posting summary if it is related to another posting summary. The journal keeper updates the referential information of the related posting summaries to reference the newly posted posting summary, and stores the updated referential information in the dialog store.","A media coordinator is provided for graphically depicting the spatial and temporal context of a selected dialog posting in relation to other postings belonging to a given dialog.","According to one embodiment, the dialog facilitator is provided on a server communicating with plural client computers, with the posting summary information being stored on the server, and the dialog postings being stored on the client computers.","According to one aspect of the invention, the journal keeper updates the referential information of the related posting summaries to reference the new posting summary so that the parent posting points to each of the child postings and each child posting points to at least one parent posting, and stores the updated referential information in the dialog store. Moreover, the journal keeper updates the referential information so that siblings point to one another.","According to another aspect of the invention, the media coordinator enables users to navigate between postings belonging to a given dialog, displays the content description information of selected posting summaries, selectively retrieves a chosen dialog posting and displays the posting detail information of the retrieved posting.","According to another aspect of the invention, the media coordinator graphically depicts the spatial and temporal context of a selected dialog posting using a branch (path) structure illustrating how all postings in a given dialog are related to the initial posting either directly or through another posting.","According to yet another aspect of the invention, the media coordinator includes an interface for composing a dialog posting. The interface enables the user to specify whether a posting is a contribution to an existing dialog or is intended to initiate a new dialog. If the posting is a contribution to an existing dialog, the interface enables the user to specify the posting(s) to which the new posting is a response.","The following terms and definitions are used throughout this specification:","DIALOG refers to a construct that describes the structure of a subject-matter exchange conducted over conventional messaging systems.","DIALOG FACILITATION SYSTEM refers to the system implementing the proposed objects and methods of the disclosed invention.","DIALOG POSTING refers to the contribution made by a user to an existing or a newly initiated dialog.

The received (email) messages are processed into postings which are either added to an existing dialog or inserted into a new dialog.","The dialog construct preserves the spatial and temporal order of individual posting(s) by assigning a unique posting coordinate to each posting and storing referential information linking each posting coordinate with related posting coordinates. The relationship between postings may be established as a result of time ordering (e.g. posting E was contributed before posting F but after posting D), posting position (e.g. postings B and C were contributed in response to posting A), or as a result of user-to-system interactions. See . For example, a user may annotate a posting with a particular tag to reflect a state read\/unread\/reacted.","To support tracing and monitoring of a dialog, the dialog facilitation system  uses the structural information maintained by each posting summary to create a path (i.e. A->D->E->F) so to convey structural and temporal information and support the re-contextualization of a portion of an exchange. See . The path connects two or more posting summaries, and is characterized by a Path Ad-Hoc Interest Group that identifies the set of contributors and participants that have engaged in a specific portion of the exchange. The addressing information contained in each posting summary provides a record of the intended direct (to) and indirect (cc) posting audience. The set of users extracted from each addressing information section of each posting summary contained in a path makes up what is referred to as a Path Ad-Hoc Interest Group and is used by the dialog facilitation system to control access and sharing requests.","Distributed Storage Model","According to the presently preferred embodiment, the dialog facilitation system  uses a distributed storage model in which the dialog construct, which preserves the temporal and contextual characteristics of the postings, is stored by the dialog facilitation system  in the dialog store (storage area) -, and the posting content is stored by the conventional messaging system  in a mail folder - within the content store -.

For example, the service profile may contain information on the SMTP service used to distribute posting via the conventional messaging system . Such information includes the service address, the service access control information like user name and password, and service specific properties like support for security.","The service type information enables the services gateway  to determine which user-addressing model will be used. For example, an SMTP service will require the use of email like addresses (e.g., username@corp.com) to properly deliver the dialog posting to each participant. However, a different service provider, like FTP, may require the computer Internet address (hostname or IP address) to which deliver the dialog posting.","Establishing a Distribution Service Provider Session","Before distributing the dialog posting, the services gateway  verifies whether the addressing information has been provided. Moreover, the services gateway  accesses the contributor's user profile and retrieves service profile information such as the address of the SMTP service provider. Using the SMTP service provider address, the services gateway  establishes a session with the service provider - indicated as a conventional messaging system using well-known protocols, such as the RFC822 protocol.","After the session is established with the service provider -, the services gateway  exports the dialog posting in the native format of the distribution service provider. According to the presently preferred embodiment, dialog postings are packaged into conventional email messages complying with the requisite protocols such as the RFC822 and RFC2045\u20132049 standards. The addressing information of the dialog posting is used to populate the addressing sections of the email message header.","The content description field of the dialog posting is exported to the message subject header field. The dialog posting content (including attachments) is exported to the email message body using a MIME multi-part format such as is well known in the art.","To ensure proper handling of the dialog posting, it is necessary to ensure that the referential information contained in the dialog posting is properly exported to the email message. The dialog posting identifiers listed in the \u201cparents\u201d section of the dialog posting referential information are copied to a standard message header extension \u201cX-Parent-Id\u201d () created to support distribution of dialog facilitation system information.","If the dialog posting specifies content-level references to other postings, the references are copied to a message header \u201cX-Section-Id\u201d created to support distribution of dialog facilitation system information. The content-level references specify the posting identifier as well as the begin-mark and end-mark of the referenced posting content section.","Any user-specified intent for the submitted posting is copied to a message header \u201cX-Intent-Id\u201d created to support distribution of dialog facilitation system information.

The process completes with the acknowledgement of the MTA for the received request.","The media coordinator  enables user-specified and automatic (implicit) markup actions to apply to a dialog, a path, or a posting. Automatic markup actions include actions such as automatically marking a dialog posting item as \u201cread\u201d once the user views the content detail. A user-specified mark up may include tagging a selected posting, path, or dialog for the purpose of categorization.
