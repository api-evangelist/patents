title: Data-based signal definition for frequency domain adaptive beamforming algorithms
abstract: A data-based technique is disclosed that defines the amplitude and phase of acoustic signals for detection as they propagate across an array of sensor elements for each array incident angle of interest. The definitions of the acoustic signals are then used to constrain adaptive noise suppression operating routines from canceling desired acoustic representative of desired incident direction detector. The data-based technique of defining acoustic signals also leads to a greater reduction of noise in directions where signal is not present. The use of this technique within an adaptive-array-beamforming-processor, and more particularly in connection with the provision of data-based steering vectors therefor, results in an improvement in the ability to detect acoustic signals imbedded in noise.

No. 09\/922,308 filed Aug. 3, 2001, now abandoned, entitled \u201cCALIBRATION BASED SIGNAL DEFINITION FOR FREQUENCY DOMAIN ADAPTIVE BEAMFORMING SYSTEMS\u201d.","The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.","(1) Field of the Invention","The present invention relates generally to adaptive-array-beamforming processors and, more specifically, to adaptive-array-beamforming processors having a data-based technique that, relative to prior art, improves the description of the amplitude and phase of acoustic signals, as they propagate across an array of sensor elements, for each array incident angle of interest. The appropriate data-based determination of the acoustic signal is then used to constrain adaptive noise suppression algorithms, such that acoustic signals in the desired incident (or steering) directions are canceled less than that of prior art. In direction where there are no acoustic signals and the noise is largely uncorrelated, the use of data-based signal definitions also reduces noise more than that of prior art. The use of the data-based technique, within an adaptive-array-beamforming processor, results in an improvement in the ability to detect acoustic signals imbedded in noise.","(2) Description of the Prior Art","An adaptive-array-beamforming prior art processor  is used to detect acoustic signals imbedded in noise and is generally illustrated in FIG. . An array  used with the processor  consists of several sensor elements that convert acoustic signal pressure waves to voltages and are represented as time series and, more particularly, as time series voltages. For frequency domain algorithms, commonly used in a processor , sensor element time series voltages are transformed to frequency bin voltages via well-known analyses, such as Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) analysis.","The adaptive beamforming, that is, the processor's  response, which adapts itself to cancel noise for the particular acoustic signals being received, is then implemented on each frequency bin processed. In operation, the array  is steered; that is, the array  is constrained by the adaptive-array-beamforming processor from canceling acoustic signals in a steered or desired incident direction. The terms \u201csteered direction\u201d and \u201cdesired incident direction\u201d are used herein in an interchangeable manner. The steered direction is defined by a vector of complex numbers, one complex number for each sensor element. For the frequency domain algorithm, a steering vector is required for each frequency bin processed. The constraint for steering the array requires that the sum of the product of the steering vectors and the computed adaptive weights for each sensor element be unity for each frequency bin. The adaptive weight computation, which gives less or near zero significance to all directions other than the steering direction, is well known in the art. The term \u201cactual signal for detection\u201d means a real-world signal encountered by a signal system for the detection thereof. The adaptive-array-beamforming-processor to which the present invention relates is a stage in the signal system prior to the apparatus performing the detection. An example of an \u201cactual signal for detection\u201d in the signal system context of a sonar system used on a naval submarine would be the acoustic signal generated by a torpedo in the course of the torpedo attacking the submarine. The acoustic signal of the torpedo may be imbedded in noise caused by the underwater environment and\/or other causes. Such an \u201cactual signal for detection\u201d stands in contradistinction to the artificially generated signals projected toward the array for calibration purposes in the disclosed embodiment of the earlier cited related patent application Ser. No. 09\/922,308, wherein the artifical signals are produced by a signal generator (,  therein) in response to a signal projector controller (, , therein).","The prior art suffers drawbacks in developing constraints for adaptive-array-beamforming-processors because the prior art assumes free-field propagation of acoustic signals to each sensor element within the array . The result is a free-field based steering vector arrangement  that is used to disadvantageously constrain the adaptive-array-beamforming-processor by canceling acoustic signals representative of a desired incident direction. For example, with nearby array mounting structure scattering acoustic signals (as well as amplitude and phase variations inherent in sensor element manufacture), the signal amplitude and phase at each sensor element can deviate from free field propagation. This deviation makes the uses of the signal amplitude and phase of each sensor as an error contribution in constraining the adaptive-array-beamforming-processor causing the cancellation of desired acoustic signals. It is desired that means be provided for developing constraints for adaptive-array-beamforming processors that do not cancel the handling of desired acoustic signals as much as that of prior art so that increased signal-to-noise at the output of the beamforming processors results.","Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to provide means for developing constraints for adaptive-array-beamforming-processors that, relative to prior art, provide more accurate signal definitions to the array so that desired information contained in desired acoustic signals will be better preserved.","It is another object of the present invention to provide means for preventing undesirable canceling of desired signals when performing adaptive noise suppression techniques.","It is still another object of the present invention to provide an adaptive array beamforming processor that preserves desired acoustic signals, while increasing noise suppression in non-signal directions.","Further, it is an object of the present invention to provide a data-based technique that enables a better definition of acoustic signal propagation to each array sensor element under operating conditions.","Accordingly, the current invention provides a method for defining amplitude and phase parameters of acoustic signals that propagate across sensor elements of an array of an adaptive beamforming processor for each array incident angle of interest. The method employs a steering and summing circuit of the conventional beamforming-processor and involves as the input the actual signal for detection, when present, combined with noise. The method further comprises routing the output of each sensor element as a first input to an adaptive filter having a second input and having a representative output, and to the steering and summing circuit of the conventional beamforming-processor having a representative output interrelated to the representative output of each adaptive filter. The method continues by subtracting the representative output of each adaptive filter from the interrelated and representative output of the steering and summing circuit, so as to produce a representative error signal that is respectively routed to the second input of the adaptive filter. Again, the method continues until each error signal is substantially zero, which yields a converged and respective filter quantity ffor each sensor element. The method further continues by inverting each fquantity so as to provide representative data-based steering vectors for the beamforming-processors.","As discussed in the \u201cBackground\u201d section, for an adaptive-array-beamforming processor to function optimally, the in-situ acoustic signal vector, associated with the circuitry for steering the related array, for any given incident angle and frequency bin must be known well in order to obtain accurate results. The in-situ acoustic signal vector needs to be defined by quantities that are largely free of error, otherwise inaccurate control of the array of the adaptive beamforming processor will result. More particularly, if the quantities are not known accurately, the constraining algorithm used to control the steering circuit of the adaptive-beamforming-processor, will possibly cancel desired acoustic signals, or equivalently treat desired signals as noise. The present invention provides for a solution for this problem.","The present invention provides a method for the adaptive beamforming processor by defining the amplitude and phase of acoustic signals as they propagate across the sensor elements of the array of the beamforming processor for each array's incident angle of interest. The invention provides a data-based technique that improves the definition of the amplitude and phase parameters of acoustic signals, as they propagate across an array of sensor elements, for each array incident angle of interest. The appropriate data-based definition of the acoustic signal is then used to constrain adaptive noise suppression algorithms from canceling acoustic signals in the desired incident (or steering) direction. The use of this technique, within an adaptive-array-beamforming-processor, results in an improvement in the ability to detect acoustic signals imbedded in noise. The method of the present invention may be further described with reference to FIG. .",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00021","num":"00021"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["18","20","20","26","26","26"],"sub":["n ","n","1","2","n"],"br":[{},{}],"in-line-formulae":[{},{}],"i":["X","t,q","t,q","xN","t,q"]},"The output voltages of expression (1) are converted to frequency bins, in a manner known in the art, preferably by conventional Fast Fourier Transformations (FFTs) .

Goodlin, entitled -Proceedings of the IEEE, vol. 63, pp. 1692-1716, December 1975, and herein incorporated by reference.","Each adaptive filter  has a second input  and provides an output  carrying a filtered voltage to the subtractor  of each respective sensor element of the array sensor elements .","The array sensor elements frequency bin output voltages  are also routed to the input of steering circuit  which is a conventional beamforming processor and is known in the art. The steering circuit  provides a single output  which is interrelated to a respective output of the adaptive filter  and which is the quantity represented by expression (4), and which is given by: \n\n\nwhere the quantity x(k,q) is defined in expression (2), and \u03c6(k,q) are the phase delays that steer the conventional beam.\n","The single output  of a steering circuit , as well as single output  of each adaptive filter , are routed to a subtractor .","The subtractor  subtracts the representative output  of the adaptive filter  from the interrelated and representative output  of the steering and summing circuit  so as to produce error outputs . The error outputs of the subtractor  (also corresponding to the output of box ) is routed, via signal path , to the second input  of the adaptive filter . The error feedback circuit  serves to update the adaptive filter for each subsequent time average to produce the result of equation (3). The adaptation continues until the subtraction produces error outputs (one related to each sensor element of the array sensor elements ) that approach that of near zero as identified by box .","The adaptive filter  operates in accordance with its response given in expression (3) so as to produce quantities fthat are routed on signal path  to an invert filter , which provides an inverse characteristic of its inputted quantity f. The inverse of the response quantities fof each adaptive filter provided by each invert filter  serves as data-based steering vectors . Relative to prior art, each of the data-based steering vectors  better represents the in situ amplitude and phase of the acoustic signals of the array provided by the adaptive filter  used to accomplish the method of the present invention.","The system and method of the present invention uses the actual signal for detection that is directed onto all sensor elements that are inputs of the conventional beamformer  and which are applied to N adaptive filters . The filtered sensor element, that is, output of adaptive filter  for the associated sensor element of the array sensor elements , is placed at output  of the adapter filter  and the output  of the steering circuit  representative of that of a conventional beam without the benefits of the present invention are subtracted from each other by subtractor  so as to provide a feedback signal on signal  that is routed to the second input of the adaptive filter . The adaptive filter  is updated based upon the feedback signal and this process is continued until an output of subtractor  approaching near zero is provided that is applied on signal path .","For each frequency bin of the array sensor elements frequency bin voltage outputs , the response quantity fof each adaptive filter  is the time average of the product of the conjugate of the sensor element for each of array sensor elements with the conventional beam divided by the time average of the product of the sensor element with its conjugate, as shown in expression (3). When the adapter filter  has converged with time, the error output of the subtractor  should be nearly zero and the filtered sensor element represented by the output of the adaptive filter  is nearly identical to the output of the conventional beam .","The generator filter arrangement  of  handles each sensor element of the array sensor elements used in the adaptive array beamforming processor of the present invention. The converged states of adaptive filter  provide the desired response quantity ffor each sensor element of the array sensor element at each incident angle and at each frequency bin. Relative to prior art, the inverse of these converged states, resulting from the operation of invert filter , more accurately define the acoustic amplitude and phase of the acoustic signals appearing across the array.","In the practice of the present invention, and as seen with reference to , the output of each invert filter , that is, the inverse of each converged adaptive filter  output, that is, ffor each array sensor element at each incident angle and each frequency bin is then used to define the data-based steering vectors . During the process of detecting acoustic signals, the computed data-based steering vectors , in conjunction with outputs directly from the array sensor elements FFT , are applied to an adaptive-array-beamforming-processor  for all frequency bins in the desired incident direction. That is to say, data-based steering vectors  are used within beamforming processor  in place of the prior art free-field based steering vector arrangement , , and the frequency bin voltages from FFT  are applied as a separate input to beamforming processor , via a direct path . When the acoustic signal arrives in the steered beam direction with a high signal to background noise ratio (SNR) the signal definition is exact.","At lower SNRs, the signal will be only partially maintained because of the influence of noise. However, in steering directions with no signal and given a largely uncorrelated noise field, noise will be reduced (relative to that of a free-field-based signal definition described with reference to ) in proportion to the number of constituent sensor elements in a beam. The benefit of the data-based constraint provided by the data-based steering vectors  of the present invention is that in directions where there is signal, the signal is partially preserved and in adjacent directions with noise only, noise is greatly reduced. The additional fidelity provided by the data-based signal definition technique of the present invention using the data-based vectors , enables improved detection of signals imbedded in noise.","It should now be appreciated that the practice of the present invention provides for a method that defines amplitude and phase parameters of the acoustic signals that propagate across the sensor elements of an array of an adaptive beamforming processor for each sensor element and for each incident angle of interest. These inverted filter quantities, relative to prior art, better represent the amplitude and phase of the actual acoustic signals for detection.","More particularly, in that the acoustic signal definition is based on inverted filter quantities  that better correct for phase and amplitude deviations inherent in an actual array system, the result is increased signal gain at the output of the adaptive beamforming processor  during operations. In accordance with the methods and the operating routines of the present invention, the unwanted acoustic signal cancellation is reduced and the noise attenuation from noise-only directions increased. In turn, the ability to extract acoustic signals from noise is greatly enhanced. Thus, the performance of beamforming-processors are correspondingly improved.","It should now be appreciated that the practice of the present invention provides for a beamforming-processor that uses the output voltages of sensor elements to define filters that, when inverted, yield appropriate signal definitions that improve the accuracy of the adaptive-beamforming-processor.","It will be understood that various changes and details, steps and arrangement of parts and method steps, which have been described and illustrated in order to explain the nature of the invention, may be made by those skilled in the art within the principle and scope of the invention as expressed in the appending claims."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The appended claims particularly point out and distinctly claim the subject matter of this invention.
