title: Click stream analysis
abstract: A path calculation report is derived from a Web log having therein a plurality of Universal Resource Identifiers (URI) each corresponding to a request made by a user to a server of a Web site containing one or more web pages. The report displays, in sequential order, all of the URI that correspond to each click path through the Web Site by one or more users during one or more visits to the Web site. Each URI corresponding to each click path is derived by decompressing a fixed length number representing a compressed URI that corresponds to each request of the corresponding click path through the Web Site.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This invention relates to Web servers, and more particularly, to click stream analysis of client interactions with Web servers.","The increasing diversity of click stream analysis involves the analysis of user requests when visiting a Web site. Each request by a user represents a request to a server of the Web site that was made by the user \u2018clicking\u2019 on a visual object on a Web page on the Web site with a mouse or other input device. The visual object can be an icon, a hyperlink, or another logical representation of the request. These requests are stored in a Web server log for the Web site, where each log record typically corresponds to a single request for a single event. Click stream analysis is intended to aid Web site owners in understanding how visitors are using their Web site.","Current click stream analysis products typically provide aggregate path analysis reports, which show general trends of how users are using particular Web sites. The size of data that is accumulated for at a particular Web site can be enormous because the accumulated data includes each request by each user during each visit. If the Web site is actively used by the public, and multiple servers are used to provide web services to the Web site, the accumulated data can exceed one (1) terabyte in a period of 24 hours. For this reason, current click stream analysis products typically provide aggregate path analysis reports (e.g. path calculation reports) that are limited to a depth of six (6) user clicks or less from where a user enters the Web site. This limitation on click depth in aggregate path analysis reports has an inherent lack in granularity. In many instances, this lack in granularity for high user volume Web site causes a failure of the aggregate path analysis reports to adequately assist the Web site owner or analyst in reconstructing precisely what behavior (e.g. all of the series of \u2018clicks\u2019 or server-requests) led users to particular requests (e.g. purchasing an item) when visiting the Web site. For instance, the owner of a high user volume Web site, or an analyst thereof, desires to reconstruct each user request and represent the same in a path calculation report. To do so, the path calculation report will have to show more than six sequential clicks by the users. For this kind of exhaustive click stream analysis, the entire Web server log needs to be scanned, collated and queried, which requires excessive accumulation of data in an inefficient and time consuming process that is rarely justified by its expense.","A path calculation report is produced from data in a data structure that is derived from a Web log. The Web log contains each request, represented as a Universal Resource Identifier (URI), by each user of a Web site. The path calculation report can include a count of the users having the same click path through the Web site as well as the sequential order all of the URIs for each user request for each click path. Each URI for the path calculation report are derived from a decompression of a compressed fixed length number that represents the URI and that is stored in the data structure. The data structure also includes request entries in a request table representing each request by a user, visit entries in a visit table representing each visit by each user to the Web site, and summary entries in a summary table representing each unique click path followed by a user through the Web site.","Overview","To overcome problems including those described in the Background section, the following description introduces the broad concept of using a Web log to reconstruct each request made by a user to a server for a Web site during the user's visit to the Web site. The request is represented by a Universal Resource Identifier (URI). A visit is determined for a collection of requests made by the same user. The reconstruction logically represents all of the requests made by one user in one visit by compressing the corresponding one or more URI thereof to produce a fixed length number. The fixed length number is substantially unique for the sequence of clicks made by the user during the visit. This compression to a substantially unique fixed length number advantageously reduces data storage requirements. Due to the low data storage requirements made possible by compression techniques, the reconstruction scales to high user volume web sites. This reconstruction can then be used to prepare a path calculation report to show a relatively large number of clicks by each user, in the respective sequential order thereof, during a visit to a web site. The reconstruction, and\/or the path calculation report, can be used to perform extensive behavior analysis across the click activities of many users in an aggregate form during their respective visits to the Web site.","An analyst may wish to examine the behavior of certain users that requested a \u201ccommerce event\u201d. In particular, the analyst can use the reconstruction, and\/or the path calculation report, to examine the sequence of all user clicks, across all users, that occurred prior to and\/or subsequent to the commerce event. By way of example, and not by way of limitation, a commerce event can be any request made by a user at a Web site that is deemed a point of great interest, because the event typically represents a culmination of a user's navigational journey(s) through the Web site or the event results in some type of request that determines the outcome of the navigation. For instance, while visiting a Web site a user may purchase a product, click on an advertisement, add an item to a virtual shopping basket: all of which are the type of requests that might warrant a logging of a commerce event, because they represent special or the more interesting requests of a user's click activity.","Personnel managing the Web site can use the reconstruction, and\/or the path calculation report, in a variety of ways, such as where additional or alternative requests can be considered to be a commerce event on their respective Web site. Thus, a commerce event may also be a designated event (i.e., a request) that marks a point in a user's click activity in which there is a desire to track and determine what the user's click activity was prior to and subsequent to such a designated request. By way of example, a software provider may want to designate a request to download free software as such a point, and then perform a click stream analysis with respect to an unlimited number of clicks prior to or after that point. To do so, one or more techniques including a hashing algorithm as described herein can be used to prepare an exhaustive path calculation report. This path calculation report is then used to perform a click stream analysis. Once the click stream analysis has been performed upon the exhaustive path calculation report with respect to the point of particular interest, the analyst may then have gained the best practical understanding of user behavior at the various Web pages of the Web site. Once such understanding might be with respect to a particular advertisement that had been shown to Web site users in a daughter window or in a banner. The click stream analysis can provide an understanding of the \u2018reach and frequency\u2019 of user exposure to the advertisement. The analyst can then use this understanding to suggest additions, deletions, and\/or modifications to the Web pages of the Web site and thereby influence future behavior of prospective Web site users.","Exemplary Network Environment",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","130","100","102","1","102","104","102","104"]},"Web services  are accessible directly by other services (represented by communication link ) or a software application, such as Web service application  (as represented by communication links  and ). Each Web service  is illustrated as including one or more servers that execute software to handle requests for particular services. Such services often maintain databases  that store information to be served back to requesters. Web services may be configured to perform any one of a variety of different services. Examples of Web services include login verification, notification, database storage, stock quoting, location directories, mapping, entertainment, shopping, calendars, news, games, ticketing, and so on. The Web services can be combined with each other and with other applications to build intelligent interactive experiences.","The network environment  also includes representative client devices (), (), (), (), . . . , (M) that utilize the Web services  (as represented by communication link ) and\/or the Web application  (as represented by communication links , , and ). The client devices represented generally as number  may communicate with one another using standard protocols as well, as represented by an exemplary XML link  between clients () and ().","The client devices  can be implemented many different ways. Examples of possible implementations include, without limitation, portable computers, stationary computers, tablet PCs, televisions\/set-top boxes, wireless communication devices, personal digital assistants, gaming consoles, printers, photocopiers, and other smart devices.","The Web application  is an application designed to run on some type of network platform such as one or more server(s) . The Web application  may utilize Web services  when handling and servicing requests from client . The Web application  is composed of one or more software applications  that are executing on one or more servers  or other computer systems. Note that a portion of Web application  may reside on one or more of clients . Alternatively, Web application  may coordinate with other software on clients to accomplish tasks. In one exemplary implementation, one of the software applications  may include a Commerce Server\u2122 family of products provided by Microsoft Corporation of Redmond, Wash., USA, and\/or other application server application programs.","Web application  may include the ability to monitor Web services, servers, and\/or client devices  interactions with one or more Web site(s) (), . . . , (J). The Web sites, referred to generally as , can operate on Web services , servers  and\/or client devices . Web application  may also be implemented at a client to monitor Web sites . Client () represents the situation where a Web application  including applications  (which may be identical to server-based applications ), but modified for any number of client purposes to monitor interactions with Web sites .","Click Stream Analysis: Requests at Web Pages, Path Calculation Report",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIGS. 2-3","FIG. 1"],"b":["160","201","206","304","314","201","160"]},"Some of the requests made by a user may also be designated a commerce event by one of the software applications . As described above, a commerce event describes any request made by a visitor to a Web site that is deemed a point of great interest, because the event typically represents a culmination of a user's navigational journey(s) through a Web site or results in some type of request that determines the outcome of the navigation. For instance, while visiting a Web site a user may purchase a product, click on an advertisement, add an item to a virtual shopping basket: all of which are the type requests that are usually considered a commerce event, because they represent special or the more interesting requests of a user's click activity. Further, the software applications  may also contain the flexibility to permit personnel managing the Web site  to designate additional or alternative requests that they consider to be a commerce event on the Web site .","Each time a user makes a request on the Web site , the request invokes one or more applications  to log a Universal Resource Identifier (URI) corresponding to whatever resource, page, advertisement, or other related item was clicked-on as part of a record . Each record  is stored in Web log . Each record  may also contain information such as the type of request as designed by a Universal Resource Identifier (URI) , a user key  logically representing a user who paid a visit to the Web site , historical data (not shown), the date and time of the visit , how the user entered the Web site (not shown), what browser (not shown) was used to enter the site, a previous URI (not shown) of a different Web site that the user viewed that may have enabled the user to visit the present Web site, and other information pertinent to tracking a user's interactions with the Web site . Additionally, certain URI  maybe be of particular interest and the corresponding request can be designated as a commerce event record  in records  of Web log .","As used herein, a \u201cvisit\u201d refers to a single sequence of requests made by a user, such as pages viewed while at a Web site from a certain period of time when the user enters the Web site, to when the user exits the Web site, where the time period between each chronologically contiguous click within the visit does not exceed a given timeout threshold. Click stream analysis application , through the log import module , is able to infer a visit from the web site  when no hits are received from a particular user after the last previous hit for a default period of time such as 30 minutes. In one implementation it is possible for the period of time used to determine what length of time should be used between the time a user enters a Web site to the time the user exits the Web site, to be determined by personnel managing the Web site. Click stream analysis application  permits this time to be selectable. Additionally, a visit may be determined by other techniques as described above. Of course, other durations, shorter or longer, may be selected for purposes of determining a visit. Other methodologies can also be used to infer a visit. For example, if the referring Universal Resource Locator (URL) is from a different domain than the site under analysis, then a visit can be inferred when the URL chain is broken.","In the example of , web log  shows the first six of many requests made by a single user (User) of client device XYZ during one visit to web site . As per the first record , the User entered the Web site on Jan. 1, 2002 at 1 PM. User then added an item to a virtual shopping basket on the user's second click, as denoted by the URI  in record  of Web log . As such, the record  contains a request representing a commerce event. User then performed the next four requests as designated by URI  referencing, respectively, \\path, \\path, \\path, and \\path. Although web log  is shown in  as being truncated, it is intended to represent an unlimited number of requests (URI ) of User as were made to the server(s) of the Web site  during the visit of User. Of course, the web log  also contains each of the requests of all other users that visited the web site . Such requests, and users making the same, have been omitted from web log  depicted in  for the sake of brevity.","As shown in , click stream analysis application  (which may be part of the applications  of operate in conjunction with applications ) is able to analyze a user's requests when visiting the web site . Click stream analysis application  includes a log import module  that imports (i.e., extracts) data from the web log . Optionally, the log import module  can import or extract data from the web log  of each of more than one server the services request from the users of the web site . Once these data have been imported and\/or extracted, the click stream analysis application  then can parse these data and store the result thereof in a database . In one implementation, a SQL Server 2000\u2122 product provided by the Microsoft Corporation of Redmond, Wash., USA is used to create and maintain the database , although other implementations are not limited to this particular arrangement. Click stream analysis application  also includes a reporting module  that analyzes information stored in the database , and based on that analysis, produces a path calculation report  that shows a number of sequential requests made by each user during their respective visits to the web site .","Database: Logical Representation of Tables from Techniques Including Hashing","The path calculation report  provides analysis concerning the Web log  and may be may produced by reporting module  by reconstructing visits to the Web site by one or more users. Each request performed by each user of the web site  is identified in the path calculation report , including a number of requests made by each user. This reporting includes any such request representing any record  in web log  that characterizes the purchasing of an item or other request of particular interest. The particular requests made by users prior to and\/or subsequent to the requests of particular interest can be further examined in a Web analyst's review of the path calculation report . Thus, the path calculation report  permits personnel (e.g., analyst) to monitor the Web site  and to gather detailed information on all of any given user's click activity prior to and subsequent to any record  in web log  that logically represents a commerce event. The path calculation report  may be displayed to an analyst in soft form, such as by a display on a client device, or in other formats such as a hard copy printed by a printer.","The path calculation report  is produced by extracting data from the Web log  (performed by log import module ), populating database  with information (also performed by log import module ), and by searching database  for user click activity (performed by report module ) according to default parameters or those requested by a Web site analyst. The database  can be organized in a fashion to permit the reconstruction of all of the user's visit from potentially several different servers. Consequently, by focusing-in on requests (those designated a \u201ccommerce event\u201d) that were performed on the Web site that are of greater importance to the Web site analyst, it can be determined the precise behavior (unlimited series of requests on which pages) that led a user to make a request corresponding to the commerce event or what type of requests occurred after the commerce event.","Hashing Process ","In one implementation, database  seen in  includes three tables: a request table , a visit table , and a summary table . Each table is described below. These tables need not be actually formed but can be kept as logical representations in database . Tables , , and  are formed by techniques that include compressing the corresponding one or more URI  of user\/client  during one visit to produce a fixed length number. This fixed length number, for the purpose of click stream analysis, is sufficiently to uniquely represent any particular click path. In various implementations, the fixed length number can be formed by a hashing process . Due to the potentially immense amount of data needed to represent all user requests during a period of time at a high user volume web site, hashing process  can be used to represent the user activity with less accumulated volume of data than otherwise.","Hashing process  can be implemented by hashing the large string of arbitrary length represented by each URI  in a compression that produces a fixed length (e.g. 128-bits or 8 bytes) integer. The compression can be performed using known hashing algorithms. In one implementation, the CryptoAPI (Crypto Application Programming Interface) can be used as the hashing algorithm. In another implementation, the MD4 CryptoAPI hash algorithm can be used to create a 128-bit hash value for use by 32-bit computers. Other hashing algorithms include the CryptoAPI MD2, MD5, and Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["207","311","207","311","207","312","316","328","312","324","330","316","160","324","328","324","324","207","328","324","328","312","324","324","160"]},"Request Table ",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["332","210","332","332","332","207","326","324"]},"Visit Table ",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["334","210","332","334","334","332","324","330","334","332","316","334","206","340","318","206","340"]},"Summary Table ","An optional summary table  can be formed by identifying each unique cumulative hash  that is formed in the hashing process  across all visits by all users during a period time.

A site depth  is set for each request by the user  during the visit to the web site, as represent by the path item no.  in the hashing process . Note that while the path item no.  is an assigned ordinal that advances by one for each request by the user during the visit, up to a value of \u2018N\u2019, the site depth  is not so assigned but is rather a logical representation of the depth to which the user  clicked within the web pages of the web site.","At block , an entry is formed in request table  for each request (path item no. ) by one user  during a visit to the web site.

Each row of the Path Calculation Report shows, in sequential order, the unique click path through the designed Web site that was taken by the number users shown in the \u201cUsers\u201d column. As such, the \u201cUsers\u201d column shows, for each row, the number of users that followed the particular click path of that row. Each subsequent column in that row shows, in sequential order, each of the one or more URI  corresponding to each of the requests of in the unique click path of the row on the report. As shown on the report, an unlimited number (\u2018N\u2019) of requests can be shown for each row on the Path Calculation Report. An unlimited site depth (\u2018K\u2019 for \u2018\\pathK\u2019) for the clicks of a user into the web pages at the Web site can also be shown. A discussion of the derivation of the data for the Path Calculation Report from database  and web log  follows.","The web log  has therein a plurality of URI each corresponding to a request made by a user  to a server of a Web site . The Web site  contains one or more web pages. Each user  of the Web site  and each visit made by each user  of the Web site  can be identified from the web log . A site depth  in the web pages of the web site  corresponding to each URI  can also be identified. The site depth  is the sequential number of the request by the user  in the visit (e.g. 1request, 2request, 3request, etc.). Consequently, the last request that is made by a user during a visit to a Web site will have the highest value site depth . Each URI  can be compressed, as discussed above, to form a URI hash number  that has a first fixed length.","Within each identified visit by each identified user , and for each URI  within the visit, a request entry can be made in the request table . The request entry in the request table  can include the site depth  of the corresponding request, the URI hash number , and a previous cumulative hash number  of a second fixed length. The previous cumulative hash number  can be is formed by compressing together each of the URI hash numbers  of the chronologically prior request entries of the visit that are in the request table . This compression can be a logical operation rather than an operation that is physically performed. Even though all the previous requests are available in a database, there is no need to literally go and retrieve all of the computed hashes for the previous requests and then to recalculate the cumulative hash. Rather, the hash can be calculated based on the cumulative hash (e.g. only one number) plus the new incoming URI (e.g. the string). In practice, if is likely that the combination of the single number that is hashed with the new incoming path (e.g. the URI) will yield a new unique number (e.g. the new cumulative hash). By knowing the depth, another degree of uniqueness is added.","The request entry also includes a cumulative hash number  of a third fixed length that is formed by compressing the URI hash number  with the previous cumulative hash number . These compressions can be performed as was discussed above with respect to compression algorithms.","A visit entry can be formed in the visit table  for each visit by a user  to the web site . The visit entry can include a visit duration  of the visit by the user  that can be derived from the date\/time  of the requests made during the visit, or by other techniques disclosed herein. The visit entry can also include a logical representation  of the user and, for the chronologically last request entry within the visit, the cumulative hash number  and the site depth  of the corresponding request.","A summary entry can be formed in the summary table  for each unique cumulative hash number  in the visit entries of visit table , where each summary entry includes a count  that represents the number of visit entries in visit table  that have the same cumulative hash number .","The sequential order of all of the URI that correspond to each summary entry in the summary table  can be derived by performing a lookup in a table that can be formed so as to correspond to each of the URI hash numbers . In order to obtain a path calculation report by using the tables described above, a query is first made to the summary table . This first query will give a cumulative hash for a given path that can be used in a second query made against the request table . This second query gives an individual URI hash. The individual URI hash can be used in a third query of an additional \u2018URI table\u2019 which maps a URI hash to a string. In addition, the URI table gives a \u201cpointer\u201d to the previous cumulative hash. Given the foregoing, a process can be repeatedly performed. In this process, a query is made to the request table  based on the cumulative hash, and then the individual URI hash and the previous path can then be found as described above.","As an alternative, the sequential order of all of the URI that correspond to each summary entry in the summary table  can be derived by decompressing each URI hash number  in each request entry of request table  that corresponds to one visit entry in visit table  that in turn corresponds to each summary entry in summary table . This derivation can be performed by identifying one visit entry in the visit table  that corresponds to one of the summary entries in summary table  according to a match of the cumulative hash number  in each. Then, an identification can be made of each request entry in request table  that corresponds to the identified one visit entry in visit table  by matching in each the cumulative hash number  and the site depth .","Thereafter, an identification can be made of each request entry in request table  that corresponds to the identified one request entry in request table  within the one visit by the one user . When so identified, a decompression can be performed of each URI hash number . The decompression of the URI hash number  yields the URI of the request. This decompression will preferably be conducted in the sequential order specified by the value of site depth  so that the \u2018path click\u2019 of the visit will be reconstructed in proper order. As such, the URI of each request in each entry in request table  will be identified for each unique visit to the Web site .","The identification of each of the request entries in request table  that correspond to the identified one request entry within the one visit by the one user  can be performed by identifying each match of the previous cumulative hash number  of the one request entry with the cumulative hash entry  of another said request entry that has a site depth  that is less than the site depth  of the one request entry. The first, second and third fixed lengths as used in the compression algorithms (e.g. CryptoAPI, MD2, MD5, SHA, etc.) can have the same length.","Exemplary Computing System and Environment",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","130","202","500","500","500"]},"The computer and network architectures can be implemented with numerous other general purpose or special purpose computing system environments or configurations. Examples of well known computing systems, environments, and\/or configurations that may be suitable for use include, but are not limited to, personal computers, server computers, thin clients, thick clients, hand-held or laptop devices, multiprocessor systems, microprocessor-based systems, set top boxes, programmable consumer electronics, network PCs, minicomputers, mainframe computers, gaming consoles, distributed computing environments that include any of the above systems or devices, and the like.","The applications  (including click stream analysis application ) may be described in the general context of computer-executable instructions, such as program modules, being executed by a computer. Generally, program modules include routines, programs, objects, components, data structures, etc. that perform particular tasks or implement particular abstract data types. The applications  (including click stream analysis application ) may also be practiced in distributed computing environments where tasks are performed by remote processing devices that are linked through a communications network. In a distributed computing environment, program modules may be located in both local and remote computer storage media including memory storage devices.","The computing environment  includes a general-purpose computing system in the form of a computer . The components of computer  can include, but are not limited to, one or more processors or processing units , a system memory , and a system bus  that couples various system components including the processor  to the system memory .","The system bus  represents one or more of any of several types of bus structures, including a memory bus or memory controller, a peripheral bus, an accelerated graphics port, and a processor or local bus using any of a variety of bus architectures. By way of example, such architectures can include an Industry Standard Architecture (ISA) bus, a Micro Channel Architecture (MCA) bus, an Enhanced ISA (EISA) bus, a Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA) local bus, and a Peripheral Component Interconnects (PCI) bus also known as a Mezzanine bus.","Computer system  typically includes a variety of computer readable storage media. Such media can be any available media that is accessible by computer  and includes both volatile and non-volatile media, removable and non-removable media. The system memory  includes computer readable storage media in the form of volatile memory, such as random access memory (RAM) , and\/or non-volatile memory, such as read only memory (ROM) . A basic input\/output system (BIOS) , containing the basic routines that help to transfer information between elements within computer , such as during start-up, is stored in ROM . RAM  typically contains data and\/or program modules that are immediately accessible to and\/or presently operated on by the processing unit .","Computer  can also include other removable\/non-removable, volatile\/non-volatile computer storage media. By way of example,  illustrates a hard disk drive  for reading from and writing to a non-removable, non-volatile magnetic media (not shown), a magnetic disk drive  for reading from and writing to a removable, non-volatile magnetic disk  (e.g., a \u201cfloppy disk\u201d), and an optical disk drive  for reading from and\/or writing to a removable, non-volatile optical disk  such as a CD-ROM, DVD-ROM, or other optical media. The hard disk drive , magnetic disk drive , and optical disk drive  are each connected to the system bus  by one or more data media interfaces . Alternatively, the hard disk drive , magnetic disk drive , and optical disk drive  can be connected to the system bus  by a SCSI interface (not shown).","The disk drives and their associated computer-readable media provide non-volatile storage of computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules, and other data for computer . Although the example illustrates a hard disk , a removable magnetic disk , and a removable optical disk , it is to be appreciated that other types of computer readable media which can store data that is accessible by a computer, such as magnetic cassettes or other magnetic storage devices, flash memory cards, CD-ROM, digital versatile disks (DVD) or other optical storage, random access memories (RAM), read only memories (ROM), electrically erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM), and the like, can also be utilized to implement the exemplary computing system and environment.","Any number of program modules can be stored on the hard disk , magnetic disk , optical disk , ROM , and\/or RAM , including by way of example, an operating system , one or more application programs , other program modules , and program data . Each of such operating system , one or more application programs , other program modules , and program data  (or some combination thereof) may include an embodiment of the applications  (including click stream analysis application ).","Computer system  can include a variety of computer media indentified as communication media. Communication media typically embodies computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules, and includes any information delivery media.","A user can enter commands and information into computer system  via input devices such as a keyboard  and a pointing device  (e.g., a \u201cmouse\u201d). Other input devices  (not shown specifically) may include a microphone, joystick, game pad, satellite dish, serial port, scanner, and\/or the like. These and other input devices are connected to the processing unit  via input\/output interfaces  that are coupled to the system bus , but may be connected by other interface and bus structures, such as a parallel port, game port, or a universal serial bus (USB).","A monitor  or other type of display device can also be connected to the system bus  via an interface, such as a video adapter . In addition to the monitor , other output peripheral devices can include components such as speakers (not shown) and a printer  which can be connected to computer  via the input\/output interfaces .","Computer  can operate in a networked environment using logical connections to one or more remote computers, such as a remote computing device . By way of example, the remote computing device  can be a personal computer, portable computer, a server, a router, a network computer, a peer device or other common network node, and the like. The remote computing device  is illustrated as a portable computer that can include many or all of the elements and features described herein relative to computer system .","Logical connections between computer  and the remote computer  are depicted as a local area network (LAN)  and a general wide area network (WAN) . Such networking environments are commonplace in offices, enterprise-wide computer networks, intranets, and the Internet. When implemented in a LAN networking environment, the computer  is connected to a local network  via a network interface or adapter . When implemented in a WAN networking environment, the computer  typically includes a modem  or other means for establishing communications over the wide network . The modem , which can be internal or external to computer , can be connected to the system bus  via the input\/output interfaces  or other appropriate mechanisms. It is to be appreciated that the illustrated network connections are exemplary and that other means of establishing communication link(s) between the computers  and  can be employed.","In a networked environment, such as that illustrated with computing environment , program modules depicted relative to the computer , or portions thereof, may be stored in a remote memory storage device. By way of example, remote application programs  reside on a memory device of remote computer . For purposes of illustration, application programs and other executable program components, such as the operating system, are illustrated herein as discrete blocks, although it is recognized that such programs and components reside at various times in different storage components of the computer system , and are executed by the data processor(s) of the computer.","Conclusion","The entire click path of a user during a visit to a web site can be reconstructed by using click path compression techniques. A path calculation report can be produced from the reconstruction to show the sequential order of a virtually unlimited number of clicks in each unique click path during any web site visit by any user. The reconstruction, and\/or the path calculation report, can be used to perform extensive behavior analysis of the web site users.","Although the invention has been described in language specific to structural features and\/or methodological steps, it is to be understood that the invention defined in the appended claims is not necessarily limited to the specific features or steps described.
