Most of the campaign monitoring and reporting focus on aggregate progress of the collective users participating in a citizen engagement campaign and may only be specially created for the campaign administrators.","A method for providing end-to-end citizen engagements, in one aspect, may comprise obtaining data from one or more of communication and social computing channels via one or more adapters. The method may also comprise providing data refactoring and management, integration and process orchestration of the data according to a data model as data attributes of the data model, the data obtained from multiple disintegrated data sources. The method may also comprise performing one or more analytics based on the data attributes stored according to the data model and input specified to the one or more analytics. The method may also comprise providing one or more results computed by performing the one or more analytics. The method may further comprise producing one or more application logics supporting one or more front-end applications. The method may also comprise providing the one or more front-end applications for automated sensing of user activities and sensor-based personal assistant capability.","The system for providing an end-to-end citizen engagement, in one aspect, may comprise a data model comprising a set of data types. An adapter layer may comprise a plurality of adapter executing on a processor and obtaining data from one or more of communication and social computing channels. A factory layer may comprise a computer executable module executing on the processor and adapting, extracting, making inference, reducing and augmenting, and integrating of the data as data attributes of the data model, the data obtained from multiple disintegrated data sources. An engagement analytics layer may comprise a plurality of analytics application programming interfaces that invoke one or more analytics computations based on the data attributes stored according to the data model and input specified to one or more analytics computations. An application logic layer may comprise one or more application logics corresponding to one or more front-end user applications, wherein the one or more results computed by performing the one or more analytics are provided to the user via the application logic layer and the one or more front-end user applications. Front-end applications are provided for automated sensing of user micro activities and sensor-based personal assistant capability.","A computer readable storage medium storing a program of instructions executable by a machine to perform one or more methods described herein also may be provided.","Further features as well as the structure and operation of various embodiments are described in detail below with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the drawings, like reference numbers indicate identical or functionally similar elements.","Citizen engagement or Campaign refers to a city or citizen initiated activity that has goal statement, timeline, and qualification for participation.","Campaign Definition may include defining goals, start and end dates, targeted age groups, targeted geographic areas, task for the volunteers to do (e.g., vote for a new park location), incentive definitions, rules to dynamically adjust incentives, and success metrics or measurement metrics.","Campaign Announcement or Launch may include generating campaign Web page and automatically pushing announcement to social media channels.","Campaign Recruitment (online) enables citizens to register as campaigners and campaigners to update recruitment status; enable citizens to register as volunteers and perform the task they are recruited for right there where they are registered; enable businesses (organizations or citizens) to register as sponsors; display campaign recruitment status for social approval.","Campaign Activity Reporting and Analysis may provide aggregate display of campaign progress of near real-time activity status for general public consumption and for use by the campaign administrators: e.g., viewed, liked, followed, response rate, most followed people, temporal stats and advanced analytics for staff consumption, which enables near real-time monitoring of the progress of the campaign status and adjustments of incentive based on the response rate and coverage.","Sensor-based refers to using various sensing devices, e.g., Pulse oxy meter, Heart beat monitor, Blood sugar monitor, Pedometer, etc., for determining information.","Sensor-based Personal Assistant (PA) Capability refers to using various sensing devices to create personalized experience and assistance in various aspects related to a campaign, e.g., sending, monitoring and tracking of personal progress daily toward the personal goals set by the users, and sending out reminders and alerts based on the goals set out by the users.","Various city\/citizen initiated activities may be carried through communication\/interaction channels such as community center activities, city infrastructure reporting via phones, public hearing processes, and so forth. Examples of campaigns include trying to persuade a group (a large number) of people to engage in a goal: e.g., 1) commit to ride their bike to work on a given week, 2) install rain gardens in their yard, 3) replace their incandescent light bulbs with CFLS (compact florescent light bulbs), 4) help recruit volunteers for a study. For city and citizens, the lack of a common single point interaction interface poses various challenges such as low participation rate, no visibility of campaign activities to city administrators, inefficient city resource allocation\/utilization, and so forth. Campaigns share common characteristics, and the process may be repeatable. They can be clearly defined with goals, a start and stop time, and activities to be done. Because campaigns happen at particular time (and sometimes place) they can be a social activity with people working together and getting friends involved. Because campaigns involve many people doing the same thing during the same time, they can use social incentives like leader boards, badges, rankings and points. Businesses may wish to sponsor them by contributing material incentives like coupons or t-shirts (and particular campaigns will attract particular sorts of people that particular businesses may be interested in). Participants can help one another by providing moral support, tips, etc. Campaigns are also well suited for test deployments in cities. One city may promote rain garden installation; another might promote bus use. Doing 1 or 2 campaigns is less of a commitment than, say, starting up an online 3ii. 3ii provides functions similar to 311, which is New York City's main source of government information and non-emergency services. There are specific roles in the City (usually the Communications Director) with whom to work.","Wellness specific problems for citizen engagement currently lack of Personal Assistant (PA) Capability and a system that communicates with PA. A methodology of the present disclosure may provide such PA capability in the citizen engagement conducted by the cities to do automate sensing using wireless sensors\/GPS, categorization, self-learning, and automated correction of the categorization of commonly performed physical activities, e.g., running, jogging, driving, walking, etc., personalized monitoring and tracking of the sensed data (e.g., via various wireless sensors, e.g., Pulse oxy meter, Heart, beat monitor, Blood sugar monitor, Pedometer), monitoring and tracking of daily personal progress, (e.g., frequency and amount of eating, physical exercises, and increase\/decrease of weight), and sending out reminders and alerts based on the goals created by the citizen to do the activities to improve the wellness of the citizens.","A methodology of the present disclosure in one embodiment may store, combine, correlate, and analyze public and private data about citizens, city infrastructure, and city and\/or citizen initiated engagements and\/or campaigns and their interactions to achieve an effective citizen engagement. The methodology in one embodiment may employ analytics to achieve the effectiveness of a citizen engagement. For example, for a given activity, an engagement model and analytics may quantify trust level of participants, impact assessment, personalized reward characterization, recruitment framework, behavior characterization, and prioritization of activities. In another aspect, an end-to-end Effective Citizen Engagement system may be provided that comprises 1) a back-end system that processes data from Web sites and social media, mobile phones, and sensing devices and produces analytics to achieve an effective citizen engagement, 2) End-user interface comprising one or more smartphone Apps (applications) for automated sensing of personal micro activities and for logging, viewing, and editing physical activities, diet and weight, as well as setting goals and working in teams, and one or more Web applications for users to interact with the system.","While the present disclosure describes a methodology with reference to a city and citizens of the city, it should be understood that the methodology of the present disclosure may be applicable to any other governing or organizational group and its constituents.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"There are various attributes of an individual that may be captured. Each attribute can play a role in determining an individual's engagement characteristics and qualifications. For example, a sustainability campaign may be better for those who are more environmentally aware. A public hearing about transit planning would interest more people who use the public transit system who are being impacted by the transit planning. Each engagement may have an impact on a diverse set of key attributes of a citizen, e.g., environmental awareness, physical health conditions, geospatial existence, social relation, financial conditions, demographic attributes. A deep analytical capability may be provided in one embodiment of the present disclosure that quantifies each attribute. The actual data collected for these set of selected attributes for each campaign constitute one of the data sources as shown in  and labeled as \u2018Multi-silo data\u2019 of the EECEASPA focus area.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["202","204","214","218","222","220","206","208","212","210","202","204","204","204","202","202","216","204","220","220","218","202"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["302","304"]},"An Adapter layer  comprises one or more adapters for getting data from various communication and social computing channels for the said architecture  of citizen engagements. The Adapter layer , for example, may include application programming interfaces (API) or the like for interface with various data sources from receive and\/or exchange data from the various data sources. There may be an API for each specific data source. Each adapter may process a specific set of data, for example, an HRA adapter may process health and\/or wellness related data, e.g., weight, diet, and activities\/exercise; a transit adapter may process smartphone GPS data of participant's movement records in and out of the City, a driver adapter may process driving data, e.g., driving habits; a sustainability adapter may process sustainability related data, e.g., water and energy smart meter data. Other adapters may be included, and more examples are described below.","A Factory layer  provides data management and integration, and application programming interfaces (APIs) for an effective mechanism to consume data from multiple the disintegrated data sources from various the communication and social media channels, transform the data through adaptation, extraction, inference, reduction, augmentation, and integration. The Factory layer  may retrieve data from the database (DB) . The Factory layer  supports the architecture  for citizen engagement and process, orchestrate to integrate with the data model , adapters , analytics and application logic . For cross-domain data integration, the factory layer links multiple disintegrated data sources by both dynamic integration at runtime and pre-calculated integration that stores data into database (DB).","An Engagement Analytics layer  comprises one or more analytics for analyzing the data and computing results of the citizen engagements. Examples of analytics are further described below.","An Application Logic layer  comprises one or more application logic tailored for various application types. An application logic of the Application Logic layer  may provide an application related functions that support one specific type of application. For example, the sustainability related application logic for water may provide functions to support a sustainability application and\/or Web portal for water; application logic for electricity may provide functions to support a sustainability application and\/or Web portal for electricity. Similarly, there may be application logic for health and\/or wellness supporting a smart phone Application for health and\/or wellness. Each application logic may implement the functions that support one type of application.","A front-end user interface  may comprise smartphone apps  for automated sensing of human micro activities and sensor-based Personal Assistant Capability sense devices to act like a Per Personal Assistant for personalized sensing. The front-end  of the system architecture may also comprise Web Applications , Apps for citizens and City (e.g., shown in  at  and ) to conduct effective citizen engagements. Web Applications  are applications that are Web based or accessible via Internet.","In one embodiment, EECEASPA takes input from various data sources , e.g., smartphone Apps (GPS, user inputs), personalized data, surveys, reports, communication channels (email, etc.), and social computing channels (social media channels, e.g., social networking sites, blogging sites, microblogging sites), e.g., as described with reference to .","In one embodiment, input data  are first processed by the Adapter layer . The Factory layer  integrates the data processed by the Adapter layer  and transforms the data into the correct format for the Engagement Analytics Layer  to perform calculation and produce results, which is used by a specific Application logic  targeted for a specific type of application to send and\/or receive data via APIs to that target application (e.g., shown at  in ). Examples of the calculations performed by the engagement analytics layer may include (but are not limited to): trust analytics that provides a mechanism for systematic analysis on the quality of data and\/or inputs provided by campaign participants, which can compromise the quality and\/or effectiveness of the campaigns, incentive analytics that provides a mechanism to optimize the allocation of incentives resources and provide dynamic adjustment of incentive allocation based on a participant's individual incentive sensitivity to the changes of incentive amount, e.g., how a participant is responding to the incentive changes, and other analytics. Additional calculations may include impact analytics that analyzes the impact on the participants by the campaign, behavior analytics that analyzes how the participants' behavior affects by the campaign, reward analytics, recruitment analytics, geo analytics, effectiveness analytics and prioritization analytics, etc.","Table 1 illustrates some of the analytics by definition and examples of

teaming, and integration with the health risk assessment (HRA) sites, provide alerts based on data collected to support HRA improvement, etc. In one embodiment of the present disclosure, there may be more than one smartphone app. For instance, one app may contain two sets of functions. In this example implementation, one set of functions is implemented by one app. Smartphone apps  may be a CEP App described above.","Both Smartphone Apps (for Automated sensing and Personal Assistant monitoring) may be downloaded and installed on a participant's smartphone with an operating system, e.g., Android\u2122 OS, and\/or others. Users take their smartphones with them for physical activities, e.g., walking or running. Smartphone App for Automated sensing (e.g., at ) utilizes the sensing device, e.g., Smartphone accelerometer, to provide automated sensing of the most commonly performed human daily micro activities, e.g., jogging, jumping, running, driving, etc. The App transmits the data produced by the use of the sensing device to the backend server, which performs analytics on the data for certain duration and automatically classifies the data. It can also perform user-assisted learning based on user-edited entries to self-correct and reclassify system logged activities to improve accuracy; automatic detection of patterns of misclassification; and automatic correction of misclassification.

Record is anything that is reported by the citizen and can be located on a map. It contains commonly used data fields including various fields for impact, verification, location and revision. Data type associated with this type of support may include: Record, Incident, Announcement. Record has several related data types: CategoryItem, Impact, Verification, Comments, Revision, MergeRecord, Area (for location and neighborhood). Record also includes various data, e.g., urgency, severity, certainty. Announcement has several related data types: Contact, Attachment (can be: Results or Collection (e.g. files, images, videos, etc.)).","The data model of the present disclosure in one embodiment may also support the following data types: Notification, Impact, Verification, Area, ActorAction, Incentive, NotifyTemplate. Notification may involve several other data types: Preference, Subscription (start and stop times), Location, Route (for location-based notification). Verification may involve several other data types: VerifyRule. Both Impact and Verification may be used together to arrive at one final determination of the decision of an Incident in terms of the reliability of the source, the user's reputation (e.g., trust score computed by trust analytics), and the impact on users (via impact score computed by impact analytics that analyzes the impact on the city residents of certain reported incidents, e.g., potholes, power outage, chemical gas leak, etc.,), etc. ActorAction is a general way to track all activities done by an actor, e.g., \u2018report\u2019 an incident, \u2018vote\u2019 a proposal, \u2018comment\u2019 on another actor's comment, \u2018view\u2019 portal page, etc. This can be used for analytics, e.g., more \u2018report\u2019 activities than \u2018viewing\u2019 activities. NotifyTemplate is an instance of the notification at a point in time for ease of reuse and customization. This also includes Preference, Subscription (start and stop times), Location, Route, etc. Users can reuse or change the templates without having to go through the trouble creating from scratch the entire list of data fields as described in the template. For example, organizations may want to create templates for its employees. Also, one or more frequently used templates, e.g., employee record, which may include commonly used list of data fields, e.g., employee ID, name, address, phone numbers, job title, date hired, emergency contact info, etc.), payroll record, customer profile, user profile (e.g. social network sites), etc. can be reused easily or been sold by small business that specializes in custom-tailor notification and alerting packages.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0082","num":"0081"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},"As described above, the data model is used to store the data received from various data sources and data used in the EECEASPA of the present disclosure, in a structured format for use by various functionalities of the EECEASPA.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0084","num":"0083"},"figref":["FIG. 11","FIG. 3"],"b":["308","1102","1104","1106","1104","1108","1110","1112","1110","1118","1120","1122","1124","1126","1128"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0085","num":"0084"},"figref":"FIG. 12","b":["1202","1204","1202","1202","1204","1206","1202","1202","1206"]},"The Factory layer  may call the following APIs to communicate with the social computing adapter  of the Adapter layer:\n\n","GIS refers to Geographic Information Systems.","The engagement analytics layer (e.g., shown in  at ) may perform the following analytics in one embodiment of the present disclosure.","Event Impact Analytics, based on pre-defined rules, links reported incidents and comments to impacted parties, actions, and possible outcomes. As a use case example of Event Impact Analytics, when a serious pothole report is submitted, the event impact analytics analyzes the impact of the reported event on the population of the city.","Incentive Design Analytics may generate various incentives such as points, badges, ranks, and so forth that are linked to reporting, polling, and other activities through Citizen Engagement Platform and evaluate the incentives that seem to be most effective. As a use case example of Incentive Design Analytics, higher points may be given to users with fast and valuable reports to have high impact. As another use case example of Incentive Design Analytics, give higher points to users with valuable comments that help shape the public hearing process.","Participant Behavior Analytics analyzes how participants in engagements behave under various conditions. As a use case example of Participant Behavior Analytics, the analytics tries to understand classes of participants that will communicate a pothole. Some users may report every pot hole they see. Others may report only if it has impacted them in a negative way, yet others may report when they see reward points for their prior reporting, etc.","Participant Reputation Analytics analyzes the quality of participant input and links it to participant reputation to create varying degrees of trust in crowd-sensed data. As a use case example of Participant Reputation Analytics, some citizens may report even the smallest problems while others will only report if it is a big issue. Learning and associating a trust value to every participant input and using it to weigh and aggregate the overall degree of input from citizen participants help prioritize actions.","Engagement Effectiveness Analytics analyzes the amount of engagement being generated by various engagement mechanisms to evaluate the effectiveness of those mechanisms. As a use case example of Engagement Effectiveness Analytics, if recruitment is being conducted for an event through multiple marketing channels, this analytics may evaluate the effectiveness of each channel in terms of the success of recruitment.","Reaction Prioritization prioritizes possible choices of reactions based on participant reputation analysis and event impact analysis. As a use case example of Reaction Prioritization, if there are two potholes to fix and only one can be fixed next week, the reaction prioritization may be used to recommend the pothole that if fixed will lead to the best mitigation of impact of the pothole and the mitigation of the negative opinion generated by it.","Impact analytics may be a variation of the trust analytics.","The following illustrates analytics APIs in one embodiment of the present disclosure.","Task Trust Analytics\n\n","Task Impact Analytics\n\n","Social Analytics\n\n","Each API may be implemented as an atomic calculation routine for selecting and prioritizing participants for a specific campaign task. For example, a social analytics API is used to identify individuals who have a greater influence so that a social message can propagate more effectively. Another example is a trust API that assigns a higher score for individuals who have higher trustworthiness for a specific input. An impact API is used to calculate who will be impacted by a specific event and a campaign so that any inputs from the impacted individuals can be accounted properly.","Analytics APIs may be implemented as abstraction classes: e.g., impact abstraction class to implement Event Impact Analytics, trust abstraction class, prioritization abstraction class to implement Reaction Prioritization, behavior abstraction class to implement Participant Behavior Analytics, engagement effectiveness abstraction class to implement Engagement Effectiveness Analytics, incentive abstraction class to implement Incentive Design Analytics, and similarity abstraction class. A similarity API may use a set of clustering algorithms such as support vector machine, k-means, and others to cluster individuals into multiple clusters. A choice of distance metrics such as L\u22121 norm, Cosine distance and other well known metrics may be used to calculate the similarity between clusters.","A trust API calculates a trustworthiness score of individual based on a set of attributes that describe a characteristics of individual and prior knowledge of a subject matter. In addition, previously verified inputs may be used to assign a score towards the trustworthiness.","The following illustrates an example use case scenario of transit approval public hearing.","Trust Analytics calculate trust metric for a user by attribute types (e.g., responsiveness, quality of data, frequency of participation, and so forth).
