title: Celestial navigation using stellar narrow-band emission
abstract: A method is provided for characterizing luminous celestial objects (e.g., stars) in celestial navigation of a missile system. The method includes segmenting, assigning, measuring, computing, ratioing, producing, scaling, and determining operations. Segmenting includes subdividing wavelength range into discrete contiguous bins. Assigning arranges each bin into a plurality of color bands. Establishing sets a transmissivity to each bin of each color band. Computing calculates broad-based fluxes for a reference value as a reference flux. Ratioing computes a ratio between the target flux to the library flux as a color scale for each band. Squaring determines the library flux for each band as a library flux squared. Producing sums a spectral scale over the color bands, a second multiplication of the color scale and the library flux squared as a first sum product, and sums over all the bands the library flux squared as a second sum product and dividing the sum products. Scaling factors each measured intensity of the measured intensities as a scaled intensity by multiplying each target intensity by the spectral scale for each bin. Determining sums a scaled broad-band flux for each band over the bins, a third multiplication of the transmissivity and the scaled intensity.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Pursuant to 35 U.S.C. \u00a7119, the benefit of priority from provisional application 61\/195,385, with a filing date of Sep. 30, 2008, is claimed for this non-provisional application.","The invention described was made in the performance of official duties by one or more employees of the Department of the Navy, and thus, the invention herein may be manufactured, used or licensed by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.","The invention relates generally to celestial navigation for missile systems. In particular, the invention relates to characterizing celestial spectral information in conjunction with stellar catalogs and appropriate adjustments based on narrow-band spectral emission (NBSE).","Weapon systems that navigate by the stars are designed to view and examine stars that are suitable to the system's charge-coupled device (CCD) capabilities. The manufacturer's design defines the CCD's response to light, which can be expressed as a function of wavelength. The CCD response is integrated with each particular star's photometric spectrum. This integrated flux can be used to determine whether or not the star is useable for navigation by the weapon system. The main source for narrow-band photometry spectra is the Mitchell-Johnson (MJ) star catalog.","Conventional stellar identification and characterization methods for celestial navigation yield disadvantages addressed by various exemplary embodiments of the present invention. In particular, such limitations cause severe inconvenience in characterizing all but a handful of bright stars.","Various exemplary embodiments provide a method for characterizing luminous celestial objects (e.g., stars) in celestial navigation of a missile system. The method includes segmenting, assigning, measuring, computing, ratioing, producing, scaling, and determining operations. Segmenting operation includes subdividing wavelength range into a plurality of discrete contiguous bins. Assigning operation arranges each bin of the plurality of bins into a plurality of color bands. Establishing operation sets a transmissivity to each bin of each color band; measuring luminous intensity from a target object for each bin as a plurality of measured intensities. Computing operation calculates broad-based fluxes for a reference value as a reference flux, the target object as a target flux estimate for each band, and a narrow-band library as a library flux.","In various exemplary embodiments, the reference and library fluxes include summing a first multiplication of the transmissivity for each bin and a reference luminous intensity for each bin over the plurality of bins. Ratioing operation computes a ratio between the target flux to the library flux as a color scale for each band. Squaring operation determines the library flux for each band as a library flux squared. Producing operation sums a spectral scale over the color bands a second multiplication of the color scale and the library flux squared as a first sum product, and sums over all the bands the library flux squared as a second sum product and dividing first sum product by the second sum product. Scaling operation factors each measured intensity of the plurality of measured intensities as a scaled intensity by multiplying each target intensity by the spectral scale for each bin. Determining operation sums a scaled broad-band flux for each band over the plurality of bins as a third multiplication of the transmissivity and the scaled intensity.","Various exemplary embodiments further include estimating an error for the band the target flux estimate from the scaled broad-band flux as a plurality of flux differences, and includes summing, subtracting, computing and determining operations. Summing operation adds a sum-square flux difference for each band from a square of each flux difference of the plurality of flux differences. Computing operation determines a root-sum-square flux difference for each band a square-root of the sum-square flux difference. Determining operation sums an intensity error estimate over all the color bands each root-sum-square flux difference as an intensity error estimate.","In the following detailed description of exemplary embodiments of the invention, reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof, and in which is shown by way of illustration specific exemplary embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention. Other embodiments may be utilized, and logical, mechanical, and other changes may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present invention is defined only by the appended claims.","Stellar navigation for missile systems employs orientation based on specific luminous celestial objects (e.g., stars) based on select electromagnetic emission characteristics for identification. Although the Mitchell-Johnson (MJ) catalog contains many bright stars, estimates of other stars' narrow-band photometry can provide information to guide the system more accurately.","This disclosure describes a method that uses broad-band photometry and spectral types to estimate the narrow-band spectra of non-MJ stars. The analysis incorporates narrow-band spectral emission (NBSE) characterization. The broad-band information is provided by the Hipparcos (HIP) star catalog. The broad-band photometry for a non-MJ star can be used to scale similar spectra from the MJ catalog.","The method also estimates errors of the scaled spectra. Analogous to Kalman filtering, these errors can be used as weights to combine the estimates of all similarly scaled spectra to calculate the Kalman estimated spectrum. The method can be easily automated so that thousands of spectra can be estimated in minutes. This disclosure describes that method, as well as aspects of its validation.","A weapon system's CCD sensitivity tunes to particular frequency bands and intensity of stellar light. Different stars have different frequency spectra; some stars are usable by the weapons system and others are not. In order to measure the CCD's sensitivity preferably employs narrow-band frequency estimates of the stars' spectra. Upon fielding of a CCD in a weapon system, operation includes construction of an initial star catalogue tuned to the performance of that device. Over time, whether due to system hardware upgrades or staleness of the original star catalog parameters, the weapon system's catalog of stars undergoes re-evaluation. Stars not usable before may subsequently be deemed beneficial due to the upgrade or catalog changes.","The various star catalogs offer much photometric information. Nonetheless, conventional techniques lack a process to rapidly filter all of this information so that limited resources can be focused on the most likely stars appropriate to the specific characteristics of the CCD. By applying the techniques described in this disclosure, hundreds of thousands of possibilities can quickly be screened to extract the critical few additions from the non-MJ star data. To accomplish this objective manually would constitute a lifetime effort. Once identified, the astronomers can apply more sophisticated techniques to improve on the 95% accurate spectra available from this filter approach.","The MJ catalog identified as \u201cThirteen-color Photometry of 1380 Bright Stars\u201d by H. L. Johnson and R. I. Mitchell, . vol. 1, pp. 299-324, has 1380 bright stars. Most of the catalog stars have thirteen narrow-bands of color flux. The Hipparcos (HIP) catalog from , European Space Agency, 1997, ESA SP-1200, provides three broad-band color magnitudes for more than 100,000 stars. Only a fraction of HIP stars have corresponding MJ narrow-band spectra.","Traditionally, a non-MJ star's narrow-band photometry was manually estimated for a few select bright stars. This process takes a knowledgeable person a considerable period, but the disclosed methodology can be computationally automated and can quickly estimate narrow-band spectra for HIP stars. In addition, neighboring stars around any catalog star (whether MJ or non-MJ) can affect the CCD performance. The fainter neighboring stars are rarely included in the MJ catalog, so their narrow-band spectra are also estimated. This paper describes and validates a methodology that Naval Surface Warfare Center\u2014Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD) uses to estimate non-MJ narrow-band spectra.","The methodology relies on using the MJ spectra as a library of narrow-band information. This library of information is cataloged by each star's Harvard Revised Identification Number (HR#) and characterized by its spectral type. A target star is chosen from the HIP catalog along with its spectral type and broad-band photometry.","All the MJ narrow-band spectra similar to the target star's spectral type are coarse-grained and scaled to match the HIP broad-band photometry. These scaled MJ narrow-band spectra provide a number of estimates of the target star's narrow-band spectrum. Each scaled estimate is associated with an expected error that indicates how close the estimated spectrum matches the broad-band information provided by HIP. These weights provide a single Kalman-type estimate of the target star's spectrum.","Narrow-Band Photometry: The 13-colored flux data from the MJ catalog are interpolated in wavelength every 10 nm from 350 nm to 1100 nm. The MJ spectrum is denoted as h(\u03bb) where the subscript index \u201cmj\u201d represents the HR#. Every MJ spectrum is associated with a spectral type.  illustrates a graph  of MJ Spectra for B6 Spectral Type Stars. A legend  identifies the stars within the MJ catalog. The abscissa  denotes wavelength in nano-meters (nm) of the light received, and the ordinate  denotes the spectral irradiance in fW-cm-\u03bcm(femto-watts-per-square-centimeter-per-micron).","All ten B6-type spectra reveal similarity in shape. The legend  identifies the corresponding HR# of each star. Stars with the same spectral type share similar spectra. For example, the top curve the graph  traces the MJ spectral irradiance for HR# 6396. The star HR# 6396 belongs to the spectra type B6. The ten other B6 stars' spectra from MJ are also plotted. In this example, HR# 6396 has greater spectral power than the other ten stars.","Broad-band Flux Estimates:  illustrates a graph  showing transmission of select electromagnetic energy bands as a function of wavelength \u03bb. A legend  identifies blue, visual and infrared curves, with the abscissa  denoting wavelength and the ordinate  denoting normalized transmissivity. The corresponding peaks of the blue b(\u03bb), visual v(\u03bb), and infrared i(\u03bb) transmission curves respectively correspond to 410 nm, 530 nm and 820 nm.","For demonstration purposes estimates are provided for a target star included in both MJ and HIP. The stars' MJ spectra represent a collected set in which all have the same designated spectral type as the HIP star. In practice, this method would be most practical for non-MJ stars. However, for demonstration purposes, this method presented for both to describe the methodology. Subsequently, two additional examples of non-MJ stars are demonstrated.","The MJ spectra in the collected set are coarse-grained in order that MJ data can be compared with HIP provided broad-band photometry. One of the transmission curves shown in the graph  is multiplied with a star's spectrum at each applicable wavelength bin. This function-product represents a function of wavelength integrated to yield the broad-band flux for that respective color. The subscript index \u201cmj\u201d refers to the star's Harvard Revised Identification Number.","The series of relations in eqn (1) shows the color MJ broad-band fluxes Ifor blue, visual, and infrared respectively:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":{"mrow":{"msubsup":{"mi":["I","mj","Blue"]},"mo":"=","mrow":{"msubsup":{"mo":"\u222b","mn":["350","1100"]},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"b","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"\u03bb"}},{"msub":{"mi":["h","mj"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"\u03bb"}},{"mo":"\u2146","mi":"\u03bb"}],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.2em","height":"0.2ex"}}}}}}}},{"mtd":{"mrow":{"msubsup":{"mi":["I","mj","Visual"]},"mo":"=","mrow":{"msubsup":{"mo":"\u222b","mn":["350","1100"]},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"v","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"\u03bb"}},{"msub":{"mi":["h","mj"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"\u03bb"}},{"mo":"\u2146","mi":"\u03bb"}],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.2em","height":"0.2ex"}}}}}}}},{"mtd":{"mrow":{"mrow":{"msubsup":{"mi":["I","mj","Infrared"]},"mo":"=","mrow":{"msubsup":{"mo":"\u222b","mn":["350","1100"]},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"i","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"\u03bb"}},{"msub":{"mi":["h","mj"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"\u03bb"}},{"mo":"\u2146","mi":"\u03bb"}],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.2em","height":"0.2ex"}}}}}},"mo":","}}}]},"mo":"}"}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"1"}}]}}}},"br":{},"sub":"mj "},"Broad-band Hipparcos Photometry: Typically irradiance fluxes are referenced to Alpha-Lyrae (\u03b1-Lyrae, HR# 7001).

Information from all of the scaled spectra can provide an estimate that typically has less flux error than the best-scaled estimate. The wavelength range can be divided into seventy-six wavelength bins of width 10 nm each. The bins range extends from 350 nm to 1100 nm. Each wavelength bin is denoted by \u03bb.

The Kalman weight K weighs the \u201cprevious\u201d and \u201ccurrent\u201d spectrum to construct the \u201cnew\u201d estimate Xwith error V. The new state replaces the previous. This process is repeated until the last scaled spectra are incorporated into the final weighted spectrum \u0125(\u03bb) with error \u03b5(\u03bb).

On the other hand, sometimes the MJ catalog does not have a star that matches the two-letter HIP spectral designation exactly. In these cases, estimates based on matching only the first letter of the spectral type are made. The overall strategy includes automating the algorithm to provide a composite of estimates and then selecting the value with the lowest expected error as the \u201ccomposite\u201d estimate.","MJ and HIP Spectral Comparisons: The composite method can be performed on the set of HIP stars also contained in the MJ catalog. The difference between spectra that have been estimated with HIP broad-band photometry and their MJ reference counterparts should be no greater than the \u201calgorithm\u201d error.

The HIP provided color magnitudes are B=3.071, V=2.06 and I=1.05. The MJ broad-band counter parts were calculated to be somewhat dimmer with magnitudes B=3.588, V=2.58 and I=1.55. For this star, estimates were applied for the spectrum, but not MJ, for CCD sensitivity analysis.","The star HR# 2735 provides another example, revealing a signifycant difference between MJ spectrum and the method's estimate. For this star, Dr. Lane concluded that the MJ catalog probably is mislabeled and the MJ spectrum really belongs to star HR# 2736.

A legend  identifies a bold dash line that denotes MJ catalog data and a thin solid line to indicate the completed spectrum from weighting application. A bracket  marks the wavelengths above 650 nm beyond which the MJ data are missing and can be compensated for by the process.","For the wavelength bins 670-1100 nm in the HR# 125 example, the spectrum h(\u03bb>670 nm) is zero.

For this example, the broad-band flux error can be supplied by the operator as zero for wavelength bins below or at 670 nm. This method enables these 163 MJ partial spectra to be reclaimed by operating on filled-in data consistent with their spectral class. Thus, the 163 red-less MJ stars need not be treated as purely non-MJ stars.","The methodology described herein estimates the narrow-band spectra of stars not contained in the MJ catalog. For each estimated spectrum, an expected broad-band flux error is calculated. The flux errors are used to select the best-scaled estimate and are used as weights in a Kalman type estimate. Ultimately, a composite estimate is automatically produced when the HIP spectral type designation is suspect.","The method has been validated by treating MJ stars as targets of estimation and then comparing them to the MJ reference spectra counterparts. This method has been shown to detect and highlight photometric differences between the MJ and HIP catalogs, as well as fill-in missing red data for 163 spectra in the MJ catalog. The process has been implemented as an automated set of instructions and within minutes has evaluated more over a hundred-thousand HIP stars for possible inclusion in the weapon system's star catalog for navigation. Furthermore, the method quickly detects photometric violations that neighboring HIP stars may impose on a star for consideration in the weapon system's catalog.","Spectral Estimation: The procedures for the automation process can be described in the following portion, associated with appropriate flowcharts.

Both \u0125(\u03bb) and \u03b5(\u03bb) are one-dimensional arrays indexed by the wavelength bin \u03bb.","A broad-band flux estimate of the weighted spectrum \u0125(\u03bb) can be used to also calculate a broad-band flux error \u0394\u00ce(k) that represents a one-dimensional array indexed by color k. This broad-band flux error can be employed to create a scalar estimate of the total spectrum error \u0394\u0125.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0134","num":"0180"},"figref":"FIG. 14","b":["1400","1000","1100"]},"As described earlier, the operator can supply \u00e0 priori estimates of the target stars spectra. These \u00e0 priori estimates are accompanied by an error estimate per wavelength bin to be included in the set after the \u201cregular\u201d spectra as described in A-0 (iii) so that the algorithm assigns the associated operator-supplied errors correctly. This feature of the algorithm enables filling-in missing data in a spectrum.","By adding the partial spectrum to the library set and assigning error as a function of wavelength, NBSE can supplement the missing data, thereby enabling a greater number of stars to be made available for navigation. For example,  shows plot  of HR# 125 without red data in the catalog, yet the \u201cweighted\u201d or Kalman estimate from NBSE shows the spectrum filled-in for complete extrapolation. In this example, the broad-band flux error is set to zero for wavelength bins between 670 nm and 1100 nm, the corresponding spectrum is also defined as zero by h=h(\u03bb>670 nm)=0 and the corresponding error \u03b5\u2261\u03b5(\u03bb>670 nm)=10from eqn (26).","The operator inserts partial spectra into the algorithm by merely adding it to the library of user supplied spectra h(\u03bb). The algorithm prompts the operator to input a variable mjand mj_add. In the spectra array h(\u03bb), the indices mj=1 to mjrefers to narrow band spectra not associated with the target star. The indices mj=mjto mj_add refers to the \u00e0 priori spectra of the target star. The associated \u00e0 priori flux error is supplied by the user by means of the two-dimensional array add_err(\u03bb).","Part B. Narrow-Band Spectra Estimation Method: The following method for NBSE relies on using a library set of pre-defined narrow-band spectra. Spectra from the library are characterized by a spectral type. The operator constructs a library of narrow-band spectra that usually may, but need not, be consistent with the target star's spectral type. The algorithm coarse-grains the spectra in this library and then scales them to match the target star's broad-band photometry.","These scaled narrow-band spectra provide a number of estimates of the target star's narrow-band spectrum. The scaled spectrum that has the least flux error is identified along with its associated spectral type. Each scaled estimate is associated with an expected error. The algorithm uses these scaled spectra and errors (and any \u00e0 priori estimates) to calculate a single Kalman-type (or weighted) estimate of the target star's spectrum. Based on the array descriptions given in the Part A, the method for estimating narrow-band spectra is described below.","Section B-0 NSBE Input\/Output:  lists the parameters of user input to be supplied by the operator, as well as of output. User definitions and options are presented in a first block  to identify parameters such as number of spectra, wavelength bin width and weight options. Arrays of photometry data are presented in a second block  to identify color magnitude and library information. Algorithm output is presented in a third block  to identify scaled estimates and errors.","Section B-1 Compute the reference and target star's broad-band flux:  identifies a first do-loop  for setting the broad-band flux arrays Iand Ifor each color k.
