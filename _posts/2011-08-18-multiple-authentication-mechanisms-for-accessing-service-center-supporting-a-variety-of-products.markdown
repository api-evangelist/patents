{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Embodiments of the present invention relate generally to providing product services. More particularly, embodiments of the invention relate to providing multiple authentication options for authenticating a user to access a service center.","Prior to the advent and prolific use of distributed network environments such as the Internet, customer service sessions typically occurred over a teleconference between a customer service agent or service specialist and a customer. These teleconferences, which incidentally are still very popular today, are initiated by a customer placing a phone call to a customer service agent. The customer service agent's phone receives the call through a public-switched telephone network (PTSN). Many support centers handle a large volume of inquiries, usually by phone, for sales, information, customer support and other services. Typical support centers provide the ability to route multiple incoming, customer-initiated calls to agents which provide sales, information, or support on behalf of an entity interested in establishing or maintaining a relationship with the customer.","Modern support center systems selectively route incoming calls based on a number of factors such as the number called or dialed, the originating number, the queued sequence of the caller, the geographic location of the caller, accumulated caller history, and other relevant criteria. Once the system has evaluated the inbound caller's information, if any, the system searches for an available agent to service the call. Availability of agents may be dependent on any number of factors such as a skill level or a schedule of the agent. The number of agents within the contact center and available to the system may often be limited by the physical space available for the agents to operate. Contact centers have to deal with a limited number of agents to handle a large number of incoming customer calls.","As the Internet is getting more popular, customer service providers now provide for computer-based customer service interaction by way of the World Wide Web. Instead of initiating a customer service session by using the phone, customers may access a website and engage in a web-based customer service session to make inquiries (e.g., technical support) and\/or perform tasks (e.g., paying bills). Web-based customer service sessions offer numerous advantages over teleconference-based sessions. For example, the graphical user interface of web-based customer service applications permit customers to view illustrations or written explanations and thus ameliorate the miscommunications which may arise with oral conversations between a customer service agent and a customer.","Further, web-based customer service sessions enable a customer to directly target his\/her needs on the website and thus reduce the time expended both in navigating through a series of vocal menu choices inapplicable to the consumer's particular needs and in waiting to speak to a service agent. Significantly, web-based customer service sessions are particularly cost-effective for the customer service provider given that fewer agents are required to communicate with customers. Indeed, customers are provided functionality for finding answers to their questions or performing tasks without any help from a live agent. These customer service sessions may be entirely computer-based or, alternatively, involve interaction with a customer service agent.","In addition, in order to access a support center, a user is required to enter certain credentials such as username and password to allow the support center authenticating the user. As mobile devices are getting more popular, such an authentication mechanism becomes inconvenient as a mobile device may lack a user-friendly keyboard. There has been a lack of alternative authentication options available to a mobile device for accessing a support center.","Various embodiments and aspects of the inventions will be described with reference to details discussed below, and the accompanying drawings will illustrate the various embodiments. The following description and drawings are illustrative of the invention and are not to be construed as limiting the invention. Numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of various embodiments of the present invention. However, in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order to provide a concise discussion of embodiments of the present inventions.","Reference in the specification to \u201cone embodiment\u201d or \u201can embodiment\u201d means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in conjunction with the embodiment can be included in at least one embodiment of the invention. The appearances of the phrase \u201cin one embodiment\u201d in various places in the specification do not necessarily all refer to the same embodiment.","According to some embodiments, various login and authentication options are provided to a mobile device to allow a user to select one or more of the options to access a service center (e.g., a support center) that provides support services to a variety of products or services on behalf of a variety of product or service providers. The login\/authentication options include, but are not limited to, a traditional username and password login\/authentication option, a voice login\/authentication option, and an image login\/authentication option. These options can be utilized individually or in combination dependent upon a particular user configuration or preference, which may be specified and stored in a user profile maintained by the service center. One login\/authentication option can be utilized in addition to another login\/authentication option or alternatively, one login\/authentication option can be utilized as a backup option when another login\/authentication option fails.","In one embodiment, in response to a user selection of a voice login option, the mobile device presents predefined one or more terms, phrases, or sentences and requests the user to speak the presented content to a microphone of the mobile device. A voice recorder of the mobile device is configured to capture a voice stream representing the one or more phrases spoken in real time by the user. The mobile device then transmits the captured voice stream to the service center over a network. In response, a security system of the service center is configured to authenticate the user by matching the received voice stream against another voice stream that has been previously registered and stored in a database associated with the user of the service center.","Similarly, a user can also initiate an image or video login option from its mobile device. According to one embodiment, in response to a user selection of an image login option, the mobile device requests the user to capture one or more images of the user at the point in time using a camera of the mobile device. The mobile device then transmits the captured image(s) to the service center over a network. In response, a security system of the service center is configured to authenticate the user by matching the received image(s) against other image(s) that have been previously registered and stored in a database associated with the user of the service center.","According to one embodiment, the voice login option and the image\/video login option may be required independently or in combination dependent upon specific situations, which may be configurable by the user and stored in a user profile of the service center. For example, a voice or image authentication may be required in addition to the traditional password authentication. Any of the voice, image, and password authentications may be selected as a default or primary authentication mechanism. If the default authentication fails, another authentication may be utilized as a backup login option.","Once the service center has successfully authenticated the user, the user can obtain support services or access resources available from the service center regarding one or more products or services that have been registered by the user. For example, a user can initiate from its mobile device and the service center can arrange a service specialist by establishing a communications session between the user and the service specialist using a communications channel that is preferred by the user and available to the service specialist. A user can also sell or dispose a registered product via the service center. A user can also access an online discussion forum associated with a registered product via the service center. A user can also receive certain advertisements (e.g., promotions or discount coupons) related to a registered product via the service center.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","101","102","101"]},"Service center  may be implemented in a centralized facility or server. Alternatively, service center  may be implemented in multiple facilities or servers in a distributed manner (e.g., cloud-based service platforms). Service center  provides services to a variety of products or services from a variety of clients or vendors. A client may be a manufacturer, a distributor, a retailer, a service provider or broker, a purchasing facility (e.g., Amazon\u2122, Expedia\u2122, or ISIS\u2122), or a combination thereof. In one embodiment, service center  includes service APIs  to communicate with other systems such as mobile device , client's site , social communities , contact center  including agents or experts , client backend systems , manufacturer backend systems , eCommerce sites  and other auxiliary systems (e.g., billing system). Service center  can handle service requests from customers of multiple clients. For example, a service center may handle customer service requests for a number of retail sales companies, sales calls for catalog sales companies, and patient follow-up contacts for health care providers. In such a structure, the service center may receive service requests directly from the customers or through client support management systems.","In one embodiment, service center  further includes community service system , support services system , post market service system , messaging system , and data warehouse . Support services system  is responsible for handling support services requests from the users, including identifying and registering a product, creating an instance case context, selecting and assigning a customer representative (also referred to herein as an agent, specialist, or expert) to provide support services to the users, and managing work flows, etc. An agent may be selected based on a skill set or expertise of the agent, as well as other factors such as geographic location, of the agent. The term \u201cagent,\u201d \u201cspecialist,\u201d or \u201cexpert\u201d refers to a service center personnel or a computerized application, in some cases, that respond to customer requests. An agent may be locally situated at the service center or remotely situated over a network. Throughout this application, the terms of \u201cagent,\u201d \u201cspecialist,\u201d and \u201cexpert\u201d are interchangeable terms dependent upon the circumstances. In most cases, the term of \u201cagent\u201d collectively refers to a customer representative, a support agent, a support specialist, a support expert, or a combination thereof, which may be a service center personnel and\/or a computerized application. Further detailed information concerning service center  and\/or support service system  can be found in co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13\/085,397, filed Apr. 12, 2011, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.","In one embodiment, community service system  is responsible for communicating with social communities  via an API, for example, to post a message received from a user and to route the responses received from social communities  back to the user. Post market service system  is responsible for handling post market activities associated with the registered products, including selling a registered product on eCommerce sites  and arranging a disposal facility to dispose or recycle the product, etc.","According to one embodiment, in addition to registering a product with the service center, a user can also register, for example, through the application running within a mobile device, one or more social communities and\/or one or more eCommerce sites by storing the necessary credentials (e.g., usernames and passwords) of the servers hosting the social communities and eCommerce sites in a database (e.g., user database) of the service center, where the database is associated with a user the mobile device. Subsequently, the user can transmit a sales request to sell or dispose a registered product by specifying one or more of the eCommerce sites.","In response to the sales request, post market service system  of service center  is configured to retrieve the necessary credentials for the specified one or more eCommerce sites and arrange the specified eCommerce sites for selling the product together with the associated credentials to allow the eCommerce sites to authenticate the user for the purpose of selling the product, such that the user does not have to provide the necessary credentials at the point in time of the sales request and the user does not have to provide detailed information of the product to be posted on the eCommerce sites describing the product to be sold. A single sales request received from the mobile device can specify multiple eCommerce sites. The service center can also arrange a disposal facility to dispose (e.g., recycle) a registered product without having a user to specifically contact the disposal facility.","Similarly, a user can also post a message to one or more of the registered social communities from the application running within the mobile device without having to individually access the social communities. In one embodiment, a user can transmit a request from mobile device  to service center , where the request includes a message to be posted and one or more community identifiers identifying one or more registered social communities. In response, community service system  of service center  is configured to retrieve the associated credentials from the database and to post the message to the specified social communities together with the associated credentials allowing the social communities to authenticate the user, without having to prompt the user for their same credentials each time. Further detailed information concerning community service system  and\/or post market service system  can be found in co-pending U.S. patent application Ser.

Messages may be related to the registered products of the user, such as, promotions, rewards, and recall messages. Messages may include advertisements from a variety of advertisement providers.","In one embodiment, a user can configure a set of one or more rules to specify whether certain types of messages or advertisements received from vendors or parties (e.g., retailers, manufacturers, social communities, or other advertisement providers), which may or may not be related to a registered product, should be routed to the user. These rules serve as part of message delivery or filtering rules. The service center engages with the related parties to allow the related parties to get in touch with the user by sending certain messages such as product promotions, rewards, and\/or recalls, etc. to the user. The service center may send a message to a user via one or more communications channels preferred by the user, which may also be configured as a set of rules and stored in a database associated with the user.","According to another embodiment, an advertisement received from a vendor is delivered by the service center to a mobile device of a user based on a set of delivery rules associated with the user. The advertisement is displayed on a display of the mobile device by an application running therein. In addition, the service center and\/or the application are configured to track interactions of the user with respect to the displayed advertisement to determine user behaviors, patterns, or trends in view of the displayed advertisement. An analysis is performed on the user interaction and the result of the analysis may be utilized to configure further advertisement delivery by the service center and\/or the vendors.","According to another embodiment, service center  is configured to identify users that have at least one common product registered with the service center and are also members of a social community. The service center is configured to send a message to those users to invite them to connect (e.g., becoming friends or following a friend) with each other via the social community. The social community is hosted by a third party and communicatively coupled to the service center over a network. The service center may also deliver messages or items posted by one of those users to another one of those users on behalf of the social community, without requiring such users to individually or directly accessing the social community. The service center can also deliver messages or items to a particular user posted by other users of the social community, where the messages or items are related to a registered product of that particular user.","According to a further embodiment, an application running on a mobile device provides a user friendly graphical user interface (GUI) to allow a user to configure a set of one or more delivery rules concerning whether certain types of messages or advertisements should be received at the mobile device from a service center. The service center is configured to deliver messages or advertisements on behalf of a message or advertisement provider, which can be a client to the service center, a retailer, a manufacturer, a social community, or other content providers. A user can utilize the GUI to configure, for each of the providers, whether a message associated with a particular registered product of the user or all products in general related to the provider should be received by the mobile device. The settings of the delivery rules are then transmitted from the mobile device to the service center to allow the service center to delivery subsequent messages or advertisements on behalf of the message or advertisement providers accordingly. Further detailed information concerning advertisement system  can be found in co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13\/185,309, filed Jul. 18, 2011, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.","In one embodiment, data warehouse  includes product database , client database , user database , and knowledgebase . Product database  is configured to store any data related to the registered products including user manuals, etc. Client database  is configured to store information related to clients such as client's preferred communications mechanisms.

Voice recorder  of mobile device  is configured to capture a voice stream representing the one or more phrases spoken in real time by the user. Mobile device  then transmits the captured voice stream to service center  over a network. In response, authentication module  of security system  is configured to authenticate the user by matching the received voice stream against one of voice references  that have been previously registered by registration system  and stored in user database  associated with the user.","In one embodiment, authentication module  may invoke voice processing module  to process the received voice stream in view of voice references . Voice processing module  may be implemented as a part of a voice recognition system, which may be maintained by service center  or alternatively by a third party voice recognition system that is accessible (e.g., over a network) via an API. Voice references  may include multiple voice streams, each of which may be registered and trained previously by registration system . For example, during the registration, a user may be prompted by registration system  via application  to repeatedly speak to a microphone of mobile device  a predetermined phrase in real time. The predetermined phrase may be maintained by application  or retrieved from user database  of service center . Registration system  may invoke voice processing module  to process the captured phrases, and to train and capture voice characteristics of the user that can uniquely identify the user. The final voice reference is then stored in database  as part of voice references . Multiple voice references may be utilized during the training, any one or more of which can be used to authenticate the user dependent upon user configuration, which may be stored as part of authentication preferences . For example, if authentication module fails to authenticate the user based on a first voice reference, it may attempt to authenticate the user based on a second voice reference, or up to a predetermined number of voice references before declaring that the user cannot be authenticated.","Similarly, a user can also initiate an image or video login option from its mobile device . According to one embodiment, in response to a user selection of an image login option, mobile device  requests the user to capture one or more images or a video stream of the user at the point in time using camera  of mobile device . Mobile device  then transmits the captured image(s) or video stream to security system  of service center  over a network. In response, security system  is configured to authenticate the user by matching the received image(s) or video stream against image or video references that have been previously registered by registration system  and stored as part of image references  in database . Similarly, multiple image references can be utilized to authenticate a user.","According to one embodiment, the voice login option and the image\/video login option may be required independently or in combination dependent upon specific situations, which may be configurable by the user and stored as part authentication preferences . For example, a voice or image authentication may be required in addition to the traditional password authentication, dependent upon the security level required. Any of the voice, image, and password authentications may be selected as a default or primary authentication mechanism. If the default authentication fails, another authentication mechanism may be utilized as a backup login option.","Once the service center has successfully authenticated the user, the user can obtain support services or access resources available from the service center regarding one or more products or services that have been registered by the user. For example, a user can initiate from its mobile device and the service center can arrange a service specialist by establishing a communications session between the user and the service specialist using a communications channel that is preferred by the user and available to the service specialist. A user can also sell or dispose a registered product via the service center. A user can also access an online discussion forum associated with a registered product via the service center. A user can also receive certain advertisements (e.g., promotions or discount coupons) related to a registered product via the service center. A registered product or service may be registered by scanning a machine-readable code (e.g., barcode, UPC, or serial number) of the product or service using a scanner or camera of the mobile device without requiring the user to provide detailed information of the product or service. Based on the scanned machine-readable code, registration system  can communicate with the necessary or related parties (e.g., systems - of ) to compile the detailed information, as described in the above incorporated-by-reference applications.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIGS. 1-2","FIG. 3"],"b":["300","102","301","302","303"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIGS. 1-2","FIG. 4"],"b":["400","102","401","402","403","405","404"]},"As described above, a user can configure, as a part of a user profile or authentication preferences, any one or more of the configured authentication methods can be used to authenticate a user. Alternatively, a particular authentication method (e.g., voice, image, or password) can be designated as a default or primary authentication method or alternatively, it can be configured as a secondary or backup authentication method. Furthermore, a particular authentication method can also be configured as an addition authentication method, in addition to a default or primary authentication dependent upon the security requirement. For example, according to one configuration, a user can select any one of voice, image, and password authentication methods to allow a service center to authenticate the user. Alternatively, according to another configuration, if a voice or image authentication fails, a traditional password authentication may be performed, or vice versa. According to a further configuration, if a default authentication such as voice or image authentication is successful, a traditional password authentication may further be required, or vice versa, for extra security consideration, etc. Other configurations may also be applied herein.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIGS. 1-2","FIG. 5"],"b":["500","101","501","502","503"]},"In response to a user selection of an image\/video authentication method, at block , processing logic instructs the user to capture an image or video stream of the user at the point in time using a camera of the mobile device. Processing logic is configured to capture, via the camera of the mobile device, an image or video stream in real time and to transmit the captured image or video stream to the service center over a network to enable the service center to authenticate the user based on the image or video stream. In response to a user selection of a password authentication method, at block , processing logic prompts the user to enter a password in an input field displayed on the login page and transmits the password to the service center to allow the service center to authenticate the user based on the password.","Note that as described above, the voice, image\/video, and password authentication methods may be presented and performed individually or in combination. Operations involved in blocks - may be performed independently or in sequence, dependent upon the specific configuration (e.g., authentication preferences) of the user. Similarly, the voice, image\/video, and password login options may be presented on the login page individually or in combination dependent upon the authentication preferences of the user. For example, it is assumed that a user has configured his\/her authentication preferences to have a voice login as a primary authentication method and a password authentication as a secondary authentication. In this example, the login page may only display a voice login option and only if the voice authentication fails, the login page then prompts the user for password. Similarly, if the user has configured requiring both image and password authentication methods, where the image authentication method is a default one, the login page may display only the image login option first and only if the image authentication is successful, the login page then displays the password login option requesting the user to enter the password. Other configurations may exist.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":["FIGS. 6A-6F","FIGS. 6A-6F","FIG. 6A"],"b":["103","101","103","102","600","600","601","602"]},"Again, the login options are presented on login page  dependent upon the specific configuration of the authentication settings, which may be stored as a part of authentication preferences or user profile. In this example, it is assumed that a user has configured to have all three options available and enabled, such that the user can utilize any one of the login options -. In another example, the user may have configured to have only one or two of the login options - that are available for login. In such a situation, only the preferred or available login options are presented on login page . In a further example, a user may have designated a primary or default login option and a secondary or backup login option, where the secondary login option is utilized only when the primary login option fails to authenticate the user. In such a situation, only the primary login option is initially displayed on login page , where the secondary login option is displayed on login page  only when the primary login fails. Similarly, a user may have designated a primary or default login option and one or more secondary login options, where the secondary login option is utilized only when the primary login option successfully authenticates the user. In such a situation, only the primary login option is initially displayed on login page , where a secondary login option is displayed on login page  only when the primary login successfully authenticates the user.","Referring back to , according to one embodiment, a user can select any one of login options - for logging onto the service center. If the user selects traditional password login option , the user can enter the necessary user identification (e.g., email address) in input field  and the password in input field . Once the user activates or clicks login button , the username and password are transmitted by the application to the service center over a network to allow the service center to authenticate the user based on the username and password. Alternatively, the user can select voice login or image login option by activating buttons  and , respectively.","According to one embodiment, when the user selects voice login option , a voice login page  is displayed as shown in . Referring now to , voice login page  includes information requesting the user to capture predetermined phrase  by activating button . The predetermined phrase  may be maintained by the underlying application or by the service center. In addition, voice login page  displays a volume indicator  indicating the current volume spoken by the user, which may be monitored by the underlying application. In this way, the user can adjust his\/her volume to ensure that a reasonably good quality of a voice stream is captured for authentication purpose.","Once the user activates button , voice login page  displays information indicating that the voice of the user is being recorded as shown in . In addition, volume indicator  may display in real time the current volume spoken by the user. At this point, the user can click button  again to stop the recording. Once the recording has been completed, the captured voice stream is transmitted to the service center and the voice login page displays information indicating that the user is being authenticated based on the voice as shown in . Once the user has been successfully authenticated based on the voice as shown in , the user can access resources of the service center including obtaining support services from the service center concerning one or more products or services that have been previously registered with the service center by the user. If the voice authentication fails, a failure message is displayed to allow the user to try another attempt, for example, using a different phrase as shown in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"figref":["FIGS. 7A-7D","FIGS. 7A-7D","FIG. 6A","FIG. 7B","FIG. 7C","FIG. 7D"],"b":["603","700","700","701","702","700","700"]},"Some portions of the preceding detailed descriptions have been presented in terms of algorithms and symbolic representations of operations on data bits within a computer memory. These algorithmic descriptions and representations are the ways used by those skilled in the data processing arts to most effectively convey the substance of their work to others skilled in the art. An algorithm is here, and generally, conceived to be a self-consistent sequence of operations leading to a desired result. The operations are those requiring physical manipulations of physical quantities.","It should be borne in mind, however, that all of these and similar terms are to be associated with the appropriate physical quantities and are merely convenient labels applied to these quantities. Unless specifically stated otherwise as apparent from the above discussion, it is appreciated that throughout the description, discussions utilizing terms such as those set forth in the claims below, refer to the action and processes of a computer system, or similar electronic computing device, that manipulates and transforms data represented as physical (electronic) quantities within the computer system's registers and memories into other data similarly represented as physical quantities within the computer system memories or registers or other such information storage, transmission or display devices.","Embodiments of the invention also relate to an apparatus for performing the operations herein. Such a computer program is stored in a non-transitory computer readable medium. A machine-readable medium includes any mechanism for storing information in a form readable by a machine (e.g., a computer). For example, a machine-readable (e.g., computer-readable) medium includes a machine (e.g., a computer) readable storage medium (e.g., read only memory (\u201cROM\u201d), random access memory (\u201cRAM\u201d), magnetic disk storage media, optical storage media, flash memory devices).","The processes or methods depicted in the preceding figures may be performed by processing logic that comprises hardware (e.g. circuitry, dedicated logic, etc.), software (e.g., embodied on a non-transitory computer readable medium), or a combination of both. Although the processes or methods are described above in terms of some sequential operations, it should be appreciated that some of the operations described may be performed in a different order. Moreover, some operations may be performed in parallel rather than sequentially.","Embodiments of the present invention are not described with reference to any particular programming language. It will be appreciated that a variety of programming languages may be used to implement the teachings of embodiments of the invention as described herein.","In the foregoing specification, embodiments of the invention have been described with reference to specific exemplary embodiments thereof.
