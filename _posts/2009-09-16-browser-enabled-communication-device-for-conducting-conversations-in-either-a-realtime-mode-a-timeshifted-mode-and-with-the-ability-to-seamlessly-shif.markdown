Field of the Invention","This invention pertains to communications, and more particularly, to a browser enabled communication device capable of conducting conversations in either a synchronous real-time mode or asynchronously in a time-shifted mode, and with the ability to seamlessly transition between the two modes.","2. Description of Related Art","Electronic voice communication has historically relied on telephones and radios. Conventional telephone calls required one party to dial another party using a telephone number and waiting for a circuit connection to be made over the Public Switched Telephone Network or PSTN. A full-duplex conversation may take place only after the connection is made. More recently, telephony using Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) has become popular. With VoIP, voice communications takes place using IP over a packet-based network, such as the Internet. Radio communication, including Push To Talk (PTT) and PTT over Cellular (PoC) systems, allows a person to communicate with others with the push of a button, without first establishing a two-way connection. Most radio communication is half-duplex, meaning only one person can speak over a single channel at a time. With mobile phones, two-way communication is possible by establishing two channels, each at different frequencies.","Many full-duplex telephony systems have some sort of message recording facility for unanswered calls such as voicemail. If an incoming call goes unanswered, it is redirected to a voicemail system. When the caller finishes the message, the recipient is alerted and may listen to the message. Various options exist for message delivery beyond dialing into the voicemail system, such as email or \u201cvisual voicemail\u201d, but these delivery schemes all require the entire message to be left by the caller before the recipient can listen to the message.","Many home telephones have answering machine systems that record missed calls. They differ from voicemail in that the caller's voice is often played through a speaker on the answering machine while the message is being recorded. The called party can pick up the phone while the caller is leaving a message, which causes most answering machines to stop recording the message. With other answering machines, however, the live conversation will be recorded unless the called party manually stops the recording. In either recording situation, there is no way for the called party to review the recorded message until after the recording has stopped. As a result, there is no way for the recipient to review any portion of the recorded message other than the current point of the conversation while the conversation is ongoing and is being recorded. Only after the conversation has concluded, and the parties have hung up, or the recipient has manually stopped the recording, can the recipient go back and review the recorded message or conversation.","Some more recent call management systems provide a \u201cvirtual answering machine\u201d, allowing callers to leave a message in a voicemail system, while giving called users the ability to hear the message as it is being left. The actual answering \u201cmachine\u201d is typically a voicemail-style server, operated by the telephony service provider. Virtual answering machine systems differ from standard voice mail systems in that the called party may use either their phone or a computer to listen to messages as they are being left. Similar to an answering machine as described in the preceding paragraph, however, the called party can only listen at the current point of the message as it is being left. There is no way to review previous portions of the message before the message is left in its entirety and the caller hangs up.","Certain mobile phone handsets have been equipped with an \u201canswering machine\u201d feature inside the handset itself that behaves similarly to a landline answering machine as described above. With these answering machines, callers may leave a voice message, which is recorded directly on the phone of the recipient. While the answering machine functionality has been integrated into the phone, the limitations of these answering machines, as discussed above, are still present.","With most current PTT systems, incoming audio is played on the device as it is received. If the user does not hear the message, for whatever reason, the message is irretrievably lost. Either the sender must resend the message or the recipient must request the sender to retransmit the message. PTT messaging systems are known. With these systems, message that are not reviewed live are recorded. The recipient can access the message from storage at a later time. These systems, however, typically do not record messages that are reviewed live by the recipient. See for example U.S. Pat. No. 7,403,775, U.S. Publications 2005\/0221819 and 2005\/0202807, EP 1 694 044 and WO 2005\/101697.","With the growing popularity of the Web, more people are communicating through the Internet. With most of these applications, the user is interfacing through a browser running on their computer or other communication device, such as a mobile or cellular phone or radio, communicating with others through the Internet and one or more communication servers.","With email for example, users may type and send text messages to one another through email clients, located either locally on their computer or mobile communication device (e.g., Microsoft Outlook) or remotely on a server (e.g., Yahoo or Google Web-based mail). In the remote case, the email client \u201cruns\u201d on the computer or mobile communication device through a Web browser. Although it is possible to send time-based (i.e., media that changes over time, such as voice or video) as an attachment to an email, the time-based media can never be sent or reviewed in a \u201clive\u201d or real-time mode. Due to the store and forward nature of email, the time-based media must first be created, encapsulated into a file, and then attached to the email before it can be sent. On the receiving side, the email and the attachment must be received in full before it can be reviewed. Real-time communication is therefore not possible with conventional email.","Skype is a software application intended to run on computers that allows people to conduct voice conversations and video-conferencing communication. Skype is a type of VoIP system, and it is possible with Skype to leave a voice mail message. Also with certain ancillary products, such as Hot Recorder, it is possible for a user to record a conversation conducted using Skype. However with either Skype voice mail or Hot Recorder, it is not possible for a user to review the previous media of the conversation while the conversation is ongoing or to seamlessly transition the conversation between a real-time and a time-shifted mode.","Social networking Web sites, such as Facebook, also allow members to communicate with one another, typically through text-based instant messaging, but video messaging is also supported. In addition, mobile phone applications for Facebook are available to Facebook users. Neither the instant messaging, nor the mobile phone applications, however, allow users to conduct voice and other time-based media conversations in both a real-time and a time-shifted mode and to seamlessly transition the conversation between the two modes.","Google Wave is Web based personal communication and collaboration tool and computing platform designed to merge email, wiki, and instant messaging. Instead of sending a message and its entire thread of previous messages as is typical with conventional email, objects known as \u201cwaves\u201d contain a complete thread of multimedia messages (blips) maintained on a central server. Waves are shared and collaborators can be added or removed at any point during the existence of a wave. Any participant can reply anywhere in the message, edit the content, or add participants at any point in the duration of a wave. Recipients are notified of any changes or replies in all the waves in which they are active. The changes or replies are automatically visible when the user accesses the wave. The ability to modify a wave at any point or location lets users create collaborative documents, edited in a manner akin to wikis. In addition, replies or edits may be updated, letter-by-letter, as they are typed. Although the update of each keystroke as it occurs gives the appearance of being time-based media that is rendered \u201clive\u201d, in actuality it is not. Rather each keystroke entry is a separate or discrete event. In contrast with time-based media such as voice or video, the media is continuous and changes over time. Multiple participants may edit a single wave simultaneously. When multiple users are online at the same time, waves are similar to instant messaging. Waves, however, do not support the real-time communication of voice or other time-based media. Consequently, there is no ability to conduct a voice and\/or video conversation in real-time using Google wave.","A browser enabled communication device is disclosed. The communication device includes a processor, a display, a network connection configured to connect the communication device with a remote communication device over a communication network, a browser and a communication application. The communication application and the browser both run on the processor and cooperate to create a user interface that enables a user of the communication device to participate in a conversation with the remote communication device over the communication network. The user interface enables the user to participate in the conversation in either: (i) a real-time mode or (ii) a time-shifted mode and to (iii) seamlessly transition the conversation between the two modes (i) and (ii) so that the media of the conversation may be rendered synchronously when in the real-time mode or asynchronously when in the time-shifted mode.","It should be noted that like reference numbers refer to like elements in the figures.","The invention will now be described in detail with reference to various embodiments thereof as illustrated in the accompanying drawings. In the following description, specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the invention. It will be apparent, however, to one skilled in the art, that the invention may be practiced without using some of the implementation details set forth herein. It should also be understood that well known operations have not been described in detail in order to not unnecessarily obscure the invention.","\u201cMedia\u201d as used herein is intended to broadly mean virtually any type of media, such as but not limited to, voice, video, text, still pictures, sensor data, GPS data, or just about any other type of media, data or information.","As used herein, the term \u201cconversation\u201d is also broadly construed. In one embodiment, a conversation is intended to mean a thread of messages, strung together by some common attribute, such as a subject matter or topic, by name, by participants, by a user group, or some other defined criteria. In another embodiment, the messages of a conversation do not necessarily have to be tied together by some common attribute. Rather one or more messages may be arbitrarily assembled into a conversation. Thus a conversation is intended to mean two or more messages, regardless if they are tied together by a common attribute or not.","Referring to , a communication system including one or more communication servers  and a plurality of client communication devices  is shown. A communication services network  is used to interconnect the individual client communication devices  through the servers .","The server(s)  run an application responsible for routing the metadata used to set up and support conversations as well as the actual media of messages of the conversations between the different client communication devices . In one specific embodiment, the application is the server application described in commonly assigned co-pending U.S. application Ser. No. 12\/028,400 (U.S. Patent Publication No. 2009\/0003558), Ser. No. 12\/192,890 (U.S. Patent Publication No. 2009\/0103521), and Ser. No. 12\/253,833 (U.S. Patent Publication No. 2009\/0168760), each incorporated by reference herein for all purposes. The communication application as described in the above-listed applications enables client communication devices  to engage in conversations (i) synchronously in a real-time mode or (ii) asynchronously in a time-shifted mode and to (iii) seamlessly transition the conversation between the two modes (i) and (ii). The conversations may include multiple types of media, including voice, text, video, sensor data, GPS data, etc., and are not limited to just voice media as with conventional telephone conversations. In addition, the server(s)  may support conversations between more than two parties, such as conference calls between multiple parties.","In various embodiments, each of the server(s)  may run only the above-mentioned communication application. In an alternative embodiment, one or more of the server(s) may also be Web servers capable of serving Web content to the client communication devices  as well as running the communication application. In yet another alternative embodiment, the communication services network  may include, in addition to the Web server(s) , one or more stand-alone Web servers (not illustrated) capable of serving Web content.","The client communication devices  may be a wide variety of different types of communication devices, such as desktop computes, mobile or laptop computers, mobile or cellular phones, Push To Talk (PTT) devices, PTT over Cellular (PoC) devices, radios, satellite phones or radios, VoIP phones, or conventional telephones designed for use over the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN). The above list should be construed as exemplary and should not be considered as exhaustive. Any type of communication device may be used.","The network  may in various embodiments be the Internet, PSTN, a circuit-based network, a mobile communication network, a cellular network based on CDMA or GSM for example, a wired network, a wireless network, a tactical radio network, a satellite communication network, any other type of communication network, or any combination thereof. The network  may also be either heterogeneous or homogeneous network.","Referring to , a block diagram of a client communication device  according to one embodiment of the present invention is shown. The client communication device  includes a network connection  for connecting the client communication device  to the network , a speaker  for rendering voice and other audio based media, a mouse  for cursor control and data entry, a microphone  for voice and other audio based media entry, a keyboard or keypad  for text and data entry, a display  for rendering image or video based media at the client communication device , and a camera  for capturing either still photos or video using the client communication device . It should be noted that elements  through  are each optional and are not necessarily included on all implementations of a client communication device . In addition, the display  may be a touch-sensitive display capable of receiving inputs using a pointing element, such as a pen, stylus or finger. In yet other embodiments, client communication devices  may optionally further include other media generating devices (not illustrated), such as sensor data (e.g., temperature, pressure), GPS data, etc.","The client communication device  also includes a Web browser  configured to generate and display HTML\/Web content  on the display . An optional multimedia platform , such as Adobe Flash, provides audio, video, animation, and other interactivity features within the Web browser . The multimedia platform  communicates with an underlying communication application  using remote Application Programming Interfaces or APIs, as is well known in the art.","The Web browser  may be any well-known software application for retrieving, presenting, and traversing information resources on the Web. In various embodiments, well known browsers such as Internet Explorer by Microsoft, Firefox by the Mozilla Foundation, Safari by Apple, Chrome by Google, Opera by Opera Software for desktop, mobile, embedded or gaming systems, or any other browser may be used. Regardless of the browser, information resources are identified by a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) and may be a Web page, image, video, or any other type of content. Hyperlinks present in resources enable users to easily navigate their browsers to related resources. Once content has been retrieved, the browser  is responsible for rendering the images, audio, video, data, text and\/or related XML files defined by the retrieved Web page, typically creating a user-friendly interface on the display  and\/or speaker  of client communication device . In various embodiments, the browser  further includes a host of user interface features, such as backward and forward buttons, refresh or reload buttons, a stop button for stopping the loading of content, a home button to return to a home page, an address bar to input URLs, a search bar to input search terms into a search engine, a status bar, and other features typically found on Web browsers. Although the browser  is primarily intended to access the World Wide Web, in alternative embodiments, the browser  can also be used to access information provided by servers in private networks or content in file systems.","The client communication device  also includes a communication application  that enables the client communication device  to set up and engage in conversations with other client communication devices  (i) synchronously in the real-time mode, (ii) asynchronously in the time-shifted mode and to (iii) seamlessly transition the conversation between the two modes (i) and (ii). The conversations may also include multiple types of media, including voice, text, video, sensor data, etc. In one specific embodiment, the communication application is the client application described in commonly assigned co-pending U.S. application Ser. Nos. 12\/028,400, 12\/192,890, and 12\/253,833, each incorporated by reference herein for all purposes.","The client communication device  also includes a Web browser plug-in  and a browser interface layer . The Web-browser plug-in  provides well-known \u201cplug-in\u201d functionality of services offered by the browser . The browser interface layer  acts as an interface between the Web browser  and the core of communication application . The browser interface layer  is responsible for (i) invoking the various user interface functions implemented by the communication application  and presenting the appropriate user interfaces through the content presented through browser  to the user of client communication device  and (ii) receiving inputs from the user through the browser and other inputs on the client communication device , such as mouse , keyboard or keypad , or touch display  and providing these inputs to the communication application . As a result, the user of the client communication device  may control the operation of the communication application  when setting up, participating in, or terminating conversations through the Web browser  and the other input\/output devices  through  optionally provided on the client communication device .","The various software components including the browser , multimedia platform , communication application , Web browser plug-in  and browser interface layer , all run or are executed on a underlying processor core . The processor core  may be any computing hardware platform, such as those based on, but not limited to, microprocessors developed by Intel or AMD, which are typically used in both desktop and mobile or laptop computers, as well as the microprocessors and\/or microcontrollers, such as the ARM processor from ARM, Limited, typically used in mobile communication devices, such as cell or mobile phones.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["40","28","26","12","40","42","44","46","44","48","49"]},"The folders window  includes a plurality of optional folders, such an inbox for storing incoming messages, a contact list, a favorites contact list, a conversation list, conversation groups, and an outbox listing outgoing messages. It should be understood that the list provided above is merely exemplary. Individual folders containing a wide variety of lists and other information may be contained within the folders window .","Window  displays the active conversations the user of client communication device  is currently engaged in. In the example illustrated, the user is currently engaged in three conversations. In the first conversation, a participant named Jane Doe previously left a text message, as designated by the envelope icon, at 3:32 PM on Mar. 28, 2009. In another conversation, a participant named Sam Fairbanks is currently leaving an audio message, as indicated by the voice media bubble icon. The third conversation is entitled \u201cGroup \u201d. In this conversation, the conversation is \u201clive\u201d and a participant named Hank Jones is speaking. The user of the client communication device  may select any of the active conversations appearing in the window  for participation.","Further in this example, the user of client communication device  has selected the Group  conversation for participation. As a result, a visual indicator, such as the shading of the Group  conversation in the window  different from the other listed conversations, informs the user that he or she is actively engaged in the Group  conversation. Had the conversation with Sam Fairbanks been selected, then this conversation would have been highlighted in the window . It should be noted that the shading of the selected conversation in the window  is just one possible indicator. In various other embodiments, any indicator, either visual, audio, a combination thereof, or no indication may be used.","Within the selected conversation, a \u201cMUTE\u201d icon and an \u201cEND\u201d icon are optionally provided. The mute icon allows the user to disable the microphone  of client communication device , preventing any words spoken by the user from being included in the conversation and heard by the other participants. When the end icon is selected, the user's active participation in the Group  conversation is terminated. At this point, any other conversation in the list provided in window  may be selected. In this manner, the user may transition from conversation to conversation within the active conversation list. The user may return to the Group  conversation at anytime.","The conversation window  shows the history of the currently selected conversation, which in this example again, is the Group  conversation. In this example, a sequence of media bubbles each represent the media contributions to the conversation respectively. Each media bubble represents the media contribution of a participant to the conversation in time-sequence order. In this example, Tom Smith left an audio message that is 30 seconds long at 5:02 PM on Mar. 27, 2009. Matt Jones left an audio message 1 minute and 45 seconds in duration at 9:32 AM on Mar. 28, 2009. Tom Smith left a text message, which appears in the media bubble, at 12:00 PM on Mar. 29, 2009. By scrolling up or down through the media bubbles appearing in window , the entire history of the Group  conversation may be viewed. For example, by scrolling upward, the earlier media bubbles of the conversation may be retrieved and displayed in the window. By scrolling downward, the more recent media bubbles of the conversation may be retrieved and displayed in the window . In various embodiments, the scrolling either up or down through the history of the conversation, from the initial or first media bubble to the last or most recent, may be accomplished using a number of well known methods. For example, window scroll bars or a cursor controlled by a mouse may be used by non-touch screen displays, while an input device, such as a stylus, pen, or finger, may be used with touch-sensitive type displays.","The window  further includes a number of icons allowing the user to control his or her participation in the selected Group  conversation. A \u201cPLAY\u201d icon allows the user to render the media of a selected media bubble appearing in the window . For example, if the Tom Smith media bubble is selected, then the corresponding voice message is accessed and rendered through the speaker  on the client communication device . With media bubbles containing a text message, the text is typically displayed within the bubble. In either case, when an old message bubble is selected, the media of the conversation is being reviewed in the time-shifted mode. The \u201cTEXT\u201d and the \u201cTALK\u201d icons enable the user of the client communication device  to participate in the conversation by either typing or speaking a message respectively. The \u201cEND\u201d icon removes the user from participation in the conversation.","When another conversation is selected from the active list appearing in window , the history of the newly selected conversation appears in the conversation history window . Thus by selecting different conversations from the list in window , the user may switch participation among multiple conversations.","The media controller window  enables the user of the client communication device  to control the rendering of voice and other media of the selected conversation. The media controller window operates in two modes, the synchronous real-time mode and the asynchronous time shifted mode, and enables the seamless transition between the two modes.","When in the real-time mode, the window  includes an identifier pertaining to the incoming message, used to identify the sender of the message. In this example as illustrated, the identifier states \u201cHank Jones Speaking\u201d. A timer  showing the current running time of a live message (i.e., \u201c00.12\u201d seconds) when in the real-time mode.","The window  further includes a number of visual and control icons for reviewing the media of a message in the time-shifted mode. The media controller window may include a \u201cscrubber bar\u201d , which provides a visual indicator of the current point with respect to the duration of the message being reviewed in the time-shifted mode. Another timer  shows the time duration of a message when in the time-shifted mode. In addition, the window  includes a number of render control icons when in the time-shifted mode, including a render rate control \u201crabbit\u201d icon , a jump backward icon , a pause icon , and a jump forward icon .","In the time-shifted mode, the media of a selected message is identified within the window . For example (not illustrated), if the previous voice message from Tom Smith sent at 5:02 PM on Mar. 27, 2009, is selected, information identifying this message is displayed in the window . The scrubber bar  allows the user to quickly traverse a message from start to finish and select a point to start the rendering of the media of the message. As the position of the scrubber bar  is adjusted, the timer  is updated to reflect the time-position relative to the start time of the message. The pause icon  allows the user to pause the rendering of the media of the message. The jump backward icon  allows the user to jump back to a previous point in time of the message and begin the rendering of the message from that point forward. The jump forward icon  enables the user to skip over media to a selected point in time of the message. The rabbit icon  controls the rate at which the media of the message is rendered. The rendering rate can be either faster, slower, or at the same rendering rate the media of the message was originally encoded.","In the real-time mode, the participant creating the current message is identified in the window . In the example illustrated, the window identifies Hank Jones as speaking. As the message continues, the timer  is updated, providing a running time duration of the message. The jump backward and pause icons  and  operate as mentioned above. By jumping from the head of the conversation in the real-time mode back to a previous point using icon , the conversation may be seamlessly transitioned from the live or real-time mode to the time-shifted mode The jump forward icon  is inoperative when at the head of the message since there is no media to skip over when at the head.","The rabbit icon  may be used to implement a rendering feature referred to as Catch up To Live or \u201cCTL\u201d. This feature allows a recipient to increase the rendering rate of the media of an incoming message until the recipient catches up to the head of the conversation. For example, if the user of the client device joins an ongoing conversation, the CTL feature may be used to quickly review the previous media contributions of the unheard message or messages until catching up to the head of the conversation. At this point, the rendering of the media seamlessly merges from the time-shifted mode to the real-time mode.","It should be noted that the user interface  is merely exemplary. It is just one of many possible implementations for providing a user interface for client communication devices . It should be understood that the features and functionality as described herein may be implemented in a wide variety of different ways. Thus the specific interface illustrated herein should not be construed as limiting in any regard.","Referring to , a block diagram of the core services or functions performed by the communication application  on client communication devices  is illustrated. The core services and functions of communication application  include a Multiple Conversation Management System (MCMS) module , a Store and Stream module , and an interface  provided between the two modules. The key features and elements of the communication application  are briefly described below. For a more detailed explanation, see U.S. application Ser. Nos. 12\/028,400, 12\/253,833, 12\/192,890, and 12\/253,820 (U.S. Patent Publication No. 2009\/0168759), all incorporated by reference herein.","The MCMS module  includes a number of modules and services for creating, managing, and conducting multiple conversations. The MCMS module  includes a user interface module A for supporting the audio and video functions on the client communication device , rendering\/encoding module B for performing rendering and encoding tasks, a contacts service C for managing and maintaining information needed for creating and maintaining contact lists (e.g., telephone numbers and\/or email addresses), a presence status service D for sharing the online status of the user of the client communication device  and which indicates the online status of the other users and the MCMS data base E, which stores and manages the metadata for conversations conducted using the client communication device .","The Store and Stream module  includes a Permanent Infinite Memory Buffer or PIMB A for storing in a time-indexed format the time-based media of received and sent messages, encoder hardware B for encoding the media, such as voice, video or sensor data generated using for example the microphone , touch display , camera , or sensors on client communication device , media drivers C for driving the media generating components, such as speaker  and display  and a network interface D for connecting the client communication device  to the network , either through a wireless or wired connection.","The store and stream module  also includes modules for encode receive A, net receive B, transmit C and render D. The encode receive function A involves the receiving, encoding, time-indexing and storing in the PIMB A media created using the communication client communication device  in a time-indexed format. The net receive function involves the time-indexing and storing in the PIMB the media contained in messages received from others over the network  at client communication device . The transmit function C transmits the media of messages created on the client communication device  to other recipients over the network . The render module D enables the client communication device  to render the media of messages either synchronously in the near real-time mode or asynchronously in the time-shifted mode by retrieving media stored in the PIMB A. The modules A through D enable the Store and Stream module  to (i) progressively and simultaneously transmitting time-based media over the network  as it is being created using a client communication device  and (ii) rendering time-based media either as it is being received over the network  in the synchronous mode or from the PIMB A in a time-shifted mode.","The persistent storage of messages, regardless if they are discrete or part of a conversation, enables a number of different rendering options. For example, the rendering of media on a client communication device  may include rendering options such as play faster (i.e., the media is played faster than it was originally encoded), play slower (i.e., the media is played slower than it was originally encoded), pause, jump backward to a selected previous point in time of a message or conversation, jump to the head of a message or conversation, or Catch-up-To Live (CTL). With the CTL rendering option, the previously received media of an incoming message or messages are rendered out of the PIMB A at a rate faster than it was originally encoded. Eventually, the rendering of the media catches up to the live point of the conversation (i.e., the head of the conversation), at which point, the system seamlessly transitions from the time-shifted to the near real-time mode.","The communication application  enables a client communication device  to engage in one or more conversations. The messages of each conversation, regardless if tied together by a common attribute or not, are persistently stored in the PIMB A in a time-indexed order. When a particular message is selected for rendering, the corresponding media of the selected message is retrieved from the PIMB A and either displayed in the case of text and\/or rendered in the case of audio or video.","The transmit module C may rely on a number of real-time communication protocols. In one optional embodiment, the module C may use the Cooperative Transmission Protocol (CTP) for near real-time communication, as described in U.S. application Ser. Nos. 12\/192,890 and 12\/192,899 (U.S. Patent Publication No. 2009\/0103560), all incorporated by reference herein for all purposes. In another optional embodiment, a synchronization protocol that maintains the synchronization of time-based media between a sending and receiving client communication device , as well as any intermediate server  hops on the network , may be used. In yet another optional embodiment, the module C may use SMTP mail protocol modified to support real-time communication, as described in U.S. application Ser. No. 12\/419,861, also incorporated by reference herein for all purposes.","With the optional CTP protocol embodiment, media for transmission is ascertained as either time-sensitive or not time-sensitive, depending if the recipient of the media has the intent to review the media either synchronously (i.e., \u201clive\u201d) in the near real-time mode or asynchronously in the time-shifted mode. When network bandwidth is insufficient to transmit a full bit rate representation of time-sensitive media at a bit rate sufficient to support \u201clive\u201d communication, a reduced bit rate representation of the media is transmitted to maintain \u201clive-ness.\u201d Media that is ascertained as not time-sensitive, meaning the recipient has not indicated the intent to review the media in the real-time mode, is transmitted when bandwidth in excess of what is needed for any current time-sensitive media becomes available. When the media ascertained as not time-sensitive is transmitted, the rate of transmission is adjusted at the sending node based on network conditions. Typically, the adjusted rate of transmission for media ascertained as not time-sensitive is set for network efficiency and reliable delivery relative to the timeliness of the delivery of media ascertained as time-sensitive. In various embodiments, the intent of a recipient to review media in the real-time or time-shifted modes may be either a declared intent or inferred from the behavior of the recipient.","In addition, CTP includes provisions for making sure that a recipient eventually receives a full bit rate representation of sent media, regardless if the missing media was lost or corrupted during transmission or the recipient previously received only a reduced bit rate version of the media to support \u201clive-ness.\u201d In either case, the CTP defers retransmission of the full bit rate version of the media when the quality of the network is sufficient to support live communication. In other words, the retransmission occurs only when excess bandwidth is available. In situations where bandwidth is limited or is being used substantially for ongoing live communication, the retransmission of any missing full bit rate media may be deferred.","With the optional real-time synchronization protocol, the transmit module C maintains real-time synchronization of time-based media between client communication devices  and server(s)  over the network . See for example U.S. application Ser. Nos. 12\/253,816 and 12\/253,820, both incorporated by reference herein for all purposes, for more details.","With the optional real-time email protocols, the transmit module C may use the existing email infrastructure to support the near real-time transmission of time-based media by modifying the way the SMTP or other proprietary email protocols, such as those used by Microsoft Exchange (hereafter generically referred to as \u201cemail protocols\u201d), are used. Current email protocols do not strictly require that an entire message be available for sending before delivery is started, although this is typically how email protocols are used. Time-based media can therefore be delivered progressively, as it is being created, using standard SMTP or other proprietary email protocols.","With the real-time email embodiment, the net receive module B supports the receipt of the time-based media associated with an email as the media is received in real-time. Conventional email is typically delivered to user devices through an access protocol like POP or IMAP. These protocols do not support the progressive delivery of messages as they are arriving. However, by making simple modifications to these access protocols, a message may be progressively delivered to a recipient as the media of the message is arriving over the network. Such modifications include the removal of the current requirement that the email server know the full size of the email message before the message can be downloaded to the client communication device . By removing this restriction from network receive module B, a client communication device  may begin rendering the time-based media of an email message as the time-based media of the email message is received over the network .","In one optional embodiment, the recipient(s) of messages may be addressed using telephone numbers and Session Internet Protocol or SIP for setting up and tearing down communication sessions between client communication devices  over the network . In various other optional embodiments, the SIP protocol is used to create, modify and terminate either IP unicast or multicast sessions. The modifications may include changing addresses or ports, inviting or deleting participants, or adding or deleting media streams. As the SIP protocol and telephony over the Internet and other packet-based networks, and the interface between the VoIP and conventional telephones using the PSTN are all well known, a detailed explanation is not provided herein. In yet another embodiment, SIP can be used to set up sessions between client communication devices  using the CTP protocol described above.","An advantage of using email protocols for real-time communication as described above is that email addresses and the existing DNS infrastructure may be used for identifying the participants of a conversation or the recipients of messages, while using the existing DNS infrastructure for route discovery. As a result, real-time conversations and the delivery of messages may occur in real-time, using the existing email infrastructure and global email addressing scheme, without the need of telephone numbers, the PSTN, or the protocols needed to support VoIP calls.","Web Sites","With the Internet and World Wide Web becoming pervasive, Web sites that create or define communities are become exceedingly popular. For example, Internet users with a common interest tend to aggregate at select Web sites where they can converse and interact with others having the same interests. Social networking sites like facebook.com, online dating sites like match.com, video game sites like addictivegames.com, and other forums, such as stock trading, hobbies, etc., have all become very popular. Up to now, members of these various Web sites could communicate with each other by either email or instant messaging style interactions within the Web page. Some sites support the creation of voice and video messaging, and other sites support live voice and video communication. None, however, allow members to communication either synchronously in the real-time mode or asynchronously in the time-shifted mode or to transition communication between the two modes.","By displaying Web pages with the user interface , or variations thereof, embedded into the Web pages appearing on the display of client communication devices , users may communicate time-based media with one another in either the real-time or time-shifted modes, with the ability to seamlessly transition between those modes, within the context of the Web page. In  for example, the user interface  is shown embedded in a social networking site , an online video gaming site , an online dating site , a stock trading forum , and within a Google wave  respectively. When users of client communication devices  running the communication application  access these and similar Web sites, they may conduct conversations, including multiple media types, with other members, in either the real-time or time-shifted modes, as described in detail herein. For example, two friends on Facebook may conduct a conversation through the interface  embedded in the Facebook Web pages as they are displayed on the client communication devices . Similarly, two individuals on a dating Web site may connect and begin conversing, either live or in a time-shifted mode, using various media types, such as voice, video and\/or text. Although a number of popular Web-based communities have been mentioned herein, it should be understood that this list is not exhaustive. The number of Web sites is virtually unlimited and there are far too many Web sites to list herein. In each case, the Web content appearing within the browser running on the client communication device  is served by either server(s)  when capable of serving Web content and\/or by separate Web servers within the network .","Referring to , a diagram of a browser-enabled display on a mobile client communication device  according to the present invention is shown. In this example, the user interface  is provided within the browser-enabled display of a mobile client communication device , such as a mobile phone or radio. It should be understood that the user interface  as shown is merely exemplary and is intended to show the various features and functions as described above. In various embodiments, the functions and features as described herein may be implemented in numerous ways. In addition, the mobile client communication device  as provide may rely on any real-time communication protocol, such as those discussed herein, including CTP, a modified version of SMTP or other proprietary email protocols. Furthermore, the mobile client communication device  may rely on SIP for setting up and tearing down sessions over packet-based and non-packet based networks and\/or the existing DNS infrastructure for addressing and route discovery as described herein.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0072","num":"0071"},"figref":["FIG. 6B","FIG. 3","FIG. 6B"],"b":["12","85","85","46","12","12"]},"While the invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to specific embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that changes in the form and details of the disclosed embodiments may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention.
