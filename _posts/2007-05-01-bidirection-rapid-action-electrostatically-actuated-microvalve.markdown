title: Bi-direction rapid action electrostatically actuated microvalve
abstract: A bi-directional electrostatic microvalve includes a membrane electrode that is controlled by application of voltage to fixed electrodes disposed on either side of the membrane electrode. Dielectric insulating layers separate the electrodes. One of the fixed electrodes defines a microcavity. Microfluidic channels formed into the electrodes provide fluid to the microcavity. A central pad defined in the microcavity places a portion of the second electrode close to the membrane electrode to provide a quick actuation while the microcavity reduces film squeezing pressure of the membrane electrode. In preferred embodiment microvalves, low surface energy and low surface charge trapping coatings, such as fluorocarbon films made from cross-linked carbon di-fluoride monomers or surface monolayers made from fluorocarbon terminated silanol compounds coatings coat the electrode low bulk charge trapping dielectric layers limit charge trapping and other problems and increase device lifetime operation.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["PRIORITY CLAIM","STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This application is a Continuation-in-Part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/493,376, filed Jul. 26, 2006, now abandoned which claims priority under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7119 to Patent Application No. 60\/702,972, filed Jul. 27, 2005, the disclosures of which are expressly incorporated by reference in the entireties.","This invention was made with Government assistance under Contract No. FA8650-04-1-7121 awarded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). The Government has certain rights in this invention.","The invention concerns microfluidics. The invention provides an electrostatically actuated microvalve that can be used in a wide variety of microfluidic applications, e.g., chemical analysis, pre-concentrators, micro-total analysis system (\u03bcTAS), gas\/liquid sample injection, mixing, lab-on-a chip, micropumps and compressors, etc.","Microvalves are the subject of continuing research. Microvalves generally utilize microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) technology to control fluid flow in microfluidic systems. Microvalves have been variously used in chemical analysis, micro-total analysis system (\u03bcTAS), gas\/liquid sample injection, mixing, lab-on-a chip, micropumps and compressors, and so on.","U.S. Pat. No. 6,148,635, for example, discloses a compact active vapor compression cycle heat transfer device. The device of the '635 patent includes a flexible diaphragm serving as the compressive member in a layered compressor. The compressor is stimulated by capacitive electrical action and drives the relatively small refrigerant charge for the device that is under high pressure through a closed loop defined by the compressor, an evaporator and a condenser. The evaporator and condenser include microchannel heat exchange elements to respectively draw heat from an atmosphere on a cool side of the device and expel heat into an atmosphere on a hot side of the device. The overall structure and size of the device is similar to microelectronic packages, and it may be combined to operate with similar devices in useful arrays. The '635 patent makes use of passive microvalves, e.g., flap microvalves and active electrostatic microvalves in the heat transfer device to direct fluid flow in the closed loop in one direction. In this invention the microvalves simply hold off the fluid flow until a desired high pressure is reached and then they rapidly open. They cannot close against the higher pressures or be switched on and off at any time desired, nor can they bi-directionally route the fluid flow. The active electrostatic microvalves are used simply to hold-off the opening of the microvalve for the pressure to reach higher values. Other types of devices require active microvalves that can be arbitrarily switched in time and can reroute fluid flows.","Active microvalves include an actuator that responds to application of electrical energy, whereas passive microvalves do not. Active microvalves have an important advantage over passive microvalves, in that their fluidic resistances can be changed with respect to time and applied pressure by an applied control voltage or current. Also, an active microvalve can operate in resistance to fluid pressure. On the other hand, passive microvalves are typically smaller and are often easier to fabricate than known active microvalves. Passive microvalves can open rapidly, even as fast as microseconds. Active microvalves, however, take milliseconds or much longer to open or close, particularly if switching high pressures.","Different actuation principles have been used in active microvalves. Actuators that have been tested in active microvalves include solenoid plungers, piezoelectric actuators, electromagnetic actuators, shape memory alloys, pneumatic actuators, bimetallic actuators, and thermopneumatic actuators. The last four types can potentially switch relatively high pressures, but tend to be slow or very slow. Electrostatic actuators have also been investigated due to the ability to scale well as size shrinks and due to potentially very high switching speeds, but with less success. Comb-drive electrostatic actuators have been investigated, but occupy a significant amount of space relative to the overall size of the microvalve, particularly if actuating high pressures. In a comb-drive, the generating electrostatic force is limited due to the inverse proportionality of the force to the gap between the electrodes. Additionally, electrostatic microvalves that employ in-plane actuators, such as comb drives, are ill-suited for out-of-plane flow geometries. In-plane designs have limited applications.","Known electrostatic actuators often require relatively high applied voltages (>100 V) to generate sufficient force to open and close the microvalves against even a modest pressure (0.1 atm) since the electrostatic force is inversely proportional to the square quadratic of gap distance between electrodes, if operated in planar mode, and is proportional to electrode area over seal area if operated in comb drive mode. Known electrostatic microvalves also exhibit a binary open or closed operation, with little ability to operate at positions between fully open and fully closed to adjust flow rates for a given pressure. In addition, normally closed (or fail-closed) electrostatic microvalves have proven difficult to achieve. Typical known designs do not open against a pressure but rather act with applied pressure (i.e., the microvalve seat is pressurized acting to push the microvalve open). Such known electrostatic actuated microvalves tend to be leaky, with relatively high back flows (order of 0.1% or greater with respect to forward flows) possible.","Additionally, known electrostatically actuated MEMS microvalves typically employ silicon-based architectures, with doped silicon as the conductor and silicon oxide or nitride as the material of the seats and valves. This creates relatively hard microvalves and seats, which also have difficulty sealing at the interface and can suffer from wear during operation. Other issues with such microvalve seats include hydrogen bonded sticking (\u201cstiction\u201d) problems when humid gases or aqueous liquids are valved, which reduces the reliability of the device.","The issue of discrete flow control from open and closed states has also recently been addressed by developing electrostatic actuator arrays for more precise control of the microflow. See, Collier et al. \u201cDevelopment of a Rapid-Response Flow-Control System Using MEMS Microvalve Arrays,\u201d , Vol. 13, No. 6, December 2004, pp. 912-922. To address the issue of relatively high voltage operation of electrostatic devices used to apply high forces, touch-mode actuation has been developed in order to increase the electrostatic force without needing voltages well over 100 V.","One type of touch-mode actuation device that has been proposed uses an unmovable electrode surface shaped in a smooth curve for the other moving electrode to touch with these electrodes continuously, such that the moving electrode is pulled in on actuation. Legtenberg, et al., \u201cElectrostatic Curved Electrode Actuators,\u201d , Vol. 6, No. 3, September 1997, pp. 257-265; Li, et al, \u201cDRIE-Fabricated Curved Electrode Zipping Actuators with Low Pull-in Voltage,\u201d 03, 2003, pp. 480-483.","Touch-mode actuation generates electrostatic force between the two touching electrodes, which are separated by one or more dielectric layers that prevent electrical shorting and arcing. Achieving high force at reasonable voltage, e.g., less that 100V, requires that the gap between the electrodes be very small, since the magnitude of the electrostatic force is proportional to the square of the electric field. Minimizing the electrode gap competes with other practical difficulties, however, as exemplified by the prior research discussed in the background of this application. One such issue is dielectric breakdown. In the closed position of a touch-mode capacitance microvalve, the spacing between the electrodes is determined solely by the thickness of dielectric separating the electrodes. Ideally, the dielectric thickness would be minimal to increase the electrostatic force generated upon application of voltage to drive the electrodes away from each other. With very thin dielectric layers, e.g., less than a few microns and down to one micron, the electric field becomes too high for typical dielectric materials to sustain. For example, if 100 V is applied across 1 micron, the field is 100 V\/micron or 1 megavolt per centimeter, which is very high for typical dielectric materials to sustain. Dielectric breakdown, of course, produces device breakdown.","Another type of touch-mode actuation device that has been proposed involves attaching one and the other ends of the moving electrode to the upper electrode and lower electrode, respectively for the moving electrode to zip with one electrode and to unzip the other electrode, which makes the moving electrode s-shaped. Fluidic capacitance caused by the curved electrode, and longer traveling path of the s-shaped electrode can degrade the microvalve response time. See, Sato, et al. \u201cAn Electrostatically Actuated Gas Microvalve with an S-Shaped Film Element,\u201d . & ., Vol. 4, 1994, pp. 205-209; Shikid et al. \u201cResponse Rime Measurement of Electrostatic S-Shaped Film Actuator Related to Environmental Gas Pressure Conditions,\u201d 1996; Oberhammer, J., and G. Stemme, \u201cDesign and fabrication aspects of an S-Shaped film actuator based DC to RF MEMS switch,\u201d , Vol. 13., No. 3, June 2004, pp. 421-428. Complicated curves and shapes present considerable fabrication hurdles, however.","A normally closed flat membrane touch-mode capacitance microvalve that acts out of plane has also been investigated. See, Philpott, et al., \u201cSwitchable Electrostatic Micro-Valves with High Hold-off Pressure,\u201d 2000 -, Hilton Head Island, S.C., Jun. 4-8, 2000, p. 226-229. This type of microvalve was demonstrated to be able to hold off very high pressures (>18 atm) applied to the microvalve seat without opening or leaking, and had no measurable reverse leakage or flow. However, the microvalve was not able to close against high pressures (only on order of 1 atm or less), nor could it be opened against a reverse pressure applied to the side opposite the microvalve seat.","A rolling action electrostatically actuated microvalve has been proposed to reduce required actuation voltage. See, U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,968,862 and 6,837,476. In these devices, a diaphragm including an electrode is provided in a space between opposing walls. One of the opposing walls is curved and includes an electrode that is attached to the wall and follows its curved shape. Fluid pressure is also maintained on both side of the diaphragm to reduce the pressure differential and the required actuation voltage. In the '862 patent, the curved shape is to make the diaphragm actuate in a rolling action. This causes the diaphragm to effectively squeeze the fluid out from between the diaphragm and its touch interface with the curved electrode. The curve creates a continuous gradient in the separation distance between the diaphragm and the stationary electrode, and this results in the rolling action that reduces actuation voltage. An embodiment includes a third electrode on the other opposing wall, which has a microvalve seat and is flat. Due to the curve in the upper electrode, the third electrode is at a considerable gap from the diaphragm over a substantial region. The gap acts to increase the time needed for actuation, as well as reduces the pressures over which the microvalve can open and close or switch directions of flow.","Similarly, the touch-mode capacitance systems that use two smooth surfaces, where the diaphragm forms an \u201cS\u201d shape, are designed to make the diaphragm smoothly move from one position the next. If there is a sharp disruption, or jump, in the surface that leaves a gap, the high electrostatic contact force is lost or is greatly diminished, since the electrostatic force created by a given voltage is proportional inverse of the square of the separation distance (distance between the electrode plus dielectric thickness on the membrane). Thus, for example, doubling the distance between the electrodes by creating a gap (the gap is zero when touching, and the force is determined only by the thickness of the dielectric layers), cuts the created electrostatic force for a given voltage a factor of 4. The curves in either type of design create greater distances between the diaphragm\/membrane with electrode and the fixed electrodes that must be compensated for with voltage to achieve a given actuation force.","Another important problem with all touch-mode electrostatically actuated devices is that the high electric field within the dielectric can be high enough to cause arcing across the dielectric material over time, and that the dielectric degrades with time, rendering the device useless. In addition, even if the applied voltage is kept low enough that direct arcing failures do not occur, electrical charges can move into the bulk of the dielectric and\/or onto the surfaces at the interface of the touch-mode electrodes, which then diminish the electric field providing the actuation force, reducing both the pressure that can be switched and\/or increasing the time required for switching.","More problematic is that the charges trapped in the bulk and\/or on the surfaces can create an electrostatic sticking force that can prevent the device from working at all. The phenomena of charge trapping has been recognized in the art, but comprehensive solutions that limit the trapping of charges in thin dielectric layers that permit a small gap are lacking. Trapped charges accumulate in time, which can significantly shorten device lifetime and reliability.","Many applications would benefit from a rapid action touch mode capacitance microvalve. Some problems have been individually addressed in prior proposed microvalves, but the present inventors recognize that a need exists for high performing microvalves that operate under significant pressures.","A preferred embodiment bi-directional electrostatic microvalve of the invention includes a membrane electrode that is controlled by application of voltage to fixed electrodes disposed on either side of the membrane electrode. Dielectric insulating layers separate the electrodes. One of the fixed electrodes defines a microcavity. Microfluidic channels formed into the electrodes provide fluid to the microcavity. A central pad defined in the microcavity places a portion of the second electrode close to the membrane electrode to provide a quick actuation while the microcavity reduces film squeezing pressure of the membrane electrode.","In preferred embodiment microvalves, low surface charge trapping and low surface energy coatings coat low bulk charge trapping dielectric on the electrodes. An example preferred low surface charge trapping layer is a thin nitride layer. An example of a preferred low surface energy layer is a fluorocarbon film made from cross-linked carbon di-fluoride monomers or surface monolayers made from fluorocarbon terminated silanol compounds. Layer combinations in preferred embodiments limit charge trapping and other problems and increase device lifetime operation.","A preferred embodiment bi-directional electrostatic microvalve of the invention includes a membrane electrode that is controlled by application of voltage to fixed electrodes disposed on either side of the membrane electrode.

In preferred embodiments, thin silicon nitride coatings provide low surface charge trapping dielectric. For low surface energy, fluorocarbon films made from cross-linked carbon di-fluoride monomers or surface monolayers made from fluorocarbon terminated silanol compounds coatings can be used. Layer combinations in preferred embodiments limit charge trapping and other problems and increase device lifetime operation.","In preferred embodiments, the closed position of the microvalve is defined by a non-deformed state of the membrane electrode, which in that position, seats against one of the fixed electrodes to seal an inlet and outlet defined in the fixed electrode. This position may be assisted by fluid pressure on an opposite side of the membrane electrode. The membrane is deformed by attraction to a fixed electrode and\/or repulsion from the other fixed electrode. The fixed electrode that defines a microcavity includes a central pad disposed between inlet and outlet ports. The central pad reduces the gap to the membrane electrode, while allowing the membrane to deform sufficiently into the other parts of the microcavity defined by the lower electrode to permit a predetermined amount of fluid flow. The space in the microcavity around the central pad accommodates portions of the membrane electrode, providing a large space for fluid to flow from the inlet to the outlet when the microvalve is in the open position. Depending upon the level of voltage applied, the microvalve can be fully open into the surrounding space, to a fully open position or at any number of intermediate positions between fully open and fully closed. The membrane electrode can be moved back to the fully closed position by application of voltages to the electrodes and can close against substantial fluid pressure.","A preferred embodiment bi-directional electrostatic microvalve utilizes touch-mode capacitance actuation for the initial and final positions for opening and closing the microvalve, and is constructed of three electrodes. Intermediate positions employ capacitive action across a gap without any rolling action touch-mode actuation. A middle electrode is a flexible movable membrane that contains an imbedded electrode. Another electrode is a closing electrode that includes transverse fluid ports against which the membrane seats and seals. A third electrode is a fixed opening electrode used to provide an opening force to attract the membrane away from the microvalve seat to allow fluid flow between the transverse ports. The third electrode also defines a microcavity. The third (opening) electrode includes a central pad to increase the electrostatic force by decreasing the gap between part of the membrane electrode and the opening electrode, permitting the membrane to deform sufficiently into the other parts of the microcavity defined by the third (opening) electrode to permit a predetermined amount of fluid flow. Preferably, fluid pressure is used to assist microvalve switching time and handling pressure. The membrane, opening and closing electrodes are controlled separately for bi-directional operation.","A microvalve of the invention can exhibit important operational advantages, including high speed operation. A microvalve of the invention can change states in tens of microseconds or less. Example switching times of 50 microseconds and less to open and close, respectively, over different pressures (exceeding 1 atm) have been demonstrated with prototypes. Faster switching times are possible, as is operation at higher pressures. Power consumption can be very small compared to most other active microvalves.","In preferred embodiments of the invention, power is consumed only during activation (opening or closing). Relative fluid pressures and\/or physical resilience of the membrane electrode can maintain the membrane in the position set by the open or close operation. Only a very small leakage current occurs at steady state (low duty cycles) and energy recovery (\u02dc80%) with an inductor can be used for high duty cycles.","Preferred embodiment microvalves of the invention are able to open and close against a high pressure, either on the microvalve seat or opposite side, with a very fast time response, while still taking advantage of low to no leakage current touch-mode operation with extremely low power consumption. Preferred embodiment microvalves of the invention can also be sized for a variety of fluid flows, liquid or gaseous, and can be arrayed to gain relatively high fluid flow control. A microvalve in accordance with the invention can be designed to be normally open or closed, with failure in either of those two states. If the balance pressure is much lower than the inlet pressure, then the microvalve fails open if no voltage is applied to keep the device closed. If the balance pressure is much higher than the inlet, or if the tension in the membrane electrode is made to be high (providing a closing spring-type force), then the microvalve will remain closed with no voltage applied to either electrode.","The invention addresses requirements for many applications, e.g., chemical analysis, micro-total analysis system (\u03bcTAS), gas\/liquid sample injection, mixing, lab-on-a chip, micropumps and compressors, and so on. Embodiments of the invention provide for actively and rapidly switching on and off fluid flows, or rerouting flows in two or more directions. Microvalves of the invention can handle fluids that are under high pressures typically only operated with passive microvalves in past devices. Embodiments of the invention accomplish switching under significant pressures with electrical actuation at low voltages and power consumption.","Example embodiments will now be discussed with respect to the drawings. Some of the drawing figures are presented schematically, but will be understood by artisans. The actuation electrodes may be referred to as an upper electrode and a lower electrode while no particular disposition is indicated by \u201cupper\u201d and \u201clower\u201d as the upper and lower electrodes may be disposed to the right and left of the membrane electrode if the microvalve is situated such that the membrane electrode is disposed vertically as opposed as horizontally as used in the drawings for convenience of illustration. Artisans will also understand inventive features from the discussion of the example embodiments.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":["FIG. 1A","FIG. 1A"],"b":["10","12","14","16","18","10","12","14","16","18"]},"The upper fixed electrode  defines transverse fluid ports including an inlet  and an outlet  with microfluidic channels leading to and from the ports. The membrane electrode  seats against the inlet  and outlet . While a single inlet and outlet are illustrated in the upper fixed electrode , that electrode can include multiple inlets and outlets, which can be controlled by the membrane electrode . The lower fixed electrode  defines a microcavity  to accommodate deformation of the membrane electrode . A pressure balance port  is in the lower fixed electrode . A central pad  reduces a gap between a portion of the lower fixed electrode  and the membrane electrode . The central pad  is aligned between the inlet  and outlet . It is aligned with the central portion of the membrane electrode  as it is most readily pulled away from its seated position. The central portion of the membrane electrode  is the least resilient portion as it is farthest from fixed ends of the membrane electrode . Also, fluid pressure from the inlet  is nearby. The central pad  reduces the gap but also allows the membrane electrode to deform sufficiently into the microcavity  for fluid flow.","While a single microvalve is illustrated, microvalves can be arranged in series or other networks.  shows a preferred embodiment microvalve that has a normally closed position, which will also fail in the closed position. The flow of fluid will travel from the inlet  to the outlet . The membrane electrode  will be attracted to the upper or lower fixed electrode , or  depending on which side has a voltage potential applied between the membrane electrode  and the upper or lower fixed electrode , . The upper fixed electrode  normally touches the membrane electrode , blocking flow from the inlet  to the outlet . Fluid pressure from the pressure balance port  assists this position and is preferably sufficient to maintain the closed position in the absence of applied voltage. When a potential, V, is applied to the membrane electrode  with respect to the upper fixed electrode , an electrostatic force attracts the membrane electrode to the upper fixed electrode , and the membrane electrode  will seat tightly and can hold-off very large forward pressures at the inlet  (up to more than 20 atm or higher depending on the area of the inlet  vs. the surrounding membrane electrode area). When the voltage is equalized between the membrane electrode  and the upper fixed electrode , and a potential, V, is applied to the lower fixed electrode  with respect to the membrane electrode, an electrostatic force pulls the membrane electrode  away from the upper fixed electrode  towards the lower fixed electrode .","The lower fixed electrode  has the central pad  disposed centrally in the microcavity . The pad  is much closer (about 10 microns or less versus about 100 microns for the microcavity  in a preferred embodiment) to the membrane electrode  than the remaining portions of lower fixed electrode  that define the microcavity . From the closed position, the central pad  generates much stronger force (up to the order of 100 times stronger) on the central portion of the membrane electrode  than the remaining portions lower electrode  do because of the increased force caused by the decreased gap. The stronger force pops the membrane electrode  off the upper electrode , creating a faster response for fluid to flow between the inlet and the outlet ports , . The larger volume beneath the membrane electrode  in the lower electrode microcavity  between the central pad  and edge of the lower electrode microcavity  allows the fluid to flow more easily, and reduces the squeeze film damping that occurs between the membrane electrode  and lower electrode .","The size of the central pad  also determines how much pressure the lower electrode microcavity  can have with respect to the inlet  and outlet  in order to open and close quickly. In general, the larger the central pad , the faster the opening time for a given applied voltage, gap distance, and pressure at the pressure balancing . However, for the same conditions, the closing time will slow with increasing central pad size. Preferably, the central pad  and microcavity  are sized to produce comparable fast open and close times.","The depth of the microcavity  into which portions of the membrane electrode move is also determined in part by the flow rate of the fluid moving through the device. Making the microcavity  surrounding the central pad  deeper than the gap between the membrane electrode  and the central pad  creates a larger cross-sectional area for fluid to flow between the inlet and outlet, than that permitted by the distance to the central pad  itself. This feature prevents excessive pressure drop across the device, and permits variable flows to be controlled by adjusting the voltage. Higher voltages will pull the membrane electrode  further into the microcavity  by capacitive action without touch-mode actuation, creating a larger cross-sectional area and thus a lower pressure drop. However, if the depth of the microcavity  creates a much larger cross-sectional area than that of the inlet and outlet ports, the benefit of further increases diminishes. In addition, a greater depth requires a higher voltage to pull the membrane electrode  into the microcavity , requiring higher voltages to adjust the flow rates. Therefore, microcavity depths much more than 500 microns have little practical use for microscale fluid flows.","The upper fixed electrode , membrane electrode  and lower fixed electrode  have substantially flat surfaces and are preferably semi-conductor fabricated layers. The lack of curves and complicated shapes permits the use of semiconductor materials and semiconductor fabrication techniques.

These voltages vary as a function of the dielectric thickness, the tension in the membrane electrode , and the composition of coatings on the dielectric , . Voltage rises rapidly as the gap increases. High voltages are a difficulty because they create a large electric field when the microvalve opens and the membrane electrode  touches the central pad . With a gap of about 250 microns, the electric field exceeds the breakdown voltage of most polymers. As a practical matter, the electric field should be below 200 V\/micron and preferably below 50 V\/micron to prevent long-term degradation of the membrane. That limits the distance to be below about 150 microns and preferably below about 25 microns.

The flat surfaces are readily fabricated by conventional semiconductor microfabrication techniques, without resort to machining steps. Machining steps, such as those required for curved or arched surfaces increase the lowest possible size limit and do not readily translate to mass fabrication techniques.","Additionally, low surface charge trapping and low surface energy coatings are readily added during semiconductor fabrication techniques. Low surface charge trapping and low surface energy coatings are preferably added to all of the electrodes, as have been described. These types of coatings also inhibit the accumulation of water on the surfaces and within the bulk of the dielectric layers, which can act to decrease lifetime and reliability.","The time response of the microvalve is determined by the specific application, in particular which are much more important factors in gas chromatograph injector microvalve, chemical analysis, and etc. The important factors can be injector pressure (which depends on the pressure across the microvalve), flow rate (which depends on both the pressure across the microvalve, the microvalve orifice size, the membrane electrode  thickness and size), and the lower electrode microcavity  size, and the voltage across the membrane electrode  and current that is carried through the microvalve (which depends on the applied voltage, the capacitance and resistance of the microvalve and circuit). Pressure from the pressure balance port  also factors into response time. The balance pressure is added to balance pressure on both sides of the membrane electrode , thereby decreasing the net pressure across the membrane electrode  to increase both the pressure the microvalve can handle and speed of opening and closing. The pressure can be adjusted to be different on both sides of the membrane electrode  to apply a pneumatic actuation in addition to the electrostatic force, to control open and closing times, as well as to determine if the device fails open or closed.","This allows, for example, the pneumatic action across the microvalve to be adjusted as desired to create faster opening microvalves (by reducing the pressure in the pressure balancing port  on the lower electrode side) or faster closing microvalves with lower leakage of fluid from the inlet  to the outlet  (by increasing the pressure at the pressure balance port  on the lower electrode side). For the  embodiment, even when the pressure is initially equal on both sides of the membrane when the microvalve is closed, once fluid starts flowing from the inlet  to the outlet , the pressure acting on the upper side of the membrane electrode  will decrease due to the Bernoulli principle and the pressure at the pressure balance port  will be higher than at the inlet , acting to help close the microvalve. By providing a second pressure balance port  in the lower electrode microcavity  and allowing fluid to flow out of the pressure balance port , the pressure can be adjusted to be higher or lower than at the inlet . A regulator and\/or orifice can also be added to either the inlet , outlet , or at the pressure balance port  to adjust the pneumatic actuation to the value desired for other embodiments of this invention.","Example devices have been fabricated. The fabrication and testing of example devices will now be discussed. Artisans will understand additional features from the discussion.","An experimental device consistent with  has been fabricated using Deep Reactive Ion Etching (DRIE) of silicon wafers to open up fluid ports (inlet, outlet, and fluid channels at the ports), and to create the lower electrode microcavity  and central pad . The silicon wafer is subsequently selectively doped to create conductive surfaces within the silicon for the upper and lower electrodes. Next a film is grown on the silicon to prevent charge injection from the silicon to the membrane to prevent slow degradation of the membrane due to charge buildup. First a 1.5 micron thick thermal silicon oxide is grown over the entire wafer. Next a 1 nm thick silicon nitride layer is added. Then a low power plasma containing CFis used to create a 0.1 to 10 nm thick film containing CFmonomers that are reacted to create a [CF], or CF, composition. Regions are patterned and opened through the thermal oxide insulator and metal applied to create Ohmic contacts through which the electrostatic potentials V and V can be applied and through which electric current can flow.","Those skilled in the state of the art will note that dielectric materials other than silicon oxide and silicon nitride can be used for respective low bulk charge trapping and low surface charge trapping dielectric layers. Additionally, fluorinated materials other than CFcan be used for low surface area contact layers. For the low surface energy layers, a film containing heptadecafluoro-1,1,2,2-tetrahydrodecyl groups, made from heptadecafluoro-1,1,2,2-tetrahydrodecyl trichlorosilane (FDTS) can also be used. The layer thickness must be at least 1 nm thick to avoid excessive wear and can be up to 100 nm thick for CFfor extended life. Layer thickness of CFless than 10 nm fail more rapidly. The voltage necessary to operate the device rises quickly when the total thickness of the dielectric and coating layers is more than 5 microns thick and reaches unusable levels when the layers thickness is greater than 10 microns. Total layer thicknesses below 0.1 microns have higher failure rates. Total layer thicknesses below 0.05 microns fail even more often. In a preferred embodiments, total layer thicknesses are between 0.2 and 3 microns, and most preferably about 1.5 microns.","It is also important for the layer to repel water. Water, which is present in many fluids such as air, leads to increase in stiction and surface charge trapping, which in turn increases the voltage needed to actuate the device. The CFand heptadecafluoro-1,1,2,2-tetrahydrodecyl in the layers above also prevent undue water from being adsorbed on the layer, where we define the accumulation of undue water as that sufficient to raise the voltage to open the device by 5 volts.","The membrane in the experimental device was fabricated using a polyimide polymer that is spun on and cured in a low pressure environment absent of any water vapor, which we define as a vacuum cure, on a separate glass carrier plate. The vacuum curing is found to substantially enhance breakdown voltage. The preferred temperature of the curing of polyimide is from a low of 350\u00b0 C. and a high of 450\u00b0 C. The membrane needs to be at least 0.1 microns thick to avoid premature failure. Membranes thicker than about 20 microns are typically too stiff for the preferred embodiment of a microvalve. Larger devices can utilize thicker membranes. Preferred dimensions are between 1 and 3 microns thick. The polyimide polymer is metallized with thin layers of chrome, gold, and then chrome, which are then patterned to provide an electrically conductive layer within the membrane. A second polyimide polymer layer is spun on and vacuum cured over the metal layer. Holes are patterned with photoresist and etched using oxygen plasma to open up electrical contacts to the metal layer within the stack. The oxygen etches down and stops on the upper chrome layer, which is subsequently removed using a commercially available chrome etchant, exposing the gold layer to allow electrical contact. The polymer\/metal\/polymer sandwich stack is then transferred, aligned, bonded, and released to one of the silicon layers using an adhesive layer that is applied to the silicon via contact printing.","The bonding of the layers together enables higher pressures to be switched, since without the adhesive bonding, leakage from the inlet to the outlet, as well to the outside environment, can occur more easily. The adhesive layer used in the preferred embodiment is an epoxy adhesive made from a mixture of Dow Corning solid epoxy novalac-modified resin with curing agent in a 2.5:1 mass ratio, and various solvents (2-methoxyethanol 15 to 50% by mass range, anisole 15 to 50% by mass range, and PGMEA 0 to 10% by mass range, the exact amounts depend upon the adhesive layer thickness desired). Most often, the solvents are selected to modify the viscosity of the adhesive in order to achieve a thickness of 1 \u03bcm via spin coating and to achieve sharp interfaces. For a complete description of the spin coating process, see Flachsbart, B. R., K. Wong, J. M. Iannacone, E. N. Abante, R. L. Vlach, P. A. Rauchfuss, P. W. Bohn, J. V. Sweedler, and M. A. Shannon, \u201cDesign and fabrication of a multilayered polymer microfluidic chip with nanofluidic interconnects via adhesive contact printing,\u201d ---6, 667-674, 2006. Other adhesives can be used, including those made from biphenol compounds, which cure at a higher temperature and demonstrate higher bond strengths. The key issues of the adhesive layer are that: (1) it is thin (less than 20 microns and preferably in a range of 0.1 to 3 microns and more preferably in the range of 0.2 to 0.4 microns), (2) it bonds the interfaces together to enable the device to sustain high pressures, (3) it is aligned and contact printed on the microvalve interfaces and the membrane electrode is free to move from the first to second said electrodes, and (4) so that the low surface energy and low surface charge trapping coatings are not affected by the adhesive layer.","In preferred microvalve fabrication methods, adhesive is applied by contact printing. Preferred steps for contact printing include first coating a temporary carrier with adhesive (e.g., a PDMS (Polydimethylsiloxane) stamp). The adhesive is then pressed onto the fixed electrodes ( or ) be bonded with the membrane electrode and is cured under pressure with heat. Preferably, the adhesive is applied first to the first fixed electrode  (by pressing the compliant PDMS stamp that has the adhesive spun onto it), and then the Membrane assembly is pressed onto the first fixed electrode and is cured under pressure and heat. Then the adhesive is applied to the PDMS stamp again, and it is pressed onto the second fixed electrode . The second electrode  is then pressed onto the first electrode  and membrane electrode  and is cured.","During the process, the adhesive is contact printed only onto the areas of the fixed electrodes  and  that have been patterned to lack a low surface energy film coating. Solvents may be used to modify the viscosity of the adhesive in order to achieve a thickness of preferably less than 10 \u03bcm, and most preferably about 1 \u03bcm via spin-coating and to achieve sharp interfaces between the those areas printed with the adhesive, and those areas without adhesive. In other embodiments, the adhesive can be applied to the membrane electrode .","The adhesive preferably bonds the layers by covalent bonding, or by being physically keyed into the layer (for example, by the adhesive flowing into a pore having an opening smaller than the interior, prior to curing). Since the layers are held on the carrier plate by non-covalent forces, for example by hydrogen bonding, they can be released from the carrier plate without affecting the adhesive. The adhesive preferably forms a solid resin, such as a bisphenol-A based resin adhesive. Examples include DER 642U, DER 662, DER 663U, DER 664U, DER 665U, DER 667 and DER 672U, all from Dow Corning. These adhesives use a hardener, such as DEH 82, DEH 84, DEH 85 and DEH 87, all from Dow Corning. The adhesive may also be an epoxy adhesive mixture of solid epoxy novalacmodified resin with curing agent in a 2.5:1 mass ratio. Solvent may be added to the adhesive to control the viscosity, for example 2-methoxyethanol (15 to 50% by mass), anisole (15 to 50% by mass), and PGMEA (0 to 10% by mass) range. The bonding of the layers may be carried out by heating to cure the adhesive, for example at 130\u00b0 C. and 5.2 MPa of applied pressure under vacuum for 10 minutes. The temporary adhesive carrier is an elastic polymer, such as a 3 mm thick 50 mm diameter PDMS disk; the carrier plate may be released from the layer by using a hot water bath at approximately 50\u00b0 C. for 5 minutes. The adhesive may be given a final cure, for example by heating the completed device for 12 hours at 130\u00b0 C.","Those skilled in the state of the art recognize that many other flexible polymers could be used including parylene, Teflon\u00ae, Nafion\u00ae, Viton\u00ae, polyester, polybutylene, PDMS, and other dielectric polymers with reasonable electrical breakdown strength.","The other silicon half is bonded to the membrane using the same process.
