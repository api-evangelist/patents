title: Multi-hull surface vessel with drag reduction on lateral hulls
abstract: A marine surface vessel having a main hull and at least two lateral hulls disposed respectively on opposite sides of the main hull. The vessel includes an engine disposed in the main hull producing exhaust gas and cooling air, microbubble injectors disposed in subsurface areas of each of the lateral hulls, and conduits in fluid communication with the microbubble injectors. Upon operation of the engine, the exhaust and/or cooling air produced by the engine is directed by the conduits to the injectors to effect generation of microbubbles on the subsurface areas of the lateral hulls to occasion microbubble drag reduction on the lateral hulls.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for Governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.","(1) Field of the Invention","The invention relates to reduction of drag, and its attendant advantages for marine surface vessels, and is directed more particularly to the reduction of drag caused by additional hulls in multi-hull vessels, such as trimarans and pentamarans.","(2) Description of the Prior Art","Multi-hull surface vessels, such as trimarans and pentamarans, are used for civilian and military applications. A multi-hull design provides the advantages of vessel stability at high speeds and increased deck space. In a typical trimaran, the multi-hulls or lateral hulls are substantially smaller than the main hull and have a substantially smaller subsurface area.","While a multi-hull vessel offers the advantages set forth above, the presence of a plurality of hulls increases the drag forces of the vessel, thereby requiring more power to gain the high speeds desired.","The theoretical advantages of encompassing a hull with microbubbles to reduce drag are known and have been realized in laboratories with model ships operating at modest speeds. However, the use of microbubbles with full-sized vessels has generally been unsuccessful because the air\/gas flow required for encompassing the sides of full-sized hulls is too large. A large air\/gas flow requires large air\/gas compressors, or the like. Further, the presence of microbubbles reduces the effectiveness of exterior propulsion units, such as the vessel's propellers.","As such, there is a need to eliminate the increased drag of a multi-hull vessel, preferably through efficient microbubble generation, so that the advantages of such vessels may be exploited to a greater degree.","Accordingly, it is a general purpose and primary object of the present invention to provide a multi-hull vessel in which the drag of the lateral hulls of the vessel is reduced, thereby reducing the overall drag of the vessel.","It is a further object of the present invention to accomplish drag reduction of the lateral hulls by utilization of microbubbles without a need for compressors on board, and without affecting propeller efficiency.","With the above and other objects in view, as will hereinafter appear, there is provided a marine surface vessel having a main hull and at least two lateral hulls disposed respectively on opposite sides of the main hull. The vessel is provided with a gas turbine engine disposed in the main hull and adapted in operation to drive the propellers and, in addition, to produce exhaust gas and cooling air, microbubble injectors disposed in subsurface areas of each of the lateral hulls, and conduits placing at least one of the exhaust gas and cooling air discharges in communication with the microbubble injectors. During operation of the gas turbine engine, the gas turbine exhaust and\/or cooling air is directed by the conduits to the microbubble injectors to effect generation of microbubbles on the subsurface areas of the lateral hulls to occasion microbubble drag reduction on the lateral hulls.","The above and other features of the invention, including various novel details of construction and combinations of parts, will now be more particularly described with reference to the accompanying drawings and pointed out in the claims. It will be understood that the particular device embodying the invention is shown by way of illustration only and not as a limitation of the invention. The principles and features of this invention may be employed in various and numerous embodiments without departing from the scope of the invention.","It has been found that the application of microbubble drag reduction is rendered attractive in multi-hull vessels in view of the underwater area of lateral hulls, that is, the hulls outboard of the main hull. A microbubble system used only on lateral hulls, which are not provided with propellers, avoids the issues associated with the negative impact of microbubble systems on the performance of propulsion propellers.","It will be apparent that the above description pertaining to a trimaran vessel applies equally to a pentamaran vessel, or other multi-hull type of surface vessel.","Referring now to  wherein like numerals refer to like elements throughout the several views, it will be seen that a traditional trimaran  is provided with a main hull  on which is mounted at least one propulsion propeller , and outboard of the main hull a first lateral hull  to port of the main hull , and a second lateral hull  to starboard of the main hull . An athwartship extending deck structure  is supported by all three hulls , , .","The vessel  is powered by a gas turbine engine  which produces exhaust gas and cooling gas through discharge lines ; however alternative gas-producing power generators may be used in lieu of the gas turbine engine .","The discharge lines  convey gas to distribution lines , each of which extends to a microbubble injector  located in an outside area but preferably a subsurface area  of one of the lateral hulls , . The subsurface area  is defined as the area of the lateral hulls  normally under the surface of the water.","The microbubble injectors  typically are strips or plates of porous material, typically in the range of 40%\u201350% open area defined by holes in the range of 1\/16 to  inch. The plates preferably are disposed every twenty feet, or so, along the subsurface area of the lateral hulls. The microbubble injectors  may extend completely around the bottom of the lateral hulls  and , as shown in .","The microbubbles are generated by either, or both, of the gas turbine exhaust gas and cooling air, both of which are otherwise vented to the atmosphere and\/or underwater.","Surface effect ships (SES) are surface vessels provided with an air cushion capability. Such ships ride on an air cushion, at least in part. Such vessels, in operation, experience relatively low surface area in contact with the water. Thus, a multi-hull SES presents even less of a subsurface area than a regular multi-hull vessel.","To improve performance in either an SES or non-SES type vessel, a non-wetting hull coating (teflon, silicon, or the like) may be applied to the surface areas of the hull of the SES.","There is thus provided a multi-hull vessel in which the drag of the lateral hulls is reduced, thereby reducing the overall drag of the vessel, and permitting increased speed and reduced fuel requirements. The drag reduction is accomplished without affecting the efficiency of the propulsion propellers mounted on the main hull.","It will be understood that many additional changes in the details, materials, steps and arrangement of parts, which have been herein described and illustrated in order to explain the nature of the invention, may be made by those skilled in the art within the principles and scope of the invention as expressed in the appended claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["Reference is made to the accompanying drawings in which is shown an illustrative embodiment of the invention, from which its novel features and advantages will be apparent, wherein corresponding reference characters indicate corresponding parts throughout the several views of the drawings and wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["2","2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"],"b":["3","3"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
