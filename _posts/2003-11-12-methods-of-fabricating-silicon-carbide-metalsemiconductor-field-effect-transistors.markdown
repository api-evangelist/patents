title: Methods of fabricating silicon carbide metal-semiconductor field effect transistors
abstract: SiC MESFETs are disclosed which utilize a semi-insulating SiC substrate which substantially free of deep-level dopants. Utilization of the semi-insulating substrate may reduce back-gating effects in the MESFETs. Also provided are SiC MESFETs with a two recess gate structure. MESFETS with a selectively doped p-type buffer layer are also provided. Utilization of such a buffer layer may reduce output conductance by a factor of 3 and produce a 3 db increase in power gain over SiC MESFETs with conventional p-type buffer layers. A ground contact may also be provided to the p-type buffer layer and the p-type buffer layer may be made of two p-type layers with the layer formed on the substrate having a higher dopant concentration. SiC MESFETs according to embodiments of the present invention may also utilize chromium as a Schottky gate material. Furthermore, an oxide-nitride-oxide (ONO) passivation layer may be utilized to reduce surface effects in SiC MESFETs. Also, source and drain ohmic contacts may be formed directly on the n-type channel layer, thus, the n regions need not be fabricated and the steps associated with such fabrication may be eliminated from the fabrication process. Methods of fabricating such SiC MESFETs and gate structures for SiC FETs as well as passivation layers are also disclosed.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATION","STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present application is a divisional of and claims priority from U. S. application Ser. No. 09\/567,717, filed May 10, 2000, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,686,616 entitled \u201cSILICON CARBIDE METAL-SEMICONDUCTOR FIELD EFFECT TRANSISTORS,\u201d which is assigned to the assignee of the present application, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein as if set forth fully.","The present invention was made with Government support under contract number N00014-96-C-2152 awarded by the United States Office of Naval Research. The Government has certain rights in this invention.","The present invention relates microelectronic devices and more particularly to metal-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MESFETs) formed in silicon carbide.","Electrical circuits requiring high power handling capability (>20 watts) while operating at high frequencies such as radio frequencies (500 MHz), S-band (3 GHz) and X-band (10 GHz) have in recent years become more prevalent. Because of the increase in high power, high frequency circuits there has been a corresponding increase in demand for transistors which are capable of reliably operating at radio frequencies and above while still being capable of handling higher power loads. Previously, bipolar transistors and power metal-oxide semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs) have been used for high power applications but the power handling capability of such devices may be limited at higher operating frequencies. Junction field-effect transistors (JFETs) were commonly used for high frequency applications but the power handling capability of previously known JFETs also may be limited.","Recently, metal-semiconductor field effect transistors (MESFETs) have been developed for high frequency applications. The MESFET construction may be preferable for high frequency applications because only majority carriers carry current. The MESFET design may be preferred over current MOSFET designs because the reduced gate capacitance permits faster switching times of the gate input. Therefore, although all field-effect transistors utilize only majority carriers to carry current, the Schottky gate structure of the MESFET may make the MESFET more desirable for high frequency applications.","In addition to the type of structure\u2014and perhaps more fundamentally\u2014the characteristics of the semiconductor material from which a transistor is formed also affects the operating parameters. Of the characteristics which affect a transistor's operating parameters, the electron mobility, saturated electron drift velocity, electric breakdown field and thermal conductivity may have the greatest effect on a transistor's high frequency and high power characteristics.","Electron mobility is the measurement of how rapidly an electron is accelerated to its saturated velocity in the presence of an electric field. In the past, semiconductor materials which have a high electron mobility were preferred because more current could be developed with a lesser field, resulting in faster response times when a field is applied. Saturated electron drift velocity is the maximum velocity which an electron can obtain in the semiconductor material. Materials with higher saturated electron drift velocities are preferred for high frequency applications because the higher velocity translates to shorter times from source to drain.","Electric breakdown field is the field strength at which breakdown of the Schottky junction and the current through the gate of the device suddenly increases. A high electric breakdown field material is preferred for high power, high frequency transistors because larger electric fields generally can be supported by a given dimension of material. Larger electric fields allow for faster transients as the electrons can be accelerated more quickly by larger electric fields than by smaller.","Thermal conductivity is the ability of the semiconductor material to dissipate heat. In typical operations, all transistors generate heat. In turn, high power and high frequency transistors usually generate larger amounts of heat than small signal transistors. As the temperature of the semiconductor material increases, the junction leakage currents generally increase and the current through the field effect transistor generally decreases due to a decrease in carrier mobility with an increase in temperature. Therefore, if the heat is dissipated from the semiconductor, the material will remain at a lower temperature and be capable of carrying larger currents with lower leakage currents.","In the past, most high frequency MESFETs have been manufactured of n-type III\u2013V compounds, such as gallium arsenide (GaAs) because of their high electron mobilities. Although these devices provided increased operating frequencies and moderately increased power handling capability, the relatively low breakdown voltage and the lower thermal conductivity of these materials have limited their usefulness in high power applications.","Silicon carbide (SiC) has been known for many years to have excellent physical and electronic properties which should theoretically allow production of electronic devices that can operate at higher temperatures, higher power and higher frequency than devices produced from silicon (Si) or GaAs. The high electric breakdown field of about 4\u00d710V\/cm, high saturated electron drift velocity of about 2.0\u00d710cm\/sec and high thermal conductivity of about 4.9 W\/cm\u2212\u00b0 K indicate that SiC would be suitable for high frequency, high power applications. Unfortunately, difficulty in manufacturing has limited the usefulness of SiC for high power and high frequency applications.","Recently, MESFETs having channel layers of silicon carbide have been produced on silicon substrates (see U.S. Pat. No. 4,762,806 to Suzuki et al and U.S. Pat. No. 4,757,028 to Kondoh et al). Because the semiconductor layers of a MESFET are epitaxial, the layer upon which each epitaxial layer is grown affects the characteristics of the device. Thus, a SiC epitaxial layer grown on a Si substrate generally has different electrical and thermal characteristics then a SiC epitaxial layer grown on a different substrate. Although the SiC on Si substrate devices described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,762,806 and 4,757,028 may have exhibited improved thermal characteristics, the use of a Si substrate generally limits the ability of such devices to dissipate heat. Furthermore, the growth of SiC on Si generally results in defects in the epitaxial layers which result in high leakage current when the device is in operation.","Other MESFETs have been developed using SiC substrates. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 07\/540,488 filed Jun. 19, 1990 and now abandoned, the disclosure of which is incorporated entirely herein by reference, describes a SiC MESFET having epitaxial layers of SiC grown on a SiC substrate. These devices exhibited improved thermal characteristics over previous devices because of the improved crystal quality of the epitaxial layers grown on SiC substrates. However, to obtain high power and high frequency it may be necessary to overcome the limitations of SiC's lower electron mobility.","Similarly, commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 5,270,554 to co-inventor Palmour describes a SiC MESFET having source and drain contacts formed on n regions of SiC and an optional lightly doped epitaxial layer between the substrate and the n-type layer in which the channel is formed. U.S. Pat. No. 5,925,895 to Sriram et al. also describes a SiC MESFET and a structure which is described as overcoming \u201csurface effects\u201d which may reduce the performance of the MESFET for high frequency operation. Sriram et al. also describes SiC MESFETs which use n source and drain contact regions as well as a p-type buffer layer. However, despite the performance reported in these patents, further improvements may be made in SiC MESFETs.","Embodiments of the present invention may provide SiC MESFETs formed on a semi-insulating substrate of SiC where the SiC substrate is substantially free of deep level dopants. Forming SiC MESFETs on such semi-insulating substrates may improve performance by reducing back-gating effects which may result from the presence of deep level dopants in the substrate. Buffer layers of p-type, n-type or undoped SiC may be utilized with such semi-insulating SiC substrates in the formation of MESFETs according to embodiments of the present invention.","In additional embodiments of the present invention, a two recess gate structure may be utilized where a cap layer of n-type SiC is formed on an n-type SiC channel layer. A recess is formed in the cap layer and a second recess is formed in the n-type channel layer by forming the second recess in the recess in the cap layer. The Schottky gate contact may then be formed in the second recess.","Further embodiments of the present invention may be provided by SiC MESFETs which utilize a selectively doped p-type buffer layer, where the p-type buffer layer has a carrier concentration of from about 1\u00d710to about 1\u00d710cmand more preferably from about 3 to about 5\u00d710cm. Utilization of such a buffer layer has unexpectedly been found to reduce output conductance by a factor of 3 and produce a 3 db increase in power gain over SiC MESFETs with conventional p-type buffer layers.","SiC MESFETs according to embodiments of the present invention may also utilize chromium as a Schottky gate material. Furthermore, an oxide-nitride-oxide (ONO) passivation layer may be utilized to reduce surface effects in SiC MESFETs. Also, source and drain ohmic contacts may be formed directly on the n-type channel layer, thus, the n regions need not be fabricated and the steps associated with such fabrication may be eliminated from the fabrication process.","Additionally, if a p-type buffer layer is utilized, a contact may be formed to the p-type buffer layer so as to allow grounding of the p-type buffer layer. The contact may be formed on a p well region formed in the p-type buffer layer. Optionally, the p-type buffer layer may be formed by two p-type layers where the first layer formed on the substrate has a higher doping level than the second layer which is formed on the first p-type layer.","Particular embodiments of the present invention may provide a high power, high frequency, metal-semiconductor field-effect transistor having a bulk single crystal silicon carbide substrate and an n-type epitaxial layer of n-type conductivity silicon carbide on the substrate. A p-type epitaxial layer of selectively doped p-type conductivity silicon carbide is provided between the substrate and the n-type epitaxial layer. The transistor may also include ohmic contacts for defining a source and a drain as well as a Schottky metal contact.","In other embodiments of the present invention, a high power, high frequency, metal-semiconductor field-effect transistor may be provided having an n-type layer of n-type conductivity silicon carbide on a silicon carbide substrate and a p-type layer of p-type conductivity silicon carbide between the substrate and the n-type layer. Ohmic contacts are provided on portions of the n-type layer and spaced apart which respectively define a source and a drain. A region of chromium is also provided on a portion of the n-type layer that is between the ohmic contacts and thereby between the source and the drain so as to provide a Schottky metal contact for forming an active channel in the n-type layer between the source and the drain when a bias is applied to the Schottky metal contact.","In further embodiments of the present invention, an overlayer is formed on the ohmic contacts and the Schottky metal contact. Preferably, the ohmic contacts are formed of nickel and the overlayer includes layers of titanium, platinum and gold.","Furthermore, the layers of the transistors according to the present invention may form a mesa having sidewalls extending downward from the n-type layer into the p-type layer which define the periphery of the transistors. Optionally, the sidewalls of the mesa may extend downward into the substrate. A passivation layer may also be provided on the sidewalls of the mesa and exposed portions of the n-type epitaxial layer. Preferably, the passivation layer is an ONO passivation layer.","In still further embodiments of the present invention, the Schottky metal contact is recessed in the active channel portion of the n-type epitaxial layer. The Schottky metal contact may also be a mushroom gate contact. The Schottky metal contact may also include an overlayer having layers of platinum and gold.","Metallization may also be formed on the substrate opposite the n-type layer. Preferably, the metallization includes layers of titanium, platinum and gold coated with an overlayer of eutectic alloy of AuGe.","The substrate may also be semi-insulating silicon carbide. While in particular embodiments it is preferred to utilize a semi-insulating substrate which is substantially free of deep level dopants, in other embodiments a semi-insulating silicon carbide substrate may be silicon carbide with a deep level dopant incorporated therein. The deep level dopant may be vanadium. Preferably, the semi-insulating substrate has a resistance of greater than about 10,000 \u03a9-cm.","In still further embodiments of the present invention, the ohmic contacts may be formed on regions of n silicon carbide which may be formed in the n-type epitaxial layer by ion implantation or, alternatively, formed directly on the n-type epitaxial layer.","Aspects of the present invention also may provide methods of fabricating a metal-semiconductor field-effect transistor by forming a p-type epitaxial layer of selectively doped p-type conductivity silicon carbide on a single crystal silicon carbide substrate, wherein the p-type conductivity silicon carbide has a carrier concentration of from about 1\u00d710to about 1\u00d710cm, the forming an n-type epitaxial layer of n-type conductivity silicon carbide on the p-type epitaxial layer, then forming ohmic contacts on the n-type epitaxial layer that respectively define a source and a drain and forming a Schottky metal contact on the n-type epitaxial layer that is between the ohmic contacts and thereby between the source and the drain. The n-type epitaxial layer and the p-type epitaxial layer may be etched to form a mesa. Furthermore in a preferred embodiment, the formation of ohmic contacts and a Schottky gate contact are preceded by etching the n-type epitaxial layer and the p-type epitaxial layer to form a mesa and forming an ONO passivation layer on the exposed surfaces of the mesa.","In particular embodiments of the present invention, the ONO passivation layer is formed by high temperature annealing exposed portions of the substrate, p-type epitaxial layer and n-type epitaxial layer in an Hambient and then forming an SiOlayer on the exposed portions of the substrate, p-type epitaxial layer and n-type epitaxial layer. The SiOlayer is then argon annealed and oxidized. A layer of SiNis then deposited on the oxidized SiOlayer and oxidized to provide the ONO structure.","In particular embodiments of the present invention, the high temperature anneal is carried out at a temperature of greater than about 900\u00b0 C. for a time of from about 15 minutes to about 2 hours. Furthermore, the argon anneal may be carried out at a temperature of about 1200\u00b0 C. for a time of about 1 hour.","The SiOlayer may also be formed to a thickness of from about 50 to about 500 \u212b. Preferably, the SiOlayer is formed through a dry oxide process at a temperature of about 1200\u00b0 C. Also, the SiOlayer is preferably oxidized in a wet environment at a temperature of about 950\u00b0 C. for a time of about 180 minutes.","The layer of SiNmay be deposited to a thickness of from about 200 to about 2000 \u212b. Preferably, the layer of SiNis deposited through chemical vapor deposition such as PECVD or LPCVD. The SiNlayer is also preferably oxidized in a wet environment at a temperature of about 950\u00b0 C. for a time of about 180 minutes. The SiNlayer may be oxidized to provide an oxide layer having a thickness of from about 20 to about 200 \u212b.","In other embodiments of the present invention, a gate recess is formed in the n-type epitaxial layer and the Schottky gate contact formed in the gate recess. Preferably, the gate recess is formed by etching through the ONO passivation layer and into the n-type epitaxial layer so as to provide a gate recess in the n-type epitaxial layer and the Schottky gate contact formed in the gate recess utilizing the ONO passivation layer as a mask. Furthermore, the step of etching through the ONO passivation layer may be followed by patterning the ONO passivation layer so as to provide a ledge in sidewalls of the opening of the ONO passivation layer for the gate recess. A mushroom gate structure may then be formed in the gate recess and on the sidewalls and ledge of the ONO passivation layer. The etching of the ONO passivation layer may be carried out by Electron Cyclotron Resonance or Inductively Coupled Plasma etching.","In a still further embodiment of the present invention, n well regions are implanted in the n-type epitaxial layer so as to provide source and drain regions and the ohmic contacts formed on the n well regions.","In a still further aspect of the present invention, the substrate is thinned and a metallization layer formed on the substrate opposite the p-type epitaxial layer. The metallization layer may be formed by forming a titanium layer on the substrate opposite the p-type epitaxial layer, then forming a layer of platinum on the titanium layer; and then forming a layer of gold on the layer of platinum. A layer of a eutectic alloy of AuGe may also be formed on the layer of gold.","In another aspect of the present invention methods of fabricating a gate structure for a silicon carbide field effect transistor is provided by forming an ONO passivation layer on exposed surfaces of a mesa terminated silicon carbide field effect transistor, forming a gate window in the ONO passivation layer, forming a gate recess in a channel layer of the mesa terminated silicon carbide transistor and forming a gate contact in the gate recess in the channel layer. The ONO passivation layer is preferably formed as described above. Furthermore, the mushroom gate structure may also be formed as described above.","In still further embodiments of the present invention, methods of fabricating a passivation layer of a silicon carbide semiconductor device are provided by forming an oxide layer on the silicon carbide semiconductor device and then annealing the oxide layer in a NO environment. The oxide layer may be thermally grown or deposited. Furthermore, the anneal in the NO environment may be followed by depositing a layer of SiNon the oxidized SiOlayer and then oxidizing the layer of SiN.","In particular embodiments, the oxide layer may be formed by high temperature annealing exposed portions of the substrate, p-type epitaxial layer and n-type epitaxial layer in an Hambient and then forming an SiOlayer on the exposed portions of the substrate, p-type epitaxial layer and n-type epitaxial layer, argon annealing the SiOlayer and oxidizing the SiOlayer.","In still further embodiments of the present invention, a double recessed gate MESFET may be fabricated by forming an n-type epitaxial layer of n-type conductivity silicon carbide on a silicon carbide substrate, forming ohmic contacts on the n-type epitaxial layer that respectively define a source and a drain, forming a cap layer of n-type silicon carbide on the n-type epitaxial layer, forming a first recess in the cap layer, forming a second recess in the n-type epitaxial layer, wherein the recess in the n-type epitaxial layer is within the first recess in the cap layer, and forming a Schottky metal contact on the n-type epitaxial layer that is between the ohmic contacts and thereby between the source and the drain to form an active channel in the n-type epitaxial layer between the source and the drain when a bias is applied to the Schottky metal contact wherein the Schottky metal contact is within the recess in the n-type epitaxial layer.","In particular embodiments, the formation of an n-type epitaxial layer and a cap layer are provided by epitaxially growing the n-type epitaxial layer and the cap layer in a single growth step. Furthermore, in still further embodiments, an n-type dopant concentration in the single growth step may be changed to grow the cap layer.","In yet additional embodiments of the present invention, the first recess in the cap layer may be formed by patterning the cap layer to form the first recess. Furthermore, a mesa having sidewalls which extend through the cap layer and the n-type epitaxial layer may also be formed. In such embodiments, the patterning of the cap layer to form the first recess may be followed by forming an ONO passivation layer on exposed surfaces of the mesa and the first recess, forming a gate window in the ONO passivation layer, wherein the gate window is within the first recess, forming the second recess in n-type epitaxial layer and forming a gate contact in the second recess.","In still further embodiments, the substrate may be formed by forming a semi-insulating SiC substrate which is substantially free of deep-level dopants. Also, a buffer layer may be formed between the substrate and the n-type epitaxial layer. The buffer layer may be undoped SiC, n-type SiC or p-type SiC. If the buffer layer is p-type SiC, in particular embodiments, the p-type epitaxial layer may be formed by forming a first p-type epitaxial layer on the substrate and forming a second p-type epitaxial layer on the first p-type epitaxial layer, wherein the second p-type epitaxial layer has a lower dopant concentration than the first p-type epitaxial layer.","In still further embodiments, an ohmic contact is formed to the p-type epitaxial layer. Furthermore, p-type dopants may be implanted in the p-type epitaxial layer so as to provide a region of p-type conductivity silicon carbide having a higher carrier concentration than the p-type epitaxial layer the ohmic contact formed on the implanted region. The ohmic contact may be formed by etching a ground contact window through the cap layer and the n-type epitaxial layer in a region adjacent a source region of the MESFET and forming the ohmic contact in the ground contact window.","The advantages and features of the invention, and the manner in which the same are accomplished, will become more readily apparent upon consideration of the following detailed description of the invention taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, which illustrate preferred and exemplary embodiments, and wherein:","The present invention will now be described with reference to the Figures which illustrate various embodiment of the present invention. As illustrated in the Figures, the sizes of layers or regions are exaggerated for illustrative purposes and, thus, are provided to illustrate the general structures or the present invention. Furthermore, various aspects of the present invention are described with reference to a layer being formed on a substrate or other layer. As will be appreciated by those of skill in the art, references to a layer being formed on another layer or substrate contemplates that additional layers may intervene. References to a layer being formed on another layer or substrate without an intervening layer are described herein as being for \u201cdirectly\u201d on the layer or substrate. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 5"],"b":["12","10","12","10","14","32","12","32"]},"The first epitaxial layer  may be a p-type conductivity silicon carbide epitaxial layer, an undoped silicon carbide epitaxial layer or a very low doped n-type conductivity silicon carbide epitaxial layer. If a low dope silicon carbide epitaxial layer is utilized, then it is preferred that the doping concentration of the first epitaxial layer  be less than about 5\u00d710cm. If an undoped or n-type first epitaxial layer  is utilized, the substrate  is preferably a semi-insulating silicon carbide substrate. If an undoped or n-type first epitaxial layer  is utilized, a high quality channel layer may be formed without the buffer layer having any significant electrical effect on the transistor.","Ohmic contacts  and , are formed directly on the second epitaxial layer  and are spaced apart so as to provide a source contact  and a drain contact . A Schottky gate contact  is formed directly on the second epitaxial layer  between the source contact  and the drain contact . As illustrated, optional metal overlayers ,  and  are formed on the source and drain contacts  and  and the Schottky gate contact . In forming the ohmic contacts  and  directly on the second epitaxial layer , it is preferred that these ohmic contacts  and  be formed of nickel and be annealed at about 1050\u00b0 C. for about 2 minutes. However, temperatures of from about 800 to about 1150\u00b0 C. and times of from about 30 seconds to about 10 minutes may also be utilized. It has been found that Ni contacts formed directly on the n-type epitaxial layer  may provide a contact resistance below 1\u00d710\u03a9-cm. Such a low resistance may result from the use of the high temperature anneal. By forming the contacts  and  directly on the epitaxial layer  the need for an implantation step may be avoided. Furthermore, the surface roughness which may result from implantation and activation of ions to form the n regions of conventional SiC MESFETs may be reduced. As used herein, \u201cn\u201d or \u201cp\u201d refer to regions that are defined by higher carrier concentration than are present in adjacent or other regions of the same or another epitaxial layer or substrate.","The structure of the transistor as shown in  and subsequent , preferably forms a mesa which defines the periphery of the device. In a device not having a p-type epitaxial layer, the substrate and the n-type epitaxial layer form a mesa having sidewalls which define the periphery of the transistor. The sidewalls of the mesa extend downward past the n-type conductivity layer of the device. Preferably, the mesa is formed to extend into the substrate of the device. The mesa preferably extends past the depletion region of the device to confine current flow in the device to the mesa and reduce the capacitance of the device. If the depletion region of the device extends below the level of the mesa then it may spread to areas outside the mesa, resulting in larger capacitance. The mesa is preferably formed by reactive ion etching the above described device, however other methods known to one skilled in the art may be used to form the mesa. Furthermore, if a mesa is not utilized the device may be isolated using other methods such as proton bombardment, counterdoping with compensating atoms or others known to one skilled in the art.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0065"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["12","10","14","12","20","22","24","14","16","18","16","18"],"sup":["+","+"]},"Alternatively, the n regions  and  may be eliminated as described above so as to provide a device having the source, drain and gate structure illustrated in .

As used herein a mushroom gate is a gate structure at least a portion of which has increasing cross-sectional area as the distance from the second epitaxial layer  increases. Preferably, the gate structure is self aligned with respect to the recess in the n-type layer . Furthermore, it is preferred that the recess be formed by dry etching and more particularly formed by Electron Cyclotron Resonance (ECR) or Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) etching. Forming a self-aligned recess for formation of the gate in such a manner may result in low damage to the epitaxial layer and any insulating layer as well as provide high breakdown characteristics.","Another method of forming the recessed gate is to perform the etching in two steps with a double recess process as illustrated in . As seen in , the Schottky gate contact  is formed in a double recess through a cap layer  and into the second epitaxial layer . The cap layer  may be first etched through and then a second etch performed to etch into the second epitaxial layer . The first etch can be performed either through the cap layer  that is doped at the same level as in the n-type epitaxial layer  or it can be very lightly n-type doped, with the preferred doping range for the cap layer  being N=about 1\u00d710cmto about 5\u00d710cmand the preferred thickness of this cap layer being from about 50 nm to about 300 nm. The depth of the first etch can be all the way through the cap layer , or it may be only partially through the cap layer . The preferred depth into the second epitaxial layer  for the second etch is from about 20 nm to about 120 nm. The cap layer  may be formed as part of the epitaxial growth process of the second epitaxial layer , however, the doping concentration may be changed to provide the preferred doping range for the cap layer . Thus, the cap layer  may be a separate layer or may be part of the second epitaxial layer .","The two etch approach may have a number of advantages over a single recess process. One advantage is that the first etch can be performed prior to any metalization on the wafer, allowing a thermal oxide to be grown subsequent to etching. The thermal oxidation process removes SiC that may have been damaged by the etch process and also smoothes out roughness that may have been created on the surface by the etch. This may enable the second etch, performed immediately prior to the gate metalization, to be much shallower, minimizing the sub-surface damage and surface roughness that, typically, cannot be removed. Another advantage of the double recess process is that the shallower second etch reduces the amount of gate contact to the etched side wall. This minimizes the contact area with potentially damaged material and the reduced contact area may also reduce the gate capacitance and, therefore, improve the frequency response of the transistor.","As illustrated, the Schottky mushroom gate contact  can optionally be formed of a first gate layer  of chromium (Cr) contacting the active channel layer, a barrier layer  of platinum (Pt) and a third layer of gold  or other highly conductive metal. Preferably, the chromium layer  is formed by evaporative deposition.","As is further illustrated, an optional metal overlayer  and  is formed on the source and drain contacts. Preferably, the metal overlayer  and  is formed of titanium (Ti) for adhesion to a nickel contact, platinum (Pt) as a barrier layer and gold (Au) as a highly conductive metal.","An optional metallization layer  may be formed on the opposite side of the substrate  from epitaxial layer  to provide a conducting plane on the substrate . The metallization layer is preferably formed as described below with reference to .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0075","num":"0074"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 1 through 3","FIG. 4"],"b":["60","20","22","24","40","60","60","60","60"],"sub":["2","3","4 ","2 ","2 ","2 ","it"]},"Preferably, the passivation layer  is formed by first forming an SiOlayer A of about 200 \u212b through a dry oxide process at about 1200\u00b0 C. The first layer A is then argon annealed for about 1 hour at about 1200\u00b0 C. This is subsequently oxidized at about 950\u00b0 C. for about 180 minutes in a wet environment. Then layer B of SiNof about 500 \u212b thickness is deposited by PECVD or LPCVD. Then a final oxidation is performed at about 950\u00b0 C. for about 180 minutes in a wet environment to provide the third layer C of oxide. While these fabrication specifications are preferred, other suitable conditions and specifications may also be utilized.

Carrier concentrations of from about 1\u00d710to about 1\u00d710cmare suitable for the first epitaxial layer if the first epitaxial layer \u2032 is selectively doped, however, carrier concentrations of about 3 to 5\u00d710are preferred. Suitable dopants include aluminum, boron and gallium. The first epitaxial layer \u2032 is preferably selectively doped to provide a total charge density of greater than about 1\u00d710cm.

The ohmic contacts  and  are preferably formed of nickel or other suitable metals. The Schottky gate contacts  may be formed of chromium, platinum or platinum silicide, nickel, or TiWN however other metals such as gold, known to one skilled in the art to achieve the Schottky effect, may be used. Preferably, however, the Schottky gate contact  has the three layer structure described with regard to the mushroom gate . Such a structure may have advantages because of the high adhesion of chromium (Cr). The above described devices optionally have an overlayer on one or more of the ohmic contacts and the gate contact, the overlayer ,  and  as described above but may also be gold, silver, aluminum, platinum and copper. Other suitable highly conductive metals may also be used for the overlayer.","The thickness of the n-type conductivity region beneath the gate contact defines the cross-sectional height of the channel region of the device and is selected based on the desired pinch-off voltage of the device and the carrier concentration. Given the carrier concentration of the second epitaxial layer, the depth of the layer for a given pinch-off voltage may be readily calculated using methods known to one skilled in the art. Accordingly, it is desirable for the thickness and carrier concentration of the n-type epitaxial layer to be selected to provide a pinch-off voltage of greater than \u22123 volts and preferably greater than \u22125 volts. The pinch off voltage may also be from between about \u22123 volts and \u221220 volts, but preferably between about \u22125 volts and \u221215 volts.

For a device utilizing a p-type substrate, the thickness of the buried p-type conductivity layer and the substrate of the above described devices should be sufficiently thick so that breakdown of the gate junction occurs before the depletion of the p-type conductivity layer and the substrate.","The above descriptions describe the preferred embodiments of the present invention, however, the first epitaxial layer described above may optionally be eliminated and thereby forming a transistor having a single epitaxial layer of n-type conductivity SiC formed on either a semi-insulating substrate or a p-type substrate. In forming a single epitaxial layer device, the substrate of the device it is preferable to utilize either p-type conductivity silicon carbide having the carrier concentrations as described for the p-type buried layer or a semi-insulating substrate.","In selecting the dimensions of the MESFET, the width of the gate is defined as the dimension of the gate perpendicular to the flow of current. As shown in the cross-sections, , the gate width runs into and out of the page. The length of the gate is the dimension of the gate parallel to the flow of current. As seen in the cross-sectional views of , the gate length is the dimension of the gate  which is in contact with the second epitaxial layer . A third important dimension is the source to gate distance which is shown in the cross-sections, , as the distance from the source contact  or n region  if present, to the gate contact .","To minimize the effect of low electron mobility, the source to gate distance should be as small as possible without allowing substantial source to gate leakage current. In one embodiment of the present invention, the distance from the source to the Schottky gate contact is large enough to prevent the flow of any substantial leakage current from the source to the gate when a bias is applied to the gate while small enough to minimize the effect of the low electron mobility of silicon carbide. This typically means that the gate contact should be as close to the source contact without coming into contact with the source contact or the n region if present. Positioning the gate as close as possible to the source region can maximize the electric field intensity in the region of the transistor where the electrons are accelerated and thereby reduces the effect of low electron mobility of SiC. Typically, the distance from the source to the Schottky contact of about 1 \u03bcm or less, is desirable. The gate to drain distance of the device should be large enough to support the gate to drain depletion spread of the device. These distances are typically from about 0.5 \u03bcm to about 5 \u03bcm.","To further minimize the effect of low electron mobility, the length of the gate contact should be as small as possible. Typically, Schottky gate lengths of less than about 1.0 \u03bcm are desirable. By minimizing the length of the gate, the intensity of the electric field beneath the gate is increased. The increase in electric field results because the same voltage is placed across a smaller area. This increase in electric field intensity increases the acceleration of the electrons in the gate area and thereby reduces the effects of the low electron mobility of silicon carbide. Thus, it is desirable to minimize the length of the gate and thereby maximize the intensity of the electric field beneath the gate.","If the first epitaxial layer \u2032 is selectively doped, then the substrate  may also be doped with a deep level dopant such as vanadium to create a semi-insulating substrate.

Such a semi-insulating substrate may be produced by providing silicon carbide substrates which sufficiently high levels of point defects and sufficiently matched levels of p-type and n-type dopants such that the resistivity of the silicon carbide substrate is dominated by the point defects. Such a domination may be accomplished by fabricating the silicon carbide substrate at elevated temperatures with source powders which have concentrations of heavy metals, transition elements or other deep level trapping elements of less than about 1\u00d710cmand preferably less than about 1\u00d710cm. For example, temperatures between about 2360\u00b0 C. and 2380\u00b0 C. with the seed being about 300\u00b0 C. to about 500\u00b0 C. lower may be utilized. Thus, it is preferred that the semi-insulating substrate be substantially free of heavy metal, transition element dopants or other deep level trapping elements, such as vanadium, such that the resistivity of the substrate is not dominated by such heavy metals or transition elements. While it is preferred that the semi-insulating substrate be free of such heavy metal, transition element dopants or deep level trapping elements, such elements may be present in measurable amounts while still benefiting from the teachings of the present invention if the presence of such materials does not substantially affect the electrical properties of the MESFETs described herein.

Furthermore, the first etch of the double recess may be performed before formation of the ONO passivation layer . The formation of the ONO passivation layer may also be preceded by a thermal oxidation of the SiC cap layer  and any exposed portions of the n-type epitaxial layer  and a wet etch to remove the oxidation.

Source and drain n wells were formed by ion implantation of phosphorus that was activated with an anneal at 1300\u00b0 C. for 1 hour.

This ground contact  may eliminate one of the potential drawbacks of having a p-type buffer layer which is not fully depleted, which is that hole charge can build up and be stored in this layer. This undesired buildup of hole charge may be prevented by providing a ground path for the holes. Because of the difficulty in making high quality ohmic contacts to p-type SiC, it is preferred that the p contact wells be formed in the buffer layer by etching off the n-type channel and implanting the buffer layer with a p-type dopant, such as Al, and activating the implanted species at a temperature of between about 1550\u00b0 C. and about 1750\u00b0 C. to provide a p well  in the buffer layer \u2032. This p-type contact  should be as close to the channel as possible without interfering with the n-type source ohmic contact . The p-type ohmic contact  may be formed with the same step as the n-type ohmic contacts in order to reduce processing steps. It may also be formed in a separate step using a process designed to minimize ohmic contact resistance to the p-type material. An example of such a process is to deposit Ni with a thickness in the range of from about 500 \u212b to about 1500 \u212b and anneal the contacts with a rapid thermal anneal at a temperature in the range of from about 550\u00b0 C. to about 900\u00b0 C.","The series resistance of the p-type buffer layer can be reduced by increasing the doping in this layer, but this may have an adverse effect on the frequency response and breakdown voltage of the MESFET. A method of obtaining the advantage of the heavily doped p-type layer without compromising the performance of the MESFET is to form the p-type buffer layer \u2032 with two layers as illustrated in . The bottom layer \u2033 may be doped with Ngreater than about 5\u00d710cmand be from about 0.5 to about 2.0 \u03bcm thick to provide a region with low resistance, followed by a layer \u2032\u2033 with Nbetween about 5\u00d710cmto about 5\u00d710cmwith a thickness of from about 0.75 to about 2.0 \u03bcm that reduces the output conductance of the FET and still supports drain voltages in excess of 200 V. The quality of the p-type ohmic contact may be further improved by forming the implanted p well  in the heavily doped bottom layer \u2033.","While embodiments of the present invention incorporating a contact to the buried p-type layer \u2032 have been described with reference to , as will be appreciated by those of skill in the art, the p-type contact may also be provided in any of the other embodiments described herein having a p-type epitaxial layer. Thus, the present invention should not be construed as limited to the embodiments illustrated in .","As is briefly described above, MESFETs according to preferred embodiments of the present invention utilize semi-insulating SiC substrates. One method of forming semi-insulating substrates is to intentionally incorporate a deep level dopant into the lattice in order to pin the Fermi level at a very deep energy level relative to the conduction band. These deep level dopants act as trap centers for any electrons that get injected into the substrate under normal device operation. This trapping may have a substantial impact on the performance of microwave MESFETs because the time constants associated with these traps are much slower than the frequency at which the devices are being operated, so the amount of trapped charge increases over time and alters the behavior of the transistor.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0100","num":"0099"},"figref":"FIG. 10","sup":["\u2212","17 ","\u22123"],"sub":"D"},"This back-gating effect may impact the operation of MESFETs in several different ways. The first is that the peak RF power available from the device is typically lower than is expected from the DC characteristics of the device because the peak current available under RF drive is reduced by the trapped charge below the channel. Secondly, the efficiency of the part is, typically, not as high as it should be because the ratio of peak to average current is reduced for the same reason. The trapping effects may also change the bias conditions of the part under RF operation as the back-gating charge is accumulated.  illustrates one of these bias shifts that has been observed. In an ideal MESFET, the drain current increases monotonically under RF drive and then returns to the quiescent value when the RF drive is removed. In SiC MESFETs with the presence of deep level traps, the drain current initially droops below the quiescent value as RF drive is increased, thereby reducing the power, linearity and efficiency of the device. An additional problem is that when the RF power is removed, the drain current drops well below the quiescent value and may take several minutes to recover to the original value. Because this is caused by deep level traps, the recovery time can be reduced either by heating the device or by shining light on it.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0102","num":"0101"},"figref":["FIG. 12","FIG. 12"]},"Additionally, the efficiency of the devices was improved, as shown by the comparison of on-wafer power measurements in  and .

The MESFET fabricated on the vanadium-free substrates () had a much improved power added efficiency of 63% compared to the 35% efficiency of the MESFET fabricated on the vanadium-doped substrates () while maintaining a comparable power density of >5 W\/mm. The improvement in efficiency may result from the ability to bias the transistor at a much lower quiescent drain current and still obtain the same amount of peak power.","In the drawings and specification, there have been disclosed typical preferred embodiments of the invention and, although specific terms are employed, they are used in a generic and descriptive sense only and not for purposes of limitation, the scope of the invention being set forth in the following claims."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 2","sup":"+"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 3A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 3B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":"FIGS. 6A through 6I"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":"FIG. 7","sub":"A","sup":["15 ","\u22123"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":"FIG. 8","sub":"A=","sup":["16 ","\u22123"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"figref":"FIG. 12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":"FIG. 13"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":"FIG. 14"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
