No. 14\/331,730 filed Jul. 15, 2014, the entire content of which is incorporated by reference.","The instant application contains a Sequence Listing which has been submitted electronically in ASCII format and is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Said ASCII copy, created on Nov. 7, 2014, is named 069496-082993_SEtxt and is 320,546 bytes in size.","The technology described herein relates to ligands, e.g., antibodies for the treatment of disease.","It is recognized that individual humans differ in their sequence and recently several individuals have had their genomes sequenced, for instance James Watson and Craig Venter. Comparison of the genome sequence of individuals has revealed differences in their sequences in both coding and non-coding parts of the genome. Some of these variations in humans are significant and contribute to phenotypic differences between individuals. In extreme cases these will result in genetic disease. The 1000 Genomes Project has the objective of cataloguing sequences in the human genome, involving sequencing the genomes of a very large sampling of individuals from diverse art-recognized human ethnic populations.","Through the application of human genetic variation analysis and rationally-designed sequence selection the present invention provides for improved human patient diagnosis and therapy. Importantly, the invention enables tailored medicines that address individual human patient genotypes or phenotypes.","The inventor's analysis of large numbers of naturally-occurring genomic human TOI sequences reveals that there is significant variation across diverse human populations and provides for the ability for correlation between individual human patients and tailored medical and diagnostic approaches addressing the target. The technical applications of these findings, as per the present invention, thus contribute to better treatment, prophylaxis and diagnosis in humans and provides for patient benefit by enabling personalized medicines and therapies. This provides advantages of better prescribing, less wastage of medications and improved chances of drug efficacy and better diagnosis in patients.","Furthermore, the inventor surprisingly realised that some rarer natural forms, although present in humans at much lower frequencies than the common form, nevertheless are represented in multiple and ethnically-diverse human populations and usually with many human examples per represented ethnic population. Thus, the inventor realised that targeting such rarer forms would provide for effective treatment, prophylaxis or diagnosis across many human ethnic populations, thereby extending the utility of the present invention and better serving patients in those populations.","With this, the inventor realised that there is significant industrial and medical application for the invention in terms of guiding the choice of an anti-TOI ligand for administration to human patients for therapy and\/or prophylaxis of TOI-mediated or associated diseases and conditions. In this way, the patient receives drugs and ligands that are tailored to their needs\u2014as determined by the patient's genetic or phenotypic makeup. Hand-in-hand with this, the invention provides for the genotyping and\/or phenotyping of patients in connection with such treatment, thereby allowing a proper match of drug to patient. This increases the chances of medical efficacy, reduces the likelihood of inferior treatment using drugs or ligands that are not matched to the patient (eg, poor efficacy and\/or side-effects) and avoids pharmaceutical mis-prescription and waste.","To this end, the invention provides:\u2014","In a First Configuration","A method of treating or preventing a disease or condition in a human,

be addressed. This has spawned great interest in personalized medicine where genotyping and knowledge of protein and nucleotide variability is used to tailor medicines and diagnosis of patients more effectively. The present invention provides for tailored pharmaceuticals and testing that specifically addresses rarer variant forms of a human target of interest (TOI).","The present invention harnesses the power of human genetic variation analysis and rationally-designed sequence selection. The technical applications of these approaches, as per the present invention, contribute to better treatment, prophylaxis and diagnosis in humans and provides for patient benefit by providing choice and enabling personalized medicines and therapies. This provides advantages of better prescribing, less wastage of medications and improved chances of drug efficacy and better diagnosis in patients.","As sources of genomic sequence variation data, the skilled person will be aware of the available databases and resources (including updates thereof) provided by the following:\u2014\n\n","Wide Web at 1000 genomes.org\/). This resource provides complete genomic sequence for at least 2500 unidentified individuals from one of 25 distinct population groups.\n\n","The present invention involves the identification and cataloguing of naturally-occurring human genomic target sequence variants, including those found to be relatively low-frequency or rare variants that segregate with specific human ethnic populations and in many individual humans.","An aspect of the invention is based on rational design of sequence selection addressing the desirability to tailor medicaments and diagnostics to rarer, but yet still significant groups of human individuals that suffer from, or have the potential to suffer from (ie, who are at risk of), a disease or condition mediated or associated with the target of interest. In devising this rational design of the present aspect of the invention, the inventor included considerations of the spread of prevalence of naturally-occurring target variant sequences across multiple, diverse human ethnic populations, as well as the importance of addressing such populations where many individuals are likely to display a genotype and\/or phenotype of one or more of the variants being analysed. As part of this design, the inventor saw the importance of adopting the art-recognised classifications of human ethnic populations, and in this respect the inventor based the analysis and design on the recognised human ethnic populations adopted by the 1000 Genomes Project, since this is a resource that is, and will continue to be, widely adopted by the scientific and medical community.","Thus, in this aspect of the invention, the inventor designed the following variant sequence selection criteria, these being criteria that the inventor realised would provide for useful medical drugs and diagnostics to tailored need in the human population.","Selection Criteria","Three or four of the following:\u2014\n\n","The inventor's selection included, as a consideration, selection for nucleotide variation that produced amino acid variation in corresponding TOI forms (ie, non-synonymous variations), as opposed to silent variations that do not alter amino acid residues in the target protein.","In an embodiment, the cumulative human allele frequency is 30, 25, 20, 15, 10 or 5% or less, eg, in the range from 1 to 20% or 1 to 15% or 1 to 10%.","In an embodiment, the total human genotype frequency is 35, 30, 25, 20, 15, 10 or 5% or less, eg, in the range from 1 to 25%, 1 to 20%, 1 to 15%, 1 to about 15%, 1 to 10%, 1 to about 10% or 1 to 5% or 1 to about 5%.","In an embodiment, the naturally-occurring human target variant sequences are found in at least 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 or 20 different human ethnic populations (using the standard categorisation of the 1000 Genomes Project).","In an embodiment, the naturally-occurring human target variant sequences are found in at least 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 100, 105, 110, 115, 120, 130, 140 or 150 individuals distributed across such many different ethnic populations.","In an example, the following criteria are applied:\u2014\n\n","In an example, the criteria are applied with reference to one or more human genomic sequence databases as described herein. For example, the criteria are those as applied to the 1000 Genomes database.","For example in any aspect example, embodiment or configuration of the invention, the 1000 Genomes database release 13. For example, the 1000 Genomes database in its most recent version as at 1 Oct. 2013.","Optionally, further sequence analysis and 3D in silico modelling (eg, see ) can also be used as an additional selection criterion: variants whose variant amino acid residues (versus the most common form of human TOI) are surface-exposed on the target are desirable for selection, since the inventor saw these as contributing to determining the topography of the target and potentially contributing to how and where ligand binding on the target occurs.","The following bioinformatics protocol is envisaged to identify human sequences for use in the present invention:\n\n","Human Populations","Optionally the ethnic populations are selected from those identified in the 1000 Genomes Project database. In this respect, see Table 4 which provides details of the ethnic populations on which the 1000 Genomes Project database is based.","N A Rosenberg et al (Science 20 Dec. 2002: vol. 298 no. 5602 2342-2343) studied the genetic structure of human populations of differing geographical ancestry.

For example, the ligand specifically binds to the TOI variant as per the invention. The ligand may inhibit or antagonise the activity of the target, eg, the ligand neutralises the target. The skilled person will be familiar with neutralising ligands in general, such as antibodies or antibody fragments, and can readily test suitable ligands for specific binding and\/or neutralisation of a target in vitro or in an in vivo assay.","An antibody \u201cfragment\u201d comprises a portion of an intact antibody, preferably the antigen binding and\/or the variable region of the intact antibody. Examples of antibody fragments include dAb, Fab, Fab\u2032, F(ab\u2032)2 and Fv fragments; diabodies; linear antibodies; single-chain antibody molecules and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments.","In an embodiment, the ligand of the invention is or comprises an antibody or antibody fragment, for example an antibody or fragment comprising human variable regions (and optionally also human constant regions). Anti-TOI or TOI-binding or targeting antibodies and fragments can be prepared according to any known method, eg, using transgenic mice (eg, the Kymouse\u2122 or Velocimouse\u2122, or Omnimouse\u2122, Xenomouse\u2122, HuMab Mouse\u2122 or MeMo Mouse\u2122), rats (eg, the Omnirat\u2122), camelids, sharks, rabbits, chickens or other non-human animals immunised with the TOI followed optionally by humanisation of the constant regions and\/or variable regions to produce human or humanised antibodies. In an example, display technologies can be used, such as yeast, phage or ribosome display, as will be apparent to the skilled person. Standard affinity maturation, eg, using a display technology, can be performed in a further step after isolation of an antibody lead from a transgenic animal, phage display library or other library. Representative examples of suitable technologies are described in US20120093818 (Amgen, Inc), which is incorporated herein by reference, eg, the methods set out in paragraphs [0309] to [0346]. Although this is with reference to PCSK9, the antibody-generating methods can be applied to other TOIs as per the broadest scopes of the present invention.","Generally, a VELOCIMMUNE\u2122 or other mouse or rat can be challenged with the antigen of interest, and lymphatic cells (such as B-cells) are recovered from the mice that express antibodies. The lymphatic cells may be fused with a myeloma cell line to prepare immortal hybridoma cell lines, and such hybridoma cell lines are screened and selected to identify hybridoma cell lines that produce antibodies specific to the antigen of interest. DNA encoding the variable regions of the heavy chain and light chain may be isolated and linked to desirable isotypic constant regions of the heavy chain and light chain. Such an antibody protein may be produced in a cell, such as a CHO cell. Alternatively, DNA encoding the antigen-specific chimaeric antibodies or the variable domains of the light and heavy chains may be isolated directly from antigen-specific lymphocytes.","Initially, high affinity chimaeric antibodies are isolated having a human variable region and a mouse constant region. As described below, the antibodies are characterized and selected for desirable characteristics, including affinity, selectivity, epitope, etc. The mouse constant regions are replaced with a desired human constant region to generate the fully human antibody of the invention, for example wild-type or modified IgG1 or IgG4 (for example, SEQ ID NO: 751, 752,753 in US2011\/0065902, which sequences are incorporated herein by reference for use in the ligands of the present invention). While the constant region selected may vary according to specific use, high affinity antigen-binding and target specificity characteristics reside in the variable region.","In an example, the ligand of the invention is or comprises a nucleic acid, eg, RNA, eg, siRNA that hybridises under stringent condition to the TOI variant sequence, eg, hybridises a nucleotide sequence comprising one or more nucleotides that are variant (versus the most common TOI sequence, eg, with reference to the 1000 Genomes Project database).","Target binding ability, specificity and affinity (Kd, Kand\/or K) can be determined by any routine method in the art, eg, by surface plasmon resonance (SPR). The term \u201cKd\u201d, as used herein, is intended to refer to the equilibrium dissociation constant of a particular antibody-antigen interaction.","In one embodiment, the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) is carried out at 25\u00b0 C. In another embodiment, the SPR is carried out at 37\u00b0 C.","In one embodiment, the SPR is carried out at physiological pH, such as about pH7 or at pH7.6 (eg, using Hepes buffered saline at pH7.6 (also referred to as HBS-EP)).","In one embodiment, the SPR is carried out at a physiological salt level, eg, 150 mM NaCl.","In one embodiment, the SPR is carried out at a detergent level of no greater than 0.05% by volume, eg, in the presence of P20 (polysorbate 20; eg, Tween-20\u2122) at 0.05% and EDTA at 3 mM.","In one example, the SPR is carried out at 25\u00b0 C. or 37\u00b0 C. in a buffer at pH7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% detergent (eg, P20) and 3 mM EDTA. The buffer can contain 10 mM Hepes. In one example, the SPR is carried out at 25\u00b0 C. or 37\u00b0 C. in HBS-EP. HBS-EP is available from Teknova Inc (California; catalogue number H8022).","In an example, the affinity of the ligand (eg, antibody) is determined using SPR by\n\n","Regeneration of the capture surface can be carried out with 10 mM glycine at pH1.7. This removes the captured antibody and allows the surface to be used for another interaction. The binding data can be fitted to 1:1 model inherent using standard techniques, eg, using a model inherent to the ProteOn XPR36\u2122 analysis software.","In an example, the ligand of the invention is contained in a medical container, eg, a vial, syringe, IV container or an injection device (eg, an intraocular or intravitreal injection device). In an example, the ligand is in vitro, eg, in a sterile container. In an example, the invention provides a kit comprising the ligand of the invention, packaging and instructions for use in treating or preventing or diagnosing in a human a disease or condition mediated by the TOI. In an example, the instructions indicate that the human should be genotyped for a TOI variant sequence of the invention before administering the ligand to the human. In an example, the instructions indicate that the human should be phenotyped for a TOI variant of the invention before administering the ligand to the human. In an example, the human is of Chinese (eg, Han) ethnicity and the instructions are in Chinese (eg, Mandarin). In an example, the instructions comprise directions to administer alirocumab or evolocumab to said human.","The invention relates to the concepts set out in the following clauses.","Clause 1","A method of treating or preventing a disease or condition in a human, wherein the disease or condition is mediated by a Target of Interest (TOI), wherein the TOI is present in humans as different polymorphic variants, the method comprising\n\n","In any aspect, configuration, example, embodiment, clause or concept herein, frequencies may be determined using bioinformatics.","In any aspect, configuration, example, embodiment, clause or concept herein, frequencies may be determined by reference to a database comprising at least 1000 or 2000 human sequences.","In any aspect, configuration, example, embodiment, clause or concept herein \u201cheterozygous human genotype frequency\u201d means the cumulative frequency of all genotypes in the sample or database or in humans having one occurrence of the rare variant allele and one occurrence of another allele (heterozygous state), eg, genotype in 1000 Genomes database.","In any aspect, configuration, example, embodiment, clause or concept herein \u201chomozygous human genotype frequency means the cumulative frequency of two occurrences of the variant allele (homozygous state), eg, genotype in 1000 Genomes Project database.","In any aspect, configuration, example, embodiment, clause or concept herein \u201ctotal human genotype frequency\u201d means the total of heterozygous plus homozygous human genotype frequencies.","In any aspect, configuration, example, embodiment, clause or concept herein \u201ccumulative human allele frequency\u201d refers to the total of all occurrences of the variant allele (eg, SNP) in the sample or database or in humans, eg, in the 1000 Genomes Project database.","Clause 2:","The method of clause 1, wherein before step (a) the ligand has been or is determined as being capable of binding to said TOI variant, eg, with an affinity (Kd) disclosed below.","In an example, the ligand is (or has been determined as) a neutraliser of the TOI.

In some applications, modification to remove undesirable glycosylation sites may be useful, or e.g., removal of a fucose moiety to increase antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) function (see Shield et al. (2002) JBC 277:26733). In other applications, modification of galactosylation can be made in order to modify complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC).","In an example, the invention features a pharmaceutical composition comprising a ligand of the invention, wherein the ligand is or comprises a recombinant human antibody or fragment thereof which specifically binds the TOI (eg, a rare variant as described herein) and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In one embodiment, the invention features a composition which is a combination of an antibody ligand or antigen-binding fragment of an antibody of the invention, and a second therapeutic agent.

Methods for determining whether two molecules specifically bind are well known in the art and include, for example, equilibrium dialysis, surface plasmon resonance, and the like. An isolated antibody that specifically binds a human TOI may, however, exhibit cross-reactivity to other antigens such as a TOI molecule from another species. Moreover, multi-specific antibodies (e.g., bispecifics) that bind to human TOI and one or more additional antigens are nonetheless considered antibodies that \u201cspecifically bind\u201d TOI, as used herein.","Genotyping & Phenotyping","The skilled person will be familiar with techniques that can be used for accurate genotyping and application to the invention.

Other high-throughput methods discriminate alleles by differential hybridization, primer extension, ligation and cleavage of an allele-specific probe (Review Accessing genetic variation: genotyping single nucleotide polymorphisms, Syv\u00e4nen AC, Nat Rev Genet. 2001 December; 2(12):930-42; Review Techniques patents for SNP genotyping, Twyman R M, Primrose S B, Pharmacogenomics. 2003 January; 4(1):67-79).","An approach for a fully automated, large-scale SNP analysis is the \u2018homogeneous\u2019 assay, i.e. a single-phase assay without separation steps, permitting continual monitoring during amplification. The TaqMan\u2122 assay (Applied Biosystems), originally designed for quantitative real-time PCR, is a homogeneous, single-step assay also used in determination of mutation status of DNA (see, eg, A. A. Komar (ed.), Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms, Methods in Molecular Biology 578, DOI 10.1007\/978-1-60327-411-119, Humana Press, a part of Springer Science+Business Media, LLC; and Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms, Methods in Molecular Biology\u2122 Volume 578, 2009, pp 293-306, The TaqMan Method for SNP Genotyping, Gong-Qing Shen et al). The TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assay exploits the 5\u2032-exonuclease activity of AmpliTaq Gold\u2122 DNA polymerase to cleave a doubly labeled probe hybridized to the SNP-containing sequence of ssDNA. Cleavage separates a 5\u2032-fluorophore from a 3\u2032-quencher leading to detectable fluorescent signal. The use of two allele-specific probes carrying different fluorophores permits SNP determination in the same tube without any post-PCR processing. Genotype is determined from the ratio of intensities of the two fluorescent probes at the end of amplification. Thus, rather than taking advantage of the full set of real-time PCR data as in quantitative studies, only end-point data are used.","TaqMan SNP genotyping in a high-throughput, automated manner is facilitated by the use of validated Pre-made TaqMan\u00ae Genotyping assays, but Custom TaqMan\u00ae Assays may also be used (High-throughput genotyping with single nucleotide polymorphisms, Ranade K, Chang M S, Ting C T, Pei D, Hsiao C F, Olivier M, Pesich R, Hebert J, Chen Y D, Dzau V J, Curb D, Olshen R, Risch N, Cox D R, Botstein D, Genome Res. 2001 July; 11(7):1262-8; Assessment of two flexible and compatible SNP genotyping platforms: TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assays and the SNPlex Genotyping System, De la Vega F M, Lazaruk K D, Rhodes M D, Wenz M H, Mutat Res. 2005 Jun. 3; 573(1-2):111-35). The results of the assay can be automatically determined by genotyping software provided with real-time thermal cyclers (e.g. IQ software of Bio-Rad, Sequence Detection Software of Applied Biosystems).","Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can be determined using TaqMan\u2122 real-time PCR assays (Applied Biosystems) and commercial software that assigns genotypes based on reporter probe signals at the end of amplification. An algorithm for automatic genotype caling of SNPs using the full course of TaqMan real-time data is available for use (A. Callegaro et al, Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34(7): e56, Published online 2006 Apr. 14. doi: 10.1093\/nar\/gk1185, PMCID: PMC1440877). The algorithm is unique in that it classifies samples according to the behavior of blanks (no DNA samples), which cluster with heterozygous samples. This method of classification eliminates the need for positive controls and permits accurate genotyping even in the absence of a genotype class, for example when one allele is rare.","The skilled person will be familiar with techniques that can be used for accurate phenotyping and application to the invention. These include the use of amino acid sequencing of isolated target protein and comparison of sequences from different variants (eg, with the most common variant). An antibody that specifically and selectively binds in the area of a SNP under stringent conditions can also be used to identify a particular variant. In another method, the genotype is determined and a corresponding amino acid sequence (phenotype) determined, eg, by in silico translation.","Therapeutic Administration and Formulations","The invention provides therapeutic compositions comprising the anti-TOI ligand, eg, antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof, of the present invention. The administration of therapeutic compositions in accordance with the invention will be administered with suitable carriers, excipients, and other agents that are incorporated into formulations to provide improved transfer, delivery, tolerance, and the like.

When the ligand, eg, antibody, of the present invention is used for treating various conditions and diseases associated with the TOI in an adult patient, it is advantageous to intravenously administer the antibody of the present invention normally at a single dose of about 0.01 to about 20 mg\/kg body weight, more preferably about 0.02 to about 7, about 0.03 to about 5, or about 0.05 to about 3 mg\/kg body weight. Depending on the severity of the condition, the frequency and the duration of the treatment can be adjusted.","Various delivery systems are known and can be used to administer the ligand or pharmaceutical composition of the invention, for example a ligand provided by e.g., encapsulation in liposomes, microparticles, microcapsules, recombinant cells capable of expressing the mutant viruses, receptor mediated endocytosis (see, e.g., Wu et al. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262:4429-4432). Methods of introduction include, but are not limited to, intradermal, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intravenous, subcutaneous, intranasal, epidural, and oral routes. The ligand or composition may be administered by any convenient route, for example by infusion or bolus injection, by absorption through epithelial or mucocutaneous linings (e.g., oral mucosa, rectal and intestinal mucosa, etc.) and may be administered together with other biologically active agents. Administration can be systemic or local.","The ligand or pharmaceutical composition can be also delivered in a vesicle, in particular a liposome (see Langer (1990) Science 249:1527-1533; Treat et al. (1989) in Liposomes in the Therapy of Infectious Disease and Cancer, Lopez Berestein and Fidler (eds.), Liss, New York, pp. 353-365; Lopez-Berestein, ibid., pp. 317-327; see generally ibid.).","In certain situations, the ligand or pharmaceutical composition can be delivered in a controlled release system. In one embodiment, a pump may be used (see Langer, supra; Sefton (1987) CRC Crit. Ref. Biomed. Eng. 14:201). In another embodiment, polymeric materials can be used; see, Medical Applications of Controlled Release, Langer and Wise (eds.), CRC Pres., Boca Raton, Fla. (1974). In yet another embodiment, a controlled release system can be placed in proximity of the composition's target, thus requiring only a fraction of the systemic dose (see, e.g., Goodson, in Medical Applications of Controlled Release, supra, vol. 2, pp. 115-138, 1984).","The injectable preparations may include dosage forms for intravenous, subcutaneous, intracutaneous and intramuscular injections, drip infusions, etc. These injectable preparations may be prepared by methods publicly known. For example, the injectable preparations may be prepared, e.g., by dissolving, suspending or emulsifying the antibody or its salt described above in a sterile aqueous medium or an oily medium conventionally used for injections. As the aqueous medium for injections, there are, for example, physiological saline, an isotonic solution containing glucose and other auxiliary agents, etc., which may be used in combination with an appropriate solubilizing agent such as an alcohol (e.g., ethanol), a polyalcohol (e.g., propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol), a nonionic surfactant [e.g., polysorbate 80, HCO-50 (polyoxyethylene (50 mol) adduct of hydrogenated castor oil)], etc. As the oily medium, there are employed, e.g., sesame oil, soybean oil, etc., which may be used in combination with a solubilizing agent such as benzyl benzoate, benzyl alcohol, etc. The injection thus prepared is preferably filled in an appropriate ampoule. A pharmaceutical composition of the present invention can be delivered subcutaneously or intravenously with a standard needle and syringe. In addition, with respect to subcutaneous delivery, a pen delivery device readily has applications in delivering a pharmaceutical composition of the present invention. Such a pen delivery device can be reusable or disposable. A reusable pen delivery device generally utilizes a replaceable cartridge that contains a pharmaceutical composition. Once all of the pharmaceutical composition within the cartridge has been administered and the cartridge is empty, the empty cartridge can readily be discarded and replaced with a new cartridge that contains the pharmaceutical composition. The pen delivery device can then be reused. In a disposable pen delivery device, there is no replaceable cartridge. Rather, the disposable pen delivery device comes prefilled with the pharmaceutical composition held in a reservoir within the device. Once the reservoir is emptied of the pharmaceutical composition, the entire device is discarded.","Numerous reusable pen and autoinjector delivery devices have applications in the subcutaneous delivery of a ligand or pharmaceutical composition of the present invention. Examples include, but certainly are not limited to AUTOPEN\u2122 (Owen Mumford, Inc., Woodstock, UK), DISETRONIC\u2122 pen (Disetronic Medical Systems, Burghdorf, Switzerland), HUMALOG MIX 75\/25\u2122 pen, HUMALOG\u2122 pen, HUMALIN 70\/30\u2122 pen (Eli Lilly and Co., Indianapolis, Ind.), NOVOPEN\u2122I, II and III (Novo Nordisk, Copenhagen, Denmark), NOVOPEN JUNIOR\u2122 (Novo Nordisk, Copenhagen, Denmark), BD\u2122 pen (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, N.J.), OPTIPENT\u2122, OPTIPEN PRO\u2122, OPTIPEN STARLET\u2122, and OPTICLIKT\u2122 (sanofi-aventis, Frankfurt, Germany), to name only a few. Examples of disposable pen delivery devices having applications in subcutaneous delivery of a pharmaceutical composition of the present invention include, but certainly are not limited to the SOLOSTAR\u2122 pen (sanofi-aventis), the FLEXPEN\u2122 (Novo Nordisk), and the KWIKPEN\u2122 (Eli Lilly).","Advantageously, the pharmaceutical compositions for oral or parenteral use described above are prepared into dosage forms in a unit dose suited to fit a dose of the ligand(s). Such dosage forms in a unit dose include, for example, tablets, pills, capsules, injections (ampoules), suppositories, etc. The amount of the aforesaid antibody contained is generally about 5 to about 500 mg per dosage form in a unit dose; especially in the form of injection, it is preferred that the aforesaid antibody is contained in about 5 to about 100 mg and in about 10 to about 250 mg for the other dosage forms.","Exemplary TOIs","For example in any configuration, aspect, concept, example or configuration of the invention, the or each TOI is selected from the group consisting of ABCF1; ACVR1; ACVR1B; ACVR2; ACVR2B; ACVRL1; ADORA2A; Aggrecan; AGR2; AICDA; AWl; AIG1; AKAP1; AKAP2; AIYIH; amyloid-beta; AMHR2; ANGPT1; ANGPT2; ANGPTL3; ANGPTL4; ANPEP; APC; APOC1; AR; Axl; AZGP1 (zinc-a-glycoprotein); B7.1; B7.2; BAD; BAFF; BAG1; BAIl; BCL2; BCL6; BDNF; BLNK; BLR1 (MDR15); B1yS; BMP1; BMP2; BMP3B (GDF1O); BMP4; BMP6; BMP8; BMPR1A; BMPR1B; BMPR2; BPAG1 (plectin); BRCA1; Cl9orflO (IL27w); C3; C4A; C5; C5R1; CANT1; CASP1; CASP4; CAV1; CB1; CCBP2 (D6\/JAB61); CCL1 (1-309); CCL11 (eotaxin); CCL13 (MCP-4); CCL15 (MIP-id); CCL16 (HCC-4); CCL17 (TARC); CCL18 (PARC); CCL19 (MIP-3b); CCL2 (MCP-1); MCAF; CCL2O (MIP-3a); CCL21 (MIP-2); SLC; exodus-2; CCL22 (MDC\/STC-1); CCL23 (MPIF-1); CCL24 (MPIF-2 I eotaxin-2); CCL25 (TECK); CCL26 (eotaxin-3); CCL2?

The terms \u201cprotein\u201d and \u201cpolypeptide\u201d are used interchangeably herein when referring to a gene product and fragments thereof. Thus, exemplary polypeptides or proteins include gene products, naturally occurring proteins with the specified sequence. One can also use peptide homologs, peptide orthologs, peptide paralogs, peptide fragments and other equivalents, variants, fragments, and analogs of the peptides as these terms are understood by one of ordinary skill in the art.","As used herein, the term \u201cnucleic acid\u201d or \u201cnucleic acid sequence\u201d refers to any molecule, preferably a polymeric molecule, incorporating units of ribonucleic acid, deoxyribonucleic acid.

A siRNA has the ability to reduce or inhibit expression of a gene or target RNA when the siRNA is present or expressed in the same cell as the target gene, e.g. the target RNA. siRNA-dependent post-transcriptional silencing of gene expression involves cutting the target RNA molecule at a site guided by the siRNA.","As used herein, \u201cPCSK9\u201d or \u201cproprotein convertase subtilisin\/kexin type 9\u201d refers to a serine protease involved in regulating the levels of the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) protein (Horton et al., 2007; Seidah and Prat, 2007). PCSK9 has been shown to directly interact with the LDLR protein, be endocytosed along with the LDLR, and co-immunofluoresce with the LDLR throughout the endosomal pathway (Lagace et al., 2006). PCSK9 is a prohormone-proprotein convertase in the subtilisin (S8) family of serine proteases (Seidah et al., 2003).

Methods of identifying and\/or diagnosing such diseases and conditions are well known to medical practitioners of ordinary skill.","A subject at risk of having or developing a disease or condition mediated by PCSK9 can be a subject exhibiting one or more signs or symptoms of such a disease or condition or having one or more risk factors for such a disease or condition, e.g. being overweight, having elevated cholesterol level, comprising one or more genetic polymorphisms known to predispose to the disease or condition, e.g., elevated cholesterol level, such as having a mutation in the LDLR (encoding low-density lipoprotein receptor) or APOB (encoding apolipoprotein B) or in the PCSK9 gene and\/or having a family history of such a disease or condition.","As used herein, \u201cligand\u201d refers to a molecule which can bind, e.g., specifically bind, to a second molecule or receptor. In some embodiments, a ligand can be, e.g., an antibody, antibody fragment, antibody portion, and\/or affibody.","The term \u201cvariant\u201d as used herein refers to a peptide or nucleic acid that differs from the polypeptide or nucleic acid (eg, the most common one in humans, eg, most frequent in a database as disclosed herein, such as the 1000 Genomes Project database) by one or more amino acid or nucleic acid deletions, additions, yet retains one or more specific functions or biological activities of the naturally occurring molecule Amino acid substitutions include alterations in which an amino acid is replaced with a different naturally-occurring amino acid residue. Such substitutions may be classified as \u201cconservative\u201d, in which case an amino acid residue contained in a polypeptide is replaced with another naturally occurring amino acid of similar character either in relation to polarity, side chain functionality or size. Such conservative substitutions are well known in the art. Substitutions encompassed by the present invention may also be \u201cnon-conservative\u201d, in which an amino acid residue which is present in a peptide is substituted with an amino acid having different properties, such as naturally-occurring amino acid from a different group (e.g., substituting a charged or hydrophobic amino; acid with alanine), or alternatively, in which a naturally-occurring amino acid is substituted with a non-conventional amino acid. In some embodiments amino acid substitutions are conservative. Also encompassed within the term variant when used with reference to a polynucleotide or polypeptide, refers to a polynucleotide or polypeptide that can vary in primary, secondary, or tertiary structure, as compared to a reference polynucleotide or polypeptide, respectively (e.g., as compared to a wild-type polynucleotide or polypeptide).","Variants of PCSK9 are provided elsewhere herein. Variants of PCSK9 can include the forms described herein as a, f, c, r, p, m, e h, aj, and q. Sequences of these variants are provided herein, see, e.g, SEQ ID NOs:1-27 and in Table 1, 2 or 6.","In some aspects, one can use \u201csynthetic variants\u201d, \u201crecombinant variants\u201d, or \u201cchemically modified\u201d polynucleotide variants or polypeptide variants isolated or generated using methods well known in the art. \u201cModified variants\u201d can include conservative or non-conservative amino acid changes, as described below. Polynucleotide changes can result in amino acid substitutions, additions, deletions, fusions and truncations in the polypeptide encoded by the reference sequence. Some aspects use include insertion variants, deletion variants or substituted variants with substitutions of amino acids, including insertions and substitutions of amino acids and other molecules) that do not normally occur in the peptide sequence that is the basis of the variant, for example but not limited to insertion of ornithine which do not normally occur in human proteins. The term \u201cconservative substitution,\u201d when describing a polypeptide, refers to a change in the amino acid composition of the polypeptide that does not substantially alter the polypeptide's activity. For example, a conservative substitution refers to substituting an amino acid residue for a different amino acid residue that has similar chemical properties. Conservative amino acid substitutions include replacement of a leucine with an isoleucine or valine, an aspartate with a glutamate, or a threonine with a serine.","\u201cConservative amino acid substitutions\u201d result from replacing one amino acid with another having similar structural and\/or chemical properties, such as the replacement of a leucine with an isoleucine or valine, an aspartate with a glutamate, or a threonine with a serine. Thus, a \u201cconservative substitution\u201d of a particular amino acid sequence refers to substitution of those amino acids that are not critical for polypeptide activity or substitution of amino acids with other amino acids having similar properties (e.g., acidic, basic, positively or negatively charged, polar or non-polar, etc.) such that the substitution of even critical amino acids does not reduce the activity of the peptide, (i.e. the ability of the peptide to penetrate the blood brain barrier (BBB)). Conservative substitution tables providing functionally similar amino acids are well known in the art. For example, the following six groups each contain amino acids that are conservative substitutions for one another: 1) Alanine (A), Serine (S), Threonine (T); 2) Aspartic acid (D), Glutamic acid (E); 3) Asparagine (N), Glutamine (Q); 4) Arginine (R), Lysine (K); 5) Isoleucine (I), Leucine (L), Methionine (M), Valine (V); and 6) Phenylalanine (F), Tyrosine (Y), Tryptophan (W). (See also Creighton, Proteins, W. H. Freeman and Company (1984), incorporated by reference in its entirety.) In some embodiments, individual substitutions, deletions or additions that alter, add or delete a single amino acid or a small percentage of amino acids can also be considered \u201cconservative substitutions\u201d if the change does not reduce the activity of the peptide. Insertions or deletions are typically in the range of about 1 to 5 amino acids. The choice of conservative amino acids may be selected based on the location of the amino acid to be substituted in the peptide, for example if the amino acid is on the exterior of the peptide and expose to solvents, or on the interior and not exposed to solvents.","In alternative embodiments, one can select the amino acid which will substitute an existing amino acid based on the location of the existing amino acid, i.e. its exposure to solvents (i.e. if the amino acid is exposed to solvents or is present on the outer surface of the peptide or polypeptide as compared to internally localized amino acids not exposed to solvents). Selection of such conservative amino acid substitutions are well known in the art, for example as disclosed in Dordo et al, J. MoI Biol, 1999, 217, 721-739 and Taylor et al, J. Theor. Biol. 119(1986); 205-218 and S. French and B. Robson, J. MoI. Evol. 19(1983)171. Accordingly, one can select conservative amino acid substitutions suitable for amino acids on the exterior of a protein or peptide (i e amino acids exposed to a solvent), for example, but not limited to, the following substitutions can be used: substitution of Y with F, T with S or K, P with A, E with D or Q, N with D or G, R with K, G with N or A, T with S or K, D with N or E, I with L or V, F with Y, S with T or A, R with K, G with N or A, K with R, A with S, K or P.","In alternative embodiments, one can also select conservative amino acid substitutions encompassed suitable for amino acids on the interior of a protein or peptide, for example one can use suitable conservative substitutions for amino acids is on the interior of a protein or peptide (i.e. the amino acids are not exposed to a solvent), for example but not limited to, one can use the following conservative substitutions: where Y is substituted with F, T with A or S, I with L or V, W with Y, M with L, N with D, G with A, T with A or S, D with N, I with L or V, F with Y or L, S with A or T and A with S, G, T or V.

One can also administer compositions at 24 hours apart, or even longer apart. Alternatively, two or more compositions can be administered simultaneously, e.g. less than 10 or less than 5 minutes apart. Compositions administered simultaneously can, in some aspects, be administered as a mixture, with or without similar or different time release mechanism for each of the components.","As used herein, \u201ccontacting\u201d refers to any suitable means for delivering, or exposing, an agent to at least one complex, enzyme, or cell. Exemplary delivery methods include, but are not limited to, direct delivery to cell culture medium, perfusion, injection, or other delivery method well known to one skilled in the art.","As used herein, \u201cobtain\u201d refers to any method of acquiring, securing, procuring, or coming into the possession of, e.g. a sample. Obtaining a biological sample from a subject can comprise physical removing a sample from a subject (e.g. drawing blood or taking a hair or saliva sample) without or without active participation from the subject; receiving a sample from a subject (e.g. the subject collects a saliva or hair sample themselves and provides it, e.g. in a container provided for the purpose); or procuring a sample from a storage facility, medical facility, or medical provider. Obtain from the human or subject, refers to an active step of, e.g., drawing blood or taking a tissue or cell sample.","As used herein, \u201ccholesterol level\u201d refers to a level of one or more of total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and\/or triglycerides. Cholesterol levels can be the level of cholesterol in the blood of a subject.","As used herein in reference to cholesterol levels, \u201cmaintain\u201d refers to preventing the level from worsening (e.g. increasing). In some embodiments, maintaining a particular level refers to a process that results in the cholesterol level not increasing by more than 10% over time. Maintaining may also refer to maintaining a previously achieved level. For example, if a human has received statin treatment, one can maintain the cholesterol level achieved using the statin treatment.","In some embodiments, the subject treated according to the methods described herein has previously had their cholesterol level reduced. As used herein, \u201cpreviously reduced\u201d indicates that at a prior point in time, the subject experienced a decrease in cholesterol levels. The decrease can be due to administration of a pharmaceutical composition (e.g. administration of a composition as described herein or another composition, e.g. a statin) or due to another cause, e.g. a change in diet and\/or exercise.","An existing treatment for high cholesterol levels is the administration of a statin. As referred to herein, a \u201cstatin\u201d (also known as HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors) are inhibitors of the enzyme HMG-coA reductase, which mediates cholesterol production in the liver. Statins, by competitively binding HMG-CoA reductase, prevent the binding of HMG-CoA to the enzyme and thereby inhibit the activity of the reductase (e.g. the production of mevalonate). Non-limiting examples of statins can include atorvastatin (LIPITOR\u2122), fluvastatin (LESCOL\u2122), lovastatin (MEVACOR\u2122, ALTOCOR\u2122), pitavastatin (LIVALO\u2122), pravastatin (PRAVACHOL\u2122) rosuvastatin (CRESTOR\u2122), and simvastatin (ZOCOR\u2122). Statins can be administered in combination with other agents, e.g. the combination of ezetimibe and simvastatin.","Some subjects are, or become, resistant to statin treatment. As used herein, \u201cresistant to statin treatment\u201d or \u201creduced responsiveness to statin treatment\u201d refers to a subject exhibiting a statistically significantly lower response to the administration of a statin as compared to a reference level. The reference level can be, e.g., the average response for a population of subjects or the level of the individual subject at an earlier date. A response to statin treatment is readily measured by one of skill in the art, e.g., measurement of cholesterol levels, changes in cholesterol levels, and\/or HMG-CoA reductase activity.","As used herein, the term \u201cdetectable label\u201d refers to a molecule or moiety that can be detected, e.g. measured and\/or determined to be present or absent.

Additionally or alternatively (and as further illustrated in the non-limiting Examples below), an optional aspect of the invention provides for matching of other features of the ligand to the patient's genotype or phenotype. In this respect, for example, the invention includes the ability to match amino acid sequence variation in a human patient to one or more ligand sequences or domains outside of the binding sites. For example, where the ligand comprises or consists of a human TOI-binding antibody or an anti-human TOI receptor Fc fusion, this aspect of the invention provides for more tailored matching of one or more constant region domains (eg, the Fc) to the patient genotype or phenotype. Additionally or alternatively, it is contemplated that sequence variation in the binding site can be similarly matched to the patient's genotype or phenotype. The present inventor has done this by considering the SNP occurrences in sequences encoding one or more parts of the ligand, eg, SNP occurrences in one, more or all of the gene segments from which the variable domain(s) and\/or constant region domain(s) are derived. The inventor realised that it would be desirable to match the ligand to one or more corresponding variant SNPs found in the patient to be treated therapeutically and\/or prophylactically. Matching could involve designing the ligand specifically for a patient of known phenotype and\/or genotype, or matching could involve choosing a ligand by determining that there is correspondence between variation in the patient's phenotype or genotype with the variation in the ligand amino acid and\/or corresponding nucleotides.","A key consideration for the inventor was the desire to promote compatibility of the ligand with the patient's body, and in particular, the possible patient immune system responses to administered ligands. For example, it has been observed that human patients receiving human or humanised antibody drugs may mount an immune response against the incoming antibody (a so-called HAHA response) which results in the patient producing anti-drug antibodies as a result of the patient's immune system recognising the drug as foreign. For example, studies have suggested that some patients receiving HUMIRA\u2122 (adalimumab), currently the biggest selling antibody medicine, mount a HAHA immune response against the medicine, and this may impact treatment adversely. Reference is made to JAMA. 2011; 305(14):1460-1468. doi:10.1001\/jama.2011.406: \u201cDevelopment of Antidrug Antibodies Against Adalimumab and Association With Disease Activity and Treatment Failure During Long-term Follow-up\u201d, GM Bartelds et al. The authors concluded that results of this study showed that development of antidrug antibodies was associated with a negative outcome of adalimumab treatment in human RA patients. It was reported that not only did patients with anti-adalimumab antibodies discontinue treatment more often and earlier than patients without anti-adalimumab antibodies, they also had a higher disease activity during treatment and only rarely came into remission. In addition, reportedly the data showed that two-thirds of the anti-adalimumab antibody-positive patients developed these antibodies in the first 28 weeks of treatment and that the presence of anti-adalimumab antibodies substantially influenced serum adalimumab concentrations.","This HAHA theme is, therefore, a significant concern and this has been considered by the regulatory authorities. For example, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has issued a \u201cGuideline on immunogenicity assessment of monoclonal antibodies intended for in vivo clinical use\u201d (available on the world wide web at ema.europa.eu\/docs\/en_GB\/documentlibrary\/Scientific_guideline\/2012\/06\/WC500128688.pdf; EMA\/CHMP\/BMWP\/86289\/2010, addendum to EMEA\/CHMP\/BMWP\/14327\/2006), which came into force on 1December 2012. As such, it is good practice for researchers to identify and assess risk of anti-antibody drug occurrence and effects.","The present aspect of the invention, by more closely tailoring the ligand itself (as well as its specificity) to the patient, helps to address these considerations when designing and administering anti-human TOI medicines for treating and\/or preventing human TOI-related diseases and conditions.","The inventor also considered the desirability to tailor the variation in the ligand constant region (eg, for an antibody or Fc-containing ligand), mindful that then the constant region being administered to the patient would be tuned to the various components, such as patient's Fc receptors, that would interact with the constant region in the patient. Good Fc\/Fc receptor interactions can be important for drug recycling (via the FcRn) to provide for useful half-lives in vivo or for use in cell killing, eg, for cancer indications. In this way it is possible, therefore, to tune the effector function of the constant region (eg, Fc) to the patient more closely, to promote efficacy. For example, more efficacious drugs are desirable for better patient treatment and may provide the possibility of lowered dosing and\/or dosing frequencies.","Thus, in examples of this aspect, the invention provides the following (set out as clauses):\u2014\n\n","Examples of Tailored Ligands","The inventor analysed amino acid variability and distribution amongst large representative human samples. The result of the analysis for example antibody gene segments is shown in Table 9.","In a first example, the inventor identified the possibility of addressing the rarer IGH-gamma-1 SNPs 204D (observed cumulative frequency of 0.296) and 206L (observed cumulative frequency of 0.283) individually or in combination. These residues are part of the CH3 domain, and as such they form part of antibody Fc regions. Thus, matching of these CH3 variations with the patient is especially beneficial for reasons as discussed above. Thus, this example provides aspects set out in the following clauses.\n\n","In a second example, the inventor identified the possibility of addressing IGH-gamma-2 SNPs. This included consideration of Fc region variation\u2014in this respect, the inventor focused on positions 161 and 257 which are in the Fc region. Thus, this example provides aspects set out in the following clauses.\n\n","In a third example, the inventor addressed human kappa constant region variation. Thus, the present aspect of the invention also provides the following.\n\n","In a fourth example, the inventor addressed human lambda constant region variation. Thus, this example provides aspects set out in the following clauses.\n\n","In a fifth example, the inventor addressed human heavy chain variable region variation. Thus, this example provides aspects set out in the following clauses.\n\n","In a sixth example, the inventor addressed human light chain variable region variation. Thus, this example provides aspects set out in the following clauses.\n\n","In a specific embodiment, the ligand, antibody or fragment of present invention comprises an Fc region, wherein the Fc region comprises at least one non-native amino acid residue selected from the group consisting of 234D, 234E, 234N, 234Q, 234T, 234H, 234Y, 2341, 234V, 234F, 235A, 235D, 235R, 235W, 235P, 235S, 235N, 235Q, 235T, 235H, 235Y, 235I, 235V, 235F, 236E, 239D, 239E, 239N, 239Q, 239F, 239T, 239H, 239Y, 240I, 240A, 240T, 240M, 241W, 241 L, 241Y, 241E, 241R. 243W, 243L 243Y, 243R, 243Q, 244H, 245A, 247L, 247V, 247G, 251F, 252Y, 254T, 255L, 256E, 256M, 262I, 262A, 262T, 262E, 263I, 263A, 263T, 263M, 264L, 264I, 264W, 264T, 264R, 264F, 264M, 264Y, 264E, 265G, 265N, 265Q, 265Y, 265F, 265V, 265I, 265L, 265H, 265T, 266I, 266A, 266T, 266M, 267Q, 267L, 268E, 269H, 269Y, 269F, 269R, 270E, 280A, 284M, 292P, 292L, 296E, 296Q, 296D, 296N, 296S, 296T, 296L, 296I, 296H, 269G, 297S, 297D, 297E, 298H, 298I, 298T, 298F, 299I, 299L, 299A, 299S, 299V, 299H, 299F, 299E, 305I, 313F, 316D, 325Q, 325L, 325I, 325D, 325E, 325A, 325T, 325V, 325H, 327G, 327W, 327N, 327L, 328S, 328M, 328D, 328E, 328N, 328Q, 328F, 328I, 328V, 328T, 328H, 328A, 329F, 329H, 329Q, 330K, 330G, 330T, 330C, 330L, 330Y, 330V, 330I, 330F, 330R, 330H, 331G, 331A, 331L, 331M, 331F, 331W, 331K, 331Q, 331E, 331S, 331V, 331I, 331C, 331Y, 331H, 331R, 331N, 331D, 331T, 332D, 332S, 332W, 332F, 332E, 332N, 332Q, 332T, 332H, 332Y, 332A, 339T, 370E, 370N, 378D, 392T, 396L, 416G, 419H, 421K, 440Y and 434W as numbered by the EU index as set forth in Kabat. Optionally, the Fc region may comprise additional and\/or alternative non-native amino acid residues known to one skilled in the art (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,624,821; 6,277,375; 6,737,056; PCT Patent Publications WO 01\/58957; WO 02\/06919; WO 04\/016750; WO 04\/029207; WO 04\/035752 and WO 05\/040217).","In an example the ligand, antibody or fragment comprises one or more human binding sites that specifically bind the TOI (eg, PCSK9, IL4Ra, IL6R, VEGFA or Nav1.7). In an embodiment, the binding sites comprise or consist of human antibody variable domains or human receptors for the TOI (eg, Human receptor binding sites for VEGFA). Furthermore, the ligand, antibody or fragment can be optionally fully human (eg, comprising human constant regions, eg, human Fc regions with or without human CL regions). In an example, the ligand is aflibercept, alirocumab, sarilumab or dupilumab. Fully human ligands maximise compatibility with the human patient when used in the context of the invention wherein the V and\/or C regions are tailored to the human genotype and\/or phenotype as per the description herein.","Some embodiments of the technology described herein can be defined according to any of the following numbered paragraphs:\n\n","Proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is a serine protease involved in regulating the levels of the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) protein (Horton et al., 2007; Seidah and Prat, 2007). In vitro experiments have shown that adding PCSK9 to HepG2 cells lowers the levels of cell surface LDLR (Benjannet et al., 2004; Lagace et al., 2006; Maxwell et al., 2005; Park et al., 2004). Experiments with mice have shown that increasing PCSK9 protein levels decreases levels of LDLR protein in the liver (Benjannet et al., 2004; Lagace et al., 2006; Maxwell et al., 2005; Park et al., 2004), while PCSK9 knockout mice have increased levels of LDLR in the liver (Rashid et al., 2005). Additionally, various human PCSK9 mutations that result in either increased or decreased levels of plasma LDL have been identified (Kotowski et al., 2006; Zhao et al., 2006). PCSK9 has been shown to directly interact with the LDLR protein, be endocytosed along with the LDLR, and co-immunofluoresce with the LDLR throughout the endosomal pathway (Lagace et al., 2006).","PCSK9 is a prohormone-proprotein convertase in the subtilisin (S8) family of serine proteases (Seidah et al., 2003). Humans have nine prohormone-proprotein convertases that can be divided between the S8A and S8B subfamilies (Rawlings et al., 2006). Furin, PC1\/PC3, PC2, PACE4, PC4, PC5\/PC6 and PC7\/PC8\/LPC\/SPC7 are classified in subfamily S8B. Crystal and NMR structures of different domains from mouse furin and PC1 reveal subtilisin-like pro- and catalytic domains, and a P domain directly C-terminal to the catalytic domain (Henrich et al., 2003; Tangrea et al., 2002). Based on the amino acid sequence similarity within this subfamily, all seven members are predicted to have similar structures (Henrich et al., 2005). SKI-1\/S1P and PCSK9 are classified in subfamily SBA. Sequence comparisons with these proteins also suggest the presence of subtilisin-like pro- and catalytic domains (Sakai et al., 1998; Seidah et al., 2003; Seidah et al., 1999). In these proteins the amino acid sequence C-terminal to the catalytic domain is more variable and does not suggest the presence of a P domain.","Prohormone-proprotein convertases are expressed as zymogens and they mature through a multi step process. The function of the pro-domain in this process is two-fold. The pro-domain first acts as a chaperone and is required for proper folding of the catalytic domain (Ikemura et al., 1987). Once the catalytic domain is folded, autocatalysis occurs between the pro-domain and catalytic domain. Following this initial cleavage reaction, the pro-domain remains bound to the catalytic domain where it then acts as an inhibitor of catalytic activity (Fu et al., 2000). When conditions are correct, maturation proceeds with a second autocatalytic event at a site within the pro-domain (Anderson et al., 1997). After this second cleavage event occurs the pro-domain and catalytic domain dissociate, giving rise to an active protease.","Autocatalysis of the PCSK9 zymogen occurs between Gln152 and Ser153 (VFAQ|SIP (SEQ ID NO: 116)) (Naureckiene et al., 2003), and has been shown to be required for its secretion from cells (Seidah et al., 2003). A second autocatalytic event at a site within PCSK9's pro-domain has not been observed. Purified PCSK9 is made up of two species that can be separated by non-reducing SDS-PAGE; the pro-domain at 17 Kd, and the catalytic plus C-terminal domains at 65 Kd. PCSK9 has not been isolated without its inhibitory pro-domain, and measurements of PCSK9's catalytic activity have been variable (Naureckiene et al., 2003; Seidah et al., 2003).","In certain embodiments, a PCSK9 polypeptide includes terminal residues, such as, but not limited to, leader sequence residues, targeting residues, amino terminal methionine residues, lysine residues, tag residues and\/or fusion protein residues. \u201cPCSK9\u201d has also been referred to as FH3, NARC1, HCHOLA3, proprotein convertase subtilisin\/kexin type 9, and neural apoptosis regulated convertase 1. The PCSK9 gene encodes a proprotein convertase protein that belongs to the proteinase K subfamily of the secretory subtilase family. The term \u201cPCSK9\u201d denotes both the proprotein and the product generated following autocatalysis of the proprotein. When only the autocatalyzed product is being referred to (such as for an antigen binding protein or ligand that binds to the cleaved PCSK9), the protein can be referred to as the \u201cmature,\u201d \u201ccleaved\u201d, \u201cprocessed\u201d or \u201cactive\u201d PCSK9. When only the inactive form is being referred to, the protein can be referred to as the \u201cinactive\u201d, \u201cpro-form\u201d, or \u201cunprocessed\u201d form of PCSK9. The term PCSK9 also encompasses PCSK9 molecules incorporating post-translational modifications of the PCSK9 amino acid sequence, such as PCSK9 sequences that have been glycosylated, PCSK9 sequences from which its signal sequence has been cleaved, PCSK9 sequence from which its pro domain has been cleaved from the catalytic domain but not separated from the catalytic domain (see, e.g., FIGS. 1A and 1B of US20120093818A1; which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety).","The present invention provides anti-PCSK9 ligands; and PCSK9-binding or targeting ligands as described herein. The ligands have a variety of utilities. Some of the ligands, for instance, are useful in specific binding assays, for genotyping or phenotyping humans, affinity purification of PCSK9, in particular human PCSK9 or its ligands and in screening assays to identify other antagonists of PCSK9 activity. Some of the ligands of the invention are useful for inhibiting binding of PCSK9 to LDLR, or inhibiting PCSK9-mediated activities.","Anti-PCSK9 ligands (eg, antibodies and anti-sense RNA) have been developed based on targeting and neutralising so-called \u201cwild-type\u201d human PCSK9, which is a commonly-occurring form (see, eg, US20120093818A1 and US20110065902A1; each of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety). While such therapies are useful for human patients harbouring this form of human PCSK9, the inventor considered it useful to investigate the possibility of targeting much rarer\u2014but still naturally-occurring\u2014forms of PCSK9 amongst human populations. In this way, the inventor arrived at insight into the natural occurrences and distributions of rarer human PCSK9 forms that can serve as useful targets (at the protein or nucleic acid level) for human treatment, prophylaxis and diagnosis pertinent to diseases and conditions mediated or associated with PCSK9 activity. This particularly provides for tailored therapies, prophylaxis and diagnosis in humans that are devoid of the common PCSK9 gene or protein (ie, the form a or a\u2032 as used in US20120093818A1 and US20110065902A1 to generate antibodies).","The skilled person will know that SNPs or other changes that translate into amino acid variation can cause variability in activity and\/or conformation of human targets to be addressed. This has spawned great interest in personalized medicine where genotyping and knowledge of protein and nucleotide variability is used to more effectively tailor medicines and diagnosis of patients. The invention, therefore, provides for tailored pharmaceuticals and testing that specifically addresses rarer PCSK9 polymorphic variant forms. Such forms or \u201calleles\u201d (at the nucleotide level), in many of the examples determined by the inventor, comprise multiple changes at the nucleotide and amino acid levels from the corresponding common form nucleotide and amino acids sequences, ie, there are multiple non-synonymous changes at the nucleotide level that translate into multiple corresponding changes in the protein target in humans.","Furthermore, the inventor surprisingly realised that the rarer natural forms, although present in humans at much lower frequencies than the common form, nevertheless are represented in multiple and ethnically-diverse human populations and usually with many human examples per represented ethnic population. Thus, the inventor realised that targeting such rarer forms would provide for effective treatment, prophylaxis or diagnosis across many human ethnic populations, thereby extending the utility of the present invention.","With this realisation, the inventor realised that there is significant industrial and medical application for the invention in terms of guiding the choice of anti-PCSK9 ligand for administration to human patients for therapy and\/or prophylaxis of PCSK9-mediated or associated diseases or conditions. In this way, the patient receives drugs and ligands that are tailored to their needs\u2014as determined by the patient's genetic or phenotypic makeup. Hand-in-hand with this, the invention provides for the genotyping and\/or phenotyping of patients in connection with such treatment, thereby allowing a proper match of drug to patient. This increases the chances of medical efficacy, reduces the likelihood of inferior treatment using drugs or ligands that are not matched to the patient (eg, poor efficacy and\/or side-effects) and avoids pharmaceutical mis-prescription and waste.","In developing this thinking, the present inventor decided to determine a set of human PCSK9 variants on the basis of the following criteria, these being criteria that the inventor realised would provide for useful medical drugs and diagnostics to tailored need in the human population. The inventor selected variants having at least 3 of the 4 following criteria:\u2014\n\n","On the basis of these criteria, the inventor identified the variants listed in Table 1 below (excluding form a).","The inventor's selection included, as a consideration, selection for nucleotide variation that produced amino acid variation in corresponding PCSK9 forms (ie, non-synonymous variations), as opposed to silent variations that do not alter amino acid residues in the target

While modifications in lifestyle and conventional drug treatment are often successful in reducing cholesterol levels, not all patients are able to achieve the recommended target cholesterol levels with such approaches. Various conditions, such as familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), appear to be resistant to lowering of LDL-C levels in spite of aggressive use of conventional therapy. Homozygous and heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (hoFH, heFH) is a condition associated with premature atherosclerotic vascular disease. However, patients diagnosed with hoFH are largely unresponsive to conventional drug therapy and have limited treatment options. Specifically, treatment with statins, which reduce LDL-C by inhibiting cholesterol synthesis and upregulating the hepatic LDL receptor, may have little effect in patients whose LDL receptors are non-existent or defective. A mean LDL-C reduction of only less than about 20% has been recently reported in patients with genotype-confirmed hoFH treated with the maximal dose of statins. The addition of ezetimibe 10 mg\/day to this regimen resulted in a total reduction of LDL-C levels of 27%, which is still far from optimal. Likewise, many patients are statin non-responsive, poorly controlled with statin therapy, or cannot tolerate statin therapy; in general, these patients are unable to achieve cholesterol control with alternative treatments. There is a large unmet medical need for new treatments that can address the short-comings of current treatment options.","Specific populations treatable by the therapeutic methods of the invention include patients indicated for LDL apheresis, subjects with PCSK9-activating (GOF) mutations, heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia (heFH); subjects with primary hypercholesterolemia who are statin intolerant or statin uncontrolled; and subjects at risk for developing hypercholesterolemia who may be preventably treated.","Therapeutic Administration and Formulations","The invention provides therapeutic compositions comprising the anti-PCSK9 ligands, antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof of the present invention. The administration of therapeutic compositions in accordance with the invention will be administered with suitable carriers, excipients, and other agents that are incorporated into formulations to provide improved transfer, delivery, tolerance, and the like. A multitude of appropriate formulations can be found in the formulary known to all pharmaceutical chemists: Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa. These formulations include, for example, powders, pastes, ointments, jellies, waxes, oils, lipids, lipid (cationic or anionic) containing vesicles (such as LIPOFECTINT\u2122), DNA conjugates, anhydrous absorption pastes, oil-in-water and water-in-oil emulsions, emulsions carbowax (polyethylene glycols of various molecular weights), semi-solid gels, and semi-solid mixtures containing carbowax. See also Powell et al. \u201cCompendium of excipients for parenteral formulations\u201d PDA (1998) J Pharm Sci Technol 52:238-311.","The dose may vary depending upon the age and the size of a subject to be administered, target disease, conditions, route of administration, and the like. When the ligand, eg, antibody, of the present invention is used for treating various conditions and diseases associated with PCSK9, including hypercholesterolemia, disorders associated with LDL and apolipoprotein B, and lipid metabolism disorders, and the like, in an adult patient, it is advantageous to intravenously administer the ligand or antibody of the present invention normally at a single dose of about 0.01 to about 20 mg\/kg body weight, more preferably about 0.02 to about 7, about 0.03 to about 5, or about 0.05 to about 3 mg\/kg body weight. Depending on the severity of the condition, the frequency and the duration of the treatment can be adjusted.","Various delivery systems are known and can be used to administer the pharmaceutical composition of the invention, thus the composition invention provides the ligand by e.g., encapsulation in liposomes, microparticles, microcapsules, recombinant cells capable of expressing the mutant viruses, receptor mediated endocytosis (see, e.g., Wu et al. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262:4429-4432). Methods of introduction include, but are not limited to, intradermal, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intravenous, subcutaneous, intranasal, epidural, and oral routes. The composition may be administered by any convenient route, for example by infusion or bolus injection, by absorption through epithelial or mucocutaneous linings (e.g., oral mucosa, rectal and intestinal mucosa, etc.) and may be administered together with other biologically active agents. Administration can be systemic or local.","The pharmaceutical composition can be also delivered in a vesicle, in particular a liposome (see Langer (1990) Science 249:1527-1533; Treat et al. (1989) in Liposomes in the Therapy of Infectious Disease and Cancer, Lopez Berestein and Fidler (eds.), Liss, New York, pp. 353-365; Lopez-Berestein, ibid., pp. 317-327; see generally ibid.).","In certain situations, the pharmaceutical composition can be delivered in a controlled release system. In one embodiment, a pump may be used (see Langer, supra; Sefton (1987) CRC Crit. Ref. Biomed. Eng. 14:201). In another embodiment, polymeric materials can be used; see, Medical Applications of Controlled Release, Langer and Wise (eds.), CRC Pres., Boca Raton, Fla. (1974). In yet another embodiment, a controlled release system can be placed in proximity of the composition's target, thus requiring only a fraction of the systemic dose (see, e.g., Goodson, in Medical Applications of Controlled Release, supra, vol. 2, pp. 115-138, 1984).","The injectable preparations may include dosage forms for intravenous, subcutaneous, intracutaneous and intramuscular injections, drip infusions, etc. These injectable preparations may be prepared by methods publicly known. For example, the injectable preparations may be prepared, e.g., by dissolving, suspending or emulsifying the antibody or its salt described above in a sterile aqueous medium or an oily medium conventionally used for injections. As the aqueous medium for injections, there are, for example, physiological saline, an isotonic solution containing glucose and other auxiliary agents, etc., which may be used in combination with an appropriate solubilizing agent such as an alcohol (e.g., ethanol), a polyalcohol (e.g., propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol), a nonionic surfactant [e.g., polysorbate 80, HCO-50 (polyoxyethylene (50 mol) adduct of hydrogenated castor oil)], etc. As the oily medium, there are employed, e.g., sesame oil, soybean oil, etc., which may be used in combination with a solubilizing agent such as benzyl benzoate, benzyl alcohol, etc. The injection thus prepared is preferably filled in an appropriate ampoule. A pharmaceutical composition of the present invention can be delivered subcutaneously or intravenously with a standard needle and syringe. In addition, with respect to subcutaneous delivery, a pen delivery device readily has applications in delivering a pharmaceutical composition of the present invention. Such a pen delivery device can be reusable or disposable. A reusable pen delivery device generally utilizes a replaceable cartridge that contains a pharmaceutical composition. Once all of the pharmaceutical composition within the cartridge has been administered and the cartridge is empty, the empty cartridge can readily be discarded and replaced with a new cartridge that contains the pharmaceutical composition. The pen delivery device can then be reused. In a disposable pen delivery device, there is no replaceable cartridge. Rather, the disposable pen delivery device comes prefilled with the pharmaceutical composition held in a reservoir within the device. Once the reservoir is emptied of the pharmaceutical composition, the entire device is discarded.","Numerous reusable pen and autoinjector delivery devices have applications in the subcutaneous delivery of a pharmaceutical composition of the present invention. Examples include, but certainly are not limited to AUTOPEN\u2122 (Owen Mumford, Inc., Woodstock, UK), DISETRONIC\u2122 pen (Disetronic Medical Systems, Burghdorf, Switzerland), HUMALOG MIX 75\/25\u2122 pen, HUMALOG\u2122 pen, HUMALIN 70\/30\u2122 pen (Eli Lilly and Co., Indianapolis, Ind.), NOVOPEN\u2122I, II and III (Novo Nordisk, Copenhagen, Denmark), NOVOPEN JUNIOR\u2122 (Novo Nordisk, Copenhagen, Denmark), BD\u2122 pen (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, N.J.), OPTIPENT\u2122, OPTIPEN PRO\u2122, OPTIPEN STARLET\u2122, and OPTICLIKT\u2122 (sanofi-aventis, Frankfurt, Germany), to name only a few.

Such dosage forms in a unit dose include, for example, tablets, pills, capsules, injections (ampoules), suppositories, etc. The amount of the aforesaid antibody contained is generally about 5 to about 500 mg per dosage form in a unit dose; especially in the form of injection, it is preferred that the aforesaid antibody is contained in about 5 to about 100 mg and in about 10 to about 250 mg for the other dosage forms.","The invention provides therapeutic methods in which the ligand, eg, antibody or antibody fragment, of the invention is useful to treat hypercholesterolemia associated with a variety of conditions involving hPCSK9. The anti-PCSK9 ligands, eg, antibodies or antibody fragments, of the invention are particularly useful for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia and the like. Combination therapies may include the anti-PCSK9 ligand of the invention with, for example, one or more of any agent that (1) induces a cellular depletion of cholesterol synthesis by inhibiting 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-coenzyme A (CoA) reductase, such as cerivastatin, atorvastatin, simvastatin, pitavastatin, rosuvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin; (2) inhibits cholesterol uptake and or bile acid re-absorption; (3) increase lipoprotein catabolism (such as niacin); and activators of the LXR transcription factor that plays a role in cholesterol elimination such as 22-hydroxycholesterol or fixed combinations such as ezetimibe plus simvastatin; a statin with a bile resin (e.g., cholestyramine, colestipol, colesevelam), a fixed combination of niacin plus a statin (e.g., niacin with lovastatin); or with other lipid lowering agents such as omega-3-fatty acid ethyl esters (for example, omacor).","Tailoring Antibodies to Rare PCSK9 Variant Profile","As outline above, the invention includes the possibility to tailor treatment of humans further by selecting antibody-based ligands with variable domains based on gene segments commonly found in humans of the ethnic populations where the variant PCSK9 forms are found to meet the selection criteria of the invention. An example is provided below for ligands comprising antibody VH domains derived from recombination of human VH3-23.","The inventor analysed the frequencies and distribution of various human VH3-23 alleles and realised the desirability of using ligands based on human VH3-23 alleles comprising SNP rs56069819. This SNP corresponds to a change from leucine at position 24 in the encoded protein sequence to a valine at that position (L24V change) and the SNP is at coordinate 106268889 on human chromosome 14.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0965","num":"1340"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},"Notably, human VH3-23 alleles comprising SNP rs56069819 were found in the CEU population at a frequency that is almost double the frequency of 11% for all populations.

Binding curves were double referenced using a buffer injection (i.e. 0 nM) to remove baseline drift and injection artefacts. Regeneration of the capture surface was with 100 mM phosphoric acid which removed the captured antibody allowing another cycle of capture and binding. The binding sensorgrams generated were analysed using the 1:1 model inherent to the ProteOn XPR36 Array system analysis software.

IL-4 has been shown to possess a broad spectrum of biological activities, including growth stimulation of T cells, mast cells, granulocytes, megakaryocytes and erythrocytes. IL-4 induces the expression of class II major histocompatibility complex molecules in resting B cells, and enhances the secretion of IgE and IgGI isotypes by stimulated B cells","In an example, the invention provides a method of treating or reducing the risk of an IL4Ra-mediated disease or condition in a human in need thereof, the method comprising administering to said human a ligand (eg, an antibody or antibody fragment) that specifically binds a human IL4RA protein. The invention also provides a corresponding ligand.","The present invention provides anti-IL4Ra ligands; and IL4Ra-binding or targeting ligands as described herein. The ligands have a variety of utilities. Some of the ligands, for instance, are useful in specific binding assays, for genotyping or phenotyping humans, affinity purification of IL4Ra, in particular human IL4Ra or its ligands and in screening assays to identify other antagonists of IL4Ra activity. Some of the ligands of the invention are useful for inhibiting binding of IL4Ra to IL4, or inhibiting IL4Ra-mediated activities.","Anti-IL4Ra ligands (eg, antibodies and anti-sense RNA) have been developed based on targeting and neutralising so-called \u201cwild-type\u201d human IL4Ra, which is a commonly-occurring form (see, eg, SEQ ID NO: 67). While such therapies are useful for human patients harbouring this form of human IL4RA, the inventor considered it useful to investigate the possibility of targeting rarer\u2014but still naturally-occurring\u2014forms of IL4Ra amongst human populations. In this way, the inventor arrived at insight into the natural occurrences and distributions of rarer human IL4Ra forms that can serve as useful targets (at the protein or nucleic acid level) for human treatment, prophylaxis and diagnosis pertinent to diseases and conditions mediated or associated with IL4RA activity. This particularly provides for tailored therapies, prophylaxis and diagnosis in humans that are devoid of the common IL4Ra gene or protein.","The skilled person will know that SNPs or other changes that translate into amino acid variation can cause variability in activity and\/or conformation of human targets to be addressed. This has spawned great interest in personalized medicine where genotyping and knowledge of protein and nucleotide variability is used to more effectively tailor medicines and diagnosis of patients. The invention, therefore, provides for tailored pharmaceuticals and testing that specifically addresses rarer IL4Ra polymorphic variant forms. Such forms or \u201calleles\u201d (at the nucleotide level), comprise one or more changes at the nucleotide and amino acid levels from the corresponding common form nucleotide and amino acids sequences, ie, there are one or more non-synonymous changes at the nucleotide level that translate into one or more corresponding changes in the protein target in humans.","Furthermore, the inventor surprisingly realised that the rarer natural forms, although present in humans at much lower frequencies than the common form, nevertheless are represented in multiple and ethnically-diverse human populations and usually with many human examples per represented ethnic population. Thus, the inventor realised that targeting such rarer forms would provide for effective treatment, prophylaxis or diagnosis across many human ethnic populations, thereby extending the utility of the present invention.","With this realisation, the inventor realised that there is significant industrial and medical application for the invention in terms of guiding the choice of anti-IL4Ra ligand for administration to human patients for therapy and\/or prophylaxis of IL4Ra-mediated or associated diseases or conditions. In this way, the patient receives drugs and ligands that are tailored to their needs\u2014as determined by the patient's genetic or phenotypic makeup. Hand-in-hand with this, the invention provides for the genotyping and\/or phenotyping of patients in connection with such treatment, thereby allowing a proper match of drug to patient. This increases the chances of medical efficacy, reduces the likelihood of inferior treatment using drugs or ligands that are not matched to the patient (eg, poor efficacy and\/or side-effects) and avoids pharmaceutical mis-prescription and waste.","In developing this thinking, in this non-limiting example the present inventor decided to determine a set of human IL4Ra variants on the basis of the following criteria, these being criteria that the inventor realised would provide for useful medical drugs and diagnostics to tailored need in the human population. The inventor selected variants having at least 3 of the 4 following criteria:\u2014","Naturally-occurring human IL4Ra variation having a cumulative human allele frequency of 35% or less;","Naturally-occurring human IL4Ra variation having a total human genotype frequency of about 50% or less;","Naturally-occurring human IL4Ra variation found in many different human ethnic populations (using the standard categorisation of the 1000 Genomes Project; see Table 2 below); and","Naturally-occurring human IL4Ra variation found in many individuals distributed across such many different ethnic populations.","On the basis of these criteria, the inventor identified variants listed in Table 11 below. The inventor's selection included, as an additional or alternative consideration, selection for nucleotide variation that produced amino acid variation in corresponding IL4Ra forms (ie, non-synonymous variations), as opposed to silent variations that do not alter amino acid residues in the target protein.","In an example, the invention provides a method of treating or reducing the risk of an IL4Ra-mediated disease or condition in a human in need thereof, the method comprising administering to said human a ligand (eg, an antibody or antibody fragment) that specifically binds a human IL4RA protein that comprises a mutation selected from the group consisting of I75V, E400A, C431R, S503P, Q576R and S752A in SEQ ID NO: 67.

Human IL-4 receptor alpha (h1L-4Ra) is described in, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,599,905, 5,767,065, and 5,840,869. Antibodies to h1L-4R are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,717,072.","Methods for using antibodies to h1L-4R are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,714,146; 5,985,280; and 6,716,587.","The human IL-4Ra (aka IL-4Ra) subunit (Swiss Prot accession number P24394) is a 140 kDa type 1 membrane protein that binds human IL-4 with a high affinity (Andrews et al J. Biol. Chem (2002) 277:46073-46078). The IL-4\/IL-4Ra complex can dimerize with either the common gamma chain (yc, CD132) or the IL-13Ralpha1 (IL-13Ra1) subunit, via domains on IL-4, to create two different signalling complexes, commonly referred to as Type I and Type II receptors, respectively. Alternatively, IL-13 can bind IL-13Ra1 to form an IL-13\/IL-13Ra1 complex that recruits the IL-4Ra subunit to form a Type II receptor complex. Thus, IL-4Ra mediates the biological activities of both IL-4 and IL-13 (reviewed by Gessner et al, Immunobiology, 201:285, 2000). In vitro studies have shown that IL-4 and IL-13 activate effector functions in a number of cell types, for example in T cells, B cells, eosinophils, mast cells, basophils, airway smooth muscle cells, respiratory epithelial cells, lung fibroblasts, and endothelial cells (reviewed by Steinke et al, Resp Res, 2:66, 2001, and by Willis-Karp, Immunol Rev, 202:175, 2004).","IL-4 by binding to its receptor (IL-4R) is essential for the development of airway inflammation present in asthma, through the induction of IgE synthesis in B cells and differentiation of T cells to a Th2 phenotype. Dupilumab is a monoclonal antibody designed for the treatment of atopic diseases. It binds to the alpha subunit of the interleukin-4 receptor. Through blockade of IL-4R alpha, dupilumab modulates signaling of both the IL-4 and IL-13 pathway, which have been implicated in the pathophysiology of allergic disease. Anti-IL4Ra ligands, antibodies and fragments according to the invention can, for example, be used for treating or reducing the risk of allergic disease.","In an example, the ligand, antibody or fragment is for treating or reducing the risk of (or treats or reduces the risk of) allergic asthma, eosinophilic asthma or atopic dermatitis, optionally wherein the antibody is dupilumab.","In addition to its role in asthma, IL-4Ra has been linked with a number of other pathologies, e.g. as follows (anti-IL4Ra ligands, antibodies and fragments according to the invention can, for example, be used for treating or reducing the risk of any one of these diseases or conditions):","Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) includes patient populations with varying degrees of chronic bronchitis, small airway disease and emphysema and is characterised by progressive irreversible lung function decline that responds poorly to current asthma based therapy. The underlying causes of COPD remain poorly understood. The \u201cDutch hypothesis\u201d proposes that there is a common susceptibility to COPD and asthma and therefore, that similar mechanisms may contribute to the pathogenesis of both disorders (Sluiter et al., Eur Respir J,). Zheng et al (J Clin Invest, 106(9):1081-93, 2000) have demonstrated that overexpression oflL-13 in the mouse lung caused emphysema, elevated mucus production and inflammation, reflecting aspects of human COPD. Furthermore, AHR, an IL-13 dependent response in murine models of allergic inflammation, has been shown to be predictive of lung function decline in smokers (Tashkin et al., Am J Respir Crit Care Med, 153(6 Pt 1):1802-11, 1996). A link has also been established between an IL-13 promoter polymorphism and susceptibility to develop COPD (Van Der Pouw Kraan et al., Genes Immun, 3(7): 436-9, 2002). The signs are therefore that IL-4\/IL-13 pathway, and in particular IL-13, plays an important role in the pathogenesis of COPD.","In addition to asthma, the IL-4\/11-13 pathway has been linked to other fibrotic conditions, like systemic sclerosis (Hasegawa et al., J Rheumatol, 24(2):328-32, 1997), pulmonary fibrosis (Hancock et al., Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol, 18(1): 60-5, 1998), parasite-induced liver fibrosis (Fallon et al., J Immunol, 164(5): 2585-91, 2000; Chiaramonte et al., J Clin Invest, 104(6): 777-85, 1999; Chiaramonte Hepatology 34(2):273-82, 2001), and cystic fibrosis (Hauber et al. J. Cyst Fibr, 2:189, 2003).","IL-4 and to some extent IL-13, are crucial for B cell mediated activities, such as B cell proliferation, immunoglobulin secretion, and expression of FcepsilonR. Clinical applications of an IL-4Ra inhibitor include for example, use in allergy therapy to suppress IgE synthesis (including for example atopic dermatitis and food allergy), use in transplation therapy to prevent transplant rejection, as well as suppression of delayed-type hypersensitivity or contact hypersensitivity reactions.","Il-4R antagonists may also find use as adjuvants to allergy immunotherapy and as vaccine adjuvants.","IL-4Ra polymorphisms in the human population have been described (reviewed by Gessner et al, Immunobiology, 201:285, 2000) and association with IgE levels or clinical atopy has been reported in some populations. For instance, V75R576 IL-4Ra is associated with allergic asthma and enhanced IL-4Ra function (Risma et al. J. Immunol. 169(3):1604-1610, 2002).","Anti-IL4Ra ligands, antibodies and fragments according to the invention optionally neutralise IL-4Ra with high potency, for example as described in more detail in the Examples of EP2604628. Neutralisation means inhibition of a biological activity mediated by IL-4Ra. Ligands, antibodies and fragments according to the invention may neutralise one or more activities mediated by IL-4Ra. The inhibited biological activity is likely mediated by prevention of IL-4Ra forming a signalling complex with gamma chain (or IL-13Ra) and either of the associated soluble ligands, e.g. IL-4 or IL-13.","Neutralisation of IL-4 or IL-13 signalling through its IL-4Ra containing receptor complex may be measured by inhibition of IL-4 or IL-13 stimulated TF-1 cell proliferation.","The ligand, antibody or fragment according to the invention is, for example, dupilumab or any one disclosed in WO 08\/054606 (Regeneron), EP2604628 (Medimmune), WO 01\/92340 (immnunex) or WO 05\/047331 (Immunex), the disclosures of which (including the sequences, eg, VH, VL and heavy and light chain sequences) are incorporated herein by reference for potential inclusion in one or more claims herein.

Voltage-gated sodium channels play a critical role in the generation and conduction of action potentials and are thus important for electrical signalling by most excitable cells. Sodium channels are integral membrane proteins and are comprised of a large a subunit, which forms the voltage-sensitive and ion-selective pore, and smaller auxiliary \u03b2 subunit(s) that can modulate the kinetics and voltage dependence of channel gating. To date, we know of 9 isoforms of the sodium-channel a subunit (Nav1.1-Nav1.9), each with a unique central and peripheral nervous system distribution. Four closely related sodium channels (Nav1.1, -1.2, -1.3, and -1.7) are encoded by a set of 4 genes (SCN1A, SCN2A, SCN3A, and SCN9A, respectively) located within a cluster on chromosome 2q24.3. Nav1.7 has a critical role in pain sensation. Furthermore, from KO studies and animal pain models, it would appear that Nav1.7 plays a major role in inflammatory pain.","Nav1.7 is located in peripheral neurons and plays an important role in action potential production in these cells. Recent genetic studies have identified Nav1.7 dysfunction in three different human pain disorders. Gain-of-function missense mutations in Nav1.7 have been shown to cause primary erythermalgia (PE) and paroxysmal extreme pain disorder (PEPD), while nonsense mutations in Nav1.7 result in loss of Nav1.7 function and a condition known as channelopathy-associated insensitivity to pain (CIP), a rare disorder in which affected individuals are unable to feel physical pain. Recent work has shown that different types of channelopathies (diseases caused by disturbed function of ion channel subunits or the proteins that regulate them), all involving the same Nav1.7 sodium channel, underlie these disorders.","Nav1.7 is encoded by SCN9A, a 113.5-kb gene comprising 26 exons (OMIM 603415) (, Drenth & Waxman) The encoded sodium channel is composed of 1977 amino acids organized into 4 domains, each with 6 transmembrane segments, and is predominantly expressed in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons and sympathetic ganglion neurons (, Drenth & Waxman) Immunohistochemical studies show that Nav1.7 is present at the distal ends of the wire-like projections of neurons known as neurites, close to the impulse trigger zone where neuronal firing is initiated. Interestingly, the large majority of DRG neurons that express Nav1.7 are pain sensing (nociceptive), suggesting a role for this sodium channel in the pathogenesis of pain.","Cell. 2014 Jun. 5; 157(6):1393-404. doi: 10.1016\/j.cell.2014.03.064. Epub 2014 May 22; \u201cA monoclonal antibody that targets a NaV1.7 channel voltage sensor for pain and itch relief\u201d, Lee J H et al and 2011 (both incorporated herein by reference) describe the generation of a monoclonal antibody against human Nav1.7.","In an example, the invention provides a method of treating or reducing the risk of a Nav1.7-mediated disease or condition in a human in need thereof, the method comprising administering to said human a ligand (eg, an antibody or antibody fragment) that specifically binds a human Nav1.7 protein. The invention also provides a corresponding ligand.","The present invention provides anti-Nav1.7 ligands; and Nav1.7-binding or targeting ligands as described herein. The ligands have a variety of utilities. Some of the ligands, for instance, are useful in specific binding assays, for genotyping or phenotyping humans, affinity purification of Nav1.7, in particular human Nav1.7 or its ligands and in screening assays to identify other antagonists of Nav1.7 activity. Some of the ligands of the invention are useful for inhibiting Nav1.7-mediated activities.","Anti-Nav1.7 ligands (eg, antibodies and anti-sense RNA) have been developed based on targeting and neutralising so-called \u201cwild-type\u201d human Nav1.7, which is a commonly-occurring form (see, eg, SEQ ID NO: 75). While such therapies are useful for human patients harbouring this form of human NAV1.7, the inventor considered it useful to investigate the possibility of targeting rarer\u2014but still naturally-occurring\u2014forms of Nav1.7 amongst human populations. In this way, the inventor arrived at insight into the natural occurrences and distributions of rarer human Nav1.7 forms that can serve as useful targets (at the protein or nucleic acid level) for human treatment, prophylaxis and diagnosis pertinent to diseases and conditions mediated or associated with NAV1.7 activity. This particularly provides for tailored therapies, prophylaxis and diagnosis in humans that are devoid of the common Nav1.7 gene or protein.","The skilled person will know that SNPs or other changes that translate into amino acid variation can cause variability in activity and\/or conformation of human targets to be addressed. This has spawned great interest in personalized medicine where genotyping and knowledge of protein and nucleotide variability is used to more effectively tailor medicines and diagnosis of patients. The invention, therefore, provides for tailored pharmaceuticals and testing that specifically addresses rarer Nav1.7 polymorphic variant forms. Such forms or \u201calleles\u201d (at the nucleotide level), comprise one or more changes at the nucleotide and amino acid levels from the corresponding common form nucleotide and amino acids sequences, ie, there are one or more non-synonymous (aka \u201cmissense\u201d) changes at the nucleotide level that translate into one or more corresponding changes in the protein target in humans.","Furthermore, the inventor surprisingly realised that the rarer natural forms, although present in humans at much lower frequencies than the common form, nevertheless are represented in multiple and ethnically-diverse human populations and usually with many human examples per represented ethnic population. Thus, the inventor realised that targeting such rarer forms would provide for effective treatment, prophylaxis or diagnosis across many human ethnic populations, thereby extending the utility of the present invention.","With this realisation, the inventor saw that there is significant industrial and medical application for the invention in terms of guiding the choice of anti-Nav1.7 ligand for administration to human patients for therapy and\/or prophylaxis of Nav1.7-mediated or associated diseases or conditions. In this way, the patient receives drugs and ligands that are tailored to their needs\u2014as determined by the patient's genetic or phenotypic makeup. Hand-in-hand with this, the invention provides for the genotyping and\/or phenotyping of patients in connection with such treatment, thereby allowing a proper match of drug to patient. This increases the chances of medical efficacy, reduces the likelihood of inferior treatment using drugs or ligands that are not matched to the patient (eg, poor efficacy and\/or side-effects) and avoids pharmaceutical mis-prescription and waste.","In developing this thinking, in this non-limiting example the present inventor decided to determine a set of human Nav1.7 variants on the basis of the following criteria, these being criteria that the inventor realised would provide for useful medical drugs and diagnostics to tailored need in the human population. The inventor selected variants having at least 3 of the 4 following criteria:\u2014","Naturally-occurring human Nav1.7 variation having a cumulative human allele frequency of 35% or less;","Naturally-occurring human Nav1.7 variation having a total human genotype frequency of about 50% or less;","Naturally-occurring human Nav1.7 variation found in many different human ethnic populations (using the standard categorisation of the 1000 Genomes Project; see Table 2 below); and","Naturally-occurring human Nav1.7 variation found in many individuals distributed across such many different ethnic populations.","On the basis of these criteria, the inventor identified variants listed in Table 12 (see Further Variants) below. The inventor's selection included, as an additional or alternative consideration, selection for nucleotide variation that produced amino acid variation in corresponding Nav1.7 forms (ie, non-synonymous variations), as opposed to silent variations that do not alter amino acid residues in the target protein.","In an example, the invention provides a method of treating or reducing the risk of a Nav1.7-mediated disease or condition in a human in need thereof, the method comprising administering to said human a ligand (eg, an antibody or antibody fragment) that specifically binds a human Nav1.7 protein that comprises an amino acid selected from the group consisting of 136I, 216S, 241T, 395K, 848T, 858H, 858F, 863P, 1449V, 996C, 1298F, 1298D, 1299F, 1461T, 1462V, 1464I, 1627K, 277X (wherein X is an amino acid other than R), 328X (wherein X is an amino acid other than Y), 395K, 459X (wherein X is an amino acid other than S), 693 X (wherein X is an amino acid other than E), 767X (wherein X is an amino acid other than I), 830X (wherein X is an amino acid other than R), 897X (wherein X is an amino acid other than W), 1200L, 1235L, 1488X (wherein X is an amino acid other than R), 1659X (wherein X is an amino acid other than K), 1689X (wherein X is an amino acid other than W), 422D, 490N, 943L, 1002L, 1161W and 1919G.

For example, the gamma-4 is an IgG4PE (ie, a gamma-4 constant region with 228Pro and 235Glu). For example the gamma-2 is an IgG2\u0394a.","For example, as per example (ix), the inventor identified the possibility of addressing IGH-gamma-4 variation and identified utility for variations 189L and 289R individually or in combination, since these residues are part of the CH3 domain, and as such they form part of antibody Fc regions. Thus, matching of these CH3 variations with the patient is especially beneficial for reasons as discussed above. Thus, in this example the ligand of the invention comprises or consists of an antibody that comprises a human gamma-4 heavy chain constant region that comprises a Leu corresponding to position 189 of SEQ ID NO: 73 or an Arg corresponding to position 289 of SEQ ID NO: 73 and wherein the genome of the human comprises a gamma-4 heavy chain constant region nucleotide sequence that encodes such a Leu and\/or Arg or the human expresses antibodies comprising human gamma-4 constant regions comprising such a Leu and\/or Arg.","Determination of Specific Binding of Ligands of the Invention to NAV1.7 Variants","The specific binding of ligands of the invention to Nav1.7 variants can be performed using the SPR method described in Example 1.","Embodiments are provided as follows:\u2014","Methods with VH Tailoring\n\n","Preferably herein the Nav1.7 mutation is 1161W (also known as 1150W in some publications, eg, Reimann et al (Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 2010 Mar. 16; 107(11):5148-53. doi: 10.1073\/pnas.0913181107.

ligands as described herein. The ligands have a variety of utilities. Some of the ligands, for instance, are useful in specific binding assays, for genotyping or phenotyping humans, affinity purification of IL6R, in particular human IL6R or its ligands and in screening assays to identify other antagonists of IL6R activity. Some of the ligands of the invention are useful for inhibiting binding of IL6R to IL6 and\/or gp130, or inhibiting IL6R-mediated activities.","Anti-IL6R ligands (eg, antibodies and anti-sense RNA) have been developed based on targeting and neutralising so-called \u201cwild-type\u201d human IL6R, which is a commonly-occurring form (see, eg, SEQ ID NO: 78). While such therapies are useful for human patients harbouring this form of human IL6R, the inventor considered it useful to investigate the possibility of targeting rarer\u2014but still naturally-occurring\u2014forms of IL6R amongst human populations. In this way, the inventor arrived at insight into the natural occurrences and distributions of rarer human IL6R forms that can serve as useful targets (at the protein or nucleic acid level) for human treatment, prophylaxis and diagnosis pertinent to diseases and conditions mediated or associated with IL6R activity. This particularly provides for tailored therapies, prophylaxis and diagnosis in humans that are devoid of the common IL6R gene or protein.","The skilled person will know that SNPs or other changes that translate into amino acid variation can cause variability in activity and\/or conformation of human targets to be addressed. This has spawned great interest in personalized medicine where genotyping and knowledge of protein and nucleotide variability is used to more effectively tailor medicines and diagnosis of patients. The invention, therefore, provides for tailored pharmaceuticals and testing that specifically addresses rarer IL6R polymorphic variant forms. Such forms or \u201calleles\u201d (at the nucleotide level), comprise one or more changes at the nucleotide and amino acid levels from the corresponding common form nucleotide and amino acids sequences, ie, there are one or more non-synonymous changes at the nucleotide level that translate into one or more corresponding changes in the protein target in humans.","Furthermore, the inventor surprisingly realised that the rarer natural forms, although present in humans at much lower frequencies than the common form, nevertheless are represented in multiple and ethnically-diverse human populations and usually with many human examples per represented ethnic population. Thus, the inventor realised that targeting such rarer forms would provide for effective treatment, prophylaxis or diagnosis across many human ethnic populations, thereby extending the utility of the present invention.","With this realisation, the inventor realised that there is significant industrial and medical application for the invention in terms of guiding the choice of anti-IL6R ligand for administration to human patients for therapy and\/or prophylaxis of IL6R-mediated or associated diseases or conditions. In this way, the patient receives drugs and ligands that are tailored to their needs\u2014as determined by the patient's genetic or phenotypic makeup. Hand-in-hand with this, the invention provides for the genotyping and\/or phenotyping of patients in connection with such treatment, thereby allowing a proper match of drug to patient. This increases the chances of medical efficacy, reduces the likelihood of inferior treatment using drugs or ligands that are not matched to the patient (eg, poor efficacy and\/or side-effects) and avoids pharmaceutical mis-prescription and waste.","In developing this thinking, in this non-limiting example the present inventor decided to determine a set of human IL6R variants on the basis of the following criteria, these being criteria that the inventor realised would provide for useful medical drugs and diagnostics to tailored need in the human population. The inventor selected variants having at least 3 of the 4 following criteria:\u2014\n\n","On the basis of these criteria, the inventor identified the variants listed in Table 13 below. The inventor's selection included, as a consideration, selection for nucleotide variation that produced amino acid variation in corresponding IL6R forms (ie, non-synonymous variations), as opposed to silent variations that do not alter amino acid residues in the target protein.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1171","num":"2259"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00014","num":"00014"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"378pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 13"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Human IL6R variants distributed over several human ethnic populations &"},{"entry":"having desired total human genotype frequency"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":"(a) Amino acid variability, population distributions and frequencies: Exon 9"}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"8"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"98pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"8","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},{},{},{},{},{},"Hom Freq",{}]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"No.","No. Unique",{},"(Het + Hom",{}]},{"entry":[{},{},"Human Populations","individs","Pops","Het Freq","freq)","Cum Freq"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"8","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Most","358D",{},{},{},"0.383","0 489","0.680"]},{"entry":["common",{},{},{},{},"(0.872)",{},{}]},{"entry":["Variant","358A","YRI, ASW, GBR,TSI,","557","14","0.383","0.128","0.320"]},{"entry":[{},{},"CLM, CHB, LWK, CHS,",{},{},{},"(0.511)",{}]},{"entry":[{},{},"MXL, PUR, JPT, IBS, FIN,",{},{},{},{},{}]},{"entry":[{},{},"CEU",{},{},{},{},{}]},{"entry":[{},{},"(See note 7)",{},{},{},{},{}]},{"entry":["Most","385V",{},{},{},"0.086","0 904","0.947"]},{"entry":["common",{},{},{},{},{},"(0.99)",{}]},{"entry":["Variant","385I","LWK, ASW, YRI, PUR","105","0.086","0.010","0.053",{}]},{"entry":[{},{},"(see note 8)",{},{},"(0.096)"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"8","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"378pt","align":"left"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"Table Footnotes:"},{"entry":{"sup":"1"}},{"entry":{"sup":"2"}},{"entry":{"sup":"3"}},{"entry":"of the variant allele and one occurrence of another allele (heterozygous state), eg, ac genotype in 1000 Genomes database;"},{"entry":{"sup":"4"}},{"entry":"(homozygous state), eg, cc genotype in 1000 Genomes database; and"},{"entry":{"sup":"5"}},{"entry":{"sup":"6"}},{"entry":{"sup":"7"}},{"entry":"(KHV, GBR, CHB, CDX, CLM, MXL, CHS, JPT, GIH, PUR, ESN, FIN, ACB, BEB, YRI, ASW, ITU, PJL, TSI, PEL, MSL,"},{"entry":"LWK, STU, GWD, IBS, CEU) and in 1218 individuals with a cumulative frequency of 0.29.

An example is provided for ligands comprising antibody VH domains derived from recombination of human IGHV gene segments comprising selected nucleotides at positions in the HCDR1 or FW3 where there is variability in humans (ie, where SNPs occur in humans).","The inventor analysed human IGHV variation and used this to choose ligands based on human IGHV alleles comprising said selected nucleotides and for matching to human recipient genotypes and\/or phenotypes.

An anti-human IgG surface (Jackson Labs 109-005-008) was created on a GLC Biosensor chip by primary amine coupling. Test antibodies are captured on this surface as ligands. The IL6R variants are used as analytes and passed over the captured antibodies at 256 nM, 64 nM, 16 nM, 4 nM and 1 nM. Binding curves are double referenced using a buffer injection (i.e. 0 nM) to remove baseline drift and injection artefacts. Regeneration of the capture surface is with 100 mM phosphoric acid which removes the captured antibody allowing another cycle of capture and binding. The binding sensorgrams generated are analysed using the 1:1 model inherent to the ProteOn XPR36 Array system analysis software. The assay is performed at 25\u00b0 C. and using 1xHBS-EP (Teknova) as running buffer.","The references cited herein are incorporated by reference in their

is also referred to as VEGF, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A, MVCD1, VEGF-A, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor, Vascular Permeability Factor and VPF. Human VEGF-A binds to the human FLT1\/VEGFR1 and KDR\/VEGFR2 receptors. Human isoforms, including VEGF-165 and VEGF-145, have been observed.","Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a highly specific mitogen for vascular endothelial cells. Five VEGF isoforms are generated as a result of alternative splicing from a single VEGF gene. These isoforms differ in their molecular mass and in biological properties such as their ability to bind to cell-surface heparan-sulfate proteoglycans. The expression of VEGF is potentiated in response to hypoxia, by activated oncogenes, and by a variety of cytokines. VEGF induces endothelial cell proliferation, promotes cell migration, and inhibits apoptosis. In vivo VEGF induces angiogenesis as well as permeabilization of blood vessels, and plays a central role in the regulation of vasculogenesis. Deregulated VEGF expression contributes to the development of solid tumours by promoting tumour angiogenesis and to the etiology of several additional diseases that are characterized by abnormal angiogenesis. Consequently, inhibition of VEGF signalling abrogates the development of a wide variety of tumours. The various VEGF forms bind to two tyrosine-kinase receptors, VEGFR-1 (flt-1) and VEGFR-2 (KDR\/flk-1) in humans, which are expressed almost exclusively in endothelial cells. Endothelial cells express in addition the neuropilin-1 and neuropilin-2 coreceptors, which bind selectively to the 165 amino acid form of VEGF (VEGF165).","VEGF is a key regulator of angiogenesis, and its expression in producing cells is regulated by a plethora of external factors. Cytokines, growth factors, and gonadotropins that do not stimulate angiogenesis directly can modulate angiogenesis by modulating VEGF expression in specific cell types, and thus exert an indirect angiogenic or anti-angiogenic effect. Factors that can potentiate VEGF production include fibroblast growth factor 4 (FGF-4), PDGF, tumour necrosis factor \u03b1, transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2), keratinocyte growth factor (KGF), IGF-I, interleukin 1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), and IL-6.","Angiogenesis has a causal role in many diseases, including neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Identification of key regulators of angiogenesis, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), fibroblast growth factor 2, pigment epithelium-derived growth factor, angiopoietins and extracellular matrix molecules, has facilitated the development of novel therapeutic agents that target the underlying pathological angiogenic process. Among these, VEGF serves as a \u201cmaster switch\u201d for many ocular neovascular conditions through its promotion of endothelial cell proliferation and survival, vascular permeability and ocular inflammation. Anti-VEGF agents are now available, such as aflibercept (EYLEA\u2122), bevacizumab (AVASTIN\u2122, ranibizumab (LUCENTIS\u2122) and pegaptanib sodium (MACUGEN\u2122), an aptamer for neovascular AMD. Unlike bevacizumab, which binds all VEGF isoforms, pegaptanib targets only VEGF165, the isoform responsible for pathological ocular neovascularization.","Flt-1 (VEGFR-1; Unitprot ID: P17948) is one of the two human receptors for vascular endothelial growth factor. The other being KDR (VEGFR-2; Uniprot ID: P35968). The flt-1 protein consists of an external domain containing seven immunoglobulin like domains, a transmembrane region and a cytoplasmic region containing a tyrosine kinase domain. In contrast to other members of the receptor tyrosine kinase family, the kinase domain of flt-1 is in two segments with an intervening sequence of \u02dc70 amino acids. The biology of the VEGF receptors has been reviewed (Neufeld et al., (1999) FASEB Journal. 13:11-22; Zachary (1998) Experimental Nephrology. 6:480-487) and the tyrosine phosphorylation sites have been identified (Ito et al., (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273:23410-23418).","It is thought that flt-1 may be important in regulating the tissue architecture in developing vasculature while the second VEGF receptor (KDR, VEGFR-2) mediates the mitogenic and angiogenic effects of VEGF in endothelial cells. Evidence to support this theory has come from knockout studies in mice (Fong et al., (1995) Nature. 376:66-70). VEGF and its receptors are over expressed in many tumour types and blocking of VEGF function inhibits angiogenesis and suppresses growth of tumours while over expression of VEGF enhances angiogenesis and tumour growth (Skobe et al., (1997) Nature Medicine 3:1222-1227).","The flt-1 cDNA (EMBL Accession Number X51602, 7680 bp) encodes a mature protein of 1338 amino acids. The structure of the murine flt-1 gene has been determined (Kondo et al., (1998) Gene 208:297-305) and has been used to predict the intron\/exon boundaries within the human gene. The promoter region of the human gene has been characterised (Ikeda et al., (1996) Growth Factors. 13:151-162; Morishita et al., (1995) J Biol Chem 270:27948-27953; EMBL Accession Number D64016,1745 bp). The flt-1 gene, which is organised into thirty exons, has been localised to chromosome 1312 (Rosnet et al. (1993) Oncogene 8:73-179). See EP1130123A2.","Diabetic Retinopathy (DR)","Diabetic retinopathy (DR), a micro-vascular complication of diabetes, is a main cause of blindness in adults. It is well established that DR is determined by both genetic and environmental factors. The longer duration of diabetes, poorer control of blood glucose and elevated blood pressure are the major risk factors in the development of DR. However, genetic factors also play important roles in the pathogenesis of DR. Over the past three decades, the number of people with diabetes mellitus has more than doubled globally, making it one of the most important public health challenges to all nations. DR occurs in 75% of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and almost all patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus within 15 years of the manifestation of diabetes. Evidence supports an important role for genetics in determining risk for DR.","VEGF-A has been implicated as a major contributor to the development of DR. VEGF-A could induce the earliest changes in DR including leukostasis, blood-retinal barrier breakdown, and macular edema and neovascularization in progression of DR. The VEGF-A gene is located on human chromosome 6p21.3 and consists of 8 exons. The genetic variants in the VEGF-A gene are suggested to influence levels of VEGF-A protein expression. To date, many studies have investigated the associations between polymorphisms in the VEGF-A gene in humans and DR. \u2212634G\/C (+405G\/C or rs2010963) polymorphism in the 5-untranslated region and \u22122578C\/A (\u221225491\/D (in high linkage disequilibrium with \u22122578C\/A) or rs699947) polymorphism in the promoter region of the VEGF-A gene have been investigated.","Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD)","Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a neurodegenerative disease that leads to visual impairment and accounts for half of all cases of registered blindness in Western individuals older than 65 years of age. There are approximately eight million people in the United States with symptoms of early or intermediate AMD, of whom approximately one million will develop advanced AMD within the next five years. AMD is estimated to affect about 50 million people worldwide, and an increase in aging populations makes AMD a significant public health concern and a major focus of research efforts. AMD is a clinically heterogeneous and genetically complex disease, with multiple environmental and genetic risk factors involved. While epidemiological studies have linked cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, light exposure, diet, drugs, and high blood pressure to the risk of AMD, familial aggregation and twin studies have suggested that genetic variation may also play an important role in the disease.","Anti-VEGF therapies are now regarded as the standard of care in the treatment of neovascular AMD. Two of the most widely used treatments are ranibizumab and bevacizumab. Ranibizumab (Lucentis\u00ae, Genentech, CA, USA), a US FDA-approved anti-VEGF therapy for AMD, is a recombinant, fragmented, monoclonal antibody that binds to VEGF. On the other hand, bevacizumab (Avastin\u00ae, Genentech), although not FDA approved for ocular treatment, is a full-length monoclonal antibody reportedly with similar function as that of ranibizumab. Bevacizumab, FDA approved for metastatic colon cancer, has been given as an off-label treatment for ocular angiogenic disorders. An individual's genetic variation may affect the treatment response in both of these drugs.","Polypoidal Choroidal Vasculopathy (PCV)","A subset of wet AMD, termed polypoidal chorio-vasculopathy (PCV), has been identified as a clinical entity. PCV is important, as it may be the main cause of vision loss from AMD in certain Asian and","black populations. The distinctive clinical features of PCV include one or more haemorrhagic pigment epithelial detachments (PEDs), extensive exudation, and disease outside of the macula including the periphery. There is a predilection for peripapillary \u2018polyps\u2019. Patients are also characteristically younger.","There is increasing evidence that Asian patients with neovascular AMD have a variant of AMD, ie, polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV), which is characterized by polypoidal lesion with inner choroidal vessel abnormality. PCV is more prevalent in Asian subjects, reportedly accounting for about 50% of neovascular AMD compared to 10% in Europeans. Studies have shown that anti-VEGF therapy (ranibizumab) in combination with photodynamic therapy (PDT) was associated with a more favorable outcome compared to ranibizumab monotherapy.","Retinal Angiomatous Proliferation (RAP)","Another variant of AMD in the spectrum of occult CNV is retinal angiomatous proliferation (RAP), which represents about 12%-15% of neovascular AMD. It is associated with proliferation of intraretinal capillaries with retinal anastomosis or CNV.","Diabetic macular edema (DME)","Diabetic macular edema (DME), the most common cause of visual loss in subjects with diabetes, is a separate classification assessed independently from the DR spectrum, because it can develop at any stage of DR. The pathogenesis of DR and DME is thought to be related to the loss of pericytes, thickening of basement membrane and endothelial cell loss, leading to microaneurysms, blood-retinal barrier breakdown, increase in inflammation and vascular leakage. There are several treatment modalities for DME. The goal of laser treatment of DME is to reduce disease progression by targeting areas of leakage on the retina. Intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide (IVTA) has also been shown to significantly reduce DME, with maximal action at one week and lasting 3-6 months.","Retinal-Vein Occlusion (RVO)","Retinal-vein occlusion (RVO) is the most common retinal vascular disorder after diabetic retinopathy in the elderly and is often associated with systemic disorders, such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus and\/or arteriosclerotic vascular disorders. It is classified as branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) or central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO), depending on the site of occlusion and further divided into ischemic (non-perfusion) or non-ischemic (perfusion) RVO, each with differing prognosis and treatment. Macular edema and retinal neovascularization are the two most common causes of visual impairments; thus, ocular managements with laser photocoagulation, intravitreal injections of glucocorticoids or anti-VEGF agents, as well as other surgical or systemic therapies, have focused on these two sequelae.","Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP)","ROP remains one of the leading causes of childhood blindness. In late stages of ROP, neovascularization of abnormal or pathological vessels arise, due to retinal immaturity, and lead to retinal traction, detachment, hemorrhage and funnel configuration, eventually resulting in poor vision. Neovascularization is mainly driven by VEGF, and currently, the recommended treatment for Type-1 ROP is peripheral ablation by laser.","Angiogenesis & Angiogenesis Inhibitors","Angiogenesis is the formation of new blood vessels. This process involves the migration, growth, and differentiation of endothelial cells, which line the inside wall of blood vessels. The process of angiogenesis is controlled by chemical signals in the body. These signals can stimulate both the repair of damaged blood vessels and the formation of new blood vessels. Other chemical signals, called angiogenesis inhibitors, interfere with blood vessel formation. Normally, the stimulating and inhibiting effects of these chemical signals are balanced so that blood vessels form only when and where they are needed. Neovascularization is the formation of functional microvascular networks with red blood cell perfusion. Neovascularization differs from angiogenesis in that angiogenesis is mainly characterized by the protrusion and outgrowth of capillary buds and sprouts from pre-existing blood vessels.","Angiogenesis plays a critical role in the growth and spread of cancer. A blood supply is necessary for tumours to grow beyond a few millimeters in size. Tumours can cause this blood supply to form by giving off chemical signals that stimulate angiogenesis. Tumours can also stimulate nearby normal cells to produce angiogenesis signalling molecules. The resulting new blood vessels \u201cfeed\u201d growing tumours with oxygen and nutrients, allowing the cancer cells to invade nearby tissue, to move throughout the body, and to form new colonies of cancer cells, called metastases. Because tumours cannot grow beyond a certain size or spread without a blood supply, research is focused on trying to find ways to block tumour angiogenesis, with the idea that angiogenesis inhibitors will prevent or slow the growth of cancer. Similarly, ocular diseases and conditions, such as AMD and DR are associated with angiogenesis, and inhibitors are useful for the treatment or prevention of these too.","Thus, anti-VEGF (ie, VEGF-A) ligands and antibodies of the invention are useful for treating, preventing or reducing the risk of one or more of such ocular conditions and cancer (eg, solid tumours).","Angiogenesis requires the binding of signalling molecules, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), to receptors on the surface of normal endothelial cells. When VEGF and other endothelial growth factors bind to their receptors on endothelial cells, signals within these cells are initiated that promote the growth and survival of new blood vessels. Angiogenesis inhibitors interfere with various steps in this process. For example, bevacizumab (Avastin\u00ae) is an anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody that specifically recognizes and binds to VEGF. Aflibercept (Eylea\u00ae) is a VEGF receptor-Fc fusion that binds VEGF. Other angiogenesis inhibitors, including sorafenib and sunitinib, bind to receptors on the surface of endothelial cells or to other proteins in the downstream signalling pathways, blocking their activities.","In addition to, or alternative to, targeting human VEGF-A to address ocular conditions or cancer (or angiogenesis or neovascularisation generally), it may be useful to target the platelet derived growth factor pathway (eg, targeting PDGF-B and\/or PDGFR-B), or the angiopoietin-2 pathway. Further details are provided below.","In an example, the invention provides a method of treating or reducing the risk of a VEGF-A-mediated disease or condition in a human in need thereof, the method comprising administering to said human a ligand (eg, an antibody or antibody fragment) that specifically binds a human VEGF-A protein. The invention also provides a corresponding ligand.","In an example, the invention provides a method of treating or reducing the risk of a PDGF-B (ie, platelet derived growth factor-beta)-mediated disease or condition in a human in need thereof, the method comprising administering to said human a ligand (eg, an antibody or antibody fragment) that specifically binds a human PDGF-B protein. The invention also provides a corresponding ligand.","The present invention provides anti-VEGF-A ligands; and VEGF-A-binding or targeting ligands as described herein. The ligands have a variety of utilities. Some of the ligands, for instance, are useful in specific binding assays, for genotyping or phenotyping humans, affinity purification of VEGF-A, in particular human VEGF-A or its ligands and in screening assays to identify other antagonists of VEGF-A activity. Some of the ligands of the invention are useful for inhibiting VEGF-A-mediated activities.","In an example, the invention provides a method of treating or reducing the risk of a PDGFR-B (ie, platelet derived growth factor-beta receptor)-mediated disease or condition in a human in need thereof, the method comprising administering to said human a ligand (eg, an antibody or antibody fragment) that specifically binds a human PDGFR-B protein.

Some of the ligands of the invention are useful for inhibiting PDGFR-B-mediated activities.","Anti-VEGF-A ligands (eg, antibodies and anti-sense RNA) have been developed based on targeting and neutralising so-called \u201cwild-type\u201d human VEGF-A, which is a commonly-occurring form. While such therapies are useful for human patients harbouring this form of human VEGF-A, the inventor considered it useful to investigate the possibility of targeting rarer\u2014but still naturally-occurring\u2014forms of VEGF-A amongst human populations. In this way, the inventor arrived at insight into the natural occurrences and distributions of rarer human VEGF-A forms that can serve as useful targets (at the protein or nucleic acid level) for human treatment, prophylaxis and diagnosis pertinent to diseases and conditions mediated or associated with VEGF-A activity. This particularly provides for tailored therapies, prophylaxis and diagnosis in humans that are devoid of the common VEGF-A gene or protein.","The skilled person will know that SNPs or other changes that translate into amino acid variation can cause variability in activity and\/or conformation of human targets to be addressed. This has spawned great interest in personalized medicine where genotyping and knowledge of protein and nucleotide variability is used to more effectively tailor medicines and diagnosis of patients. The invention, therefore, provides for tailored pharmaceuticals and testing that specifically addresses rarer VEGF-A polymorphic variant forms. Such forms or \u201calleles\u201d (at the nucleotide level), comprise one or more changes at the nucleotide and amino acid levels from the corresponding common form nucleotide and amino acids sequences, ie, there are one or more non-synonymous (aka \u201cmissense\u201d) changes at the nucleotide level that translate into one or more corresponding changes in the protein target in humans.","Furthermore, the inventor surprisingly realised that the rarer natural forms, although present in humans at much lower frequencies than the common form, nevertheless are represented in multiple and ethnically-diverse human populations and usually with many human examples per represented ethnic population. Thus, the inventor realised that targeting such rarer forms would provide for effective treatment, prophylaxis or diagnosis across many human ethnic populations, thereby extending the utility of the present invention. In particular, human VEGF-A variations are correlated with increased incidence or risk of VEGF-A mediated diseases or conditions, such as ocular conditions or cancer. Additionally or alternatively, VEGF-A variations are correlated with improved responses following treatments for ocular conditions. The inventor analysed such variations and devised the collections of variants in Tables 18-20. As shown in those tables, the inventor also assessed variation in other human targets that also correlate to incidence or risk of diseases or conditions, such as ocular conditions or cancer, or improved responses following treatments for ocular conditions. In this respect, therefore, the invention provides various aspects and concepts as set out below in this example.","The inventor saw that there is significant industrial and medical application for the invention in terms of guiding the choice of anti-TOI (VEGF-A, PDGF-B and\/or PDGFR-B) ligand for administration to human patients for therapy and\/or prophylaxis of VEGF-A, PDGF-B and\/or PDGFR-B-mediated or associated diseases or conditions. In this way, the patient receives drugs and ligands that are tailored to their needs\u2014as determined by the patient's genetic or phenotypic makeup. Hand-in-hand with this, the invention provides for the genotyping and\/or phenotyping of patients in connection with such treatment, thereby allowing a proper match of drug to patient. This increases the chances of medical efficacy, reduces the likelihood of inferior treatment using drugs or ligands that are not matched to the patient (eg, poor efficacy and\/or side-effects) and avoids pharmaceutical mis-prescription and waste.","In developing this thinking, in a non-limiting embodiment the present inventor decided to determine a set of human VEGF-A, PDGF-B and PDGFR-B variants on the basis of the following criteria, these being criteria that the inventor realised would provide for useful medical drugs and diagnostics to tailored need in the human population. The inventor selected variants having at least 3 of the 4 following criteria:\u2014","Naturally-occurring human TOI (VEGF-A, PDGF-B or PDGFR-B) variation having a cumulative human allele frequency of 35% or less;","Naturally-occurring human TOI variation having a total human genotype frequency of about 50% or less;","Naturally-occurring human TOI variation found in many different human ethnic populations (using the standard categorisation of the 1000 Genomes Project; see Table 2 below); and","Naturally-occurring human TOI variation found in many individuals distributed across such many different ethnic populations.","On the basis of these criteria, the inventor identified variants listed below.","Furthermore, the inventor identified useful variations also in the following human TOIs: complement factor H (CFH), complement component 2 (C2), prothrombin, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), Factor V, ARMS2, VEGFR2 and HTRA1. As the titles to Tables 18-20 indicate, the examiner realised that such variants have useful correlations.","In an example, the ligand of the invention comprises an anti-TOI (eg, anti-human VEGF-A) binding site, wherein the binding site is a human or humanized binding site, eg, the binding site comprises or consists of a human or humanized antibody variable domain or plurality of variable domains (eg, human VH\/VL binding site(s)). Additionally or alternatively, the ligand comprises one or more human antibody constant regions (eg, a human antibody CH1, CH2, CH3 (or all of these) or Fc). In an example, the ligand is an antibody that comprises human or humanized variable regions and human constant regions (eg, bearing one or more mutations to enhance or dampen Fc function in a human patient).","In an example, the invention provides a method of targeting VEGF-A in a human, the method comprising administering to said human a ligand (eg, an antibody or antibody fragment) that specifically binds a human VEGF-A protein that is encoded by a human VEGF-A nucleotide comprising a VEGF-A SNP as described herein.

In an example, the method treats or reduces the risk of a VEGF-A-mediated disease or condition in the human.

This review comments that: In the case of intravitreal bevacizumab, CFHY402H genotypes, TC and TT, show more than five-fold increased improvement compared to the CC genotype. The data shows that after treatment with bevacizumab, visual acuity of the patients improved from 20\/248 to 20\/166 (TT) and from 20\/206 to 20\/170 (TC), but actually decreased from 20\/206 to 20\/341 for the CC genotype (p=0.016). In a prospective study with twice the number of patients, the CC genotype was confirmed to have worse outcome as measured by distance and reading visual acuity. In a similar experiment with intravitreal ranibizumab, the TC and TT genotypes for CFH showed improvement with fewer injections compared to the CC genotype. Recurrent analysis showed that patients homozygous for the CFHY402H risk allele (CC) were 37% more likely to require additional ranibizumab injections (p=0.04). Another study found that individuals homozygous for 69S in ARMS2 had decreased central subfield retinal thickness and no improvement in visual outcomes compared to improved visual acuity in ARMS2 rs10490924 and rs1061170 genotypes following ranibizumab treatment. Taking genetics and environmental factors together, the CFH Y402H homozygous CC genotype with BMI >30 and smoking reportedly conferred the greatest risk.","8.

Kuo et al. This article comments that: Variants in the complement factor H (CFH) gene confers a 7.4-fold increased likelihood of late AMD. AMD is a common complex disorder with complex inheritance patterns due to various gene and environmental interactions. Yet, despite these challenges, AMD represents an unusual example of the \u201ccommon disease common variant\u201d theory in which several variants identified on the CFH gene have relatively large effects on disease outcome. Even though the most well-established and consistent association of AMD is observed with complement factor H (CFH) on chromosome 1, recent studies have also shown that other candidate genes in the complement pathway, ARMS2\/HTRA1 on chromosome 10q26, LIPC, CETP, and TIMP2 are also susceptible loci associated with AMD. In 2005, three independent research groups identified a common coding variant, Y402H (rs1061170), in the CFH gene on chromosome 1 that was strongly associated with susceptibility of AMD, with reported odds ratio (OR) ranging from 2.5 to 3.3 for all AMD and as high as 7.4 for advanced AMD. The Y402H variant results in a tyrosine-to-histidine substitution. The association of CFH in AMD implicated that the complement cascade plays a critical role in the development of AMD and is now also regarded as a major contributor to susceptibility of AMD. In addition to CFH and the complement pathway, the region at chromosome 10q26 also harbors additional signals to AMD susceptibility, namely the age-related maculopathy susceptibility 2 (ARMS2) and the high-temperature requirement factor H (HTRA1) genes. It is also possible that susceptible variants within ARMS2 modulate the promoter activity of HTRA1, so that both ARMS2\/HTRA1 contribute to AMD susceptibility. In one European study, the SNP rs11200638 at the promoter region of HTRA1 confers a 49.3% attributable risk and the risk allele was associated with an elevated mRNA and protein expression and level of HTRA1. The risk allele of the same SNP was highly significant in the Chinese and has 10 times the risk of developing AMD compared to subjects with the wild-type allele. Two VEGF polymorphisms, rs699947 and rs2146323, were significantly associated with PDT treatment response. The allele frequency of rs699947 for AA, AC, and CC were 14%, 39%, and 46% in non-responders versus 40%, 48%, and 12% in responders, respectively (p=0.0008). The allele frequency of rs2146323 for AA, AC, and CC were 4%, 32%, and 64% in non-responders versus 24%, 38%, and 38% in responders, respectively (p=0.0369). Thus, the C allele in both SNPs in VEGF were associated with a higher rate of non-responder to PDT (p=0.0003 for rs699947 and p=0.0036 for rs2146323). In classic choroidal neovascularization (CNV), prothrombin (G20210A) and MTHFR (C677A) were significantly associated with PDT responders. In occult CNV, prothrombin (G20210A) and factor V (G1691A) were significantly associated with PDT responders. Two studies have showed a worse visual improvement in subjects with the homozygous TT risk allele at ARMS2 rs10490924 (A69S) after ranibizumab or bevacizumab injections. Other candidate gene studies found that patients with the risk genotype (CC) at rs1413711 of VEGF has a more significant visual gain after ranibizumab, the G allele at rs699946 of VEGF was significantly associated with a better visual prognosis after either intravitreal bevacizumab or triple therapy (PDT with intravitreal bevacizumab and triamcinolone acetonide). In a study examining the cumulative effect of risk alleles at CFH (Y402H; rs1061170), ARMS2 (A69S; rs10490924), VEGF (rs699947 and rs833069), KDR (rs2071559 and rs7671745), LPR5 (rs3736228), and FZD4 (rs10898563) after ranibizumab treatment, subjects without the high-risk alleles in CFH and ARMS2 have significantly more visual improvement compared to subjects with the high-risk alleles (p=0.009). The mean visual acuity improvement was 10 letters in subjects without the 4-risk alleles, compared to no improvement in subjects with all 4-risk alleles. By adding VEGF into the model, they found that subjects with all 6-risk alleles in CFH, ARMS2, and VEGF demonstrated a mean loss of 10 letters after ranibizumab treatment, whereas the other allele groups all demonstrated improvement (p<0.0001), suggesting a cumulative effect of the risk alleles with a poorer response rate to treatment. A comprehensive meta-analysis found variants at ARMS2\/HTRA1 (rs10490924, OR=2.27, p<0.00001; rs11200638, OR=2.72, p<0.00001), CFH (rs1061170, OR=1.72, p<0.00001; rs800292, OR=2.10, p<0.00001) or the complement pathway (C2; rs547154, OR=0.56, p=0.01) were significantly associated with PCV, with higher odds ratio observed at variants in ARMS2\/HTRA1. The strong association of ARMS2\/HTRA1 to PCV was supported by numerous studies of Asian populations.","9.

In patients with the T allele in tSNP rs3025000, there was a significantly better visual outcome at 6 months and a greater chance of the patients belonging to the responder group with anti-VEGF treatment at 3, 6, and 12 months. The visual acuity (VA) outcomes of patients harbouring the T allele at SNP rs3025000 were comparable with those of the pivotal clinical trials but with fewer injections.","11.

Epub 2013 Dec. 21, \u201cPolymorphisms in vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 are associated with better response rates to ranibizumab treatment in age-related macular degeneration\u201d, Hermann M M et al. The authors evaluated the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in VEGF genes and their receptors (VEGFR) with the response rate to ranibizumab in 366 patients with neovascular AMD. Univariate analyses of variance (ANOVAs) revealed a significant effect of SNP rs4576072 in the VEGFR2 gene on VA change after 12 months (F[1,235]=14.05; P=0.02). A stepwise linear regression analysis returned a model (P=0.01) with SNPs rs4576072 and rs6828477 in the VEGFR2 gene as independent predictors for VA change after 12 months, with a mean increase in VA of 0.26 on the logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (log MAR) scale in patients with 3 contributing minor alleles compared with a loss of 0.03 log MAR in patients with no minor allele.","12.

Pericytes appear critical for the maintenance of established blood vessels and may be important in the maturation process in ocular conditions, such as choroidal neovascularization. It has been hypothesized that there is a period of VEGF dependency of endothelial cells that overlaps with a period of responsiveness to PDGF withdrawal in newly formed neovascular vessels. Established mature vessels may be associated with resistance to anti-VEGF blockade or rapid recurrence of choroidal neovascularization.","PDGF has been demonstrated to stimulate angiogenesis and pericyte recruitment. Loss of pericytes in retinal vessels is thought to be associated with abnormalities of the vasculature and instability, including the formation of microaneurysms and vascular permeability. Loss of pericytes with PDGF-blockade may be associated with regression of maturing neovascularization. Pericytes produce VEGF-A under selected conditions, possibly thereby protecting endothelial cells when generalized suppression of VEGF-A is present.","Reference is made to Am J Pathol. 2006 June; 168(6):2036-53; \u201cInhibition of platelet-derived growth factor B signaling enhances the efficacy of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy in multiple models of ocular neovascularisation\u201d; Jo N et al.

Endothelial cells in small blood vessels and capillaries interact with pericytes, cells of mesenchymal origin that provide important support for blood vessel formation and function. Numerous studies describe the significance of members of the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) family for recruitment to and productive association of pericytes with the blood vessel endothelium during embryonal development. Strikingly, mice lacking components of the PDGF-B\/PDGFR-\u03b2 signaling axis are essentially devoid of pericytes, and as a consequence die from microhemorrhaging because of malformed blood vessels.

The authors describe that newly formed vascular sprouts recruit pericytes primarily through secretion of platelet derived growth factor beta (PDGF-BB) by endothelial tip cells. Pericytes respond by migrating along the matrix-retained gradient of PDGF-BB, and by a proliferative burst as they reach the tip of the sprout. Reciprocally, pericytes up-regulate expression of cell-bound VEGF-A as they mature and are recruited into newly formed vessels.

Tumours express antigens that can be recognized by host T cells, but immunologic clearance of tumours is rare. Part of this failure is due to immune suppression by the tumour microenvironment. PD-L1 expression on many tumours is a component of this suppressive milieu and may act in concert with other immunosuppressive signals. PD-L1 expression has been shown in situ on a wide variety of solid tumours including breast, lung, colon, ovarian, melanoma, bladder, liver, salivary, stomach, gliomas, thyroid, thymic epithelial, head, and neck (Brown J A et al., 2003. J. Immunol. 170:1257-66; Dong H et al. 2002. Nat. Med. 8:793-800; Hamanishi J, et al. 2007. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 104:3360-65; Strome S E et al. 2003. Cancer Res. 63:6501-5; Inman B A et al. 2007. Cancer 109:1499-505; Konishi J et. al.. 2004. Clin. Cancer Res. 10:5094-100; Nakanishi J et. al.. 2007. Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 56:1173-82; Nomi T et al. 2007. Clin. Cancer Res. 13:2151-57; Thompson R H et al. 2004. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 101:17174-79; Wu C, Zhu Y, Jiang J, Zhao J, Zhang X G, Xu N. 2006. Acta Histochem. 108:19-24). In addition, PD-1 expression is upregulated on tumour infiltrating lymphocytes, and this may also contribute to tumour immunosuppression (Blank C et al. 2003. J. Immunol. 171:4574-81). In ovarian cancer, PD-L1 expression is inversely correlated with intraepithelial, but not stromal, infiltrating CD8 T cells, suggesting that PD-L1 inhibits the intratumor migration of CD8 T cells (Hamanishi J et. al.. 2007. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 104:3360-65). Translation of PD-L1 mRNA is enhanced by loss of PTEN and the ensuing activation of Akt, a common event in tumourigenesis (Parsa A T et al. 2007. Nat. Med. 13:84-88). Most importantly, studies relating PD-L1 expression on tumours to disease outcome show that PD-L1 expression strongly correlates with unfavorable prognosis in kidney, ovarian, bladder, breast, gastric, and pancreatic cancer (Hamanishi J et al. 2007. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 104:3360-65; Inman B A et al. 2007. Cancer 109:1499-505; Konishi J et. al.. 2004. Clin. Cancer Res. 10:5094-100; Nakanishi J et. al.. 2007. Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 56:1173-82; Nomi T et al. 2007. Clin. Cancer Res. 13:2151-57; Thompson R H et al. 2004. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 101:17174-79; Wu C, Zhu Y, Jiang J, Zhao J, Zhang X G, Xu N. 2006. Acta Histochem. 108:19-24). In addition, these studies suggest that higher levels of PD-L1 expression on tumours may facilitate advancement of tumour stage and invasion into deeper tissue structures.","The PD-1 pathway can also play a role in hematologic malignancies. PD-L1 is expressed on multiple myeloma cells but not on normal plasma cells (Liu J et al. 2007. Blood 110:296-304). PD-L1 is expressed on some primary T cell lymphomas, particularly anaplastic large cell T lymphomas (Brown J A et al., 2003. J. Immunol 170:1257-66). PD-1 is highly expressed on the T cells of angioimmunoblastic lymphomas, and PD-L1 is expressed on the associated follicular dendritic cell network (Dorfman D M et al. 2006. Am. J. Surg. Pathol. 30:802-10). In nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma, the T cells associated with lymphocytic and\/or histiocytic (L&H) cells express PD-1. Microarray analysis using a readout of genes induced by PD-1 ligation suggests that tumour-associated T cells are responding to PD-1 signals in situ in Hodgkin lymphoma (Chemnitz J M et al. 2007110:3226-33). PD-1 and PD-L1 are expressed on CD4 T cells in HTLV-1-mediated adult T cell leukemia and lymphoma (Shimauchi T et al. 2007121: 2585-90). These tumour cells are hyporesponsive to TCR signals.","Studies in animal models demonstrate that PD-L1 on tumours inhibits T cell activation and lysis of tumour cells and in some cases leads to increased tumour-specific T cell death (Dong H et al. 20028:793-800; Hirano F et al. 200565:1089-96). Tumour-associated APCs can also utilize the PD-1:PD-L pathway to control antitumor T cell responses. PD-L1 expression on a population of tumour-associated myeloid DCs is upregulated by tumour environmental factors (Curiel T J et al. 20039:562-67). Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (DCs) in the tumour-draining lymph node of B 16 melanoma express IDO, which strongly activates the suppressive activity of regulatory T cells. The suppressive activity of IDO-treated regulatory T cells required cell contact with IDO-expressing DCs (Sharma M D et al. 2007117:2570-82).","U.S. Pat.

A\/C polymorphism at position 8923 in intron 4 of PD-L1 gene was typed using the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method (PCR-RFLP). The interactions between A\/C genotype, allele frequency and NSCLC susceptibility were analyzed.","Results:","The A\/C genotype frequencies were significantly different between NSCLC patients and controls. The AC and CC frequencies were higher in NSCLC patients than in controls (16.4 vs 8.9%, 1.0 vs 0.3%, respectively). The C-allele frequency was higher in NSCLC patients than in controls (9.2 vs 4.8%). Significant differences in the A and C allele frequencies were noted between the two groups (\u03c7(2)=8.864, P=0.003). More risk of NSCLC was found in individuals carrying the C allele than in those carrying the A allele (OR=2.203; 95% CI 1.262-3.242). In both light smokers (\u226620 pack-years) and heavy smokers (>20 pack-years), individuals carrying the C-allele had more risk of NSCLC than those carrying the A-allele (light smokers OR=1.847, 95% CI 1.001-3.409; heavy smokers OR=3.252, 95% CI 1.196-8.845, respectively).","Conclusion:","An A\/C polymorphism at position 8923 in the PD-L1 gene is associated with NSCLC susceptibility. The PD-L1 polymorphism plays a role in NSCLC, especially in patients with the C-allele.\n\n","The authors published the following:\u2014","Objective:","Programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) and its ligands (PD-L1 and PD-L2) inhibit T-cell proliferation and activation. This inhibition down-regulates the immune responses. The association of a PD-L1 polymorphism with Graves' disease (GD) was studied.","Design:","The association of an A\/C polymorphism at position 8923 in PD-L1 intron 4 with GD was studied.","Patients:","The study included 327 GD patients and 192 controls, of which 252 GD patients were followed over 5-10 years.","Measurements:","PD-L1 intron 4 position 8923 A\/C polymorphism was typed using the PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism method.","Results:","The A\/C genotype frequencies were significantly different between GD patients and controls. The A\/C and C\/C frequencies were higher in GD patients than in controls. The A\/A frequencies were lower in GD patients than in controls. C-allele frequency was higher in GD patients than in controls. A total of 252 GD patients were followed over 5-10 years; 200 had discontinued antithyroid drugs (ATD) while 52 continued to take ATD. Of these 200, 176 continued to be in remission and 24 had relapsed into hyperthyroidism. Significant differences in the duration of positive TBII, positive thyroid-stimulating antibodies, and ATD treatment were noted between the patients in remission and those that had relapsed. Significant differences in the A- and C-allele frequencies were noted between the two. The C-allele frequency was higher in GD patients who did not achieve remission than in those who achieved remission.","Conclusion:","An A\/C polymorphism at position 8923 in PD-L1 is associated with GD. The PD-L1 polymorphism plays a role in GD development. GD patients with the C allele at position 8923 in PD-L1 gene had difficulty in achieving remission.\n\n","Human subjects with the PD-1 GG genotype had significantly greater risk for ankylosing spondylitis (AS) than those with the AA genotype. Subjects with the PD-L2 CT genotype had lower risk for AS than those with the CC genotype. The combined genotypes of PD-1 G-536A, PD-L1 A8923C and PD-L2 C47103T also appear to be associated with AS development.","Conclusions.","The results suggest that PD-1 G-536A, PD-L1 A8923C and PD-L2 C47103T polymorphisms are associated with the presence of AS.\n\n","The authors published the following:\u2014","Context:","Despite much investigation, a substantial amount of the genetic susceptibility to autoimmune diseases remains unaccounted for. Recently, a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) gene has been associated with Graves' disease (GD) in a Japanese patient cohort. Our aim was to determine whether variants in PD-L1 are also associated with autoimmune Addison's disease (AAD) and to replicate the previous association in patients with GD from the United Kingdom.","Design and Patients:","We analyzed eight SNPs within PD-L1 in a United Kingdom cohort of 315 AAD subjects and 316 healthy controls. We then replicated our experiment in a cohort of 342 Norwegian AAD cases and 379 controls and in 496 United Kingdom GD subjects.","Results:","Three of the eight SNPs studied, part of a haplotype block in the PD-L1 gene, showed modest association with both AAD and GD in the United Kingdom cohort, with maximum evidence at the marker RS1411262 [United Kingdom AAD odds ratio 1.33 (5-95% confidence interval 1.02-1.73), P(genotype)=0.028; GD odds ratio 1.36 (5-95% confidence interval 1.07-1.72), P(genotype)=0.033]. Association with genotypes at the same three markers was confirmed in the Norwegian AAD cohort [P(genotype)=0.011-0.020]. A recessive effect at the most associated alleles was observed in both the AAD and GD cohorts.","Conclusions:","We confirm the role of PD-L1 variants in GD susceptibility and extend these findings to demonstrate association in two Northern European patient cohorts with AAD. PD-L1 joins the growing number of known susceptibility loci exerting modest effects in these autoimmune disorders.\n\n","The authors published the following:\u2014","To investigate the role of ligands for programmed cell death 1 (PD-L) in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 129 patients with RA and 125 unrelated healthy controls were enrolled in this study. The PD-L1 and PD-L2 polymorphisms were determined by the method of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)\/direct sequencing or PCR\/reaction fragment length polymorphisms. The genotype distributions of PD-L1 6777 C\/G were not significantly different between the patients with RA and healthy controls. There was also no significant difference in the allele frequencies of PD-L1 6777 C\/G polymorphisms between the patients with RA and controls. Similar findings could also be found in the phenotypes and alleles frequencies of PD-L2 47103 C\/T and 47139 T\/C polymorphisms between the patients with RA and controls. The patients with PD-L1 6777 G had higher prevalence of rheumatoid nodule in comparison with those without PD-L1 6777 G (p=0.005, OR=4.0, 95% CI=1.5-10.9). In contrast, the PD-L2 47103 C\/T and 47139 T\/C polymorphisms were not related to the occurrence of rheumatoid nodule. This study demonstrated that the PD-L1 and PD-L2 polymorphisms were not associated with susceptibility to RA in Taiwan. PD-L1 6777 G was associated with the prevalence of rheumatoid nodule.\n\n","Since the over-expression of B7-H1 protein has been reported to be closely related to disease progression of gastric cancer, the authors investigated the possible role of miRSNPs at the 3\u2032-untranslated region (3\u2032-UTR) of B7-H1 in the risk of developing gastric cancer. In this association study on 205 gastric adenocarcinoma patients and 393 non-cancer controls, they found that the genotype distribution of a common C>G polymorphism (rs4143815) was significantly different between the cases and controls (P=1.32\u00d710(\u22128)). Compared with CC homozygotes, GG homozygotes and G allele carriers showed 3.73-fold (P=2.98\u00d710(\u22128)) and 1.85-fold (P=0.002) increased risk of gastric adenocarcinoma, respectively. Stratified analyses indicated that variant genotypes had a strong association with the clinic-pathological features of gastric cancer including differentiation grade, depth of tumor infiltration, and tumor node metastasis (TNM) stage (P<0.001). Luciferase reporter assay indicated that this SNP might be responsible for aberrant B7-H1 protein expression in gastric cancer by disrupting the interaction between miR-570 and B7-H1 mRNA. These results are consistent with our hypothesis and indicate that genetic polymorphisms influencing B7-H1 expression modify cancer susceptibility.\n\n","The authors published the following:\u2014","PURPOSE","The aberrant expression of programmed cell death 1 ligands 1 and 2 (PD-Ls) on tumor cells dampens antitumor immunity, resulting in tumor immune evasion. In this study, we investigated the expression of PD-Ls in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) to define their prognostic significance after curative surgery.","EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN","Immunohistochemistry was used to investigate PD-Ls expression as well as granzyme B+cytotoxic and FoxP3+ regulatory T cell infiltration on tissue microarrays containing 240 randomly selected HCC patients who underwent surgery. The results were further verified in an independent cohort of 125 HCC patients. PD-Ls expression on HCC cell lines was detected by Western blot assay.","RESULTS","Patients with higher expression of PD-L1 had a significantly poorer prognosis than patients with lower expression. Although patients with higher expression of PD-L2 also had a poorer survival, the difference in recurrence was not statistically significant. Multivariate analysis identified tumor expression of PD-L1 as an independent predictor for postoperative recurrence. No correlation was found between PD-Ls expression and granzyme B+ lymphocyte infiltration, whereas a significant positive correlation was detected between PD-Ls expression and FoxP3+ lymphocyte infiltration. In addition, tumor-infiltrating cytotoxic and regulatory T cells were also independent prognosticators for both survival and recurrence. The prognostic value of PD-L1 expression was validated in the independent data set.","CONCLUSION","Our data suggest for the first time that PD-L1 status may be a new predictor of recurrence for HCC patients and provide the rationale for developing a novel therapy of targeting the PD-L1\/PD-1 pathway against this fatal malignancy.","Using this analysis, the inventor has devised the following aspects of the invention that are useful for addressing PD-L1-mediated diseases and conditions, such as cancer, autoimmune or inflammatory diseases and conditions as more fully described below. Thus, the invention provides the following aspects.","In an example, the invention provides a method of treating or reducing the risk of a PD-L1-mediated disease or condition in a human in need thereof, the method comprising administering to said human a ligand (eg, an antibody or antibody fragment) that specifically binds a human PD-L1 protein. The invention also provides a corresponding ligand. In an embodiment, the PD-L1 is encoded by a PD-L1 nucleotide sequence comprising a variation set out in Table 21, eg, comprising one or more of said SNPs (eg, RS1411262 and\/or rs4143815; or 8923C and\/or 395C). In a preferred embodiment, the variation is 8923C.","The present invention provides anti-PD-L1 ligands; and PD-L1-binding or targeting ligands as described herein. The ligands have a variety of utilities. Some of the ligands, for instance, are useful in specific binding assays, for genotyping or phenotyping humans, affinity purification of PD-L1, in particular human PD-L1 or its ligands and in screening assays to identify other antagonists of PD-L1 activity. Some of the ligands of the invention are useful for inhibiting PD-L1-mediated activities.","Anti-PD-L1 ligands (eg, antibodies and anti-sense RNA) have been developed based on targeting and neutralising so-called \u201cwild-type\u201d human PD-L1, which is a commonly-occurring form. While such therapies are useful for human patients harbouring this form of human PD-L1, the inventor considered it useful to investigate the possibility of targeting rarer\u2014but still naturally-occurring\u2014forms of PD-L1 amongst human populations. In this way, the inventor arrived at insight into the natural occurrences and distributions of rarer human PD-L1 forms that can serve as useful targets (at the protein or nucleic acid level) for human treatment, prophylaxis and diagnosis pertinent to diseases and conditions mediated or associated with PD-L1 activity. This particularly provides for tailored therapies, prophylaxis and diagnosis in humans that are devoid of the common PD-L1 gene or protein.","The skilled person will know that SNPs or other changes that translate into amino acid variation can cause variability in activity and\/or conformation of human targets to be addressed. This has spawned great interest in personalized medicine where genotyping and knowledge of protein and nucleotide variability is used to more effectively tailor medicines and diagnosis of patients. The invention, therefore, provides for tailored pharmaceuticals and testing that specifically addresses rarer PD-L1 polymorphic variant forms. Such forms or \u201calleles\u201d (at the nucleotide level), comprise one or more changes at the nucleotide and amino acid levels from the corresponding common form nucleotide and amino acids sequences, ie, there are one or more non-synonymous (aka \u201cmissense\u201d) changes at the nucleotide level that translate into one or more corresponding changes in the protein target in humans.","Furthermore, the inventor surprisingly realised that the rarer natural forms, although present in humans at much lower frequencies than the common form, nevertheless are represented in multiple and ethnically-diverse human populations and usually with many human examples per represented ethnic population. Thus, the inventor realised that targeting such rarer forms would provide for effective treatment, prophylaxis or diagnosis across many human ethnic populations, thereby extending the utility of the present invention. In particular, human PD-L1 variations are correlated with increased incidence or risk of PD-L1 mediated diseases or conditions, such as cancer. The inventor analysed such variations and devised the collections of variants in Table 21. In this respect, therefore, the invention provides various aspects and aspects as set out below in this example.","The inventor saw that there is significant industrial and medical application for the invention in terms of guiding the choice of anti-TOI (PD-L1) ligand for administration to human patients for therapy and\/or prophylaxis of PD-L1-mediated or associated diseases or conditions.
