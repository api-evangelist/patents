title: Bioreactor processing of wastewater
abstract: A bioreactor tank is internally partitioned into two chambers within which wastewater is respectively aerated and from which a bacteria purified permeate is withdrawn after filtration, while a high bacteria content remnant is recycled between the chambers to repeatedly undergo biological treatment by aeration within one of the tank chambers.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"p":["The present invention relates generally to improved bioreactor processing of wastewater.","The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefore.","Wastewater has heretofore been processed by biological treatment within one or more bioreactor settling tanks, induced by aeration to allow bacteria to metabolize soluble organic contaminants within the wastewater. The bacteria in the wastewater are then allowed to settle downstream and be partially recycled to maintain the concentration of bioreactive bacteria for retreatment. Membrane filtration systems for biological treatment of wastewater are also generally known.","The foregoing referred to type of prior known bioreactor and membrane filtration systems for processing wastewater, involved frequent disassembly of equipment and interruptions in operation for replacement of parts and\/or cleaning of the filtration membranes because of fouling thereof. Also, relatively large tank sizes and equipment installational space was required at increased costs in order to handle wastewater processing of given quantities so as to meet certain needs such as those on-board sea vessels dependent on the availability of vessel crew handling personnel.","It is therefore an important object of the present invention to provide a membrane filtration type of bioreactor system through which tank size, membrane fouling and installational space and size are reduced, as well as associated costs while accommodating certain wastewater processing needs.","In accordance with the present invention, a single bioreactor tank is utilized for processing of wastewater delivered thereto, by aeration and settling within the tank having one large chamber and one small volume chamber separated by an internal partition. The wastewater delivered to the chamber of larger volume undergoes biological treatment by aeration and recycling by overflowing the partition into the smaller volume chamber from which wastewater of higher bacteria content is recycled back into the larger volume chamber through passageway openings in the partition.","A processed portion of the biologically treated wastewater with contaminant solids removed therefrom is separated from the wastewater within the smaller volume chamber by exposure to filtration membranes from which a maximized bacteria purified permeate is withdrawn after separation from the remaining wastewater having an increased bacterial content, which gravitationally settles toward the bottom portion of the smaller volume chamber having a downwardly converging cross-section so as to enhance by compression the recycled outflow through the partition passageway openings into the bottom of the larger volume chamber just above aeration outlets therein.","Referring now to the drawing in detail, the apparatus of a bioreactor processing system  in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, as illustrated in , includes a single bioreactor tank  that is internally divided by one partition  only into one volumetrically larger chamber  and one volumetrically smaller chamber . Contaminated wastewater to be processed is delivered to one side of the tank  through an inflow conduit . Such wastewater received within the larger chamber  undergoes biologically reactive treatment during aeration with oxygen that is pressurized for inflow through nozzles  at the bottom of the tank chamber  connected by an aeration supply conduit  to some external aeration source .","In accordance with the present invention, wastewater within the tank  having its bacteria concentration increased exclusively by gravitational settlement toward the bottom of the tank chamber  is continuously recycled from bottom portion thereof through openings  in the partition  back into the chamber  adjacent to the tank bottom. The wastewater has its bacteria concentration reduced by further biological treatment by passage of the recycling wastewater at the top of the chamber  into a membrane filtration device  for filtered separation of a wastewater permeate withdrawn through a discharge conduit  as a fully cleansed effluent with reduced contamination of the wastewater.","As shown in , the membrane filtration device  located outside the tank  has a membrane filter  for filtered separation of the wastewater received from the top of the chamber  in the tank  through conduit  so that a filtered portion of the wastewater is returned from the bottom of the filtration device  to the side of the chamber  through an outflow recycling conduit . The discharge conduit  is connected to the filtration device  on that side of the filter  receiving the recycled inflow from the tank chamber .","As also shown in , the lower portion of the volumetrically smaller chamber  converges toward the lower end of the partition  at the bottom  of the tank . Such convergence is established by an inclined side wall section  of the tank  so as to enhance recycling passage of a solids concentrated portion of the recycling wastewater into the bottom portion of the volumetrically larger chamber  through the partition openings  under compression during gravitational settling within the chamber  before the recycling outflow through the opening  into the larger tank chamber .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 2"],"b":["28","18","16","30","34","28","38","42","12","28","18","32","28","24","16"]},"The bioreactor processing apparatus as hereinbefore described prolongs the operational life of the membrane filter  in the device  by reducing fouling thereof as a result of confinement of the filtration device  within recycled biologically treated wastewater having a reduced bacteria content in the small volume tank chamber , separated by the partition  from the larger volume chamber  so as to account for a reduced size of the tank  accommodating the processing of a given inflow quantity of wastewater for withdrawal of an effluent permeate with improved quality. Furthermore, because of operational and\/or locational relationship of membrane separation to bioreactor treatment within the tank , a protective aspect is associated with the positionings of the membrane filtering device  either inside or outside of the tank  as hereinbefore described. In order to further prolong the life of the membrane  in the device , the wastewater may also be initially treated for separation of microorganisms therefrom by predeposit into the larger volume chamber  of fixed media such plastic balls or sheets providing large surfaces area onto which the microorganisms attach and grow.","Obviously, other modifications and variations of the present invention may be possible in light of the foregoing teachings. It is therefore to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described."],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS","p":["A more complete appreciation of the invention and many of its attendant advantages will be readily appreciated as the same becomes better understood by reference to the following detailed description when considered in connection with the accompanying drawing wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
