No. 10\/405,733, filed Apr. 1, 2003 and issued as U.S. Pat. No. 7,305,339, entitled \u201cRESTORATION OF HIGH-ORDER MEL FREQUENCY CEPSTRAL COEFFICIENTS.\u201d","The present invention relates to Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) in general, and more particularly to ASR employing Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC).","Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems that convert speech to text typically comprise two main processing stages, often referred to as the \u201cfront-end\u201d and the \u201cback-end.\u201d The front-end typically converts digitized speech into a set of features that represent the speech content of the spectrum of the speech signal, usually sampled at regular intervals. The features are then converted to text at the back-end.","During feature extraction the speech signal is typically divided into overlapping frames, with each frame having a predefined duration. A feature vector, typically having a predefined number of features, is then calculated for each frame. In most ASR systems a feature vector is obtained by:","a) deriving an estimate of the spectral envelope corresponding to the frame;","b) multiplying the estimate of the spectral envelope by a predetermined set of frequency domain weighting functions, where each weighting function is non-zero over a narrow range of frequencies, known as the frequency channel, and computing the integrals thereof, known as bins, to form a binned spectrum; and","c) assigning the computed integrals or a set of pre-determined functions thereof to respective components of the feature vector.","Many ASR systems employ speech recognition features know as Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) that are obtained by employing specific frequency domain weighting functions at step b) and computing a cosine transform of the logarithm of the binned spectrum at step c). Typically, the spectral envelope estimate at step a) is represented by the Amplitude Short Time Spectrum (ASTS) or Power Short Time Spectrum (PSTS) of the frame. The ASTS and PSTS are obtained as absolute values and squared absolute values respectively of the Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT) applied to the frame, where the frame is multiplied by a smooth windowing function, such as a Hamming window, and then transformed using the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). The frequency channels used in step b) typically overlap, and a frequency channel with a higher channel number has a greater width than a frequency channel with a lower channel number. A Mel transform function Mel(f) of the frequency axis may be used to define the frequency channel, where Mel(f) is a convex non-linear function of f whose derivative increases rapidly with f. A typical example is Mel(f)=2595*log(1+f\/700), where f is a frequency in Hz. A set of equidistant points mf, i=0, . . . , N+1, are defined at the mel-frequency interval [Mel(f), Mel(f)] as follows:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["mf","i"]},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"Mel","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"msub":{"mi":["f","start"]}}},{"mi":"i","mo":"\u00d7","mfrac":{"mrow":[{"mrow":[{"mi":"Mel","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"msub":{"mi":["f","Nyquist"]}}},{"mi":"Mel","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"msub":{"mi":["f","start"]}}}],"mo":"-"},{"mi":"N","mo":"+","mn":"1"}]}}],"mo":"+"}}}},"br":{},"sub":["start ","Nyquist ","i ","i","i","0","1","2","L\u22121"],"sup":["th ","\u22121 ","th ","th ","\u221250"]},"While various MFCC front-end schemes might employ different spectral envelope estimation techniques, Mel function definitions, numbers N of frequency channels, etc., the maximal dimension N of an MFCC vector is equal to the number of frequency domain weighting functions or the number of bin values. The starting coordinates of the MFCC vector, referred to as low-order cepstra (LOC), generally reflect the global shape of the spectral envelope, while the ending coordinates, referred to as high-order cepstra (HOC), typically have relatively small values, and generally reflect the rapidly-varying-in-frequency nature of the spectrum. It has been observed that in small vocabulary recognition tasks the recognition accuracy is virtually unaffected when L\u2245N\/2, i.e., when the MFCC vector is truncated by 50%.","In some ASR systems, the recording of a speech signal and the subsequent speech recognition are performed by processors at separate locations, such as where a speech signal is recorded at a client device, such as a cell phone, and processed at an ASR server. Audio information that is captured at a client device is often transmitted to a server over a communications channel. Typically, and especially where the client and server communicate via a wireless network, it is not feasible to transmit the entire speech signal due to communications channel bandwidth limitations. Therefore, the speech signal is typically compressed. However, it is imperative that the compression scheme used to compress the speech will not significantly reduce the recognition rate at the server. Thus, in some systems a compressed version of the recognition features themselves is transmitted to the server. Since redundant information has been already removed in generating these features, an optimal compression rate can be attained.","In one such implementation of recording and performing speech recognition at different locations, known as Distributed Speech Recognition (DSR), a client device performs front-end speech processing where features are extracted, compressed, and transmitted via a communications channel to a server, which then performs back-end speech processing including speech-to-text conversion. In order to conserve bandwidth, MFCC vectors are often truncated in DSR systems prior to transmission. For example, the ETSI DSR standards ES 201 108 (April 2000) and ES 202 050 (July 2002) define two different front-end feature extraction and compression algorithms employing MFCC vectors where only 13 cepstra (L=13) out of 23 (N=23) are transmitted to the server for ASR back-end processing.","In some DSR systems, speech reconstruction and playback capabilities are required at the server. Where pitch is derived for each frame during speech processing, various techniques may be used to synthesize a speech signal using MFCC vectors and pitch. Unfortunately, while truncated MFCC vectors are suitable for speech recognition, speech reconstruction quality suffers significantly where truncated MFCC vectors are employed. Truncated MFCC vectors reduce the accuracy of spectra estimation, resulting in reconstructed speech having a \u201cmechanical\u201d sound quality. Therefore, a method for restoring high-order Mel frequency cepstral coefficients of truncated MFCC vectors would be advantageous.","The present invention provides for estimating HOC in an MFCC vector for voiced speech frames from the available LOC and pitch. The estimated HOC of the present invention improves both speech reconstruction quality and speech recognition accuracy when compared with speech reconstruction and recognition using truncated MFCC vectors.","In one aspect of the present invention a method is provided for estimating high-order Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients, the method including a) in an MFCC vector of length N having L

The method of  is typically performed iteratively, alternating between performing speech reconstruction from an MFCC vector and a pitch value, and applying front-end speech processing to the reconstructed speech signal.","In the method of , given an MFCC vector having L low-order coefficients (LOC), a predetermined number N\u2212L of high-order coefficients (HOC) are initialized to predetermined values, such as zeros. A preferred method of HOC initialization is described in greater detail hereinbelow with reference to . The N\u2212L HOC when appended to the L LOC form a complete N-dimensional MFCC vector, now referred to as the candidate MFCC vector. A speech signal frame is then synthesized from the candidate MFCC vector and a pitch value using any suitable speech reconstruction technique, such as that which is described in the U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/432,081 to Chazan et al. entitled \u201cMethod and system for speech reconstruction from speech recognition features.\u201d Both the MFCC vector LOC and the pitch value are preferably derived from the same speech signal using conventional techniques.

The method of  may be performed one or more additional times, such as up to a predetermined number of iterations (e.g., 3), where the HOC of the output MFCC vector of a given iteration is appended to the given LOC to form a new candidate MFCC vector for the next iteration.","A harmonic or line spectrum model of voiced speech is preferably used during speech reconstruction for parametric representation of the speech frame. At each iteration the model parameters are preferably estimated from the corresponding candidate MFCC vector and input pitch value such that the output MFCC vector that is subsequently produced from the synthesized frame by the front-end processor approximates the candidate MFCC vector as closely as possible with respect to certain metrics as described in greater detail hereinbelow.","It is well known that a speech signal within a relatively short frame can be accurately approximated by a periodic signal. The period duration as measured in samples is given by a pitch or its inverse, referred to as a normalized pitch frequency F. The Fourier spectrum of an infinite periodic signal is a train of impulses (i.e., harmonics, lines) located at multiples of the pitch frequency. This spectrum is referred to as a line spectrum. Each harmonic has its amplitude and phase values.

The coordinates of vector P are harmonic amplitudes. EQ. 1 can be viewed as an equation for determining harmonic amplitudes. In practice, the matrix equation might not have an exact solution and may be solved in the least square sense. The number of harmonics might exceed the number of the equations\/bin values. Thus, additional constraints may be imposed on the harmonic magnitudes in order to guarantee a single solution.\n","If PSTS is used at the front-end, the binned spectrum Bmay be transformed so that it approximates the binned spectrum B, which would be obtained for the frame by using ASTS. Once Bto Btransformation is done, EQ. 1 and ASTS processing may be performed without modification. A preferred method for Bto Btransformation is described in greater detail hereinbelow.","The reconstructed speech frame obtained at the end of each iteration may be further improved in terms of perceptual quality using conventional techniques, such as by synthesizing harmonic phase values and adding an unvoiced component, and then combined with other such frames in order to produce a speech signal for playback. Thus, the method of  may be implemented as an intermediate step of known speech reconstruction techniques that reconstruct speech from MFCC vectors and pitch values.","Reference is now made to , which is a simplified flowchart illustration of a method of MFCC vector HOC restoration, operative in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. The method of  is similar to the method of , and differs in that the LOC-HOC concatenation is implemented by multiplying their corresponding binned spectra, and that the speech reconstruction step is terminated after the harmonic model parameters are estimated.

The conversion is preferably performed using an N-dimensional Inverse Discrete Cosine Transform (IDCT) followed by an antilog operation.

These harmonic amplitudes may also be used for speech signal reconstruction in accordance with conventional techniques.","If the iteration counter has not reached the predefined number of iterations, the counter is incremented, and a new Bbinned spectrum corresponding to the HOC vector Cis calculated in accordance with EQ. 3. This vector is then processed during the next iteration.","Reference is now made to , which is a simplified block-flow diagram of a Distributed Speech Recognition system employing MFCC vector HOC estimation, constructed and operative in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. In  an extended DSR front-end  extracts from each frame of an input speech signal a LOC, a pitch value, and typically other parameters such as voicing class, compresses this information, and transmits the compressed data to a server , such as over a wireless communications channel. At the server side the data stream is decompressed at a decompressor . The LOC and pitch are passed to a HOC restoration block  that operates in accordance with the methods described hereinabove with reference to . HOC restoration block  produces full-size MFCC vectors that are sent to an ASR back-end  which completes the speech recognition process and outputs text. In parallel, the full size MFCC vectors together with the pitch values and the voicing class information are passed to a speech reconstruction block . Additionally, HOC restoration block  preferably passes the basis functions sampled at pitch frequencies and the mixing coefficients to a harmonic amplitudes modeling block  where the harmonic amplitudes are calculated in accordance with EQ. 5. The harmonic amplitudes are also preferably passed to speech reconstruction block  which outputs a synthesized speech signal for playback.","Reference is now made to , which is a simplified graphical illustration showing improved speech reconstruction accuracy attributable to MFCC vector HOC estimation of the present invention.  presents the results of the application of the present invention to a real speech signal in which recorded speech data was used containing multiple utterances produced by a number of male and female speakers. The number of voiced frames used for the evaluation exceeds 4,000. Reference harmonic amplitudes were obtained directly from STFT of each voiced frame using precise pitch values. MFCC vectors were computed using an ETSI ES 201 108 standard front-end. The reconstruction accuracy was measured by linear signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Average accuracy as a function of pitch period length is shown, where the solid line corresponds to the reconstruction from truncated MFCC vectors, while the dashed curve corresponds to the reconstruction from the MFCC vectors as performed by the present invention.","It is appreciated that one or more of the steps of any of the methods described herein may be omitted or carried out in a different order than that shown, without departing from the true spirit and scope of the invention.","While the methods and apparatus disclosed herein may or may not have been described with reference to specific computer hardware or software, it is appreciated that the methods and apparatus described herein may be readily implemented in computer hardware or software using conventional techniques.","While the present invention has been described with reference to one or more specific embodiments, the description is intended to be illustrative of the invention as a whole and is not to be construed as limiting the invention to the embodiments shown.
