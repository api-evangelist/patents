title: Near eye display prism optic assembly
abstract: An optical assembly uses a plastic prism with one flat surface and a collimating lens optic to provide the capability of imaging a color micro-display to the eye. The collimating optic and flat prism surface can allow for aberration-free diopter adjustment and an image with very low-magnitude, nearly-symmetric distortion. The collimating optic can also provide environmental protection of the prism involving an optical plastic device. The input illumination from the micro-display enters the prism, is reflected two times within the prism, exits the prism, and passes through the collimating optic before being viewed by the eye. Such an optical assembly can provide a field of view with eye-relief and exit pupil when viewing a full-color micro-display.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE","BACKGROUND INFORMATION","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured, used, sold, imported and\/or licensed by or for the United States Government.","The disclosure relates to near eye, head or helmet-mounted display systems, weapon sight viewers, and handheld viewing devices, incorporating micro-display technologies.","Most prior art in the area of monolithic prisms for micro-display imaging have similar properties. Such patents describe a prism with three optically-active surfaces, which can be used with and without a corrector optic.","Recent developments in micro-display technology have created large-format, full-color micro-displays. A new near-eye optical imaging approach is needed to fully realize the size and resolution of these displays with wide fields of view and large eye pupils. Also to use such a device effectively in a system concept, the imaging device must allow a large range of diopter adjustment for comfort and must conserve power by not requiring digital image remapping of the displayed image.","Similar previous work employs a monolithic prism for presenting micro-display imagery to the eye in a compact, low-profile manner. These monolithic prisms utilize multiple internal reflections to image a micro-display to the eye. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,745,295 describes such an apparatus, including an image display device and an ocular optical system for displaying an image of the display device. While such known display image sources can scale to diagonal dimension of less than or equal to 15 mm, these known sources will have several performance flaws if scaled to image sources with a diagonal dimension of greater than 15 mm. This is due to the limited optical path associated with such known prism arrangements. Further, such prior art disclosures (e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,745,295) describe embodiments that have discontinuities in optical surface profiles which preclude scaling without extensive redesign.","The present disclosure uniquely addresses solutions to the flaws in such known works, e.g., lack of focus in the absence of a digital remapping of imagery, asymmetric distortion, requirement of digital remapping of imagery, small eye relief (<25 mm), small pupil (4 mm), small usable array size on the micro-display (<15 mm), small field of view (<40\u00b0\u00d730\u00b0), and environmental vulnerability. In another aspect, scalable optical configurations are disclosed suitable for various display image formats with a diagonal dimension of less than 30 mm.","Exemplary embodiments are disclosed to allow imaging large display format sizes as needed. Such exemplary embodiments can have continuous surface profiles throughout optically active areas on prism optic, which allow large pupil sizes and the ability to be scaled to different sizes and formats.","Further, prisms made of molded plastic for low weight and ease of application of an aspheric surface can be utilized. All optical plastic elements require glass sacrificial windows to protect the delicate plastic material during normal use, decreasing the usable eye relief of such a device. The corrector optic is chosen in an exemplary embodiment to deliver the 25 mm eye relief for ease of use while providing environmental protection for the prism. Such an exemplary embodiment can address the need of a pupil up to 6 millimeters in diameter, a large eye relief of 25 millimeters, and display diagonals of up to 24.6 millimeters simultaneously in a package that will fit on a helmet mount, weapon sight, or handheld viewer and will be protected from environmental hazards. Additionally, such an exemplary embodiment can be telecentric and have negligible chromatic aberration and distortion, which can allow it to be used as a full-color photopic, digital display device without any digital image re-mapping for a large range of diopter focus.","Low and symmetric distortion can be attained by making the surface nearest to the display flat and controlling magnification nearer to the pupil. Low and nearly-symmetric distortion make this a scalable design because the image does not warp when scaled.","The corrector group is selected such that it sufficiently balances the backward curving field and provides excellent chromatic correction. This radially-symmetric correction is applied near to the pupil, and therefore has little effect on distortion. The prism is configured in conjunction with this corrector group to produce negligible distortion effect at the object plane that is extremely symmetric in comparison to prior art.","Such a unique configuration can also allow a telecentric optical path in object space such that the focus of the eyepiece can be adjusted +1 to \u22122 diopters without any significant magnification errors or warping of imagery. Prior art does not specifically teach this. Rather, prior art requires warping tables to digitally remap the imagery at nominal focus and any different diopter settings.","Such a micro-display technology as variously embodied can create much larger format arrays, which can have slightly smaller pixels. Also, uses of such devices requiring larger fields of view can be satisfied. The present disclosure addresses these concerns, including the needs for a large-format display.","Accordingly, one aspect of the present disclosure relates to an optical configuration that is reproducible, uses a prism optic in conjunction with a glass collimating optic, and presents imagery of a micro-display to the eye.","Another aspect of the present disclosure is to provide focus ability, low-power implementation, large field of view, exit pupil, eye relief for a large-format, and full-color micro-display.","In one exemplary embodiment, lightweight, plastic prism Optic is used with an aspheric surface in conjunction with a glass corrector optic to magnify the image of a micro-display and very comfortably present the immersive imagery to a user.","Such an exemplary embodiment can nominally provide a 40\u00d730 degree, rectangular field of view of a 24.6-millimeter-diagonal, full-color, micro-display at a 25 millimeter eye relief for an axial exit pupil that is 10 millimeters in diameter, decreasing to a 6 millimeter exit pupil for the corner field angle. Furthermore, the optical features can be scaled to fit several display sizes at multiple fields of view. Such an embodiment as exemplified can be scalable to have the same field of view and eye relief on a 30-millimeter-diagonal display.","A detailed description is provided in reference to an exemplary embodiment shown in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["1","4"]},"The POA  comprises an optical member  and a corrector lens grouping . The optical member  has three adjacent optical surfaces, two of which are curved surfaces; the other surface is flat. The volume between these surfaces together with their mutually orthogonal edge faces is filled with an optical polymer. Such a prism optic is ideally comprised of an optical plastic that can be diamond turned or molded to create the 3 optical surfaces and mechanical mounting features. However, this prism can also be molded or ground in glass or some other optical material that transmits visible radiation.","Light rays emitted from the flat panel display surface  enter the optical member  through the first transmitting surface  and are subsequently reflected by the first reflecting surface . The first reflected light rays are again reflected by the second reflecting surface , whereupon they are led to the observer's eye pupil  via a second transmitting surface  and the respective transmitting optical surfaces of the corrector lens grouping . The first reflection at surface  is enabled by total internal reflection (TIR). A back-coated mirror accomplishes the second reflection at surface . Surfaces  and  are, in reality, one in the same surface. They are differentiated solely on the basis of the reciprocating ray surface sequence through the optical member .","The optical surfaces of optical member  are tilted and decentered with respect to a reference axis , which is the axial principal ray that passes through the center of the eye pupil .","In order to correct the POA for the image errors induced by tilted and decentered surfaces, the curved surfaces of optical member  are anamorphic, wherein the surface geometries are independent in the X- and Y-axes. The sag of an anamorphic surface is given by the expression",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"z","mo":"=","mrow":{"mfrac":{"mrow":[{"mrow":[{"msub":{"mi":["c","x"]},"mo":"\u2062","msup":{"mi":"x","mn":"2"}},{"msub":{"mi":["c","y"]},"mo":"\u2062","msup":{"mi":"y","mn":"2"}}],"mo":"+"},{"mn":"1","mo":"+","msqrt":{"mrow":{"mn":"1","mo":["-","-"],"mrow":[{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mn":"1","mo":"+","msub":{"mi":["k","x"]}}},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"msubsup":{"mi":["c","x"],"mn":"2"},"msup":{"mi":"x","mn":"2"}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mn":"1","mo":"+","msub":{"mi":["k","y"]}}},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"msubsup":{"mi":["c","y"],"mn":"2"},"msup":{"mi":"y","mn":"2"}}]}}}]},"mo":["+","+"],"mrow":[{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":"i","mo":"=","mn":"1"},"mn":"16"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["\u03b1","i"]},"mo":"\u2062","msup":{"mi":["x","i"]}}},{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":"i","mo":"=","mn":"1"},"mn":"16"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["\u03b2","i"]},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"msup":{"mi":["y","i"]},"mo":[".","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mtext":{}},"mi":"where"}}}]}},{"msub":{"mi":["c","x"]},"mo":"=","mfrac":{"mn":"1","msub":{"mi":["R","x"]}}},{"msub":{"mi":["c","y"]},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mfrac":{"mn":"1","msub":{"mi":["R","y"]}},"mo":"."}}],"mo":[",","\u2062",",","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mtext":{}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}]}}}},"kand k=conic constant in x and y,","\u03b1=aspheric coefficients on powers of x,","\u03b2=aspheric coefficients on powers of y.","Anamorphic surfaces are not rotationally symmetric, however, they are bi-laterally symmetric (about the Y-axis).","The optical surfaces of the corrector lens grouping  are spheres, all of which are centered on the reference axis .","With such an exemplary embodiment, because some of the surfaces of the POA are tilted and decentered about a reference axis, such first-order properties that are normally derived from paraxial ray tracing would be inapplicable, and therefore are invalid. Therefore, it was necessary to use exact ray tracing to calculate attributes such as focal length, numerical aperture, image height, entrance and exit pupil positions, etc.","Adjusting diopter focus on this optical assembly can be achieved in two ways: by moving the corrector optic , or by moving the micro-display .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["1","12","11","12","19","12","19","13","14","12","19","15","14","14","15","12","12"]},"In yet another aspect, minor adjustment to diopter focus can be achieved by moving corrector optic  along reference axis , e.g., in the directions indicated by arrow . In this another aspect of the exemplary embodiment, corrector optic  has a positive optical power, and therefore may not efficiently allow diopter adjustment. The corrector optic can move, e.g., 2 mm to achieve a diopter change of 0.5 D. However, corrector optic  can better effectively adjust the magnification of the prism optic assembly. For applications that require precision tuning of magnification, corrector optic  can be positioned along reference axis , e.g., through the use of machined lens spacers and precision-machined lens housings to achieve fine-tuning of the focal length of the prism optic assembly. Focal length of the prism optic assembly can be adjusted in this manner over a range, e.g., of 0.5 mm with negligible effect to system performance.","The corrector optic  also provides an environmental seal for the prism optic  when this assembly is mounted in a package. An exemplary embodiment of the mounted prism optic assembly is shown in . Such an exemplary embodiment would have the prism optic  comprised of an optical plastic, which can be susceptible to scratching, moisture, and other environmental hazards. In this exemplary embodiment, corrector optic  is comprised of glass material. Corrector optic  can be sealed to the housing at location  either with adhesive or elastomeric seal to form an airtight seal around its annular contact area with the lens housing . Such an exemplary corrector optic  can provide a ruggedized protection for the prism optic .","The corrector optic  allows this optical assembly to have a long eye relief, large field of view, and large optical pupil, while still remaining compact in size. Such an exemplary embodiment can be used in handheld, weapon-mounted, or head-mounted scenarios, and can be configured to mount on a headgear, e.g., a helmet, which is the most size-limiting employment of a head-mounted optic.","The optical assembly as described uses a flat surface closest to the micro-display, a correcting optic, and an aspheric surface that are designed in conjunction to provide a very low-magnitude, symmetric optical distortion.","Optical distortion is a common aberration in prior art, and is defined as a change in focal length with field angle; or more commonly, an aberration that alters the shape of an image. Prism optics inherently exhibit non radially-symmetric distortion due to their use of off-axis, tilted optical surfaces with optical power. An exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure will exhibit optical distortion as shown in . The line grid in  represents a perfect image with 0% distortion. The small \u201cX\u201d symbols denote the distorted location of the grid intersections and represent the distorted image as formed by the prism optic assembly. The maximum distortion in an exemplary embodiment of this disclosure is less than 1.32%. This maximum occurs at the extreme corners of the field of view, at 25-degree field angle from the optical axis. This amount of distortion is not noticeable by the human eye, and is considered to be orthoscopic, meaning free of distortion. The distortion exhibited by the exemplary embodiment is nearly radially-symmetric about the viewing optical axis, which creates imagery that is very similar to that provided by more conventional lens optics. Even if the magnitude of the distortion was increased to become noticeable in alternative exemplary embodiments, the nearly axially-symmetric profile would still provide a high level of comfort for the user of this device.  indicates the features employed by the exemplary embodiment of the current disclosure to uniquely control distortion to levels below human perception. Corrector optic  applies radially symmetric optical power and balances negative field curvature, thereby reducing the optical power required by the surfaces of the prism. Furthermore, optical surface  on the prism is flat, and contributes no optical power. Optical surface  is located near to the focal plane, and therefore any optical power on this surface contributes almost completely to field curvature and distortion. The exemplary embodiment eliminates optical power on this sensitive surface to reduce distortion and control distortion symmetry.","An exemplary embodiment of this optical assembly provides a 25-millimeter eye relief when viewing a 40-degree horizontal by 30-degree vertical field of view on a 19.2\u00d715.36 millimeter, color micro-display. The designed optical pupil is 4 millimeters in diameter, and provides equivalent axial optical performance when positioned at any X-Y location within a 6 millimeter circle centered on the assembly's optical axis at the eye pupil plane. Also, the optical assembly provides adequate optical performance for all off-axis fields at X-Y displacements of the 4 millimeter pupil that decrease with field angle down to 1 millimeter when viewing the corner field on the micro-display. The pupil size of this invention is a feature that provides for a very comfortable, immersive viewing of the micro-display imagery. This comfort level makes the exemplary embodiment(s) ideal for an immersive display in commercial applications and as well as field mobility and targeting applications.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 1","FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":"3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 4","FIG. 5"]},"Chromatic aberration is an image blur caused by an optic focusing separate color wavelengths differently from one another. The primary chromatic aberrations are axial and lateral. Axial chromatic aberration occurs when each color focuses at a different distance along the optical axis, and appears as circular blur spot. The spot typically shows either a blue or red ring around a white spot. Lateral chromatic aberration occurs when each color focuses at a different field height, and appears as an oblong, rainbow-colored spot. Lateral chromatic aberration is typically corrected by using several different glass types with different properties. Lateral chromatic aberration is the most challenging chromatic aberration to correct in a prism optic assembly due to the use of a prism optic that is made entirely of the same material.

Further, a flat surface  can be disposed near a display plane to allow distortion to be uniquely controlled by a corrector optic  and the two anamorphic aspheric surfaces (e.g., \/ and  of ) such that it is negligible, or orthoscopic. A centered, symmetric corrector lens  and the flat surface  of the prism  allow us to uniquely achieve low distortion and telecentricity.","Further, the display focal space can be uniquely telecentric with a maximum chief ray angle of 0.4 deg across an entire (e.g., 19.2\u00d715.36 mm rectangular) display area; allowing for no apparent magnification or performance change throughout a large range of travel for diopter-focus adjustment. For example, 3.25 diopters of adjustment can be made before there is even 1 pixel of magnification change. The flat surface  and corrector optic  features interact with the anamorphic asphere surfaces to allow such an exemplary embodiment to achieve the unique attributes of, e.g., long eye relief (25 mm), large display area (19.2\u00d715.36 mm with 40-deg\u00d732-deg FOV), and scalability to different format sizes.","Accordingly, such a prism-optic assembly can achieve:","Nearly symmetric distortion;","negligible orthoscopic (negligible . . . <1.32%) distortion (see, e.g., );","one flat surface (see, e.g.,  of ) at surface closest to display;","long eye relief (25 mm+);","large display area (19.2\u00d715.32 mm);","telecentric (only 0.4 deg variation in field angle across display . . . good diopter focus);","diopter range without digital warping;","scalable to other formats and sizes;","diopter range +1 to \u22122 D, and maybe larger;","corrected chromatic aberration;\n\n","biconic Zernicke anamorphic asphere;","doublet corrector element;","3 surface prism; and\/or","all surfaces are continuous throughout optical area.
