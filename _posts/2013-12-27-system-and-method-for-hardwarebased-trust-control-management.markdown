title: System and method for hardware-based trust control management
abstract: A trust control management method for security, operable on a computer system generates a unique Trust ID value by combining user-defined values with hardware-specific values associated with the user's computer system and storing the Trust ID value in a memory register physically associated with the hardware of the computer system. A Trust Control Suite (TCS) operable with a server OS/hypervisor maintains a database of user-defined values and hardware-specific values for computer systems clustered in a trusted computing pool. An attestation procedure is performed by the trust control server combining the user-defined values with the hardware-specific values from its database and comparing it to the user-stored Trust ID value stored in the memory register associated with a user's computer system. Depending on whether it is a match or mismatch, the TCS can determine if it is a trusted computer or not, and can take appropriate alerts and policy actions.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF INVENTION","SUMMARY OF INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION"],"p":["Shared cloud computing technologies are designed to be very agile and flexible, transparently using available resources to process workloads for their customers. However, there are security and privacy concerns with not knowing the integrity, identity and location of the physical devices that make up a cloud platform, and allowing unrestricted workload migration among the servers that comprise an unverified cloud platform and across such unverified cloud platforms. Whenever multiple workloads are present on a multi-server cloud platform, there is a need to segregate those workloads from each other so that they do not interfere with each other, gain access to each other's sensitive data, or otherwise compromise the security or privacy of the workloads. Imagine two rival companies with workloads on the same cloud platform; each company would want to ensure that the servers housing their workloads are trusted to protect their information from the other company as well as any other unauthorized access.","Another concern with shared cloud computing is that workloads could move from servers in a cloud platform located in one country to servers in a cloud platform located in another country. Each country has its own laws for data security, privacy, and other aspects of information technology (IT). Because the requirements of these laws may conflict with an organization's policies or mandates (e.g., laws, regulations), an organization may decide that it needs to restrict which cloud platform it uses based on its specific location. A common desire is to only use cloud platform with servers physically located within the same country as the organization.","Forming trusted computing pools is a leading approach to aggregate trusted systems and segregate them from untrusted resources. This allows for the separation of higher-value, more sensitive workloads from commodity applications and data. The principles of operation are to: (1) Create a cloud platform to meet the specific and varying security requirements of users; (2) Control access to that cloud platform so that only the right applications get deployed there; and (3) Enable audits of the cloud platform so that users can verify compliance.","Such trusted computing pools allow IT to gain the benefits of the dynamic cloud environment while still enforcing higher levels of protections for their more critical workloads. The ultimate goal is to be able to use trusted verification and identification methodologies for deploying and migrating cloud workloads between and among trusted servers within a cloud platform. Current thinking has identified certain prerequisite steps, which can be thought of as staged requirements that a trusted cloud platform solution must meet:","Platform Attestation and Safe Hypervisor Launch: This stage attempts to ensure that the cloud workloads are run on trusted servers within the cloud platform. The cloud platform includes servers each with a hardware configuration (e.g., BIOS settings) and a hypervisor configuration. The hypervisor operates directly on the hardware, not on top of another operating system, thus it is imperative to show that the hypervisor has not been compromised and that it is the designated version and configuration. Before the server is used for workloads, its trustworthiness must be verified (measured). The items configured in the BIOS and hypervisor need to have their configurations verified before launching the hypervisor to ensure that the assumed level of trust is in place.","Trust-Based Homogeneous Secure Migration: Once the integrity of the cloud platform is established, the next stage requires that cloud workloads are able to be migrated among homogeneous trusted server platforms within a cloud environment.","Trust-Based and Geolocation-Based Homogeneous Secure Migration: This stage allows cloud workloads to be migrated among homogeneous trusted server platforms within a cloud environment, taking into consideration geolocation restrictions.","Achieving all three levels of control will not prevent attacks from succeeding, but unauthorized changes to the hypervisor or BIOS can be detected and launch of enforcement actions can be taken. These controls also facilitate compliance with security and governance policies, thus limiting damage to the information being processed or accessed within the cloud computing server.","However, the current approach to forming trusted computing pools by ensuring safe hypervisor launches and monitoring attestation of cloud server platforms has the deficiency that the conventional hypervisor management tools are software-based and run from a platform server virtually connected to remote client computers.","An example of a trust management technology for forming trusted computing pools is provided by Intel\u00ae Trusted Execution Technology (\u201cTXT\u201d). TXT implements a foundation for establishing a Transitive Chain of Trust (TCoT) that is rooted in hardware. Each module within the chain has an opportunity to examine and measure the next module, prior to that module's execution. The resulting Integrity Measurements (IM) are stored in shielded locations within a Trusted Platform Module (TPM). By using a secure communication method via the process of Remote Attestation, a third party can later request the Ns as evidence and proof that the BIOS and Operating System meet standards and thus are trusted.","In addition, TXT provides a method for introducing a user-defined value into the chain of evidence by storing that value in a specific secured NVRAM index with the TPM. The current art is to write the identical user-defined value into the TPM NVRAM index of a group of servers to designate a logical grouping or pool. Common terms for this method are \u201cGeotag\u201d, \u201cGeolocation\u201d and \u201cGeofence\u201d because historically the first user-defined values used in demonstrating this capability were geographic in nature. In a current implementation of this process, a country code or Geotag is encrypted using a SHA1 function and the resulting Geotag value is stored in the TPM NVRAM index, e.g. SHA1 (\u201cUSA\u201d). During the boot process, the Trusted Boot (TBOOT) module that initializes the BIOS uses a \u201cTPM EXTEND\u201d function to Extend the TPM NVRAM index Geotag value into Platform Configuration Register (PCR) . To validate the Geotag, the value in PCR is compared with an externally maintained lookup table.","However, the value placed into the TPM NVRAM index could be any arbitrary value because the lookup table only validates against the resulting PCR value. The validation confirms that PCR=LookupHash(GeoTag) but does not validate that Extend(PCR, SHA1(Geotag))==LookupHash(Geotag). The PCR Extend operation is not part of the validation.","There are drawbacks with deploying a homogeneous Geotag value across a number of server platforms within a Geofence. First, the fact that the value can be read by a virtual request to scan the value written in PCR  raises the concern that it could be spoofed. In addition, a bad actor could introduce a rogue machine into the Geofence that displays the \u201cexpected\u201d PCR  Geotag value. A less nefarious but nonetheless important issue is the inability of the common Geotag to tie specific virtual machines to unique physical platform hosts from an evidentiary and forensics perspective. What is needed is a more robust and foolproof way of ensuring that Geotag of a trusted virtual machine cannot be spoofed.","Finally, TXT includes an additional mechanism termed \u201cLaunch Control Policy\u201d (LCP), which allows the Platform Supplier (the manufacturer) and the Platform Owner (customer) each to specify requirements for a Secure Operating System Launch. The LCP policies contain specifications of valid Platform Configurations (PCONF policy), Operating System Versions (Measured Launch Environment, or MLE policy) and Authenticated Code Module (ACM) versions (SINIT policy). The LCP values are protected using features of the TPM and are compared against measured PCR and ACM values to determine Platform and Operating System trust. LCP provides a \u201cgo\/no-go\u201d mechanism for Secure Operating System Launch as well as providing enhanced protection against reset attacks and the ability to restrict access to specific TPM keys, data and resources.","Creating a Launch Control Policy can be a complex process and challenging to maintain. Given that the LCP process is a binary \u201cgo\/no go\u201d function, it can also be difficult to determine the root cause of LCP failures because the resulting inability to achieve Secure OS Launch is always the same. Moreover, depending on implementation, not all parts of LCP are included as part of the TCoT measurements, therefore it is possible for LCP to change and not impact the TCoT measurements.","In accordance with the present invention, a trust control management method for security in cloud computing, operable on a computer system, comprises:","generating a unique encoded alphanumeric value (Trust ID value) by combining a set of alphanumeric values defined by a user of the computer system with a set of other alphanumeric values associated with specific physical hardware embodied with the user's computer system using an encoding algorithm;","storing the Trust ID value associated with the hardware of the user's computer system;","maintaining in a database the user-defined values associated with the user's computer system together with a list of the types of physical hardware-specific values associated with the user's computer system that are to be retrieved the user's computer system and combined with the user-defined values, and the encoding algorithm; and","performing an attestation procedure via a trust control application by combining the user-defined values retrieved from the database with the selected physical hardware-specific values retrieved from the user's computer system using the same trust encoding algorithm retrieved from the database that was used to encode the original Trust ID value stored in the hardware of the user's computer system;","comparing the Trust ID value obtained in the attestation procedure with the original Trust ID value stored in the hardware of the user's computer system, and upon a match, determining that the user's computer system is a trusted computer system, or failure to match, determining that the user's computer system is not a trusted computer system, then taking an appropriate security action by the trust control application.","The method of generating and comparing the newly encoded Trust ID value with the original user-stored Trust ID value provides more robust and foolproof verification of the trust status of the user's computer system by encoding both user-defined values and hardware-specific values and storing the originally encoded Trust ID value in the hardware of the user's computer system.","The user-defined data may include a value associated with the geographical location where the user's computer system is to be deployed in order to define its grouping with the trusted computing pool associated with that geolocation.","The hardware-specific values may include values associated with a given version of firmware, BIOS, ROM, or other embedded code (collectively \u201cfirmware\u201d) present on the hardware.","The creation of the Trust ID value may be carried out without the knowledge of the person storing the Trust ID value on the user's computer hardware as a precaution against security penetration and spoofing.","Other objects, features, and advantages of the present invention will be explained in the following detailed description with reference to the appended drawings.","In the following detailed description, certain preferred embodiments are described as illustrations of the invention in specific resource applications, communication networks, and\/or computer-implemented services or application environments in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention.
