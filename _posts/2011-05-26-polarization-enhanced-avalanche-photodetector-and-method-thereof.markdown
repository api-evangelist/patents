Once the avalanche breakdown begins, the carriers are accelerated by the electric field to very high speeds striking other atoms and knocking carriers free from another atom, and ionizing it. As this process continues the number of free carriers moving through the material increases exponentially; often in just picoseconds. The avalanche multiplication process takes place in the multiplication portion of the photodetector. The carriers are absorbed for conversion to electrical current in the absorption portion of the photodetector.","An avalanche photodiode (APD) semiconductor device has a built-in first stage of gain through avalanche multiplication. Using a high reverse bias voltage (typically 100-200 V in silicon), APDs show an internal current gain effect (around 100) due to impact ionization, which is commonly referred to as avalanche effect. Gain in an avalanche device is achieved through photogenerated charge carrier impact ionization and a resultant multiplication of total charge carriers available. Typical applications for APDs include laser rangefinders and long range fiber optic telecommunication. Parameters for judging the usefulness of APDs for a particular application include quantum efficiency, or the efficiency related to the absorption of incident optical photons and subsequent generation of primary charge carriers; total dark current, noise equivalent power, spectral sensitivity range and operating voltage.","Semiconductor materials are selected for photodiodes based upon the wavelength range of the radiation that is desired to be utilized or detected. Group III-nitride avalanche detectors can presumably be widely functional between 1900 nm to 200 nm (i.e. infrared radiation to ultraviolet). Generally, the binaries utilized in such semiconductor devices are Indium Nitride (bandgap of 0.65 eV corresponding to approximately 1900 nm), Gallium Nitride (band gap of 3.4 eV corresponding to approximately 365 nm) and Aluminum Nitride (bandgap of 6.1 eV corresponding to approximately 200 nm). By varying the relative mole fractions of the binaries, ternary or quaternary alloys may be composed that can achieve radiation absorption at intermediate wavelengths to the stated values.","U.S. Pat. No. 6,326,654 to Ruden in (hereinafter Ruden '654; hereby incorporated by reference) entitled \u201cA Hybrid Ultraviolet Detector,\u201d discloses what appears to be a semiconductor material avalanche photodiode photodetector.

C., \u201cRecent advances in telecommunications avalanche photodiodes,\u201d ., Vol. 25, no. 1, p 109-121, January 2007, hereby incorporated by reference). However, in contrast to a traditional separate absorption multiplication (SAM) region system, a preferred embodiment polarization enhanced (PE) separated absorption multiplication regions avalanche photodetector (SAM-APD) employs an absorption region and an adjacent multiplication region composed of semiconductors having different magnitudes and\/or directions of polarization (both spontaneous and\/or piezoelectric) that result in the formation of beneficial polarization interface charge at their hetero-interface ().","The formation of this beneficial polarization interface charge at the hetero-interface for a PE-SAM APD provides the significant improvement in that it enables the sharp transition from a desirable large electric field in the multiplication region to a low or zero electric field on nearly the atomic scale, thereby eliminating the need for the conventionally employed charge layer, and the concomitant higher operating voltage penalty associated with it.","As shown in , a preferred embodiment polarization enhanced SAM-APD comprising a multiplication metallic contact region or layer , a semiconductor multiplication region or layer  having a total polarization P, a semiconductor absorption region or layer  having a total polarization of P, where P is less than or greater than P, and an absorption metallic contact region or layer . As used herein the term P in bold face represents the magnitude of the polarization vector.

Moreover, the metallic contact regions or layers  and  may vary in position, size, and location, depending upon the requirements of the application.","The preferred embodiment of  has the significant advantage that the interface charge formed between layer  and layer  enables a very sharp or abrupt transition on the atomic scale between the high electric field desired in the multiplication layer  to ensure large gain and the low electric field desired in the absorption layer  to efficiently collect photogenerated carriers (see bottom of ). In contrast to the conventional charge layer is commonly employed to achieve this transition resulting in a decrease in the electric field over a substantial length as shown in  TOP. These devices are commonly referred to as separate absorption, charge and multiplication avalanche photodiode (SACM-APD) A PE-SAM-APD of the current invention does not require a conventional charge layer of the prior so and therefore does not suffer from the significant voltage penalty associated with it.","As an example,  compares the calculated the electric field profiles for preferred embodiment of the current invention InGaN\/SiC PE-SAM APD that takes advantage of the formation of positive polarization charge at the interface between the InGaN absorption layer and the SiC multiplication layer and a similar structure that neglects the polarization charge and instead employs an n-type doped SiC charge layer of the conventional devices. In particular,  illustrates the potential benefits of the preferred embodiment positive polarization charge for an InGaN\/SiC SAM APD; The theoretically predicted polarization charge of \u03c3=1.5\u00d710cmat the hetero-interface is sufficient to maintain a low field in the InGaN absorption region and provide a rapid acceleration into the high field region required for impact ionization (see  line labeled \u201cwith polarization charge . . . \u201d), without any n-SiC charge layer. If one were to neglect this polarization charge, a 330 nm-thick n-type SiC charge layer with n=4\u00d710cmwould be needed to generate the positive charge that would replicate the field profiles in the absorption and multiplication layers of the device containing polarization charge at the hetero-interface. The requirement for a charge layer increases the voltage required to attain the same field profile from 150 V to 200 V (see  line labeled \u201cwithout polarization . . . \u201d). This sharp field transition may also provide the additional benefit of suppressing hole trapping at the III-Nitride\/SiC interface and improve hole injection from the absorption layer into the multiplication layer because of the more rapid transition from the low field to high field sections of the device.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0067","num":"0066"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 2"],"b":["5","5","2","3","2","3","1","5","1","4"],"sub":"net"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0067"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["1","1","2","2","2","1","2","1"],"sub":["2 ","1","br ","o","AB ","AB","br ","AB","AB ","br","0","AB"]},"If Fis less than \u03c3\/\u2208\u2208, there will be no field in the absorption region (F) that will aid transport to the multiplication region.  is an illustration of the energy band diagram for a PE-SAM APD under reverse bias and comprised of a multiplication region composed of semiconductor S having polarization P and an absorption region composed of a semiconductor S and having polarization P substantially greater than P.

Liu, et al. \u201cLow dark count rate and high single-photon detection efficiency avalanche photodiode in Geiger-mode operation,\u201d 19, 378-80, (2007), hereby incorporated by reference). However, the indirect band gap of SiC results in poor absorption and therefore reduced response near its band gap around 380 nm and no response in the visible. Therefore these devices are not suitable for light detection in the near ultraviolet and visible spectrum.","GaN APDs grown on bulk GaN substrates have been demonstrated that exhibit gains of \u02dc1000 and dark current densities of \u02dc2.6 \u03bcA\/cmnear avalanche breakdown (as described by J.

However, the size of these devices is still smaller than those of SiC APDs, 30-50 \u03bcm in diameter as compared to 250 \u03bcm, presumably due to the presence of defects. Furthermore, the noise in GaN APDs is likely to be significantly higher than that of SiC APDs due to the near unity ratio of the ionization coefficients in GaN (k\u02dc1), with these devices therefore requiring structures employing impact ionization engineering.","As shown schematically in , an exemplary preferred embodiment polarization enhanced (PE) Separated Absorption Multiplication (SAM) Avalanche PhotoDiode (APD) (a III-Nitride\/SiC PE-SAM APD) comprising a (0001) oriented (III-polar), wurtzite, III-Nitride semiconductor absorption layer A having large spontaneous polarization and a (0001) oriented SiC multiplication layer A having less polarization .  illustrates exemplary wurtzite structure for III-V and II-VI polar semiconductors.","The preferred embodiment provides the possibility of fabricating APDs having low dark current and high sensitivity comparable to that of SiC APDs by employing SiC for the multiplication layer A, while providing the capability of improving the quantum efficiency of the detector over a widely tunable spectral range from \u02dc200 to 1907 nm, by using a direct band gap of the III-Nitride alloy in the absorption layer A. These APDs would be operable in a single photon counting Geiger mode that makes them suitable as a replacement for the commonly employed photomultiplier tube photodetector in a large number of applications.","In addition to the advantages associated with polarization, this specific detector can benefit from the formation of a type II heterojunction between the III-Nitride and 4H SiC layers with both the conduction and valence band energies of the GaN below those of the SiC for certain III-Nitride alloy compositions.  is an illustration of the energy band diagram between GaN and 4H\u2014SiC layers. It should be noted that the specific embodiment of GaN\/4H\u2014SiC shown in  has a highly desirable band alignment. The conduction band offset is between \u22120.6 and \u22120.9 eV, while the valence band offset is between 0.7 and 1 eV. For further details, see Danielsson, E., C.-M. Zetterling, M. Ostling, K. Linthicum, D. B. Thomson, O.-H. Nam, and R. F. Davis, \u201cThe influence of band offsets on the IV characteristics for GaN\/SiC heterojunctions\u201d, Sol. State Electron., Vol. 46, pp. 827-35, (2002) (hereby incorporated by reference). This band alignment promotes hole injection and inhibits electron injection from GaN into SiC, in concert with the n-type (Al)(In)GaN absorption layers that will be employed to ensure single carrier injection of the photogenerated holes in the absorption layer into the SiC multiplication layer. This single carrier injection is optimum since the hole ionization coefficient of SiC is much greater than that of the electron. Moreover, pure hole injection may result in even lower noise than has previously been achieved with homojunction SiC APDs due to the expected lower k factor. While k factors as low as 0.02, comparable to that of the best Si APDs, have been projected for SiC APDs (as discussed further in Konstantinov, A. O., Q. Wahab, N. Nordell and U. Lindefelt, \u201cIonization rates and critical fields in 4H silicon carbide\u201d, Appl. Phys. Lett., Vol. 71, no. 1, pp. 90-92, 1997, hereby incorporated by reference), such results have not been achieved to date, probably due to the fact that in the homojunction SiC APDs much of the light is absorbed in the multiplication layer. This is equivalent to mixed injection, which results in higher excess noise, i.e., higher effective k factors. Since the III-Nitride\/SiC PE-SAM-APD will result in pure hole injection, lower excess noise, comparable to Si, is expected.","It should be noted that while the specific case of a III-Nitride\/SiC PE-SAM APD has this beneficial type II energy band alignment between the III-Nitride absorption region and the SiC multiplication region, in general a polarization enhanced SAM APD need not have this band alignment.","As shown in , this preferred embodiment device has the significant advantage that the interface charge enables a very sharp transition between the high electric field desired in the multiplication layer to ensure large gain and the low electric field desired in the absorption layer to efficiently collect photogenerated carriers. As a result, this structure does not require a charge layer, and the significant voltage penalty associated with a charge layer, commonly employed in a separate absorption, charge and multiplication avalanche photodiode (SACM-APD), to control the transition of the electric field from the multiplication to the absorption region (see  top).","Controlling the density of interface charge is critical to the performance of a III-Nitride\/SiC PE-SAM APD that contain defects at the hetero-interface between III-Nitride absorption layer and the SiC multiplication layer.  shows the calculated electric field distribution between the GaN absorption layer and the SiC multiplication layer as a function of reversed bias for a number of magnitudes of net interface charge density \u03c3. Letters A-E are provided to guide the reader to the appropriate companion curves for a given magnitude of \u03c3. As demonstrated in , at small reverse bias, the electric field in the device structure is confined entirely within the SiC layer. When the applied bias satisfies the condition F>\u03c3\/\u2208\u2208, punch-though occurs and F\u22600. It is clear from  that increasing interface charge, \u03c3increases the bias required to achieve punch-through. However the critical field in the SiC multiplication region (F), beyond which avalanche breakdown occurs, places an upper limit on the reverse bias that may be applied. As a result, substantially large interface charge makes it impossible to extend the electric field to the GaN region prior to avalanche breakdown within the SiC multiplication region.","This can result in reducing the quantum efficiency (QE) of the detector by limiting charge collection from the absorption to the multiplication layer to primarily a diffusion mechanism in the presence of a large density of defects at the hetero-interface; these defects introduce traps states at the interface that reduces the effective diffusion length of photo generated holes inhibiting their collection. Such defects can arise during the heteroepitaxial growth of III-Nitride films on SiC substrates due to lattice mismatch between these materials as well as the presence of surface contamination on the SiC substrate.","In contrast, insufficient charge will lead to excessive electric field in the absorption",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0096","num":"0095"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mo":"{","mrow":{"mo":"\u2003","mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":{"mrow":{"mn":"0","mo":["<","<"],"msub":{"mi":["F","GaN"]},"msubsup":{"mi":["F","GaN","br"]}}}},{"mtd":{"mrow":{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["F","SiC"]},"mo":"\u2248","msubsup":{"mi":["F","SiC","cr"]}},"mo":"\u2062","mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"3.3em","height":"3.3ex"}}}}}}]}}}}},"br":{},"sub":"SiC","sup":["cr","br"]},"This requirement defines the optimal magnitude of interface charge as:","It is important to note that F<<Fin heteroepitaxially grown GaN due to the presence of a large dislocation density at the hetero-interface that has been demonstrated to give rise to large leakage currents at low reverse bias in GaN p-n junction diodes.

For the case of a III-Nitride\/SiC PE-SAM-APD, the sign of the piezoelectric charge produced by compressive strain is opposite to that of the spontaneous polarization charge, thus reducing the positive charge at the hetero-interface, while, conversely, tensile strain increases the density of positive interface charge. While the mechanical strain expected in thin GaN films on SiC is expected to be compressive due to the smaller a lattice constant of 4H\u2014SiC (3.07 A) over GaN (3.18 A), in practice these films have a residual tensile strain. This result has been attributed to the larger thermal expansion coefficient of GaN (5.59\u00d710\/K) over that of SiC (\u22124.20\u00d710\/K) that causes tensile strain to build in the GaN film as it is cooled from the growth temperature to room temperature. This strain can be modified by the ICCL employed to provide a further method of controlling the interface charge density in these devices. For example, Perry et al. have demonstrated that GaN grown on SiC can have residual compressive strain if an AlN layer is employed in-between the GaN and SiC due to the mechanical compressive strain between the GaN and AlN layer that exceeds the tensile strain induced by cooling. For a further discussion, see Perry, W. G., et al, Journal Electron. Mater. 26, 224 (1997), hereby incorporated by reference. An (Al)GaN ICCL (as shown, for example, as  in ) could provide similar benefits for a GaN\/SiC PE SAM APD.

The net interface charge in this detector is calculated to be between \u02dc0.013-0.023 C\/m, using \u02dc0.034 C\/mas the spontaneous polarization in GaN and 0.011-0.021 C\/mfor 4H\u2014SiC, based upon the work of Bai et al. \u201cDetermination of the electric field in 4H\/3C\/4H\u2014SiC quantum wells due to spontaneous polarization in the 4H SiC matrix,\u201d ., Vol. 83, 3171-3173 (2003). The net interface charge may be substantial for the lower estimate of the spontaneous polarization for 4H\u2014SiC, therefore preventing punch-through prior to avalanche breakdown in this detector ().","One approach to controlling the interface charge in this device is to employ strain engineering, since GaN is a piezoelectric material. Compressive strain in the GaN absorption region can reduce the net interface charge by inducing a piezoelectric charge with opposite sign to that of the spontaneous polarization charge, while tensile strain will increase the net interface charge.  shows the calculated electric field profile for the GaN\/SiC SAM APD biased just short of avalanche breakdown and assuming the GaN layer is compressively strained (\u22120.24). This strain state induces a piezoelectric charge that reduces the net interface charge to \u02dc0.1 C\/m, thus allowing punch-through prior to avalanche breakdown. It is important to note that the presence of positive polarization charge at the hetero-interface is shown to result in an atomically sharp transition between the high electric field desired in the multiplication layer to ensure large gain and the low (but non-zero) electric field desired in the absorption layer to efficiently collect photogenerated carriers. This will substantially reduce the operating voltage of such a device over a similar structure employing a conventional charge layer. The electric field profile for a conventional SAM APD employing a charge layer is illustrated in  bottom for comparison.","An alternative approach is to introduce charge at the interface through dopants. This interface charge control layer (ICCL) can contain ionized acceptors or donors to provide negative or positive charge, respectively. To illustrate this concept,  shows the calculated electric field distribution in a GaN\/SiC APD employing a 2 nm Mg doped p-type ICCL (PICCL) at the hetero-interface that introduces a negative interface charge density of 0.11 C\/m. This charge is sufficient to allow punch-through of the electric field into the GaN absorption region, but also introduces a small barrier for hole transport into the SiC multiplication region (). It is important to note that the presence of positive polarization charge and ICCL at the hetero-interface is shown to result in an atomically sharp transition between the high electric field desired in the multiplication layer to ensure large gain and the low (but non-zero) electric field desired in the absorption layer to efficiently collect photogenerated carriers. This will substantially reduce the operating voltage of such a device over a similar structure employing a conventional charge layer. The electric field profile for a conventional SAM APD employing a charge layer as illustrated in  bottom for comparison.","A third approach is to introduce a layer having larger spontaneous polarization than the absorption or multiplication region, for example, an AlN ICCL. This charge control layer introduces a type I band alignment between AlN and SiC that creates a 2DEG in the SiC multiplication region, as shown in , with the effect of reducing the net interface charge density. However, the AlN ICCL also introduces a significant barrier for hole transport into the SiC multiplication region that may reduce carrier collection efficiency. This barrier may be reduced by employing an AlGaN ICCL having lower spontaneous polarization than AlN but still having sufficient band gap energy so as to maintain a type-I band alignment and a dipole at the hetero-interface. It is important to note that the presence of positive polarization charge and ICCL at the hetero-interface is shown to result in an atomically sharp transition between the high electric field desired in the multiplication layer to ensure large gain and the low (but non-zero) electric field desired in the absorption layer to efficiently collect photogenerated carriers. This will substantially reduce the operating voltage of such a device over a similar structure employing a conventional charge layer.

In this case, the formation of a negative polarization charge is desirable. An important example of this case would be a III-Nitride\/Si (111) APD, which would require a p-type, III-polar III-Nitride contact layer and an unintentionally doped III-polar absorption region for efficient electron collection.","As used herein (in the drawings, specification, abstract and claims), the term \u201clight\u201d means electromagnetic radiation, unless specifically noted to the contrary.
