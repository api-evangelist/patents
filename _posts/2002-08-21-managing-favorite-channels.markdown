{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The present invention is generally related to television systems, and, more particularly, is related to interactive television systems.","With recent advances in digital transmission technology, subscriber television systems are now capable of providing much more than the traditional analog broadcast video. In implementing enhanced programming, the home communication terminal device (\u201cHCT\u201d), otherwise known as the set-top box, has become an important computing device for accessing media content services (and media content within those services) and navigating a user through a maze of available services. In addition to supporting traditional analog broadcast video functionality, digital HCTs (or \u201cDHCTs\u201d) now also support an increasing number of two-way digital services such as video-on-demand and personal video recording.","Typically, a DHCT is connected to a cable or satellite system, or generally, a subscriber television system, and includes hardware and software necessary to provide the functionality of the digital television system at the user's site. Some of the software executed by a DHCT can be downloaded and\/or updated via the subscriber television system. Each DHCT also typically includes a processor, communication components, and memory, and is connected to a television set or other display device, such as a personal computer. While many conventional DHCTs are stand-alone devices that are externally connected to a television set, a DHCT and\/or its functionality may be integrated into a television set or personal computer or even an audio device such as a programmable radio, as will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art.","DHCTs are typically capable of providing users with a very large number and variety of media content choices. With the large array of choices, subscribers want to be able to quickly and efficiently access their favorite channels. Unfortunately, existing mechanisms for interacting with favorite channels are often cumbersome to access. Thus, a heretofore unaddressed need exists in the industry to address the aforementioned and\/or other deficiencies and\/or inadequacies.","The preferred embodiments of the invention now will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings. The preferred embodiments of the invention will herein be described in the context of a subscriber television system, with the understanding that other communication systems can similarly benefit, including home entertainment systems, among others. In particular, the preferred embodiments of the invention include systems and methods for commencing a display favorites mode that provides for the display of favorite channels and the ability to scroll among favorite channels. The display favorites mode is recognized by systems of the preferred embodiments as a request to enable certain functionality, such as causing favorites symbols to appear in proximity to favorite channels displayed in an interactive program guide, and\/or enabling forward and reverse scrolling among favorite channels displayed in an interactive program guide. The systems and methods of the preferred embodiments also include functionality for adding and deleting favorite channels to or from one or more favorite channel lists that are transparent to the user (i.e., the list is not displayed to the user during the add or delete operations).","Since the preferred embodiments of the invention are described in the context of a subscriber television system, a subscriber television system is described, followed by descriptions of headend and DHCT components of the system. Following the description of these components, a couple of example remote control devices are described, including a detailed schematic of the internal processing of the remote control devices. Implementations of the favorite channels can occur through interactive program guide (IPG) screens and real-time (or time-shifted) presentation screens, and thus the preferred embodiments will be described in the context of these two implementations. Further, examples of configuring favorite channel categories will be described. Finally, some example methods will be described for displaying favorite channels among one or more categories, adding favorite channels, and deleting favorite channels, in accordance with several embodiments of the invention.","The preferred embodiments of the invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein; rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those having ordinary skill in the art. Furthermore, all \u201cexamples\u201d given herein are intended to be non-limiting, and are included as examples among many others contemplated and within the scope of the preferred embodiments of the invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["10","10","11","16","18","10","10"]},"A DHCT  is typically situated at the residence or place of business of a user and may be a stand-alone unit or integrated into another device such as, for example, a television set or a personal computer or other display devices, or an audio device. The DHCT  receives signals (video, audio and\/or other data) from the headend  through the network  and provides any reverse information to the headend  through the network . In some analog embodiments, a home communication terminal (HCT), not DHCT, is utilized. Also, functionality discussed herein may reside in personal computers, television sets, etc.","The headend  receives, among other data and\/or media content, program guide data from a program guide provider (not shown). The program guide data comprises information about services that may be provided via the DHCT . The headend  edits the program guide data and transmits the edited program guide data to the DHCT  via the network . The headend  may include one or more server devices (not shown) for providing video, audio, and\/or data to media client devices such as the DHCT . The headend  and the DHCT  cooperate to provide a user with television services via the television set (not shown). The television services may include, for example, broadcast television services, cable television services, premium television services, video-on-demand (VOD) services, and\/or pay-per-view (PPV) services, among others.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["11","11","11","11","18","11"]},"A digital network control system (DNCS)  provides management, monitoring, and control of network elements and of the broadcast services provided to users. A content provider such as a program guide provider transmits data for television program guides through a network interface  to the DNCS  of the headend , preferably using a file transfer protocol (FTP). The DNCS  includes functionality that defines relationships between channel names listed in the program guide data received from the program guide provider and the numbered channels that are available via the DHCT . This functionality is used by the DNCS  to edit the program guide data to include channel numbers that correspond to the listed channel names. After the program guide data is edited by the DNCS , it is transmitted to the DHCT  preferably using a broadcast file system (BFS) server . The BFS server  and its counterpart, a BFS client module  (), are part of a file broadcasting system. The BFS server  repeatedly sends data through a network interface  to the DHCT  via a quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) modem  over a period of time in a cyclical manner so that the DHCT  may access the data as needed.","A quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) modem  is responsible for transporting out-of-band IP (internet protocol) datagram traffic between the distribution headend  and a DHCT . Data transmitted or received by the QPSK modem  may be routed by a headend router . The headend router  may be used to deliver upstream data to various server applications (not shown).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["16","11","341","16","16","363","11","16","342","11","18","11","18"]},"The DHCT  preferably includes one or more processors, such as processor  (e.g., a central processing unit or digital signal processor), for controlling operations of the DHCT , an output system  for driving the television set display, and at least one tuner system  for tuning into a particular television channel or frequency to display media content and for sending and receiving various types of data or media content to and from the headend . The DHCT  may include, in other embodiments, multiple tuners for receiving downloaded (or transmitted) media content. The tuner system  enables the DHCT  to tune to downstream media and data transmissions, thereby allowing a user to receive digital and\/or analog media content delivered in the downstream transmission via the subscriber television system. The tuner system  includes, in one implementation, an out-of-band tuner for bi-directional QPSK data communication and one or more QAM tuners (in band) for receiving television signals. Additionally, a receiver  receives externally generated information, such as user inputs or commands from an input device, such as remote control device , or other devices.","The DHCT  processes analog and\/or digital transmission signals for storage in a storage device such as an optical or hard disk drive (not shown), and\/or for display to the television set . The DHCT  preferably includes a signal processing system  and a media engine . The components of the signal processing system  are capable of QAM demodulation, forward error correction, and demultiplexing of MPEG-2 transport streams, and parsing of elementary streams and packetized elementary streams. Additional components, not shown, include an analog decoder and compression engine for processing an analog transmission signal and, in one implementation, converting it to compressed audio and video streams that are produced in accordance with the syntax and semantics of a designated audio and video coding method, such as specified by the MPEG-2 audio and MPEG-2 video ISO (International Organization for Standardization or ISO) standard.","The signal processing system  outputs packetized compressed streams and presents them as input for storage in the storage device, or in other implementations, as input to the media engine  for decompression by a video decompression engine (not shown) and an audio decompression engine (not shown) for display on the TV set . One having ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the signal processing system  will preferably include other components not shown, including memory, decryptors, samplers, digitizers (e.g., analog-to-digital converters), and multiplexers, among other components. Further, it will be understood that one or more of the components listed above will interface with the processor  and\/or system memory  (and\/or dedicated memory for a particular component) to facilitate data transfer and\/or processing of the video and\/or audio signal for display and\/or storage.","One or more programmed software applications are executed by utilizing the computing resources in the DHCT . Note that an application typically includes a client part and a server counterpart that cooperate to provide the complete functionality of the application. The applications may be resident in FLASH memory  or downloaded (or uploaded) into DRAM . Applications stored in FLASH memory  or DRAM  are executed by the processor  under the auspices of the operating system . Data required as input by an application is stored in DRAM  or FLASH memory  and read by the processor  as need be during the course of application execution. Input data may be data stored in DRAM  by a secondary application or other source, either internal or external to the DHCT , or possibly anticipated by the application and thus created with the application at the time it was generated as a software application, in which case it is preferably stored in FLASH memory . Data generated by an application is stored in DRAM  by the processor  during the course of application execution. DRAM  also includes application memory  that various applications may use for storing and\/or retrieving data.","An application referred to as a navigator  is also resident in FLASH memory  for providing a navigation framework for services provided by the DHCT . The navigator  registers for and in some cases reserves certain user inputs related to navigational keys such as channel increment\/decrement, last channel, favorite channel, etc. For example, the navigator  preferably includes a data structure (i.e., structured data such as a database or data structure) comprising one or more lists of favorite channels (a favorites list or favorite channel list) among one or more favorite channel categories (favorites categories). This list can be accessed, added to, and deleted from in a manner that is transparent to the user (the favorite channel list is not displayed) according to several mechanisms described below. In the preferred embodiments of the invention, additions to and deletions from the favorite channel list, in addition to displays of favorites, will preferably be implemented while the user is viewing one or more presentation screens, such as an IPG screen or a media content instance presentation screen (e.g., a display screen presented while watching a TV episode or live broadcast), thus enabling continued viewing of these screens while transparently accessing and\/or editing favorite channel lists. The navigator  also provides users with television related menu options that correspond to DHCT functions such as, for example, blocking a channel or a group of channels from being displayed in a channel menu presented on a screen display.","The FLASH memory  also contains a platform library . The platform library  is a collection of utilities useful to applications, such as a timer manager, a compression manager, a configuration manager, a hyper text markup language (HTML) parser, a database manager, a widget toolkit, a string manager, and other utilities (not shown). These utilities are accessed by applications via application programming interfaces (APIs) as necessary so that each application does not have to contain these utilities. Two components of the platform library  that are shown in  are a window manager  and a service application manager (SAM) client .","The window manager  includes a mechanism for implementing the sharing of the screen regions and user input. The window manager  on the DHCT  is responsible for, as directed by one or more applications, implementing the creation, display, and de-allocation of the limited DHCT  screen resources. It allows multiple applications to share the screen by assigning ownership of screen regions, or windows. The window manager  communicates with the resource manager  to coordinate available resources (such as display memory) among different resource consuming processes. Such processes may be directly or indirectly invoked by one or more applications.","The SAM client  is a client component of a client-server pair of components, with the server component (not shown) being located on the headend , preferably in the DNCS  (). A SAM database  (i.e., structured data such as a database or data structure) in DRAM  includes a data structure of services and a data structure of channels that are created and updated by the headend . Herein, database will refer to a database, structured data or other data structures as is well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Applications can also be downloaded into DRAM  at the request of the SAM client , typically in response to a request by the user or in response to a message from the headend . In the example DHCT  illustrated in , DRAM  includes a media-on-demand (MOD) application , an e-mail application , and a web browser application . Example applications resident in FLASH memory  include, by way of non-limiting example, an IPG application , a WatchTV application , a BFS application , and a Pay Per View (PPV) application . It should be clear to one with ordinary skill in the art that these applications are not limiting and merely serve as examples for embodiments of the invention. Furthermore, one or more DRAM based applications may be resident, as an alternative embodiment, in FLASH memory . These applications, and others provided by the subscriber television system operator, are top-level software entities on the network for providing services to the user.","An executable program or algorithm corresponding to an operating system (OS) component, or to a client platform component, or to an application, or to respective parts thereof, can reside in and execute out of DRAM  and\/or FLASH memory . Likewise, data input into or output from any executable program can reside in DRAM  or FLASH memory . Furthermore, an executable program or algorithm corresponding to an operating system component, or to a client platform component, or to an application, or to respective parts thereof, can reside in FLASH memory , or in a local storage device externally connected to or integrated into the DHCT  and be transferred into DRAM  for execution. Likewise, data input for an executable program can reside in FLASH memory  or a storage device and be transferred into DRAM  for use by an executable program or algorithm. In addition, data output by an executable program can be written into DRAM  by an executable program or algorithm and be transferred into FLASH memory  or into a storage device. In other embodiments, the executable code is not transferred, but instead, functionality is effected by other mechanisms.","The DHCT  can also include one or more wireless or wired interfaces, also called communication ports , for receiving and\/or transmitting data to other devices. For instance, the DHCT  may feature USB (Universal Serial Bus), Ethernet (for connection to a computer), IEEE-1394 (for connection to media content devices in an entertainment center), serial, and\/or parallel ports. The user inputs may be, for example, provided by an input device including a computer or transmitter with buttons or keys located either on the exterior of the terminal or by a hand-held remote control device  or keyboard that includes user-actuated buttons, or even aural input (e.g., voice activated), among others.","The IPG application  displays a program guide to the user and populates the guide with information about television services. The IPG application  utilizes the window manager  and other graphics utilities provided by the operating system  to render an IPG on the television set . The window manager  is a component that, in one embodiment, is part of the platform , but in other embodiments may be part of the operating system . The window manager  contains functionality for allocating screen areas and managing screen use among multiple applications. The operating system  provides primitives to the IPG application  in order to help render images on the television set . As a window is generated on a display device, the IPG application  registers with the window manager  for particular user input commands that may be required for selecting options provided by a newly-created window.","An example remote control device  to provide input to the DHCT  () is illustrated in . The example remote control device  includes a select button  for making selections on a screen display, navigation buttons  for navigating within a particular screen display or during a display favorites mode, a channel up button  for scrolling among favorite channels in ascending channel number order, and a channel down button  to scroll among favorite channels in descending channel number order, in accordance with one embodiment of the invention. The example remote control device  also includes alphanumeric buttons  for entering display channel numbers, or favorite channel category numbers, or inputting letters for keyword searches or special configuration screens, among other functions. A favorites button  enables a user to display favorite channels in an IPG screen or to display media content instance presentation screens associated with a favorites channel, and is used in the addition or deletion of favorite channels from a favorite channel list while being presented with the IPG screen or a media content instance, in accordance with one embodiment of the invention. \u201cA\u201d , \u201cB\u201d , and \u201cC\u201d  buttons can correspond to certain application-defined functions that have a corresponding \u201cA\u201d, \u201cB\u201d, or \u201cC\u201d symbol displayed in a graphic user interface (GUI) presented on a display device. The guide button  may be used to access a television program guide such as, for example, an IPG screen. Many alternative methods of providing user input may be used including a remote control device with different buttons and\/or button layouts, a keyboard device, a voice activated device, etc. The embodiments of the invention described herein are not limited by the type of device used to provide user input.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["580","480","580","587","583","586","591","594","592","480","580","580"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 4","FIG. 5"],"b":["480","580","480","480","480","623","627","628","480","627","628","627","628","623","480","626","612","612"]},"The remote control device  also includes a power source , which is typically a replaceable battery, and a bypass capacitor . The power source  and the bypass capacitor  are grounded at location  and communicate via connection  with the processor . The processor  is also connected via connection  to an indicator light emitting diode (LED) . The indicator LED  indicates when an IR signal is being transmitted and also functions as a low battery indicator.","The processor  is also connected via connection  to electrically erasable programmable read only memory (EEPROM) . EEPROM  includes the remote control device functions in a non-volatile memory arrangement so that when the battery in the remote control device  is replaced, the remote control device  does not lose its memory. The processor  communicates via connection  with memory . Memory  is typically a random access memory (RAM) that includes a keypad IR module . When the processor  detects a keypress from the keypad matrix , the processor  accesses memory  and the keypad IR module  to determine which IR code corresponds to the detected keypress. Once the processor  determines the correct IR code based on the detected keypress, the processor  communicates with an IR transmitter  via connection  to emit an appropriate IR signal that includes the appropriate key code to an IR receiver.","With reference to , and continued reference to , the remote control device  transmits an IR signal, which is received in the DHCT  by the receiver . Although illustrated as being transmitted to the DHCT , the IR signal transmitted by the remote control device  can be received by any communication box such as the DHCT , directly by the television set , or other peripheral devices. The receiver  demodulates the received IR signal, and preferably stores it in a temporary memory, preferably a first-in-first-out (FIFO) memory residing in the receiver , and then notifies the processor . The notification may be effected by an interrupt generated directly or indirectly by the receiver  or by the processor  polling the status of registers in the receiver  on a regular or periodic basis.","The driver  that is preferably part of the operating system  executes on the processor  to attend keypresses and releases from the remote control device , and fulfills the aforementioned functionality in communication with the receiver . A sequence of one or more demodulated IR signals corresponding to keypresses and\/or releases are transferred to memory . Each keypress or release is converted by the operating system  in cooperation with the driver  to a keypress indication that the modules of the operating system , including the window manager  and other applications, understand. In an alternate embodiment, the receiver  performs the conversion to keypress indications prior to storing in its temporary FIFO memory. After the IR code has been stored (and converted to a keypress indication), the window manager  causes the processor  to generate an interrupt, which informs the navigator  that an IR keypress signal has been received as explained above. The navigator  then retrieves the register value from memory  and performs the required action corresponding to the received IR keypress signal. Furthermore, because an IR protocol typically implements transmission and reception of continuous IR codes spaced at certain time intervals, for example 37 milliseconds apart, the processor  has the capability to determine keypresses signals and key releases as well as continuous down keypresses and delays in successive keypress signals. For example, as is described below, a user will preferably select a favorite channel category (for example, by number) after selecting the desired favorite channel if more than one category exists. Failure to receive the category number (via a keypress) after a defined period (e.g., 2 seconds) may prompt a screen asking the user to help the navigator  () discern which category the user desires (or in other embodiments, a default category will be provided).","So as long as the same key is pressed, the key signal is passing the same key word (or IR code) to the navigator  which in turn can make sense of the desired functionality. A dual keypress can be interpreted as a one key word. The navigator , as indicated above, can detect a sustained keypress. For example, to add (or delete) a favorite channel, the user can press the favorites button  for a sustained duration (e.g., 3 seconds) when highlighting a particular display channel. The navigator  recognizes the associated keypress indication as an instruction to provide functionality for adding a favorite channel to a favorite channel list. In contrast, when the favorites button  is pressed momentarily (i.e., for less than a sustained duration, e.g. approximately 1 second), the navigator  recognizes the associated keypress indication as a request to commence a display favorites mode, and thus the display will advance to the next higher numbered display channel that is a favorite channel. Thus, one trigger for discerning the required functionality for pressing the same button (e.g., the favorites button ) is the timing of the keypress release, through the cooperation of the navigator  with timing mechanisms of the DHCT .","With reference to , and as with other user interface screen display examples discussed below, the processor  executes program instructions of the active application that cause it to employ the services of the window manager  to create a graphics user interface (GUI) screen display via display data that is formatted for the television set . The processor  stores the display data or parts thereof in DRAM  (as necessary) and transfers the display data to a display output system such as output system  wherein display data is converted to respective television signals and transmitted to the television set . Of course, the scope of the preferred embodiments of the present invention also includes any other method of causing the described user interface screen displays to appear to the user.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 3","FIG. 4","FIG. 3"],"b":["700","700","394","491","394","359","394","16"]},"The top left portion of the IPG screen  includes a detailed focus area  that includes detailed information for a currently highlighted media content instance listing or display channel. Video corresponding to the television service to which the DHCT  () is currently tuned (for which audio may also be playing, and which preferably corresponds to a television presentation occupying the full screen before the user is presented with the IPG screen ) is displayed in a video area . Immediately below the video area  is an information banner  for displaying the television display channel number corresponding to the service to which the DHCT  is currently tuned (e.g., display channel 5), the current day and date (e.g., Thursday, January 17), and the current time (e.g., 8:00 p.m.).","An IPG grid  includes a listing display area , a time area , and a display channel area . The listing display area  contains listings of media content instances that correspond to respective television services identified in the display channel area  that are scheduled to be available during the time periods listed in the time area . The listings, such as the Johnny Bravo listing , includes an identifier such as the title of the media content instance (e.g., Johnny Bravo) it represents, and can include other identifiers like parental control icons or differences in shading and\/or color to represent different functionality. The display channel area  includes, in one implementation, a vertical list of television services organized sequentially from top to bottom by increasing television display channel number (except for the highest numbered television service which is typically listed immediately above the lowest numbered television service).","In this non-limiting example, the left-most time column (i.e., under the 8:00 time slot) in the listing display area  includes the title of a media content instance listing (the highlighted Johnny Bravo listing ), which is scheduled to be provided via the Cartoon Network (i.e., Toonz on display channel number 201). The bottom area  of the IPG screen  indicates the selected day for which media content instance listing data is being displayed as well as information about the current functions of the \u201cA\u201d, \u201cB\u201d, and \u201cC\u201d buttons (-, ) on the remote control device  ().","In an alternative embodiment, the IPG screen  may have fewer, additional, and\/or different components and may have a different layout. For example, the IPG screen  might not include one or more of a detailed focus area , a video area , an information banner , and\/or a bottom area . The double arrow icons  indicate that a given media content instance corresponding to that listing has a duration that expands beyond the time period shown in the current IPG display screen, suggesting to the user that the balance of the listing can be viewed in another IPG display screen by selecting the right (in this example) or left navigation arrow buttons  on the remote control device  (), depending on the direction of the double arrow icon . Note that the functions of highlighting, scrolling, and other navigation functions for interacting with a particular screen involve selecting buttons on the remote control device  that often correspond to user-suggestive symbols displayed on the screen. It will be understood that terminology that describes making selections on a particular screen will be understood to include making the corresponding selections using a remote control device . Other input devices contemplated to be within the scope of the preferred embodiments of the invention include a touch screen, a mouse, and an IR keyboard, among others. For the sake of simplicity in discussion, the IPG screens will be illustrated in the following figures with an IPG grid and display channel area only (e.g., the IPG grid  and the display channel area ).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 8","FIG. 7","FIG. 7","FIG. 8"],"b":["800","341","800","865","880","16","341","480","16","16","341","341","700","720","492","480","16","16","355"]},"In , it was assumed the user was highlighting the Johnny Bravo listing  on the TOONZ channel, Ch. 201. Assume the following favorite channels were previously selected, and only one category (a default category) of favorite channels (as explained below) is configured: TBS on Ch. 300, ABC on Ch. 7, and Comedy Central on Ch. 304. Responsive to selecting (using an un-sustained keypress) the favorites button , the display favorites mode commences, and the TBS channel 300 is displayed (e.g., highlighted), since the next (in advancing chronological channel number order) favorite channel number after the highlighted listing  (associated with channel number 201) () is TBS on channel 300. Also, a favorites (FAV) symbol  (herein, FAV symbol), signifying that the highlighted favorite channel is indeed a favorite channel, is included in the highlighted area of the display channel area  in proximity to the identity of the favorite channel (e.g., TBS 300). Although shown with a FAV symbol  to signify a favorite channel, it will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art that other symbols can be used, or other feedback mechanisms (e.g., background color changes, etc.). When the user seeks to exit from the display favorites mode, he or she selects the favorites button  momentarily (un-sustained), and the FAV symbol  disappears and the user is left on display channel 300 in the IPG screen. In other embodiments, the user can be returned to the display channel number from which he or she commenced the display favorites mode (e.g., display channel 201).","A similar mechanism for displaying the current favorite channels can be employed while watching a broadcast (or on-demand) presentation, as illustrated in .  is a screen diagram of an example presentation screen  of Johnny Bravo before pressing the favorites button  (). As shown in , the user selects the favorites button  momentarily (un-sustained) on the remote control device , and in response, the display favorites mode commences, and a presentation screen  of a media content instance (e.g., Deer Hunter) on TBS is displayed along with a FAV symbol  in the channel banner  to signify that this is a favorite channel. Note that TBS (display channel 300) is the next highest ordered display channel after Toonz (Channel 201) that is a favorite channel. Further examples described below will use the IPG screen implementation, with the understanding that the preferred embodiments can be employed similarly when the user is in a presentation screen.

Thus, the additions to (and deletions from) a favorite channel list is transparent to the user. Several embodiments of the preferred embodiments of the invention are described below in association with . Although described in association with IPG screens, as described above, similar mechanisms are employed for media content instance presentation screens.  is a composite diagram that is used to illustrate one embodiment for adding favorite channels. This embodiment preferably provides the user with a pop-up window to list the current favorite channel categories that are available (e.g., the default category and configured categories). This implementation can arise, for example, where the user does not know, or cannot remember, the favorite channel categories that are available. Based on the prior examples, two categories of favorite channels now exist after the favorite category configurations have occurred: the favorite channel category  (default favorite channel category) and favorite channel category  (Dabney's cartoon favorites).

In one implementation, in response to the user selecting the favorites button , an example pop-up window  is presented, preferably overlaid on an IPG screen  that is grayed out or otherwise modified to provide a visual distinction between the example pop-up window  and the IPG screen . The example pop-up window  notes an ambiguity in determining the intended favorite channel category that the user has selected, and seeks resolution by presenting the two current favorite channel categories in an options list  for the user to choose from. If there were no conflicts (e.g., only one category exists), the pop-up window  would preferably not be displayed, and the default category favorite channels would be displayed.","As shown in the options list  of the example pop-up window , one option is Dabney's cartoon favorites (Dabney's favorite channel category ). Assume the user seeks to add favorite channels, preferably cartoon channels, to his cartoon favorites channel category (Dabney's cartoon favorite). Thus, upon highlighting and selecting the Dabney's favorite channel category  selection from the options list  of the example pop-up window , the user is presented with an example IPG screen similar to that shown in , but without a FAV symbol. Since no favorites are currently selected, the screen preferably remains at the same display channel as it was from which the display favorites mode was launched. To add the Disney channel 316 to the list of favorite channels in Dabney's cartoon favorites, the user preferably selects the favorites button  for a sustained duration. In response, the DABFAV symbol  preferably appears in the display channel area  of the IPG screen  in proximity to the selected Disney channel 316, thus providing feedback to the user that the selected channel is now added to Dabney's cartoon favorites. To add additional favorite channels while in the display favorites mode, the user preferably scrolls to non-favorite channels using the navigation arrow keys  (), and then presses the favorites button  for a sustained duration for the highlighted selection.","To delete a selection from the favorite channel list under a selected favorites category, the user preferably scrolls to the targeted favorite channel (via using the channel up button  or channel down button , ), and then presses the favorites button  for a sustained duration. In response, the targeted favorite channel is removed from the favorite channel list for that particular category (i.e., the category selected to display favorite channels), and the symbol for the deleted favorite selection disappears (not shown).","Note that implementations using the remote control device  () would operate similarly to that described in association with , with differences due to the added functionality included in the display favorites button  () and the add\/delete favorite button .
