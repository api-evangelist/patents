As would be appreciated by a person having ordinary skill in the art, there are many kinds of mobile wireless communication devices, including, for example, smart phones, tablets, laptops, mobile phones, personal digital assistants, and many others. These mobile wireless communication devices are capable of sending and receiving wireless radio frequency signals over one or more wireless communication networks, such as cellular (e.g., 2G, 2.5G, 3G, 4G, LTE, LTE advanced, etc.) networks, local-area (e.g., Wi-Fi) networks, or other wireless communication networks.","As the computing power of mobile end-user devices (e.g., smart phones, tablets, etc.) has increased, mobile devices have become capable of sending and receiving increasing amounts of data. In addition to e-mail and text messages, many of today's mobile devices can support a variety of applications that send large quantities of information to and from end users. For example, in addition to sending e-mail and text messages, many of today's mobile devices can deliver news, weather, sports, maps, social networking information, music, videos, high-resolution photographs, documents, presentations, and other kinds of information. Furthermore, users can take advantage of applications that provide transactional services, e.g., shopping for content (books, music, videos, etc.) or applications.","The ability of mobile devices to send and receive such a wide variety and large quantity of data has stressed wireless access network bandwidth capabilities. As a result, network operators are either eliminating service plans with unlimited data usage, or they are increasing the price of unlimited service plans so that such plans are not attractive to most consumers. Consequently, many users of mobile end-user devices subscribe to service plans that include only a limited amount of data per fixed time period (e.g., per month). Because today's mobile end-user devices can access (e.g., send or receive) large amounts of information, there is a potential for a user of a mobile device to exceed his or her data plan allowance without realizing it. It is well known that such \u201coverages\u201d in data usage can be very expensive because the billing rate for data usage exceeding the contracted service plan amount is often significantly higher than the billing rate under the service plan. At the same time subscribers face an increasing potential for overage conditions and thus may be reticent to take advantage of wireless access network data services, network operators face declining revenues and are motivated to increase data adoption by their subscribers.","Today, users of mobile devices (e.g., cellular phones, smart phones, etc.) subscribe to a service plan in order to take advantage of various services including voice, messaging, and data services offered by wireless service providers (e.g., carriers). This application discloses novel approaches that allow users to purchase services on an as-needed, a la carte basis, thus enabling users to have customized service plans and service plan combinations. This application also discloses novel ways to present information associated with voice, messaging, and data service plans through user interfaces of mobile devices.","The increased computing power of mobile devices has led to an explosion in the number of applications that are available for mobile devices. Hundreds of thousands of applications are available for Android-based devices and for Apple-based devices, and the number of available applications continues to grow at a rapid pace. Many of these applications are available for subscribers to download or purchase through an electronic \u201capp store\u201d or \u201cmarketplace.\u201d A subscriber may find applications of interest to him or her by typing in a search word or phrase in a field in a search field offered by the app store or marketplace, or he or she may find an application by browsing a list offered by the app store or marketplace (e.g., popular applications). Often, however, subscriber visits to the app store are \u201chit and miss\u201d unless a subscriber happens to know the name of a desired application or happens to type in a search word or phrase that results in the application being presented.","For application developers, getting subscribers to see, download, purchase, or use their applications is critical to the application developers' success because their revenues depend on purchases, downloads, and\/or use of their applications. Yet because of the sheer number of applications available through marketplaces and app stores, and because of how subscribers may behave when browsing through the marketplace or app store, application developers have little control over whether a subscriber even finds their applications. This application discloses methods to improve the presentation and discovery of services, service plans, applications and content for users of mobile wireless communication devices.","Disclosed herein are methods, systems, and apparatuses to enable subscribers of mobile wireless communication devices to view, research, select and customize service plans for one or more mobile wireless communication devices. Also disclosed herein are methods, systems, and apparatuses that allow subscribers to create and manage a group of two or more devices (herein referred to as a device group) without service provider involvement. After a subscriber has established a master service account, the subscriber can create a device group by associating additional mobile wireless communication devices with the established master service account that is already associated with a master mobile wireless communication device.

As would be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art, mobile wireless communication devices include many types of computing devices. As used herein, the term device, mobile device, mobile communication device, mobile wireless communication device, wireless device, end-user device, wireless end-user device, and other equivalent terms are used interchangeably to refer to computing devices having one or more wireless communication capabilities to interoperate with one or more wireless networks. In some embodiments, the devices are mobile. In some embodiments, the devices include wired and wireless communication capabilities. In some embodiments, the devices are used to connect to one or more different wireless networks. In some embodiments, the devices include user interfaces through which information can be displayed and inputs received. In some embodiments, the devices include separate displays and input mechanisms. There are many other examples of devices having wireless communication capabilities and the representative embodiments disclosed herein are not intended to be limiting.","To date, service providers have provided a limited variety of different service plans and service plan bundles (multiple service plan elements bundled together) to which a user of the mobile wireless communication device may subscribe. With the increasing proliferation of a broad spectrum of mobile wireless communication devices having diverse communication and processing capabilities, it may be desirable to provide methods for an increased array of service plans and service plan bundles that may be easily accessed, reviewed, and selected by the subscriber of the mobile wireless communication device. In addition, customizable service plan bundles may be provided that permit the subscriber to select among a range of constituent service plan elements, thereby building the subscriber's own custom service plan bundle that best fits his or her particular communication service requirements. Service plan bundles may be customized based on numerous different criteria, including, but not limited to, service type (e.g., voice, messaging, data), applicable time period, geographic location, access network type, and application\/service specific content. In addition, promotional service plans, subsidized service plans, and special service plan bundles that include multiple constituent service plan elements may be offered to the subscriber to increase the subscriber's exposure to featured service plans and service plan bundles. Through an easily navigable interface, e.g., using a flexible user interface of the mobile wireless communication device itself, through access to a website through a web browser, or through an application connected to an application portal, the subscriber may learn about, test out and subscribe to one or more service plans and\/or service plan bundles that include a combination of service plan elements best suited for the subscriber's own needs. In some embodiments, a user or administrator also reviews, subscribes, shares, assigns or otherwise manages service plans and service plan bundles for devices in a device group. In some embodiments, the user or administrator manages service plans and service plan bundles for devices in a device group through an interface of one of the devices, or through a separate system that can interface with a service management system in the wireless network.","A mobile wireless communication device may need to be associated with a service account in order to allow a user or owner of the mobile wireless communication device (herein referred to as a subscriber) to use the mobile wireless communication device to communicate over a particular wireless communication network in a manner that is meaningful to the subscriber (e.g., to access content or a service offered by a service provider). Moreover, the mobile wireless communication device may need to be associated with one or more service plans that allow it to access services offered by a service provider. A service plan may, in general, allow for a quantity of communication that may be permitted during a time period of communication (e.g., 100 MB of data per month, 24 hours of network access, 100 minutes of phone calls, etc.). Some examples of services that may be offered by a service provider include the non-mutually-exclusive categories of voice services (e.g., phone calls, etc.), messaging services (e.g., text messages, multimedia messages, etc.), data services (e.g., Internet access, etc.), and hybrid services (e.g., voice over IP (VOIP), video chat, etc.). A service provider may be an operator of a wireless communication network, or may be another entity, such as a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO), a retail partner, a mobile wireless communication device original equipment manufacturer (OEM), a mobile wireless communication device operating system (OS) provider or a third-party service partner. There are many other examples of services, service plans, and service providers, and the examples provided herein are not intended to be limiting.","It may also be desirable to associate more than one mobile wireless communication device with a particular service account. There are many potential benefits of associating multiple wireless communication devices to a particular service account, including, for example, simplifying billing for the service provider and for the subscriber, and potentially reducing service costs for subscribers, e.g., by sharing the particular service account among multiple wireless communication devices. For example, a husband and wife may want to establish a single service account for both of their smart phones. As another example, a parent may want to establish a single service account for the several mobile phones used by family members. As another example, an employer may want to establish a single service account for multiple smart phones used by one or more of its employees. As another example, a person may want to establish a single service plan for multiple mobile wireless communication devices that the person uses, such as, for example, one or more of a smart phone, a tablet, a laptop, and an intermediate networking device that forwards traffic between a local area network and a wireless cellular network. There are many other examples of situations in which it might be desirable to associate multiple mobile wireless communication devices to a single service account (hereinafter referred to as a master service account).","In addition to associating multiple mobile wireless communication devices with a master service account, it may be desirable to share a service plan that is associated with the master service account among the multiple wireless communication devices associated with the master service account. For example, a parent might want to purchase a single service plan that is shared among all members of the family, or an employer might want to purchase a single service plan that is shared among multiple employees.","Today, subscribers who wish to share a service plan among multiple mobile wireless communication devices can only do so with several limitations. For example, creating a master service account and sharing a service plan among multiple wireless communication devices can require direct involvement of a service provider, e.g., a service provider customer representative. The service provider associates each of the mobile wireless communication devices with a master service account and with a service plan, and the associated mobile wireless communication devices then share the service plan. Often, subscribers cannot add or delete mobile wireless communication devices from the master service account without assistance from the service provider. In order to make changes to the master account, subscribers may need to call the service provider or may be required to log in to a web portal (e.g., by logging into a website), e.g., through a separate computing system. Another drawback is that although all of the mobile wireless communication devices associated with a master service account share a service plan, there are no controls to prevent a particular mobile wireless communication device from \u201chogging\u201d allocations provided by the service plan. Another drawback is that although some service providers today allow sharing of voice minutes or text message allocations, they do not allow or limit sharing of a data plan. Yet another drawback is that today's shared service plans do not allow subscribers to associate different kinds of mobile wireless communication devices (e.g., a tablet and a smart phone) with a master service account. As a result of these drawbacks, the utility of shared service plans available today is limited.","As used herein, service activity is used to refer to any service usage or traffic usage that can be associated with, for example, an application; a network communication end point, such as an address, uniform resource locator (URL) or other identifier with which the device is communicating; a traffic content type; a transaction where content or other material, information or goods are transacted, purchased, reserved, ordered or exchanged; a download, upload or file transfer; email, text, short messaging service (SMS), IP multimedia system (IMS), or other messaging activity or usage; VOIP services; video services; a device usage event that generates a billing event; service usage associated with a bill by account activity (also referred to as billing by account) as described herein; device location; device service usage patterns, device user interface (UI) discovery patterns, content usage patterns or other characterizations of device usage; or other categories of user or device activity that can be identified, monitored, recorded, reported, controlled or processed in accordance with a set of verifiable service control policies. As will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art in view of the embodiments described herein, some embodiments identify various service activities for the purpose of decomposing overall service usage into finer sub-categories of activities that can be verifiably monitored, categorized, cataloged, reported, controlled, monetized and used for end user notification in a manner that results in superior optimization of the service capabilities for various levels of service cost or for various types of devices or groups. In some embodiments, it will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that the terms service activity or service usage are associated with categorizing and possibly monitoring or controlling data traffic, application usage, communication with certain network end points, or transactions, and it will also be apparent that In some embodiments, the term service activity is intended to include one or more of the broader aspects listed above. The shortened term service usage can be used interchangeably with service activity, but neither term is intended in general to exclude any aspect of the other. In some cases, where the terms service usage or service activity are used, more specific descriptors such as traffic usage, application usage, website usage, and other service usage examples are also used to provide more specific examples or focus in on a particular element of the more encompassing terms.","In some embodiments, a user of a mobile wireless communication device configures service plans and service plan bundles, including individual constituent service plan elements thereof, permissions associated therewith, and restrictions applied thereto through a flexible user interface of the mobile wireless communication device. In some embodiments, a user is presented a selection of content for service plans and service plan bundles through the user interface of the mobile wireless communication device. In some embodiments, service providers or third parties supply applications to the mobile wireless communication device through which service plan and service plan bundle selection, customization, and management are effected. In some embodiments, customization and selection of service plans and service plan bundles occurs through the user interface of the mobile wireless communication device. In some embodiments, service plan and service plan bundle customization and selection occurs through a web browser application on the mobile wireless communication device. In some embodiments, customization and selection of service plans and service plan bundles uses one or more specific applications provided by a service provider or by a third party and installed on the mobile wireless communication device. In some embodiments, service plan and service plan bundle customization and selection uses applications provided by an operating system for the mobile wireless communication device. In some embodiments, the user selects and customizes service plans and service plan bundles for one mobile wireless communication device through another mobile wireless communication device. In some embodiments, selection and customization of service plans and service plan bundles occurs through a web browser communicating with a server or a website or a web portal. In some embodiments, selection and customization of service plans and service plan bundles occurs through an application communicating with an application portal or server, e.g., an application on the mobile wireless communication device or an application on another computing system. In some embodiments, a server communicatively coupled to a wireless network provides information for service plan and service plan bundle selection and customization. In some embodiments, information displayed for service plan and service plan bundle selection and customization originates from storage in the mobile wireless communication device. In some embodiments, the user selects and customizes individual constituent service plan elements included within a service plan bundle. In some embodiments, the user selects and customizes features of a service plan, service plan element or service plan bundle.","In some embodiments, notification messages, e.g., marketing interceptors, provide service plan offers to a user of the mobile wireless communication device. In some embodiments, the notification messages are presented directly through the user interface of the mobile wireless communication device. In some embodiments, multiple service plan options are presented to the user of the mobile wireless communication device for service plan selection. In some embodiments, a set of service plan selection options (and\/or customization options) is presented in response to a user action. In some embodiments, the content of the set of service plan selection options depends on the particular action of the user.

In some embodiments, a notification (e.g., a user or network service cloud notification) is generated based on a publishing of an updated\/new network capacity controlled services list based on an aggregate monitored activity (e.g., based on a service plan, velocity, sockets opening frequency\/rate (e.g., messaging layer behavior), total data usage, peak busy time usage to formulate or update black list for monitoring, notifying, and\/or controlling, which can be applied to one, multiple, group, or all devices). In some embodiments, a notification (e.g., a user or network service cloud notification) is generated based on data usage trends for particular device relative to an associated service plan and\/or other comparable devices or data usage thresholds\/statistical based data usage measures.","In some embodiments an application is actually composed of several component applications, processes or functions. Examples of this include but are not limited to: the components of a Java application JAR file; applications that use OS functions; applications that use a proxy service function; applications, functions or processes that coordinate with one another to implement a composite process, function or application; and OS process functions that support an application or overall OS function. In such embodiments it is important to be able to categorize all applications, functions and processes on a device that contribute to the service usage of a service activity so that the service activity can be monitored for service usage, have the service usage accounted for, implement the appropriate user notification when one or more service activity components attempts to start or use the network, implement the appropriate user notification when one or more service activity components reaches a pre-determined service usage level that requires user notification, and implement the appropriate background service or network protection service usage controls as specified herein ((including but not limited to for example: block network access, restrict network access, throttle network access, delay network access, aggregate and hold network access, select for time of day network access restrictions, select network type restrictions, select roaming network access restrictions, select service usage restrictions such as a usage limit, select service cost restrictions such as a cost limit or otherwise place on another form of background service status or network usage restriction as described herein). In the case of service activity components that belong exclusively to one aggregate service activity (e.g., an application, application JAR file or OS function), this may be accomplished by including each of the component service activities on a list that identifies the service activity components that belong to the aggregate service activity, and then monitoring, possibly controlling and providing user notifications based on the aggregate or component behavior of each service activity in accordance with the policies specified for the aggregate service activity. For example, it is necessary to group all application launch behavior and\/or network access behavior under the monitoring, launch, notification, accounting and background service controls or network protection service controls (or other background or network protection service policies as specified herein) in accordance with the background service or network protection service policies for the aggregate application that the JAR file supports. As another example, if an OS network synch or update function utilizes various software components or processes to implement the network synch or update function, then each of the software components or process must be monitored and aggregated under the background service policies or network protection service policies for the aggregate OS synch or update function.","In some embodiments, this ability to group usage for a related set of service activity components dedicated to an aggregate service activity as described herein is used to improve usage reporting of service activities to a service controller for the purpose of statistically identifying service activities that are candidates for background service policy controls or network protections service policy controls.","In some cases, multiple applications, processes, functions, OS services or other service activities can utilize a common set of component software applications, processes, functions or OS services. In such cases, in order to implement background service policies and\/or network protection service policies for service activity monitoring and accounting, service activity launch control, user notification, or network access control as described herein, it is necessary to associate the specific network access data or information flows to and from the common component software applications, processes or functions that belong to the specific initiating application, process, function or other service activity that is to be managed according to a background service or network protection service policy set. In what follows, a specific set of examples are provided on how to map common component service activity for a set of common OS functions referred to as proxy service functions to a specific application, process, function, OS service or other service activity for the purpose of implementing a background service policy set or a network protection service policy set as described herein. Once these examples are reviewed, it will be obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art how to apply similar mapping of service activity for a common set of components to a service activity that is to be managed in accordance with a background service policy set or a network protection service policy set as described herein.","In some embodiments, this ability to group usage for a common set of service activity components as described herein is used to improve usage reporting of service activities to a service controller for the purpose of statistically identifying service activities that are candidates for background service policy controls or network protections service policy controls.","In some embodiments, a proxy network service manager refers to an intermediary data flow function in a device operating system that sits on a data path between a device application and a device networking stack interface to provide a level of network service abstraction from the network stack interface, a higher level service function above the network stack interface, enhanced or special traffic processing functions, media service transfer management, file download service, HTTP proxy service functions, QoS differentiation, or other similar or related higher level traffic processing. Example Proxy Service Managers include the following: media service manager (e.g., android media service library function), email service manger, DNS function, software download service manager, media download manager (e.g., audio player, streaming media player, movie downloader, media service OS function, etc), data download service manager, Android \u201cmedia\u201d library function, Android.net library function, Jave.net library function, Apache library function, other similar software\/library functions or services in other device operating systems, SMTP\/IMAP\/POP proxy, HTTP proxy, IM proxy, VPN service manager, SSL proxy, etc. Herein these alternative network access data flows that are initiated by an application are termed application proxy service flows. In such embodiments an app can sometimes simply requests a network access service activity from an OS component such as a proxy service component rather then directly accessing the network. In such embodiments, in order to implement background service controls or user notification of application service usage, it is necessary to monitor the application proxy service flows, classify them as being initiated by or belonging to a particular application or service activity, and implement the proper background service classifications, user notifications, application process launch intercept, background service accounting, and background service usage restrictions as described herein in accordance with the policies intended for the initiating application or service activity. This is accomplished by inserting service usage monitors that allow a mapping of (i) the initiating application identifier (e.g., app name, app fingerprint, application identification tag, application process number, application credential, or other secure or non-secure application or process identifier) to (ii) the request to the proxy service and subsequently to (iii) the network service flows between the proxy service and the network elements that service the information communications. Once this mapping is accomplished, the service usage flows of the proxy service can then be accounted back to the initiating application, device software process or other service activity, the proper policies can then be applied to each service usage flow for user notification, service activity launch control, service activity background accounting (including variable charge rating dependent on background service state and\/or sponsored service charging), service activity background service controls or network usage restrictions as described herein (including but not limited to for example: block network access, restrict network access, throttle network access, delay network access, aggregate and hold network access, select for time of day network access restrictions, select network type restrictions, select roaming network access restrictions, select service usage restrictions such as a usage limit, select service cost restrictions such as a cost limit or otherwise place on another form of background service status or network usage restriction as described herein).","In some embodiments, this ability to track service usage for an service activity through a proxy service as described herein is used to improve usage reporting of service activities to a service controller for the purpose of statistically identifying service activities that are candidates for background service policy controls or network protections service policy controls.","In some embodiments, the various design techniques described herein that allow for monitoring, accounting for and\/or implementing service policy for component service activities that belong to an aggregate service activity can be designed into the OS itself. For example, in certain current mobile OS implementations (e.g., Android, iPhone, Blackberry, etc) there are some applications available in the market that allow a user to get an estimate for how much data a certain subset of applications are consuming on a wireless service provider network, but it is not possible for the user or application to get an indication of the service usage for certain OS functions, whereas the embodiments disclosed herein will allow for this. As another example, in certain current mobile OS implementations it is not possible to associate proxy service usage (e.g., media download and media streaming proxy library software functions) with the specific applications that use the proxy service, so while the user can be informed of generic common OS functions or proxy services (e.g., in the case of Android: \u201cmedia service\u201d, \u201cmedia\u201d, \u201cgallery\u201d, \u201cGoogle service framework\u201d and other generic common OS software library functions or proxy services), there is no way for the user to determine what applications widgets or other service activities are actually generating this common service function usage, whereas the invention described herein permits the user full visibility on such usage monitoring examples. Furthermore, if the OS is retrofitted with the intercept and policy implementation functions can be designed into the activity manager, broadcast intent manger, media service manager, service manager, or other application or service activity management function in the Android OS. One or ordinary skill in the art will recognize that similarly, the various design techniques described herein that allow for intercepting a service activity intention to launch, and applying a background service policy set or a network protection service policy set can be designed into application launch management functions in the iPhone OS, windows mobile OS, windows PC OS, Blackberry OS, Palm OS, and other OS designs.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0428","num":"0427"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10600","100","122","1100","122","135","135","135"]},"As illustrated by the solid line connecting the SDC  and the service controller , the SDC  communicates with the service controller , which is a network element that is generally located within the service-provider-controlled part of a wireless access network.

In some embodiments, ambient access generally refers to an initial service access in which such service access is in some manner limited, such as where service options are significantly limited (e.g., low bandwidth network browsing and\/or access to a specific transactional service), limited bandwidth, limited duration access before which a service plan must be purchased to maintain service or have service suspended\/disabled or throttled or otherwise limited\/reduced\/downgraded, and\/or any other time based, quality based, scope of service limited initial access for the network enabled device. In some embodiments, ambient activation is provided by setting access control to a fixed destination (e.g., providing access to a portal, such as a web page (e.g., for a hotspot) or WAP (Wireless Application Protocol) page, that provides the user with service plan options for obtaining a service plan for the user desired access, such as the service plan options for data usage, service types, time period for access (e.g., a day pass, a week pass or some other duration), and costs of service plan(s)). In some embodiments, service data usage of the ambient activated device is verified using Internet Protocol Detail Records (IPDRs, also sometimes and interchangeably referred to herein as Charging Data Records or CDRs), (e.g., using the device ID\/device number for the device  to determine if the device  has been used in a manner that is out of plan for the service plan associated with the device , such as based on the amount of data usage exceeding the service plan's service data usage limits, out of plan\/unauthorized access to certain websites, and\/or out of plan\/unauthorized transactions). In some embodiments, service data usage of the ambient activated device  is verified by setting a maximum data rate in a policy control agent and if\/when it is determined that the device  is exceeding a specified data rate\/data usage, then the service data usage is throttled accordingly.

In some embodiments, the service provider\/third-party interface  includes a sandbox interface - for sponsored applications and websites to be designed and managed by a sponsor, servicer provider or other third-party service partner. In some embodiments, the service provider\/third-party interface  includes a sandbox interface - for an enterprise information technology (IT) administrator to manage communication services, e.g., service plans and device groups, for an enterprise business.

In some embodiments, the service design center  and the service design sandboxes can be hierarchically organized. In some embodiments, the service design center  delegates certain roles to a service design sandbox and, in some embodiments, retains an oversight capability for agents of the service design center . In some embodiments, a service design sandbox can be given the ability to impact policy control to a subset of subscriber groups of a network service plan provisioning system. In some embodiments, the network service plan provisioning system can be referred to as \u201cdistributed\u201d.","In some embodiments, entities that might desire to include one or more service design sandboxes in their networks include enterprises with employees that consume network services, MVNOs, application developers, gifters, and community-based organizations. In some embodiments, e.g., enterprises with employees that consume network services, a service design sandbox can enable fine-tuned control over traffic control and charging policy (as well as notification policy). Assume that XYZ company controls a service design sandbox. XYZ company can create a service plan specific to XYZ company network services on the XYZ company intranet, which will be referred to as the XYZ plan. Specifically, the XYZ company can sponsor the XYZ company network services on the XYZ company intranet for XYZ company employees. A paid plan offered by a carrier that controls the service design center , for example, can still be available for XYZ company employees that are using other network services (or XYZ company could partially sponsor a subset of the other network services). The XYZ plan could also include a component that prevents XYZ company employees from accessing certain restricted sites through the XYZ company intranet and has notification policy associated with the attempted access. Continuing the example, an agent (e.g., IT manager) of the XYZ company can define subscriber groups that comprise XYZ company members and assign different service plans (e.g., different traffic control, notification, or charging policies) to the different XYZ company subscriber groups. For example, employees could get limited usage, managers might get access to more usage and additional services (e.g., email), members of the sales team might get better roaming services, and a CEO might get everything in the carrier's service plan offering, perhaps with XYZ company as a sponsor for all services. Advantageously, split billing is possible using these techniques, such that XYZ company can pay for sponsored services and XYZ employees can pay for unsponsored services (or for a portion of subsidized services).","In some embodiments, an MVNO can purchase bulk data from a carrier and offer plans based on the bulk. Advantageously for MVNOs, a service design sandbox enables control over subscribers based on various specified criteria, e.g., network state. Indeed, for all subscribers \u201cowned\u201d by the MVNO, a great deal of policy control can be applied (dependent upon the amount of control a carrier is willing to give to the MVNO). Other providers that can benefit from the sandbox model include mobile virtual network enablers (MVNEs), mobile shared spectrum enablers (MSSEs), and service providers (SPs).","In some embodiments, e.g., for application developers, a service design sandbox can specify applications that can be covered by a service plan. In some embodiments, the service design center  may be responsible for creating the underlying control mechanism. In some embodiments, a company like amazon.com can be given some control over sponsorship settings for applications associated with amazon.com.","In some embodiments, e.g., for \u201cgifters,\u201d a service design sandbox can enable specification of a sponsorship amount that is donated to some other organization, such as a non-profit organization. In some embodiments, e.g., for community-based organizations, a service design sandbox can specify free access for a particular network service. For example, the San Francisco Giants organization could have a plan group for fans that grants free access to the official site of the San Francisco Giants. As another example, AAA could sponsor access to services for AAA members.","In some embodiments, agents of the network service plan provisioning system can be given roles that grant access to certain aspects of service design and\/or provisioning. In some embodiments, agents at the service design center  can have a role system administrator, super user, or the like, while agents of a service design sandbox can have roles such as enterprise IT manager, MVNO administrator, or the like. In some embodiments, agents of a service design sandbox can subdivide roles further, if applicable, depending upon implementation.","In some embodiments, the service design center  is connected to the Internet and is coupled to the service controller . In some embodiments, the service design center  can set up boundaries for \u201csandboxed\u201d service and allow customizations for partner sets; lock in master tariffs based on negotiated rates for a given partner set or individual partner; create custom log-ins for different partner sets or individual partners; and carry out any applicable techniques appropriate for a service design system. In some embodiments, the service design center  allows authorized agents to manage service plan components and subscribers. In some embodiments, the agents can manage groups (collections of subscribers, SIMs, or devices) to create groups and group directories, assign an identity hierarchy for the operator, associated identifiers with groups, etc. In some embodiments, the agents can manage service plans (including one or more components) including plan name and description, groups using the plan, service plan components, service activities, network busy states and connection types, charging policies (including usage limits, thresholds, frequency, time, and payment type), notifications (e.g., for plan usage thresholds, plan cap, expiration, block, overage, no capable plan, etc.), and events (e.g., for plan usage thresholds, plan cap, expiration, block, overage, etc.). In some embodiments, the agents can manage service components (logical grouping of one or more filters and rules), including component name and description, plans using the component, network busy states and connection types, charging policies (including usage limits, thresholds, frequency, time and payment type), notifications (e.g., for plan usage thresholds, plan cap, expiration, block, overage, no capable plan, etc.), and events (e.g., for plan usage thresholds, plan cap, expiration, block, overage, etc.). In some embodiments, the agents can manage service activities (e.g., activity name, plans using the activity, components using the activity, filter name and description, and filter type details (e.g., operating system, application, remote, port, protocol, etc.). The agents can manage service group plans including assign and publish plan group, create activation workflow screens, create buy workflow screens. In some embodiments, the agents can receive, manage, customize, or generate reports for, for example, usage reports by destination for a subscriber over a period of time, usage reports by destination for a range of subscribers over a period of time (top destinations).","In some embodiments, a sandbox of the service design center  is coupled to the service design center  in an applicable convenient fashion.

In some embodiments, the pre-configured package has been configured by the sponsor or by another sponsor (e.g., a previous sponsor of the same or different application or service). In some embodiments, the sponsor selects a level of promotion (e.g., base, featured, premium, banner ads, promotional messaging, etc.). In some embodiments, the sponsor selects sponsorship parameters (e.g., amount of data to sponsor, amount of time to sponsor, roaming settings, etc.). In some embodiments, after configuring the sponsored application or service, the sponsor signs a contract. In some embodiments, the contract is electronic. In some embodiments, the contract is executed through the interface.","In some embodiments, after a sponsor has configured the sponsored application or service, the network operator\/carrier\/service provider enters information associated with the sponsored application or service into the service design center . In some embodiments, the information associated with the sponsored application or service includes: one or more application credentials, one or more device credentials, information defining notifications, information defining service parameters, information defining promotional parameters. In some embodiments, after the network operator\/carrier\/service provider has entered the information into the SDC , the sponsor approves the information. In some embodiments, information associated with the sponsored service in the SDC  is published to a specified device group. In some embodiments, the selected device group is specified or configured by the sponsor.","After a sponsor has configured the sponsored service or application parameters, the service controller  or another network element communicates the sponsored service to a mobile wireless communication device , or the mobile wireless communication device  otherwise obtains the sponsored service from a network element.","In some embodiments, when a user launches the service object (e.g., icon, banner ad, etc.) associated with the sponsored service or application, but the mobile wireless communication device  does not yet have an application (e.g., the sponsored application) necessary to use the sponsored service or application, an appropriate application (e.g., the sponsored application) is downloaded to the mobile wireless communication device . In some embodiments, the cost associated with downloading the application is charged to the sponsor.","In some embodiments, when a user launches the service object (e.g., icon, banner ad, etc.) associated with the sponsored service or application, the user interface displays information about the sponsored application or service.","In some embodiments, when a user has used a sponsored application or service, and the sponsorship of that service or application ends, a notification is presented through the device user interface . In some embodiments, the notification is a service offer (e.g., an offer for a paid service plan associated with the sponsored service or application). In some embodiments, if the user responds positively to the notification (e.g., the user purchases an offered service plan), the network operator\/carrier\/service provider credits the sponsor for some amount of sponsored access. In some embodiments, the credit is determined based on a revenue share agreement.","In some embodiments, the sponsor pays for all data usage associated with the sponsored application or service in order to maximize traffic using the application or service. For example, a bank may decide to sponsor all data usage associated with a banking application, or an insurance company may decide to sponsor all data usage associated with visits to the insurance company's website.","In some embodiments, the sponsor pays for only a portion of the data usage associated with the sponsored application or service in order to prevent excessive costs to the sponsor. In some embodiments, the sponsor pays for all data usage during a particular time period. Using such partial-sponsorship models, for example, an application developer may attempt to expose users to their applications in the hope that the users will like or need those applications and thereafter pay for data usage associated with those applications. As another example, a network operator\/carrier\/service provider may use a partial sponsorship model to encourage subscribers to try using data at no cost to them, the hope being that subscribers will then purchase a data service plan that will result in profit to the network operator.","In some embodiments, a free version of an application is offered along with free access for a limited time. In some embodiments, after the initial free period, the user is prompted to buy a paid version of the application or a paid data plan. Using such a \u201cfreemium\u201d model, application developers can increase sales, and operators can improve revenues from subscriber uptake of data plans.","In some embodiments, a service plan or an application is offered to the user of a mobile wireless communication device  that permits a limited time or service amount usage of the service plan or application. In some embodiments, the service plan or application offer is provided in a notification message, e.g., through a UI of the device. In some embodiments, a user of the mobile wireless communication device  enters one or more credentials, e.g., a device credential, a user credential, and\/or an account credential in order to \u201csign up\u201d for the offered service plan or application. In some embodiments, the user is required to provide a form of credit information, e.g., a credit card or a user credential that points to a service account that includes credit information, before the user can access and use the service plan or application. In some embodiments, the user supplies the user credential to a third-party service partner system, e.g., an \u201cApple ID\u201d to \u201ciTunes\u201d or to an \u201cApplication Store\u201d or to an \u201ciCloud\u201d account. In some embodiments, service usage for the service plan or application by the mobile wireless communication device  (and\/or a user thereof) is accounted by a network system. In some embodiments, when the service plan expires or an allocated service usage amount for the service plan is consumed, a notification message (e.g., a marketing interceptor) is provided to the user of the mobile wireless communication device . In some embodiments, the notification message provides for selecting to purchase, replace, upgrade or continue use of the service plan or application. In some embodiments, the notification message provides for selecting a pre-paid or post-paid service plan or application in place of the limited \u201cfree\u201d service plan or application. In some embodiments, the user of the mobile wireless communication device  is not required to provide credit information to use the limited \u201cfree\u201d service plan or application. In some embodiments, the user of the mobile wireless communication device  is required to provide credit information to purchase and\/or subscribe to a service plan or application offered by the notification message when the limited \u201cfree\u201d service plan or application expires or runs out.","In some embodiments, one or more of the mediation\/reconciliation functions for device assisted billing, device generated billing events, device generated bill by account events and device generated open transaction billing events can be implemented in the service controller  (e.g., a billing event server) or in another function located in a billing system or elsewhere. This billing mediation server function accepts the device based billing events discussed immediately above, reformats the billing events into a format accepted and recognized by the billing system, mediates the billing event information to remove service usage billing from the user account and place it in other bill by account categories as appropriate according to the bill by account mediation rules, adds other billing events for service usage or transactions to the user account as appropriate according to the device based billing rules, and then applies the information to the billing information the user account to correct or update the account.","For example, a bill by account can allow for a website provider, such as Google or Yahoo, to pay for or offset certain account usage for web browsing, web based searching, web based email, or any other web based or other service usage activities, which may also be based (in whole or in part) on the activities performed by the user on such transactional services (e.g., based on advertisement viewing\/accessing or click-through activities by the user, by which an advertisement business model used by such website providers directly or indirectly supports such service account subsidies). As another example, a bill by account can allow for an advertiser to pay for or offset certain account usage for viewing and\/or accessing (e.g., clicking through) a web placed advertisement or other advertisement sent via the network to the device. As yet another example, various network chatter (e.g., heartbeat related network and other network chatter related service data usage) can be assigned to a dummy account and such can be used to offset the bill and\/or used for tracking the data usage for such activities for the device. In another example, service data usage for access to a transactional service, such as a multimedia content download service (e.g., music, eBook, music\/video streaming, and\/or movie or other multimedia content download service), or an online shopping site (e.g., Amazon, eBay or another online shopping site), can be billed to a transactional service account assigned to a transactional service partner that sponsors access to that sponsor's transactional service, thereby allowing that transactional service partner to pays for or offset (e.g., subsidize) the account usage for such activities, which may also be based (in whole or in part) on the transactions actually performed by the user on such transactional services (e.g., based on the volume\/cost of the multimedia service download purchases by the user and\/or online activities)","Service Plan Selection and Customization","In some embodiments, a user of the mobile wireless communication device  obtains information about service plans and\/or service plan bundles from the service controller  through the network .

In some embodiments, the service notification and billing interface notifies the user of their current service usage at specified service usage points and displays various options to the user (e.g., service usage options and\/or billing options). For example, the user's responses to the presented options are recorded (e.g., stored locally on the device at least temporarily for reporting purposes or permanently in a local configuration data store until such configuration settings are otherwise modified or reset) and reported, such as to a billing server (e.g., central billing ). For example, user input, such as selected options and\/or corresponding policy settings, can be stored locally on the device via a cache system. As another example, the service notification and billing interface displays options to the user for how the user wants to be notified and how the user wants to control service usage costs, the user's input on such notification options is recorded, and the cost control options (e.g., and the billing agent  and policy control agent ) are configured accordingly. Similarly, the user's input on service plan options\/changes can be recorded, and the service plan options\/changes (e.g., and the billing agent  and policy control agent ) are configured\/updated accordingly. In another example, the service notification and billing interface provides various traffic control profiles, such as for where the user requests assistance in controlling service usage costs (e.g., service data usage and\/or transactional usage related activities\/costs). Similarly, the service notification and billing interface can provide various notification options, such as for where the user wants advance warning on service coverage. In another example, the service notification and billing interface provides options for automatic pre-buy at a set point in service usage.

For example, user input provided via the online portal\/web server can be recorded and reported to the billing server (e.g., central billing ). In another example, the online portal\/web server can display transaction billing information and\/or accept input for a transaction billing request, which can then be reported to the billing server accordingly.","As shown in , the service processor  includes a service interface or user interface (UI) . In some embodiments, the user interface  provides the user with information and accepts user choices or preferences on one or more of the following: user service information, user billing information, service activation, service plan selection or change, service usage or service activity counters, remaining service status, service usage projections, service usage overage possibility warnings, service cost status, service cost projections, service usage control policy options, privacy\/CRM\/GPS related options, and\/or other service related information, settings, and\/or options. For example, the user interface  can collect service usage information from service monitor agent  to update the local service usage counter (and\/or, alternatively, the service usage information is obtained from the service controller ) to update user interface service usage or service cost information for display to the user. As another example, service billing records obtained from central billing system  can be used to synchronize local service usage counters and service monitor agent  information to perform real-time updating of local service usage counters between billing system  synchronizations. As another example, the user interface  can display options and accept user preference feedback, such as similarly discussed above with respect to user privacy\/CRM\/GPS filtering, traffic monitoring and service controls. For example, the user interface  can allow the user of the device to modify their privacy settings, provide user feedback on service preferences and\/or service experiences, modify their service profiles (e.g., preferences, settings, configurations, and\/or network settings and options), to review service usage data (e.g., based on local service usage counters and\/or other data monitored by the service processor ), to receive various events or triggers (e.g., based on projected service usage\/costs), and\/or the user interface  can provide\/support various other user input\/output for service control and service usage.","In some embodiments, by providing the service policy implementation and the control of service policy implementation to the preferences of the user, and\/or by providing the user with the option of specifying or influencing how the various service notification and control policies or control algorithms are implemented, the user is provided with options for how to control the service experience, the service cost, the capabilities of the service, the manner in which the user is notified regarding service usage or service cost, the level of sensitive user information that is shared with the network or service provider entity, and the manner in which certain service usage activities may or may not be throttled, accelerated, blocked, enabled and\/or otherwise controlled. Accordingly, some embodiments provide the service control to beneficially optimize user cost versus service capabilities or capacities in a manner that facilitates an optimized user experience and does not violate network neutrality goals, regulations and\/or requirements. For example, by offering the user with a set of choices, ranging from simple choices between two or more pre-packaged service control settings options to advanced user screens where more detailed level of user specification and control is made available, some embodiments allow the service provider, device manufacturer, device distributor, MVNO, VSP, service provider partner, and\/or other \u201centity\u201d to implement valuable or necessary service controls while allowing the user to decide or influence the decision on which service usage activities are controlled, such as how they are controlled or throttled and which service usage activities may not be throttled or controlled in some manner. These various embodiments allow the service provider, device manufacturer, device distributor, MVNO, VSP, service provider partner, or other \u201centity\u201d to assist the user in managing services in a manner that is network neutral with respect to their implementation and service control policies, because the user is making or influencing the decisions, for example, on cost versus service capabilities or quality. By further providing user control or influence on the filtering settings for the service usage reporting or CRM reporting, various levels of service usage and other user information associated with device usage can be transmitted to the network, service provider, device manufacturer, device distributor, MVNO, VSP, service provider partner, and\/or other \u201centity\u201d in a manner specified or influenced by the user to maintain the user's desired level of information privacy.","As shown in , the service processor  includes a service downloader . In some embodiments, the service downloader  provides a download function to install or update service software elements on the device. In some embodiments, the service downloader  requires a secure signed version of software before a download is accepted. For example, the download can require a unique key for a particular service downloader . As another example, the service downloader  can be stored or execute in secure memory or execute a secure memory partition in the CPU memory space. Those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that there are a variety of other security techniques that can be used to ensure the integrity of the service downloader .","In some embodiments, the service processor  and service controller  are capable of assigning multiple service profiles associated with multiple service plans that the user chooses individually or in combination as a package. For example, a device  starts with ambient services that include free transaction services wherein the user pays for transactions or events rather than the basic service (e.g., a news service, eReader, PND service, pay as you go session Internet) in which each service is supported with a bill by account capability to correctly account for any subsidized partner billing to provide the transaction services (e.g., Barnes and Noble may pay for the eReader service and offer a revenue share to the service provider for any book or magazine transactions purchased from the device ). In some embodiments, the bill by account service can also track the transactions and, in some embodiments, advertisements for the purpose of revenue sharing, all using the service monitoring capabilities disclosed herein. After initiating services with the free ambient service discussed above, the user may later choose a post-pay monthly Internet, email and SMS service. In this case, the service controller  would obtain from the billing system  in the case of network based billing (or in some embodiments the service controller  billing event server  in the case of device based billing) the billing plan code for the new Internet, email and SMS service. In some embodiments, this code is cross referenced in a database (e.g., the policy management server ) to find the appropriate service profile for the new service in combination with the initial ambient service. The new superset service profile is then applied so that the user maintains free access to the ambient services, and the billing partners continue to subsidize those services, the user also gets access to Internet services and may choose the service control profile (e.g., from one of the embodiments disclosed herein). The superset profile is the profile that provides the combined capabilities of two or more service profiles when the profiles are applied to the same device  service processor. In some embodiments, the device  (service processor ) can determine the superset profile rather than the service controller  when more than one \u201cstackable\u201d service is selected by the user or otherwise applied to the device. The flexibility of the service processor  and service controller  embodiments described herein allow for a large variety of service profiles to be defined and applied individually or as a superset to achieve the desired device  service features.","As shown in , service processor  includes a service control device link . For example, as device based service control techniques involving supervision across a network become more sophisticated, it becomes increasingly important to have an efficient and flexible control plane communication link between the device agents and the network elements communicating with, controlling, monitoring, or verifying service policy. In some embodiments, the service control device link  provides the device side of a system for transmission and reception of service agent to\/from network element functions. In some embodiments, the traffic efficiency of this link is enhanced by buffering and framing multiple agent messages in the transmissions. In some embodiments, the traffic efficiency is further improved by controlling the transmission frequency or linking the transmission frequency to the rate of service usage or traffic usage. In some embodiments, one or more levels of security or encryption are used to make the link robust to discovery, eavesdropping or compromise. In some embodiments, the service control device link  also provides the communications link and heartbeat timing for the agent heartbeat function. As discussed herein, various embodiments disclosed herein for the service control device link  provide an efficient and secure solution for transmitting and receiving service policy implementation, control, monitoring and verification information with other network elements.","In some embodiments, the service control device link  agent messages are transmitted asynchronously as they are generated by one or more of the service agents. In some embodiments, the service control device link  performs collection or buffering of agent messages between transmissions. In some embodiments, the service control device link  determines when to transmit based potentially on several parameters including, for example, one or more of the following parameters: periodic timer trigger, waiting until a certain amount of service usage or traffic usage has occurred, responding to a service controller message, responding to a service controller request, initiated by one or more agents, initiated by a verification error condition, initiated by some other error or status condition. In some embodiments, once a transmission trigger has occurred, the service control device link  assembles all buffered agent communications and frames the communications.","In some embodiments, the transmission trigger is controlled by waiting for an amount of service usage, such as waiting until a certain amount of data traffic has passed, which reduces the control plane communication channel traffic usage to a fraction of the data plane traffic. For example, this approach preserves network capacity and reduces service cost even in traffic scenarios in which data traffic is light.","In some embodiments, the transmission trigger is based on waiting for an amount of service usage, and also including a minimum transmission rate that triggers a transmission according to one or more of the following parameters: a maximum time between transmissions clock to keep the service processor  in communication with the service controller  when little or no service usage is occurring, a polling request of some kind from the service controller , a response to a service controller heartbeat, a transmission generated by a service verification error event, or a transmission generated by some other asynchronous event with time critical service processor  (or service controller ) messaging needs, such as a transaction or service billing event or a user request. For example, service control plane traffic down is reduced to a relatively inexpensive and capacity conserving trickle when device  data traffic is not significant. At the same time, this approach also provides an effective flow of real time or near real-time service control plane traffic that is both cost and capacity efficient, because the service control plane traffic is a relatively small percentage of the data plane traffic when data plane traffic usage is heavy. For example, when data plane traffic usage is heavy is generally the time when close monitoring of service policy implementation verification or compromise prevention can be particularly important and by keeping the control plane overhead to a fraction of data plane traffic close monitoring and control of services are maintained at a reasonable cost in terms of percentage of both bandwidth used and network capacity. In some embodiments, the service usage or service activity trigger occurs based on some other measure than traffic usage, such as a number of messages transacted, one or more billing events, number of files downloaded, number of applications run or time that an application has been running, usage of one or more specified applications, GPS coordinate changes, roaming event, an event related to another network connection to the device and\/or other service related measures.","In some embodiments, the service control device link  provides for securing, signing, encrypting or otherwise protecting communications before sending. For example, the service control device link  can send to the transport layer or directly to the link layer for transmission. In some embodiments, the communications are further secured with transport layer encryption, such as TCP TLS (Transport Control Protocol Transport Layer Security) or another secure transport layer protocol. In some embodiments, communications are encrypted at the link layer, such as IPSEC (Internet Protocol Security), various VPN (Virtual Private Network) services, other forms of IP layer encryption and\/or another link layer encryption technique.","In some embodiments, the service control link  includes the above discussed agent heartbeat function in which the agents provide certain required reports to the service controller  for the purpose of service policy implementation verification (e.g., verification related reports on certain aspects of the service processor ) or for other purposes. For example, such agent heartbeat messages can be in the open\/clear (unencrypted) or encrypted, signed and\/or otherwise secured. In some embodiments, these messages include one or more of the below described types of messages: an agent information message, an agent check-in message and\/or agent cross check message.","In some embodiments, an agent information message is included in the agent heartbeat service policy implementation verification message, which includes, for example, any information the agent needs to communicate to the service controller  as part of the operation of the service policy implementation system. For example, an agent response to a service controller challenge, as described below, can be included in the agent heartbeat service policy implementation verification message.","In some embodiments, an agent check-in message is included in an agent heartbeat service policy implementation verification message, which includes, for example, a transmission of a unique agent identifier, secure unique identifier, and\/or hashed encrypted and signed message beginning with some shared secret or state variable for the hash. For example, an agent self-check can be included in the agent heartbeat service policy implementation verification message, which includes reporting on agent configuration, agent operation, agent code status, agent communication log, agent error flags, and\/or other agent associated information potentially hashed, encrypted, signed or otherwise secured in the message (e.g., using a shared secret unique to that agent).","In some embodiments, an agent cross-check message is included in the agent heartbeat service policy implementation verification message, which includes, for example, reports on the status, configuration, operation observations, communication log or other aspects of another agent. For example, agent environment reports can be included in the agent heartbeat service policy implementation verification message, which includes, for example, reports on certain aspects of the service processor  operating environment, such as software presence (e.g., installation status of certain operating system and\/or application software and\/or components thereof), observed communication with agents or communication attempts, memory accesses or access attempts, network accesses or access attempts, software downloads or attempted downloads, software removal or download blocking, service policy implementation verification or compromise event error conditions with respect to the operating environment for the service processor , and\/or other messages regarding the verification or possibility of compromise associated with the service processor  operating environment or agents.","In some embodiments, the agent heartbeat function also provides regular updates for information important to user service notification services. For example, the network based elements can provide regular synchronization updates for the device based service usage or service activity counters in which service usage or service activity measures available from one or more network service history elements is transmitted to the device . This allows the service usage counter errors between the device service counter and the counters used for central billing to be minimized. A common service usage or service activity measure is total traffic usage measured to date within a time frame over which a service limit is applicable. Other service usage or service activity measures can also be tracked and reconciled in a similar manner.","In some embodiments for the heartbeat function, the service controller  verifies that the scheduled agent reports are being received and that the reports are within expected parameters. In some embodiments, the access control integrity server  issues signed challenge\/response sequences to the policy implementation agent . For example, the challenges can be asynchronous, issued when an event or error condition occurs, issued on a schedule or issued when a certain amount of data has passed. This approach, for example, provides a second layer of service policy implementation verification that strengthens the service usage or service activity measurement verification. For example, a challenge\/response can be sent over the heartbeat link for the purpose of verifying device agent integrity. Various challenge\/response related verification embodiments are described below.","In some embodiments, the challenge\/response heartbeat message can include sending any kind of command or query, secure or transmitted in the open, receiving a response from the agent and then evaluating the response to determine if the response is within a range of parameters expected for a correctly configured agent, an agent that is operating properly, an agent that is not partially compromised or an agent that is not entirely compromised. In some embodiments, the agent is only required to respond with a simple acknowledgement of the challenge. In some embodiments, the agent is required to respond with a message or piece of information that is known by the agent. In some embodiments, the agent is required to respond with a message or piece of information that is difficult for the agent to respond correctly with if it were to be partially or entirely compromised. In some embodiments, the agent is required to respond back with information regarding the operation or configuration of the agent that is difficult for the agent to respond properly with if the agent is not properly configured, not operating properly, is partially compromised or is entirely compromised. In some embodiments, the first agent is required to respond back with information regarding the operation, configuration, status or behavior of a second agent that is difficult for the first or second agent to respond properly with if the first or second agent is not properly configured, not operating properly, is partially compromised or is entirely compromised. In some embodiments, the agent is required to respond with a response that includes a shared secret. In some embodiments, the agent is required to respond with information regarding the presence, configuration, operating characteristics or other information regarding other programs in the operating environment of the agent. In some embodiments, the agent is required to respond with hashed information to be portions of code or a code sample (e.g., the code portion or code sample can be specified by the service controller ).","In some embodiments, the information the agent responds with is a response to a signed or encrypted message from the service controller  in which the agent must know how to decode the encrypted controller message in order to respond correctly or it would be difficult for the agent to respond properly if the agent is not configured properly, is not operating within appropriate limits, is partially compromised or is entirely compromised. In some embodiments, the agent signs or encrypts information in such a manner that it is difficult to respond correctly when the message is decoded by the service controller  unless the agent is configured properly, is operating within appropriate limits, is not partially compromised and is not entirely compromised. In some embodiments, the agent is required to respond with a signed or encrypted hash of information that is difficult for the agent to generate unless the agent is configured properly, is operating within appropriate limits, is not partially compromised and is not entirely compromised. For example, the hashed information can be local device configuration information, portions of code or all of the code, and\/or the code portion to be used in the response can be specified by the service controller. In another example, the hashed information the agent responds with can include a shared secret, and\/or the hashed information can be information regarding the presence, configuration, operating characteristics or other information regarding other programs in the operating environment of the agent.","Accordingly, as described above, the agent heartbeat function provides an important and efficient system in some embodiments for verifying the service policy implementation or protecting against compromise events. For example, there are many other functions the agent heartbeat service can perform and some are described herein while others will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art given the principles, design background and various embodiments provided herein.","In some embodiments, the service control device link  facilitates another important function, which is the download of new service processor software elements, revisions of service processor software elements, and\/or dynamic refreshes of service processor software elements. There are many embodiments for such operations. In some embodiments, the software is received as a single file over the service control device link . For example, the file can have encryption or signed encryption beyond any provided by the communication link protocol itself. In some embodiments, the software files are segmented into smaller packets that are communicated in multiple messages sent over the service control device link . In some embodiments, once the file(s) are received, or the segmented portions of the file(s) are received, they are communicated to a service downloader  for file aggregation and installation, which, in some embodiments, is performed after further measures to verify the service processor software are completed. In some embodiments, the files are sent using other delivery means, such a direct TCP socket connection to the service downloader  or some other software installer, which can also involve secure transport and additional levels of encryption.","As shown in , the service controller  includes a service control server link . In some embodiments, device based service control techniques involving supervision across a network (e.g., on the control plane) are more sophisticated, and for such it is increasingly important to have an efficient and flexible control plane communication link between the device agents (e.g., of the service processor ) and the network elements (e.g., of the service controller ) communicating with, controlling, monitoring, or verifying service policy. For example, the communication link between the service control server link  of service controller  and the service control device link  of the service processor  can provide an efficient and flexible control plane communication link, a service control link  as shown in , and, in some embodiments, this control plane communication link provides for a secure (e.g., encrypted) communications link for providing secure, bidirectional communications between the service processor  and the service controller . In some embodiments, the service control server link  provides the network side of a system for transmission and reception of service agent to\/from network element functions. In some embodiments, the traffic efficiency of this link is enhanced by buffering and framing multiple agent messages in the transmissions (e.g., thereby reducing network chatter). In some embodiments, the traffic efficiency is further improved by controlling the transmission frequency and\/or linking the transmission frequency to the rate of service usage or traffic usage. In some embodiments, one or more levels of security and\/or encryption are used to secure the link against potential discovery, eavesdropping or compromise of communications on the link. In some embodiments, the service control server link  also provides the communications link and heartbeat timing for the agent heartbeat function. As discussed below, various embodiments described herein for the service control server link  provide an efficient and secure mechanism for transmitting and receiving service policy implementation, control, monitoring and verification information between the device agents (e.g., service processor agents\/components) and other network elements (e.g., service controller agents\/components).","In some embodiments, the service control server link  can employ the counterpart service control plane secure transmission methods discussed above with respect to the service control device link . For example, one or more layers of security can be used to secure the communications link, including, for example, basic IP layer security, TCP layer security, service control link layer security, and\/or security specific from service controller servers to service processor agents.","In some embodiments, the service control server link  reduces network chatter by efficiently transmitting service control related communications over the link. For example, the service control server link  can transmit server messages asynchronously as they arrive. As another example, the service control server link  can perform collection or buffering of server messages between transmissions. As another example, the service control server link  can determine when to transmit based potentially on several parameters, such as one or more of: periodic timer trigger, waiting until a certain amount of service usage or traffic usage has occurred, responding to a service agent message, responding to a service agent request, initiated by one or more servers, initiated by a verification error condition, and\/or initiated by some other error condition. For example, once a transmission trigger has occurred, the service control server link  can take all buffered agent communications and frame the communications. In addition, the service control server link  can provide for an efficient communication link based on various embodiments related to the timing of transmissions over the service control link, as similarly discussed above with respect to the service control device link  description. For example, the timing functions, such as asynchronous messages or polling for messages, constant frequency transmission, transmission based on how much service usage or data traffic usage has taken place, transmission in response to device side control link message, service verification error events, other error events, and\/or other message transmission trigger criteria can be determined, controlled and\/or initiated by either the device side or the network side depending on the embodiment.","In some embodiments, the service control server link  provides for securing, signing, encrypting and\/or otherwise protecting the communications before sending such communications over the service control link . For example, the service control server link  can send to the transport layer or directly to the link layer for transmission. In another example, the service control server link  further secures the communications with transport layer encryption, such as TCP TLS or another secure transport layer protocol. As another example, the service control server link  can encrypt at the link layer, such as using IPSEC, various possible VPN services, other forms of IP layer encryption and\/or another link layer encryption technique.","In some embodiments, the service control server link  includes the agent heartbeat function in which the agents provide certain required reports to the service processor for the purpose of service policy implementation verification or for other purposes. For example, the heartbeat function can also be used to issue queries or challenges, messages, service settings, service control objectives, information requests or polling, error checks and\/or other communications to the agents. As another example, agent heartbeat messages can be in the open or encrypted, signed and\/or otherwise secured. Additional heartbeat function and the content of heartbeat messages can be provided as similarly described herein, such as described above with respect to the service control device link  and the access control integrity agent  and other sections. In some embodiments, the service controller  and\/or agents of the service controller  are programmed to periodically provide reports, such as upon a heartbeat response (e.g., an agent can repeatedly send necessary reports each heartbeat), and appropriate actions can then be taken based upon such received reports. Accordingly, the heartbeat function provides an important and efficient system in various embodiments described herein for verifying the service policy implementation and\/or protecting against compromise events. There are many other functions the agent heartbeat service can perform many of which are discussed herein, while many others will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art given the principles, design background and various embodiments provided herein.","In some embodiments, the service control server link  also provides a service control software download function for various embodiments, which, for example, can include a download of new service software elements, revisions of service software elements, and\/or dynamic refreshes of service software elements of the service processor  on the device. In some embodiments, this function is performed by the service control server link  transmitting the service control software as a single file over the service control link. For example, the file can have encryption or signed encryption beyond any provided by the communication link protocol itself for service control link . In another example, the service control software files can be segmented\/divided into smaller packets that are transmitted in multiple messages sent over the service control link . In yet another example, the service control software files can be transmitted using other delivery mechanism, such as a direct TCP socket connection from a service download control server , which can also involve secure transport and additional levels of encryption. In some embodiments, the service control server link  and\/or service download control server  use(s) an agent serial number and\/or a security key look up when agents are updated and\/or when a dynamic agent download occurs.","As shown in , the service controller  includes an access control integrity server . In some embodiments, the access control integrity server  collects device information on service policy, service usage, agent configuration and\/or agent behavior. For example, the access control integrity server  can cross check this information to identify integrity breaches in the service policy implementation and control system. In another example, the access control integrity server  can initiate action when a service policy violation or a system integrity breach is suspected.","In some embodiments, the access control integrity server  (and\/or some other agent of service controller ) acts on access control integrity agent reports and error conditions. Many of the access control integrity agent  checks can be accomplished by the server. For example, the access control integrity agent  checks include one or more of the following: service usage measure against usage range consistent with policies (e.g., usage measure from the network and\/or from the device); configuration of agents; operation of the agents; and\/or dynamic agent download.","In some embodiments, the access control integrity server  (and\/or some other agent of service controller ) verifies device service policy implementations by comparing various service usage measures (e.g., based on network monitored information, such as by using IPDRs, and\/or local service usage monitoring information) against expected service usage behavior given the policies that are intended to be in place. For example, device service policy implementations can include measuring total data passed, data passed in a period of time, IP addresses, data per IP address, and\/or other measures such as location, downloads, email accessed, URLs, and comparing such measures expected service usage behavior given the policies that are intended to be in place.","In some embodiments, the access control integrity server  (and\/or some other agent of service controller ) verifies device service policy, and the verification error conditions that can indicate a mismatch in service measure and service policy include one or more of the following: unauthorized network access (e.g., access beyond ambient service policy limits); unauthorized network speed (e.g., average speed beyond service policy limit); network data amount does not match policy limit (e.g., device not stop at limit without re-up\/revising service policy); unauthorized network address; unauthorized service usage (e.g., VOIP, email, and\/or web browsing); unauthorized application usage (e.g., email, VOIP, email, and\/or web); service usage rate too high for plan, and policy controller not controlling\/throttling it down; and\/or any other mismatch in service measure and service policy.","In some embodiments, the access control integrity server  (and\/or some other agent of service controller ) verifies device service policy based at least in part on, for example, various error conditions that indicate a mismatch in service measure and service policy. For example, various verification error conditions that can indicate a mismatch in service measure and service policy include one or more of the following: mismatch in one service measure and another service measure; agent failure to report in; agent failure to respond to queries (e.g., challenge-response sequence and\/or expected periodic agent reporting); agent failure to respond correctly to challenge\/response sequence; agent improperly configured; agent failure in self checks; agent failure in cross-checks; unauthorized agent communication or attempted unauthorized communication; failure in service policy implementation test; failure in service usage reporting test; failure in service usage billing test; failure in transaction billing test; failure in download sequence; environment compromise event, such as unauthorized software load or execution (or attempt), unauthorized memory access (or attempt), unauthorized agent access (or attempt), known harmful software, and\/or known harmful communications signature; and\/or failure to respond to various messages, such as send message and suspend and\/or send message and quarantine. In some embodiments, the access control integrity server  (and\/or some other agent of service controller ) verifies device service policy by performing automated queries and analysis, which are then reported (e.g., anomalous\/suspicious report results can be reported for further analysis by a person responsible for determining whether such activities indicate out of policy activities or to provide information to the user to inform the user of such anomalous\/suspicious report results that may indicate out of policy activities). For example, the user can review the report to authorize whether such activities were performed by the user (e.g., website access requests, specific transactions, and\/or phone calls) and\/or indicate that such activities were not authorized by the user (e.g., indicate a potential compromise of the device, such as by malware or other unauthorized software\/user use of the device). In another example, the user can also be connected to communicate with service support of the service provider regarding such reported activities (e.g., by text\/chat, voice\/phone, and\/or video conference to a service support). Accordingly, in some embodiments, the access control integrity server  (and\/or some other agent of service controller ) provides a policy\/service control integrity service to continually (e.g., periodically and\/or based on trigger events) verify that the service control of the device has not been compromised and\/or is not behaving out of policy.","In some embodiments, upon detection of one or more service verification errors, such as the various service verification errors discussed above, the device is directed to a quarantine network status in which the device can, for example, only access network control plane functions, billing functions, and other functions generally controlled by the access network service provider or the central service provider. For example, quarantine network access restrictions and routing can be accomplished with the access network AAA and routing system (e.g., access network AAA server  and one or more of the gateways) or can be accomplished with device based access control or traffic control policy implementation. Quarantine network equipment or servers can, for example, be located within the access network or within another network with access to the access network. Communication with the quarantine network infrastructure can be accomplished, for example, with a secure link with one or more encryption levels or a dedicated private link. In some embodiments, quarantining a device includes, for example, a two step process for routing quarantine network device traffic, first, to a quarantine traffic handling router or server and, second, from there to the actual quarantine network infrastructure, with the route being determined by device parameters, user parameters, access service provider parameters or other parameters associated with the quarantine network routing. In some embodiments, the device is completely suspended from the network in which, for example, the device can first issue a user interface message to the user or issuing another form of a message to the user or service subscriber, such as via email, hard copy message and\/or voice message. In some embodiments, the device network access, service capabilities and\/or traffic shaping are limited, partially restricted or completely restricted, service capabilities. For example, these limitations and\/or restrictions can be implemented in the device and\/or in the network. For example, implementing a device quarantine (e.g., using a RADIUS server to quarantine the device) can involve assigning the device to a different billing profile.","In some embodiments, upon detection of one or more service verification errors, such as the various service verification errors discussed above, switch based port analysis is performed to further monitor the device (e.g., referred to as Switched Port Analyzer (SPAN) on Cisco switches, and various other vendors have different names for it, such as Roving Analysis Port (RAP) on 3Com switches). In some embodiments, the device service policy implementation behavior is monitored at a deeper level in the network by copying device traffic in the switch so that it goes to both an intended data path destination and to a specified port for switch based port analysis (e.g., the traffic content can be analyzed and recorded using deep packet inspection (DPI) techniques, which can provide a finer level of detail than the typical IPDR). For example, an advantage of performing a switch based port analysis function is that the traffic need not be analyzed in real time, and a sample subset of the devices on the network can be selected for such analysis based on, for example, either identifying devices that have suspect service policy implementation behavior and\/or a regular sampling algorithm that eventually samples all devices, or some other selection approaches. As another example, a scheduled switch based port analysis sampling can be applied that eventually rotates through all devices and designates a higher priority in the sampling queue for devices that are suspect.","In some embodiments, switch based port analysis allows for off-line sampled or non-real-time DPI, as described above, as a verification measure for the device based service control measures that are implemented. In some embodiments, sophisticated DPI techniques are used to enhance the content of the IPDRs so that they provide detailed information that can be made available in the network. For example, some of the DPI packet analysis may be redundant between the device and the network, but this approach provides for a much finer grain validation for the device based service and less reliance on the device for some of the service traffic analysis that service providers need. In some embodiments, the device control server functions and the service control policy verification functions are implemented in an integrated hardware\/software system (e.g., a gateway, server, router, switch, base station, base station aggregator, AAA server cluster or any other hardware or hardware\/software system) located in the network that the network level traffic inspection is accomplished in, or in one or more servers integrated to operate in a coordinated manner with the DPI boxes. In some embodiments, the device control server functions and the service control policy verification functions are implemented in an integrated hardware\/software system (e.g., a gateway, server, router, switch, base station, base station aggregator, AAA server cluster or any other hardware or hardware\/software system) located in the network that provides deep service control capability (e.g., using DPI techniques) for devices that have some or all of the service processor functions installed and, in some embodiments, also providing coarser network control of the basics for devices that do not have a service processor installed in the device (e.g., such coarser network control functions include max data rate and\/or max total data).","In some embodiments, the SPAN function is used in a revolving periodic manner as well to augment CDR data with deeper packet information for the purpose of spot-checking device based service usage measures. Examples of where this can be beneficial include spot checking network address access policies, spot checking ambient access policies, spot checking billing event reports, spot checking intermediate networking device\/end point device count (via checking network source or destination addresses, token, cookies or other credentials, etc). For example, the periodic SPAN can be scheduled for all devices equally, for certain devices or users with higher priority, frequency or depth of SPAN than others, higher priority, higher frequency or immediate priority for devices with higher usage patterns or unusual usage patterns, immediate or very high priority for devices with a policy violation status.","In some embodiments, a combination traffic inspection and service control approach implements traffic and service control functions in the network that are conducive for a network based implementation and implements traffic and service control functions in the device that are either more conducive for performing in the device or can only be performed in the device (e.g., activities involving inspection of traffic that is encrypted once it is transmitted to the network). For example, using this approach, activities that can be done in the network are generally performed in the network and\/or are more efficiently performed in the network than the device, and activities that are more efficiently performed in the device or can only be performed in the device are performed in the device (e.g., depending on device processing\/storage capabilities and\/or other design\/security considerations). For example, the following are various traffic and service control functions that, in some embodiments, are preferably or can only be performed in the device: network based packet processing capability limitations (e.g., encrypted traffic, application layer information unavailable once the traffic goes into the networking stack, other application\/usage context information available on the device but not in the network); information that is generally\/preferably maintained and processed locally in the device for network neutrality reasons (e.g., network neutrality issues can generally be efficiently implemented by keeping all, substantially all or at least some aspect of decisions on how to implement algorithms to control traffic local to the device and under user decision control, and\/or by providing the user with a set of pre-packaged choices on how to manage service usage or service activity usage or manage service usage versus service cost or price); information that is generally\/preferably maintained and processed locally in the device for user privacy reasons (e.g., deeper levels of traffic monitoring and service usage monitoring data where it is available for assisting the user in achieving the best, lowest cost experience and implementing a CRM filter function to the user so that the user can control the level of CRM the network is allowed to receive, such as with the higher levels of information being exchanged for something of value to the user, and\/or user location information); information that is generally\/preferably maintained and processed locally in the device for the purpose of informing the user of service control settings or service activity usage or to adjust service activity control settings or receive user feedback to choices regarding service usage policies or billing options (e.g., providing the user with a UI for the purpose of monitoring an estimate of service usage and\/or notifying the user of at least some aspect of estimated service usage or projected service usage, providing the user with a UI for the purpose of monitoring an estimate of service cost and\/or notifying the user of at least some aspect of estimated service cost or projected service cost, providing the user with a UI for the purpose of providing the user with one or more service usage and\/or service cost notification messages that require user acknowledgement and\/or a user decision and obtaining or reporting the user acknowledgements and\/or decisions, providing the user with a UI for the purpose of providing the user with service options and\/or service payment options, providing the user with a UI for the purpose of obtaining user choice for such options when service usage or cost estimates are about to run over limits or have run over limits or are projected to run over limits, providing the user with a UI for the purpose of monitoring or conducting open central billing transactions or other transactions, providing the user with a UI for the purpose of selecting the service control techniques and\/or policies and\/or algorithms and\/or pre-packaged configurations that can be used to define or partially define the service activity usage control policies implemented in the device service processor or the network service control equipment\/billing system or a combination of both); service control for roaming on different networks that typically do not have compatible DPI-type techniques with the home network; certain service notification and traffic control algorithms (e.g., stack-ranked activity statistical analysis and control of only the high usage activities); and\/or a function for assigning a device to a service experience or ambient activation experience or virtual service provider (VSP) at various times from manufacturing to device distribution to a user of the device. In some embodiments, certain activities are implemented in the device as a solution for networks in which a new centralized DPI approach is not possible, not economically feasible, or for any number of reasons not an option or not a preferred option.","In some embodiments, a network based solution is provided for a more basic set of services for all devices that do not have service control capabilities, and a super-set of services and\/or additional services are provided for devices that include a service processor. As described herein, a service controller function can be located in various places in the network in accordance with various embodiments. It should also be noted that various other embodiments described herein also employ a hybrid service control function performing certain service control functions in the network (e.g., collecting network service usage information, such as IPDRs, and\/or performing DPI related functions in the network for collecting network service usage information and\/or throttling\/shaping traffic) and service control functions in the device (e.g., service processor , which, for example, monitors service usage in the device and\/or performs throttling or traffic shaping in the device and\/or performs certain billing event recording and reporting functions that are aptly performed on the device).","In some embodiments, lower level service policy implementation embodiments are combined with a higher level set of service policy supervision functions to provide device assisted verifiable network access control, authentication and authorization services.","In some embodiments, device based access control services are extended and combined with other policy design techniques to create a simplified device activation process and connected user experience referred to herein as ambient activation. As similarly discussed above, ambient activation can be provided by setting access control to a fixed destination, verifying access with IPDRs, verifying access by setting a max data rate and triggering off in the network if it exceeds the max data rate, and\/or by various other techniques.","As shown in , service controller  includes a service history server . In some embodiments, the service history server  collects and records service usage or service activity reports from the Access Network AAA Server  and the Service Monitor Agent . For example, although service usage history from the network elements can in certain embodiments be less detailed than service history from the device, the service history from the network can provide a valuable source for verification of device service policy implementation, because, for example, it is extremely difficult for a device error or compromise event on the device to compromise the network based equipment and software. For example, service history reports from the device can include various service tracking information, as similarly described above. In some embodiments, the service history server  provides the service history on request to other servers and\/or one or more agents. In some embodiments, the service history server  provides the service usage history to the device service history . In some embodiments, for purposes of facilitating the activation tracking service functions (described below), the service history server  maintains a history of which networks the device has connected to. For example, this network activity summary can include a summary of the networks accessed, activity versus time per connection, and\/or traffic versus time per connection. As another example, this activity summary can further be analyzed or reported to estimate the type of service plan associated with the traffic activity for the purpose of bill sharing reconciliation.","As shown in , service controller  includes a policy management server . In some embodiments, the policy management server  transmits policies to the service processor  via the service control link . In some embodiments, the policy management server  manages policy settings on the device (e.g., various policy settings as described herein with respect to various embodiments) in accordance with a device service profile. In some embodiments, the policy management server  sets instantaneous policies on policy implementation agents (e.g., policy implementation agent ). For example, the policy management server  can issue policy settings, monitor service usage and, if necessary, modify policy settings. For example, in the case of a user who prefers for the network to manage their service usage costs, or in the case of any adaptive policy management needs, the policy management server  can maintain a relatively high frequency of communication with the device to collect traffic and\/or service measures and issue new policy settings. In this example, device monitored service measures and any user service policy preference changes are reported, periodically and\/or based on various triggers\/events\/requests, to the policy management server . In this example, user privacy settings generally require secure communication with the network (e.g., a secure service control link ), such as with the policy management server , to ensure that various aspects of user privacy are properly maintained during such configuration requests\/policy settings transmitted over the network. For example, information can be compartmentalized to service policy management and not communicated to other databases used for CRM for maintaining user privacy.","In some embodiments, the policy management server  provides adaptive policy management on the device. For example, the policy management server  can issue policy settings and objectives and rely on the device based policy management (e.g., service processor ) for some or all of the policy adaptation. This approach can require less interaction with the device thereby reducing network chatter on service control link  for purposes of device policy management (e.g., network chatter is reduced relative to various server\/network based policy management approaches described above). This approach can also provide robust user privacy embodiments by allowing the user to configure the device policy for user privacy preferences\/settings so that, for example, sensitive information (e.g., geo-location data, website history) is not communicated to the network without the user's approval. In some embodiments, the policy management server  adjusts service policy based on time of day. In some embodiments, the policy management server  receives, requests or otherwise obtains a measure of network availability and adjusts traffic shaping policy and\/or other policy settings based on available network capacity.","In some embodiments, the policy management server  performs a service control algorithm to assist in managing overall network capacity or application QoS. In some embodiments, the policy management server  performs an algorithm to determine which access network is best to connect to, such as based on network capacity or application QoS, service usage costs, and\/or any other criteria. In some embodiments, the device is capable of connecting to more than one network, and accordingly, device service policies can be selected\/modified based on which network the device is connected to. In some embodiments, the network control plane servers detect a network connection change from a first network to a second network and initiate the service policy implementation established for the second network. In other embodiments, the device based adaptive policy control agent (e.g., policy control agent  described herein) detects network connection changes from the first network to the second network and implements the service policies established for the second network.","In some embodiments, when more than one access network is available, the network is chosen based on which network is most preferred according to a network preference list or according to the network that optimizes a network cost function. For example, the preference list can be pre-established by the service provider and\/or the user. For example, the network cost function can be based on a minimum service cost, maximum network performance, determining whether or not the user or device has access to the network, maximizing service provider connection benefit, reducing connections to alternative paid service providers, and\/or a variety of other network preference criteria. In other embodiments, the device detects when one or more preferred networks are not available, implements a network selection function or intercepts other network selection functions, and offers a connection to the available service network that is highest on a preference list. For example, the preference list can be set by the service provider, the user and\/or the service subscriber.","As shown in , service controller  includes a network traffic analysis server . In some embodiments, the network traffic analysis server  collects\/receives service usage history for devices and\/or groups of devices and analyzes the service usage. In some embodiments, the network traffic analysis server  presents service usage statistics in various formats to identify improvements in network service quality and\/or service profitability. In other embodiments, the network traffic analysis server  estimates the service quality and\/or service usage for the network under variable settings on potential service policy. In other embodiments, the network traffic analysis server  identifies actual or potential service behaviors by one or more devices that are causing problems for overall network service quality or service cost.","As shown in , service controller  includes a beta test server . In some embodiments, the beta test server  publishes candidate service plan policy settings to one or more devices. In some embodiments, the beta test server  provides summary reports of network service usage or user feedback information for one or more candidate service plan policy settings. In some embodiments, the beta test server  provides a mechanism to compare the beta test results for different candidate service plan policy settings or select the optimum candidates for further policy settings optimization.","As shown in , service controller  includes a service download control server .

In some embodiments, the Access Network AAA server  provides the necessary access network AAA services (e.g., access control and authorization functions for the device access layer) to allow the devices onto the central provider access network and the service provider network. In some embodiments, another layer of access control is required for the device to gain access to other networks, such as the Internet, a corporate network and\/or a machine to machine network. This additional layer of access control can be implemented, for example, by the service processor  on the device. In some embodiments, the Access Network AAA server  also provides the ability to suspend service for a device and resume service for a device based on communications received from the service controller . In some embodiments, the Access Network AAA server  also provides the ability to direct routing for device traffic to a quarantine network or to restrict or limit network access when a device quarantine condition is invoked. In some embodiments, the Access Network AAA server  also records and reports device network service usage (e.g., device network service usage can be reported to device service history ).","As shown in , the device service history  is in network communication with the access network . In some embodiments, the device service history  provides service usage data records used for various purposes in various embodiments. In some embodiments, the device service history  is used to assist in verifying service policy implementation. In some embodiments, the device service history  is used to verify service monitoring. In some embodiments, the device service history  is used to verify billing records and\/or billing policy implementation. In some embodiments, the device service history  is used to synchronize and\/or verify the local service usage counter.","As shown in , the central provider billing server  is in network communication with the access network . In some embodiments, the central provider billing server  provides a mediation function for central provider billing events. For example, the central provider billing server  can accept service plan changes. In some embodiments, the central provider billing server  provides updates on device service usage, service plan limits and\/or service policies. In some embodiments, the central provider billing server  collects billing events, formulates bills, bills service users, provides certain billing event data and service plan information to the service controller  and\/or device .","Network Selection and Notification","In some embodiments, a mobile device  is capable of connecting to more than one network and device service policies are potentially changed based on which network the device is connected to at the time. In some embodiments, the network control plane servers detect a network connection change and initiate the service policy implementation established for the second network. In some embodiments, the device based adaptive policy control agent, as described herein (e.g., policy control agent  illustrated in ), detects network connection changes and implements the service policies established for the second network.","In some embodiments, when more than one access network is available, the network is chosen based on which network is most preferred according to a network preference list or according to which network that optimizes a network cost function. For example, the network preference list can be pre-established by the service provider and\/or the user and\/or later modified\/adjusted by either the service provider and\/or the user. For example, the cost function can be based on determining a minimum service cost, maximum network performance, whether or not the user or device has access to the network, maximizing service provider connection benefit, reducing connections to alternative paid service providers, and\/or any other cost related criteria for network selection purposes.","In some embodiments, the mobile device  detects when one or more preferred networks are not available, implements a network selection function or intercepts other network selection functions, and offers a connection to the available service network that is highest on a preference list. For example, the preference list can be set by the service provider, the user and\/or the service subscriber. In some embodiments, a notification is provided to the device\/user when the device is not connected to a network (e.g., indicating in a pop-up\/bubble or other UI based display a notification, such as \u201cYou are not connected to the network.

For example, the compatible transaction server can then send a signed confirmation request over a pre-assigned control socket channel to the billing agent  with the billing agent  confirming the signed confirmation request by either performing the signature check locally based on a stored and synchronized list of approved transaction servers or by passing the signed request onto a billing server  for confirmation. Optionally, in another example, a triangle confirmation can be set up in which the billing server  can confirm the transaction set up with the transaction server  or the transaction server  can confirm the transaction set up with the billing server . Once the device confirms the compatible and approved status of the transaction server , the device\/transaction server pair can then optionally further exchange keys for the remainder of the transaction for enhanced security. In another example, the transaction server  can also redirect the user browsing experience to one tailored to one or more of device type, service provider, device manufacturer or user. When the user selects a transaction, the transaction server sends the billing agent  a transaction bill that describes the transaction and the amount. The billing agent  can optionally confirm that the user account has sufficient credit limit to make the purchase by either confirming the stored credit limit on the device or querying the billing server . The billing agent  then invokes the device UI  to display the transaction description and amount and request user approval for the billing to be conducted through the central billing option. User approval can be acquired, for example, by a simple click operation or require a secure password, key and\/or biometric response from the user. Upon user approval, the billing agent  generates a billing approval and sends it to the transaction server , the transaction server  completes the transaction and then sends a bill to the billing agent . The billing agent  optionally sends a confirmation to the transaction server  and sends the bill to the billing server . Again, optionally a triangle confirmation can be formed by the billing server sending a confirmation to the transaction server , or the transaction server  can send the bill to the billing server .

The transaction server  establishes API contact with the device mobile agent , which then confirms contact and good standing for transactional purchases from the device. The transaction server  provides an offer to the device application . The device application  selects a purchase (e.g., based on the user's selection input). The transaction server  notifies the device mobile payment agent  of the purchase description and amount, and the device mobile payment agent  then requests user purchase confirmation. The purchase is confirmed by the device application  (e.g., based on the user's acknowledgement as similarly described above with respect to  and the device mobile payment agent  then transmits a purchase confirmation to the transaction server .

The transaction server also optionally sends a confirmation of the purchase bill to the device billing server for a triangle confirmation, as similarly described above with respect to . The device billing server sends the purchase bill to the central provider billing system (e.g., central provider billing system ). In some embodiments, the communications described above with respect to  with the billing server and the central provider billing system are with the alternate location billing server  and\/or alternate location central provider billing system  via the Internet . Similarly, in some embodiments, the transaction servers  are connected to the Internet .","Accordingly, these transaction billing embodiments do not require centralized content storage or content and transaction exchange infrastructure. For example, the transactions can be conducted over the Internet, and the user experience and content can be tailored versions of the transaction server\/content provider's normal experience and content. This approach provides for a much wider array of content and transaction partners with minimal or no need to accommodate proprietary specialized systems. Moreover, the compatibility between the device billing agent transaction system and the transaction provider server is easily established, for example, by writing specifications for the header information transmitted by the device and for the secure handshake and signed message transactions that take place between the device billing agent, the transaction server and optionally the transaction server and the billing server. Once a transaction partner shows compatibility test results and concludes a business relationship with the service provider, the service provider can place the transaction partner on the compatible and approved list and exchange security keys and\/or certificates. If a common user experience is desired by the service provider across multiple transaction partners, then the experience specifications for the browser redirects can also be specified in the compatibility specification and tested before the transaction partner gains approval.","User Interfaces",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0544","num":"0543"},"figref":"FIG. 56","b":["10200","100","10204","10208","10206","10204","10208","10204","100","100","10202","10204","10202","100","100","10204","101","100","100","10208","101"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0545","num":"0544"},"figref":"FIG. 57","b":["10210","10202","10204","10212","10202","10216","10212","10206","100","10206","10214","100"]},"Ambient Services","In some embodiments, improved and simplified processes for provisioning a device or user for service on a central provider network, an MVNO network or a virtual service provider (VSP) on the central provider network are provided. In some embodiments, provisioning includes one or more of the following: a process or result of assigning, programming, storing or embedding into the device and\/or network a set of credentials, or otherwise providing the credentials to the user; the credentials being at least in part carried on the device or with the user; and\/or at least a portion of or a counterpart to the credentials being stored or recognized by the network so that the various network elements responsible for admitting the device access to the appropriate service activities do so once the device or user service is active.","As an example, as discussed herein, the credentials can include one or more of the following: phone number, device identification number, MEID or similar mobile device identifier, hardware security device ID, security signature or other security credentials, device serial number, device identification and\/or credential information via security hardware such as a SIM, one or more IP addresses, one or more MAC addresses, any other network address identifier, embedded device descriptive information block (static or programmable), security key, security signature algorithms, passwords or other secure authorization information, service processor (or similar device client or agent software) identifier or settings or version, device type identifier, browser (e.g., http, https, WAP, other browser client) header information or similar identifier, browser token information or similar identifier, browser cookie information or similar identifier, embedded browser instructions, portal-client (e.g., interface or communication agent that connects to a network portal used at least in part for provisioning or activation for the device or by the user) header information or similar identifier, portal-client token information or similar identifier, portal-client cookie information or similar identifier, embedded portal-client instructions, service provider, OEM, master agent (service distributor), VSP, device service owner identifier, distributor or master agent, and\/or any information the network can use to authorize network admission, provision the device, provision the network, activate service, authorize, associate or enable the device with a provisioning sequence, associate or enable the device with one or more service profiles, associate or assist the device with an activation sequence, associate or enable the device with an ambient profile or service experience, associate or enable the device with one or more service plans or service capabilities, associate the device with a service provider or service owner, associate the device with an OEM or master agent, associate the device with a distributor or master agent, or associate the device with a device group, user group or user.","In some embodiments, provisioning includes assigning, programming or embedding into the device and\/or network the information to define the level of service activity, referred to as a service profile, that the device is authorized to receive. In some embodiments, provisioning also includes establishing the device settings and\/or network settings to define an ambient activation experience in which the device user receives a set of services after (e.g., within a short period of time after) purchasing or otherwise obtaining or installing the device whether the device has or has not been registered and activated with the device user or device owner.","In some embodiments, ambient services or adaptive ambient services for a device (e.g., any type of device capable of communicating with a wireless network, including an intermediate networking device) or use of a service on a wireless network are provided. In some embodiments, the ambient experience is the user experience that is available at the time the device is sold in the event the user has not yet signed up for a service plan, or the device is not sold with a prepaid service plan or other required service plan. In some embodiments, an ambient service generally refers to a set of application access, network destinations, sources, and\/or traffic control rules to enable an ambient service experience, and, in some embodiments, also includes a set of billing rules to keep an accounting of service usage for different service usages (e.g., various bill by account rules or service usage accounts). For example, the ambient experience is defined by an ambient service profile, an ambient service plan, the other service usage activity control policies, and\/or the ambient service or ambient experience bill-by-account usage accounting and\/or billing policies in effect in the network, on the device, on an intermediate networking device, or any combination thereof. For example, if the device service processor (e.g., on the device, the intermediate networking device, or both) is used in large part to define the ambient service profile, then the initial provisioning and activation settings in the service processor, and possibly the service controller, can define the user service upgrade offering choices, network destination access control possibilities, traffic control policies, mobile commerce transaction capabilities (e.g., which transaction websites, WAP sites or portals the user can access to purchase information, content, music, games and\/or eBooks), possibly free news or weather or other modest bandwidth Internet services that are provided free of charge to entice the user into using\/upgrading the service or using the transactions or viewing advertisements, what advertisements are displayed to the user or what advertisement based websites the user is exposed to, certain applications may have access while others are blocked (e.g., Internet based text services have access but email downloads do not), or other example service capabilities. Examples of the type of useful services that can be enabled with the ambient service techniques disclosed herein include the following embodiments. In some embodiments, a content purchasing service (e.g., books, news, magazines, music, video, games, and mobile applications) is facilitated in which the device access is partially, largely, or entirely limited to the device or network based applications, source\/destination addresses, and\/or content transfers required to properly implement the service, in which other applications, source\/destination addresses and\/or content types are partly, largely, or entirely blocked. In some embodiments, such ambient services can have service usage monitoring and accounting that is reported for one or more individual ambient services. For example, the service usage for a book storefront browsing and download service can be separately accounted for while other services such as a general Internet shopping or auction service, a music service, a picture upload and store\/print service, a search and\/or advertisement service can also each have individual service usage accounting, or in some cases, groups of services can have aggregate service usage accounting. In some embodiments, an ambient service is provided for the device prior to the time a user has paid for permanent or full time access services, which, for example, can include a service selection platform for allowing the device user to access certain limited network functions and\/or resources, and to access those network resources necessary to choose a pay-for-service plan option. In some embodiments, the individual and\/or group ambient service usage accounting can be transformed into one or more billing records in which the service usage for each ambient service is billed to an entity, which can be the business entity that provides the ambient service experience and\/or transaction platform, or the end user, or the central service provider, or an MVNO service provider, or a distribution partner, or an OEM, or another entity interested in paying for one or more ambient services.","It will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that allowing all of these services, and blocking other ambient user service attempts (e.g., unpaid large file size Internet downloads or uploads or movie viewing or other access that would consume bandwidth and cause the ambient service to be a potential source of losses for the service provider) is made possible by the service profile control capabilities of the service processor and\/or the service controller. The bill by account embodiments, as discussed herein, in which each service activity can, for example, be separately tracked with the service monitor and other agents and server functions to produce a billing offset that allows categorization and mediation of different billing entities (accounts) provides the capability for the service provider to individually account for the costs of each ambient service element. This allows business models wherein the free access to the end user is paid for or partially paid for by one or more service provider partners who are billed for service access using the bill by account capabilities (e.g., the transaction partners pay for user access to their transaction experience and perhaps pay a revenue share for transaction billing, the advertising sponsored website partners pay for their access service share).","While the service control capabilities of the service processor and the bill by account service cost sharing and transaction revenue sharing in some cases can create a profitable ambient business model, in other cases, the ambient services can be a potential source of losses for the service provider. Accordingly, in some embodiments, the ambient service capabilities can be modified over time to reduce service cost to the service provider or VSP based on a variety of decision factors. For example, the user can have one level of traffic control for a period of time, and if the user has not signed up for service by the end of the period or if the user is no longer in good standing (e.g., based on various service usage criteria) for use of the service, the ambient service access is reduced (e.g., the transmission speed can be reduced or throttled, and\/or the total volume of data transmitted can be reduced or throttled, possibly additionally according to time of day parameters and\/or network busy state parameters) by changing the service control policy settings in the service processor, and the service level can be further reduced over time if the user continues to not sign up for service or the user does not create much transaction revenue. In some embodiments, this can limit or prevent users from \u201ccamping\u201d on free ambient services without generating any meaningful revenue to fund the service, or viewing any advertising to fund the service. In some embodiments, a user can be throttled in such a manner until the user executes a \u201cuseful activity\u201d or a \u201cpreferred activity\u201d (e.g., a purchase, viewing advertising, answering a questionnaire, signing up for a service, accepting a beta trial, and\/or earning valued customer points), and after a useful or preferred activity occurs, then the access capabilities of the device are increased. As another example, the recursive throttling algorithms discussed herein can be utilized to one or more of the service activities offered in ambient service mode so that the user experiences what full speed service is like, and if the user continues consuming appreciable bandwidth with the service activity, then the activity is throttled back to reduce costs until or unless the user selects a pay-for-service plan (or accumulates sufficient service access points as described herein). In these examples, the service processor or service controller can issue the user a notification explaining that their service is currently free so their usage is being throttled, and if they desire to receive better service, service plan upgrade offers can be delivered to the user interface (UI). In some embodiments, the level of access (e.g., ambient service bandwidth and\/or transfer limits, reachable addresses beyond the ambient service, and\/or bandwidth or transfer limits for open Internet usage and\/or email usage, text usage) is increased as the user increases the number of useful or preferred activities (e.g., the user accumulates \u201cservice access points,\u201d which are then spent on access activities). It will now be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that the various ambient service parameters including various provisioning and activation processes used to provide an ambient service, can also be managed by various virtual service provider (VSP) techniques. For example, this allows the same service controllers and service processor solutions to be used to define a wide range of ambient experiences for various device groups or user groups that are controlled by different VSPs.","Similarly, rather than controlling ambient service profile settings using the device assisted services functions and\/or VSP functions to control the service controller, service processor, provisioning and activation settings, various other embodiments call for the ambient service profile settings to be controlled by various network based service activity control equipment as similarly described herein and\/or by various intermediate networking devices. For example, depending on the level of service control and service monitoring sophistication (e.g., advanced DPI (Deep Packet Inspection), TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) session aware techniques, or other service aware techniques), some, much, most or all of the above described ambient services functionality can be implemented using network based service controls and various VSP management and control techniques. Similarly, in some embodiments, service processor, provisioning and activation settings, and the ambient service profile settings can also be (at least in part) controlled by various intermediate networking devices. In some embodiments, network equipment that can provide ambient service controls include, for example, service gateways, routers, charging functions, HLRs, home agents, proxy servers, and other network equipment as would be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art.","Whether the ambient service monitoring and control apparatus is implemented with device assisted service techniques, network based techniques, or a combination of both, various embodiments described herein provide for adaptive ambient service embodiments that address the dynamic (e.g., non-static) nature of Internet service access needs (e.g., allowable source\/destination and\/or application lists, blocked source\/destination and\/or application lists, traffic control policies for each source\/destination and\/or application).","Providing an ambient service profile for an ambient service can be complicated by the variable nature of network addresses and offered services such as, for example, the Internet. For example, a central service provider, MVNO provider or VSP may desire to provide ambient service access to a given web site partner's web service, in exchange for a business deal with the website partner that motivates the service provider to provide the ambient access. In this example, the ambient access is intended to enable access (either wide open or throttled) to the website partner's collection of URLs (and possibly one or more applications) associated with the service, while blocking or differentially throttling access to other network destinations and\/or applications not associated with the web site partner services. A problem can arise in this example whenever the website partner changes the addresses and\/or domains associated with the website services, because any static access list and access list policies generally makes a static list impractical. In such cases, the adaptive ambient service embodiments described herein provide a solution to these and other problems, whether the adaptive ambient access controls and\/or traffic controls are implemented with device assisted service apparatus, network based apparatus, or a combination of both.","As another example, an ambient service profile for a transaction service provider can include that service provider's domain or web site as an allowed destination. However, there are often inline advertisements provided by ad servers and\/or partner sites that should also be included in the set of allowed destinations in the ambient service profile, and these are often dynamic or frequently changing. As another example, an ambient service provider may not want to allow access to sites that typically involve relatively high data usage (e.g., streaming and\/or downloading of video content), while allowing other sites that result in less bandwidth intensive service usage activities. As another example, during a session a user may attempt to surf out of the ambient service, such as when the user attempts to access a website or service that is not an allowed or pre-approved destination in the ambient service profile (e.g., a search site can be the pre-approved ambient service, but the ambient service partner paying for the search service access may desire to also allow and pay for user click-through to search results and\/or advertising offers, or, for example, an ambient shopping service sponsor may desire to also pay for click-through to vendor partners sites to provide a purchase transaction opportunity to the user). Moreover, the defined ambient service profile quickly stagnates as various applications and destinations, for example, change over time or on each request\/usage (e.g., new applications become available and\/or web site content and link changes occur daily if not hourly and\/or are dynamically generated using well known web site techniques). Thus, what is needed are adaptive techniques for providing an adaptive ambient service.","Accordingly, in some embodiments, adaptive ambient services using an adaptive ambient service profile are provided. In some embodiments, a flexible and efficient adaptive ambient service control is provided by using an intelligent element in the network that performs one or more of the following functions: (1) beginning with an initial list of allowable ambient service device access behaviors (e.g., addresses\/URLs, applications and\/or content types, in some cases, with a set of traffic control policies that are differentiated as discussed above), (2) as the user accesses the ambient service, determine if the access behavior of the device is within or outside of the desired ambient service access and\/or traffic control policies (e.g., determine if the access behavior is properly associated with the desired ambient services and\/or service policies), (3) for those access behaviors that are within the desired ambient service policies, expand the list of allowable ambient service device access behaviors to include the new behaviors that are desired and\/or preferred (e.g., new sub-domains, advertising content sources, transaction partner addresses, and\/or desired surf-outs), (4) for those device access behaviors that are outside of the desired\/preferred ambient service policies (e.g., are not associated or beneficially associated with the desired\/preferred ambient service), expand the list of blocked or differentially throttled ambient service device access behaviors to include the new behaviors that are undesired or less desired (e.g., not preferred). In some embodiments, the intelligent network element used to adapt the ambient service control is included in one or more network equipment functions (e.g., service gateways, routers, charging gateways, HLRs, AAA, base station, service controller, and\/or other network equipment functions). In some embodiments the intelligent network element used to adapt the ambient service control is included in the device and\/or intermediate networking device service processor. In some embodiments, the intelligent network element used to adapt the ambient service control is included in a combination of the device (and\/or intermediate networking device) and one or more network equipment functions.","In some embodiments, a flexible and efficient adaptive ambient service is provided using a baseline (e.g., a basic starting point) of an adaptive ambient service profile that includes default or previously defined (e.g., by an ambient service provider, network provider, VSP, or another entity) allowable access list and disallowed access list for the ambient service, such as to various applications, destinations, sources, traffic control rules, and\/or bill by account rules or a combination thereof. In some embodiments, the ambient service profile is an automated and a self-evolving service profile using various techniques, such as those described herein.","In some embodiments, an adaptive ambient service includes providing an ambient service profile. In some embodiments, the ambient service profile includes ambient service allowed access rules and ambient service disallowed access rules. In some embodiments, the ambient service profile further includes ambient service monitored access rules, in which access to, for example, certain applications or destinations is allowed but is considered suspect or unknown, and thus, such access is monitored (e.g., until that application or destination is reclassified under an ambient service allowed access rule or ambient service disallowed access rule). In some embodiments, the ambient service allowed\/disallowed\/monitored access rules include IP addresses, domains (e.g., URLs for web sites), or any other unique network destination or application or source identifiers. In some embodiments, the ambient service rules provide differentiated traffic control rules. In some embodiments, the differentiated traffic control rules provide differentiated bandwidth and\/or total data transfer limits according to traffic control policy elements, such as activities associated with the main ambient service functions (e.g., the main partner website or a transaction service), activities associated with secondary ambient service functions (e.g., a secondary surf-out website or a less desired service activity), activities transferring different content types, activities associated with different applications, activities based on time of day, activities based on network busy state, activities that require higher or lower QOS (Quality Of Service), and\/or other activities.","In some embodiments, the ambient service allowed access rules and\/or ambient service disallowed access rules are pushed to (e.g., published, at predefined times, during low service usage times or periods of low service usage activities, or upon request) the device or the intermediate networking device (e.g., any type of networking device capable of communicating with a device and a network, including a wireless network, example intermediate networking devices include a femto cell, or any network communication device that translates the wireless data received from the device to a network, such as an access network) from the network (e.g., an element in the network that securely provides such data, such as a service controller for the ambient service). In some embodiments, the ambient service allowed access rules and\/or ambient service disallowed access rules are pulled by (e.g., at predefined times, during low service usage times or periods of low service usage activities, or upon request) the device or the intermediate networking device from the network (e.g., an element in the network that securely provides such data, such as a service controller for the ambient service).","In some embodiments, the device or intermediate networking device includes techniques for automatically adapting the service profile based on ambient service usage and thereby updates the ambient service allowed access rules, the ambient service monitored access rules, and\/or ambient service disallowed access rules locally. Device access activities that fall into the monitored access rules are those activities that are determined not to be disallowed (as of that point in time) and are allowed to take place while the intelligent adaptive service element tests the activities on the monitored access rules list to determine if they should be moved to the allowed access rules list, should be moved to the disallowed access rules list, or should remain on the monitored access rules list for further testing and\/or observation. In this way, a useful and friendly user experience can be maintained as the adaptive ambient service rules undergo \u201ctraining\u201d to accommodate dynamic changes to the ambient service sites\/applications. The device or intermediate networking device can then periodically provide the updated ambient service allowed access rules, ambient service monitored access rules, and\/or ambient service disallowed access rules with the network using various network communication techniques, such as those described herein. In some embodiments, the device periodically synchronizes its locally stored ambient service allowed access rules, ambient service monitored access rules, and\/or ambient service disallowed access rules with the network using various network communication techniques, such as those described herein. In some embodiments, the training for one or more of the three lists occurs on the device. In some embodiments, the training for one or more of the three lists occurs in the network. In some embodiments, the training for one or more of the three lists occurs partly on the device and partly in the network (e.g., depending, in some cases, on the device (such as the computing\/memory capacity of the device), network bandwidth, and\/or any other architecture criteria).","It will now be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that the various ambient service parameters, including the provisioning and activation processes used to create the ambient service activation, can also be managed by the VSP apparatus and processes described herein. For example, this allows the same service controllers and service processor solutions to be used to define a wide range of ambient experiences for various device groups or user groups that are controlled by different VSPs.","Similarly, rather than controlling the ambient service profile settings using the VSP functions to control the service controller, service processor, provisioning and activation settings, other embodiments call for the ambient service profile settings to be controlled by the network based service activity control equipment as similarly discussed herein. Depending on the level of service control and service monitoring sophistication (e.g., highly advanced DPI or service aware techniques), some, much, most or all of the above described ambient services functionality can be implemented using network based service controls and the VSP management and control embodiments described herein.","In some embodiments, an adaptive ambient service includes implementing an ambient service profile for assisting control of a communications device use of an ambient service on a wireless network, in which the ambient service profile includes various service policy settings, and in which the ambient service profile is associated with an ambient service plan that provides for initial access to the ambient service with limited service capabilities prior to activation of a new service plan; monitoring use of the ambient service based on the ambient service profile; and adapting the ambient service profile based on the monitored use of the ambient service. In some embodiments, these techniques are performed by the communications device (e.g., using a service processor), a network element\/function (e.g., using a service controller, proxy server, and\/or other network elements\/functions\/devices), and\/or an intermediate networking communications device and, in some embodiments in various combinations with each other and\/or with other functions\/elements on the network\/in communication with the network. In some embodiments, the service policy settings include one or more of the following: access control settings, traffic control settings, billing system settings, user notification with acknowledgement settings, user notification with synchronized service usage information, user privacy settings, user preference settings, authentication settings, admission control settings, application access settings, content access settings, transaction settings, and network or device management communication settings.","In some embodiments, the ambient service profile is implemented at least in part by a proxy server, in which the monitored use of the ambient service based on the ambient service profile is performed at least in part by the proxy server, and in which the proxy server communicates the ambient service traffic to the communications device. In some embodiments, the ambient service plan allows for access to the ambient service with limited service capabilities that are limited based on one or more of the following: period of time, network address, service type, content type, application type, QOS class, time of day, network capacity (e.g., network busy state), bandwidth, and data usage. In some embodiments, the ambient service plan is a low cost or free trial service plan that is bundled or provided as an option for purchase at a point of sale of the communications device. In some embodiments, the communications device is activated prior to a point of sale of the communications device, and the ambient service plan is associated with the communications device during activation. In some embodiments, the ambient service plan is associated with the communications device during one or more of the following: a manufacture of the communications device, a distribution of the communications device, or a point of sale of the communications device. In some embodiments, the ambient service plan includes an option to purchase a new service plan for the communications device, in which the new service plan includes additional service capabilities. In some embodiments, the ambient service profile is programmable by one or more of the following: a manufacturer, a service provider, a distributor, a virtual service provider, and a device manager.","In some embodiments, the ambient service is a transaction based service, in which service usage for the ambient service by the communications device is not billed, and in which electronic commerce based transactions performed using the communications device are billed as transaction based charges. In some embodiments, the ambient service is a transaction based service, in which electronic commerce based transactions performed using the communications device are billed as transaction based charges, and in which at least a portion of service usage costs are billed to one or more of the following: an advertiser, a transaction provider, a mobile virtual network operator, a virtual service provider, and an ambient service provider.","In some embodiments, the communications device is a mobile communications device or an intermediate networking device, and the ambient service includes one or more Internet based services. In some embodiments, the communications device is a mobile communications device, and the ambient service includes one or more Internet based services, and the mobile communications device includes one or more of the following: a mobile phone, a PDA, an eBook reader, a music device, an entertainment\/gaming device, a computer, laptop, a netbook, a tablet, and a home networking system. In some embodiments, the communications device includes a modem, and the processor is located in the modem.","In some embodiments, the various techniques for adaptive ambient services are performed (e.g., at least in part) on the device (e.g., device ) and\/or on an intermediate networking device (e.g., using a service processor  and an ambient service profile). For example, the various techniques for adaptive ambient services can be performed on a processor of the device, and the ambient service profile can be securely stored locally on the device using various techniques for secure execution and storage.","In some embodiments, the various techniques for adaptive ambient services are performed on the device or on the intermediate networking device with assistance or verification from the network (e.g., a service controller  executed on any network element, in which the service controller  is in secure communication with the device\/intermediate networking device, including the service processor  executed on the device\/intermediate networking device). In some embodiments, adaptive ambient services are performed on the device or on the intermediate networking device with assistance or verification from the network (e.g., using a service controller for maintaining a centralized set of ambient service allowed access rules and\/or ambient service disallowed access rules, and a superset of all ambient service monitored access rules, working cross device population). In some embodiments, the service controller  or other network element(s) assist the device for implementing these techniques for adaptive ambient services (e.g., cross device, cross URL\/domain usage patterns\/monitoring, publishing centralized set of ambient service allowed access rules, ambient service monitored access rules, and\/or ambient service disallowed access rules, including, for example, compromised and\/or hacked URLs). In some embodiments, the service controller  or other network element(s) assist the device for implementing these techniques for adaptive ambient services by verifying the device maintained set of ambient service allowed access rules, ambient service monitored access rules, and\/or ambient service disallowed access rules. In some embodiments, the service controller  or other network element(s) assist the device for implementing these techniques for adaptive ambient services by verifying the device monitored service usage with CDR service usage using various techniques, for example, such as those described herein. In some embodiments, the service controller  or other network element(s) assist the device for implementing these techniques for adaptive ambient services by verifying the device monitored service usage by IP address (e.g., using CDR by traffic destination).","In some embodiments the various techniques for adaptive ambient services are performed on the network (e.g., a gateway, router or any other network element using, for example, deep packet inspection (DPI) on the monitored (non-encrypted) network traffic).","In some embodiments, a device is suspended based on inactivity, or the device is placed in a suspended service state or suspended account state, so that the network does not get bogged down with a significant number of devices and credentials that are inactive. For example, this can also result in a portion of the device credentials being assigned back to an available pool rather than reserved for that particular device (e.g., phone numbers if phone numbers are scarce). The device account and\/or activation state can be re-activated when the device comes back online. For example, the suspend state can be a simple suspension of services without changing the account status, in which case the re-activation process can be automatically completed as a subset or entire set of the activation sequence that occurs when the device is initially used as described herein. The suspend state can also involve changing the account status to inactive, in which case the re-activation process can automatically reconfigure the account status back to an active state when the device re-accesses the network. For example, the suspend state can involve de-assigning or possibly re-claiming a portion of the device credentials. If a portion of the credentials is de-assigned, then when the device re-accesses the network credentials can be automatically re-assigned as described in various embodiments described herein.","Provisioning and Activation","In some embodiments, automated provisioning and activation includes automation of one or more of the following functions: (1) programming device credentials or partial credentials and recording them in a database (or providing same when they are programmed into the device), (2) associating these credentials with the proper provisioning and\/or activation actions to be taken on the device and in the network, (3) directing the device to the proper activation function (e.g., activation server) sequence when it attempts to connect to the network, (4) completing provisioning of the device, (5) programming the AAA, billing system, gateways, mobile wireless center and other network equipment to the proper initial device service control settings, and (6) establishing a service account for the device.","In some embodiments, improved processes for activating service for a device or user with a network service provided by a central provider network, an MVNO network or a VSP on the central provider network are provided. In some embodiments, activation includes one or more of the following: a process or result of associating a service account with device or user credentials; with the service account potentially further being associated with a service profile defining the service activities that the device is authorized to access; creating or updating a service usage or billing record and associating it with the service account to create a service plan; and\/or initiating service to the device or user in which the network equipment allows access to the appropriate level of service activities. In some embodiments, VSP embodiments include the provisioning and activation apparatus embodiments of any or all forms.","In conventional mobile device provisioning systems, the provisioning and activation process required to create a user service account and enable the device to access the desired level of service activities can limit mass market, low cost or user friendly applications of the device or service, because the process can often be cumbersome, time consuming and\/or expensive for the service provider, service owner, master agent (service distributor), MVNO, VSP and\/or user. Accordingly, the various embodiments for provisioning and activation described herein simplify the provisioning and activation process for mobile devices. In some embodiments, provisioning and activation for the device and\/or the network accommodates a wide variety of device types and service profile types, with the capability to perform the provisioning and activation at a number of points in the manufacturing, distribution, sales and usage progression for the device, and the ability to either pre-activate before first device use or very quickly activate during first device use (or during some later use of the device).","In some embodiments, as described herein, the term provisioning generally refers to those actions\/processes associated with programming the device with credentials or other device settings or software installations used to later activate the device, as well as, in some embodiments, creating database entries and other credential associations in the network so that the network and\/or device have the information used to recognize the device or credentials and implement the service policies in the service profile and\/or service plan once the service profile and\/or service plan are activated. In some embodiments, as described herein, the term activation generally refers to the process of creating or selecting the service plan and\/or service profile, programming the settings that are used in each (e.g., required) network function and\/or each (e.g., required) device function so that the system can properly associate the device credentials with the appropriate service activity policies, and then admitting the device onto the network. The term activation can also refer in some embodiments to the creation of a user or device service account, in some cases, with user or device owner information or billing information. In some embodiments, the process of provisioning amounts to assigning credentials to the device and programming a portion or all of the credentials on the device, entering a portion or all of the credentials in the various necessary network equipment databases so that the network components are capable of identifying the device and associating it with the network based portion of the admission, traffic processing, service monitoring, billing, service limits and other policies that are eventually defined by the service profile and service plan.","Further examples of the network based service profile policies include network access level, traffic routing, service monitoring, service limits and actions taken upon reaching service limits. Once the service profile is created and activated during the activation process, the device credentials and the associated service profile are communicated throughout the necessary network elements so that each element can implement its part of the network portion of the service profile policies. This process of propagating the service profile settings to all the required network equipment components is a portion of what is referred to herein as activation in accordance with some embodiments. In some embodiments, the activation process includes associating the credentials with the proper service plan and\/or service profile, and possibly completing the process of programming the device functions and\/or network functions so that the device can be admitted to the appropriate level of network services. In some embodiments, activation also includes the service processor software settings, configurations or installs for each function or agent in the service processor to implement its part of the service profile, service plan, service billing or transaction billing policies. In some embodiments, activation also includes the creation of entries in the various service account databases and\/or billing databases to create a user account or device owner account for the purpose of managing the user choices for service plan and other account information storage and management aspects, such as maintaining status information, maintaining the central service profile configuration, conducting reconciliation and billing exchanges, service usage history, and\/or account history.","In some embodiments, the term credentials generally refers to the set of information parameters that the network and\/or device uses (e.g., requires) to admit the device onto the network and associate it with the appropriate service profile and\/or service plan. For example, the credentials can include one or more of the following: phone number, device identification number, MEID or similar mobile device identifier, hardware security device ID, security signature or other security credentials, device serial number, device identification and\/or credential information via security hardware such as a SIM, one or more IP addresses, one or more MAC addresses, any other network address identifier, embedded device descriptive information block (static or programmable), security key, security signature algorithms, passwords or other secure authorization information, service processor (or similar device client or agent software) identifier or settings or version, device type identifier, browser (e.g., http, https, WAP, other browser client) header information or similar identifier, browser token information or similar identifier, browser cookie information or similar identifier, embedded browser instructions, portal-client (e.g., interface or communication agent that connects to a network portal used at least in part for provisioning or activation for the device or by the user) header information or similar identifier, portal-client token information or similar identifier, portal-client cookie information or similar identifier, embedded portal-client instructions, service provider, OEM, master agent (service distributor), VSP, device service owner identifier, distributor or master agent, and\/or any information the network can use to authorize network admission, provision the device, provision the network, activate service, authorize, associate or enable the device with a provisioning sequence, associate or enable the device with one or more service profiles, associate or assist the device with an activation sequence, associate or enable the device with an ambient profile or service experience, associate or enable the device with one or more service plans or service capabilities, associate the device with a service provider or service owner, associate the device with an OEM or master agent, associate the device with a distributor or master agent, or associate the device with a device group, user group or user. In some embodiments, at least some of the credentials are unique to the device, and, in some embodiments, groups of devices share one or more aspects of the credentials. In some embodiments, the term permanent credentials generally refers to the set of credentials that includes at least a subset that are intended to be assigned to a device or user on a permanent basis. In some embodiments, the term temporary credentials generally refers to the set of credentials that includes at least a subset that are intended to be assigned to a device or user on a temporary basis. In some embodiments, temporary credentials are eventually replaced by permanent credentials. In some embodiments, at least some elements in the temporary credentials (e.g., phone number and\/or access or authorization security credential) are used for more than one device. In some embodiments, the temporary credentials are recycled from one or more devices and used for one or more other devices, for example, when they remain unused for a period of time or when they are replaced with permanent credentials on one or more devices. It should not be inferred from the term permanent credentials that permanent credentials are never recycled, for example, when the user discontinues service or use of the credentials. Also, the term temporary credentials does not imply that temporary credentials are always temporary. In some embodiments, partial credentials or pre-activation credentials generally refer to a subset of credentials that are to gain access to limited network services for the purpose of provisioning of credentials and\/or activation of a service plan or service profile. For example, prior to a phone number being assigned, a device can gain access to a limited set of network server destinations in which embedded information contained in the device (e.g., the partial credentials) is provided to the server, the server associates that information with the proper additional credentials (including the phone number) to assign to the device and\/or associates the information with the proper service profile to activate service. In this example, partial credentials can include device type, OEM, service provider, VSP, device identification number, SIM, service processor configuration or some other information used by the server to determine what the credentials should be and the proper service profile.","In some embodiments, a permanent service account generally refers to the service account that is permanently associated with the user and\/or device. For example, this account includes an association with the device or user credentials, user information or billing information, service profile, billing profile, network authorization status and other aspects that define the device or user service policies and billing policies. In some embodiments, the term temporary service account generally refers to a service account that is temporarily set up and associated with the device before some or all of the required permanent account information is available or entered for a device or user. For example, this account can be set up with an association with an actual user, or can be set up with a mock user or unassigned user association so that the network and billing system can recognize the credentials, authenticate the device, admit the device, provide the proper level of service activity control according to the service profile associated with the temporary service account, or collect the service activity usage information for various network and billing system accounting needs before actual user information or billing information has been entered into the network systems. For example, a temporary service account can make it possible or easier to use existing billing systems or other network systems to provide simplified provisioning, simplified activation or ambient services. A temporary service account can also become a permanent service account by replacing mock user or unassigned user information with actual user information, or a temporary service account may need to be replaced by a permanent service account when actual user information needs to be entered into the network systems, possibly including the billing or service profile databases.","In some embodiments, temporary or permanent device credentials and other information used\/required for provisioning the device are generated with apparatus located at the manufacturer or in the distribution channel as discussed below. In some embodiments, the apparatus includes a local onsite server that typically shares some aspects of the provisioning information (e.g., phone number, phone number range, MEID or MEID range, SIM number or SIM number range, IP address or IP address range, MAC address or MAC address range, other secure device credential elements) with a network provisioning database. In some embodiments, the apparatus includes a server terminal, and the aforementioned portion of the credentials is generated by the network and shared with the local provisioning apparatus. In some embodiments, as will be discussed below, the provisioning credentials are in part generated in the network and shared with the device while it is connected online to an activation server (e.g., activation server ) that is connected to the access network. Similarly, there can be activation servers connected to apparatus in the manufacturing or distribution channel that service device activation, or over the air or over the network apparatus connected to an activation server, which in turn connects to the device, can be used to accomplish activation programming of the network and device as further discussed below.","In some embodiments, when a device is provisioned and entered into the network provisioning database, it is associated with the automatic provisioning and\/or activation sequence the device is intended to go through once it connects to the network or to the apparatus that will complete the process. In some embodiments, one or more device parameters (e.g., service owner, device type, OEM, plan type, IP address, security credential and\/or software version) are used to determine what the appropriate network provisioning steps and\/or settings are for completing the provisioning and\/or activation process, and this association information is stored in the network provisioning database for propagation of the provisioning profiles or activation profiles to the various network equipment elements. In some embodiments, the network provisioning database is provided (e.g., in the network) that associates the pre-activation provisioning information (e.g., generated, as described herein, at time of manufacture, sometime during distribution, by the user on a website by a sales associate or other activation assistant, or by the network when a new device enters the automatic activation process). For example, the pre-activation provisioning information informs the network whether or not to let the device onto an activation sequence when the device attempts access, and in some cases, also instructs the network to direct the device to a specific activation sequence including, for example, an activation server (or other activation sequencing apparatus) sequence as described herein. In some embodiments, a central database is queried by other network equipment or the central database is included in one or more of the network elements (e.g., the AAA server and\/or billing system, mobile wireless center ), or the database is copied in part or in whole in various network elements (e.g., the central database, AAA server, mobile wireless center, billing system and\/or gateways).","In some embodiments, propagating the network equipment provisioning information for a given device or group of devices is accomplished with a network provisioning system that has access to the network provisioning database and is capable of programming the appropriate network equipment. In some embodiments, this network equipment is referred to as \u201cnetwork management\u201d equipment or \u201cnetwork provisioning\u201d equipment. In some embodiments, there are several functions that take part individually or in concert, including, for example, the AAA server , service controller  (either with device based\/assisted services through the service processor related embodiments or with network only embodiments as described herein), the mobile wireless center  (e.g., including the home location register (HLR) or other similar function referred to by other industry terms), the activation server(s) , other network provisioning or management equipment attached to or associated with the billing database system, and\/or some other equipment apparatus. In some embodiments, the local database on the device, database in the AAA server and\/or database elsewhere in network is provisioned to inform the gateway of the process for handling the pre-provisioned device according to, for example, the credentials. For example, if the device is not recognized or not authenticated onto the access network as an activated device with associated active service profile and\/or service plan, the device connection or communication can be directed (or routed) to a generic activation server that provides an activation sequence that is not necessarily determined by one or more of the specific device credential elements, partial credential elements, device profile or partial device profile that define something specific about the activation sequence for the device. In another example, in which the device is not recognized or authenticated as an activated device with associated service profile and\/or service plan, the device can be directed (or routed) to an activation service (or other activation sequencing apparatus) that uses some part of the credentials or range of partial credentials or a portion of a partial or complete device profile to determine a desired pre-determined device specific or device group specific activation sequence that is implemented by a specific activation service sequence or other activation sequence apparatus. In another example, in which the device is not recognized or authenticated as an activated device with associated active service profile and\/or service plan, a portion of the device credentials or partial credentials can be used as a look-up index into a database that determines what the specific device activation sequence should be, and the device can be directed (or routed) to a specific activation server sequence or other activation sequencing apparatus.","In some embodiments, a database in the AAA server or database elsewhere in network is provisioned to inform the gateway what to do with a pre-provisioned device according to the credentials. For example, devices can be authenticated (for activated devices), routed to activation servers (or other activation sequencing apparatus) or denied access. In some embodiments, the AAA server (and\/or other network elements) provide the above discussed look-up function for the above gateway description in which a lookup database, locally stored or stored in a central database, is queried to provide secondary routing information to the specific or generic activation servers.","In some embodiments, the pre-provisioned database is located in the billing system. In some embodiments, the billing system accesses the pre-provisioned database (e.g., stored on the billing system or another network element) for the purpose of setting up temporary accounts or permanent accounts and associating those accounts with pre-activation status, activated free ambient or activated paying customer.","In some embodiments, for zero activation, all the required pre-provisioning or programming of the above network elements, or others, is coordinated by the network provisioning system at some point after the partial or full device credentials have been associated with the device or reserved for a particular device type or service type. In some embodiments, the network provisioning system also coordinates the information to or from the device provisioning apparatus that is described elsewhere.","In view of the various embodiments described herein, it will be appreciated that many of the automated or background provisioning, activation and ambient embodiments described herein can be accomplished with network based approaches, device based approaches, or network\/device combination\/hybrid based approaches. For example, when the access control for the provisioning process is accomplished in the device (e.g., a device based approach), the activation server can be located anywhere on the Internet, and the device will ensure that the activation process is conducted with the activation server while blocking other traffic from occurring. As another example, some or all of the ambient provisioning programming steps become steps to program the access control, traffic control, application control, bill by account rules, and\/or other aspects in the service processor or service controller as described herein.","In some embodiments, the provisioning apparatus described herein can be a computer located in the user's home or business, and the user or an IT manager has access to a website that provides the provisioning information, in which the computer serves as the provisioning or software programming apparatus. In some embodiments, the network itself, possibly through an activation server , website or other interface to the device, becomes the provisioning apparatus, in some cases, with the assistance of software on the device to affect the programming of provisioning information from the network or the communication of device credentials or other information to the network. For example, this software can be a background process that runs without user interaction, a portal\/widget program, a web browser based program, a WAP browser based program, and\/or any other program that provides a counterpart function to the network functions effecting the provisioning (e.g., activation server). In some embodiments, the activation server either initiates a specific provisioning sequence if device software is present to assist or routes to a website for manual entry if there is no software present.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0586","num":"0585"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["6420","123","6225","410","1","420","1","6410","160","1660","6420","120","6420","6410","6410","110","6410","6420","6430"]},"In some embodiments, a device software loading and programming apparatus  provides software loading or device settings functions that form a portion or all of the provisioning or pre-provisioning device configuration, or form a portion or all of the device activation profile configuration, or form the device service owner, master agent or VSP device assignment or signature, and in some embodiments, using an activation tracking service (ATS) system. As discussed herein, the ATS monitors network connections and aspects of traffic that provide insight into which networks the device  is gaining access to, in some embodiments, for the purpose of ensuring that an OEM, master agent, device service owner or VSP is being compensated for devices that activate on a service provider network. In some embodiments, the ATS agent connects to a server counterpart that records and, in some embodiments, also analyzes the service or network connection information to make a determination of the type of access service the device is receiving and, in some cases, determine which networks the device is activated on. In some embodiments, the ATS is installed on the device in a manner that makes it difficult to tamper with or remove so that the entity that is intended to get credit for device service activation does get credit (e.g., the ATS agent can be loaded into secure memory, it can be installed with software that makes it difficult to de-install, it can be installed on the modem possibly in secure memory, it can be installed in the BIOS, it can be installed deep in the OS kernel, it can be installed with one or more additional device agents that monitor the ATS agent and alert a network function or re-install it if tampered with). The SIM inventory  is provided to illustrate that, in some embodiments, hardware elements (e.g., a SIM security module as shown) or hardware configurations are also installed or manipulated in device  and these operations and the recording of the resulting associations form a portion of the provisioning or pre-provisioning process.","In some embodiments, at the time the credentials or partial credentials are loaded, programmed, set, installed, read from the device or otherwise recorded, they are, in some cases, all associated together in a database that allows for later identification of the device and its appropriate provisioning and\/or activation process through such associations. For example, this can involve reading device parameters such as MEID, MAC address, device type, or other information that is associated with the information being loaded or configured on the device. As discussed herein, this credential configuration and association information is stored in the network equipment responsible using it to configure the network to activate the device in one of the various embodiments disclosed herein.","Some embodiments include tying some or all of the activation provisioning steps and information settings together into a database that defines a higher level activation profile for a group of users(\/devices), and a server is used to perform device and equipment programming for the devices in the group, including, for example, associating the following device information into the group definition: credentials, service owner or master agent, provisioning information and\/or activation profile. Some embodiments further provide for this device group information being distributed to the various network equipment components required to activate the devices as discussed elsewhere. In some embodiments, this programming and device group association is accomplished using the VSP workstation server . For example, a device can be manufactured and distributed in a manner that provides flexible assignment of the device to a group that is assigned to an activation profile or a service owner.","In some embodiments, multiple activation servers  are provided (as shown), which illustrates that there can be multiple device activation servers  each with a different device activation experience and potentially controlled by a different VSP, service owner, service provider, OEM or master agent. As discussed herein, there are several ways that a device  can be routed to the proper activation server  so that the device provisioning and activation process can be completed. In some embodiments, all devices that are not activated are re-directed (or routed) to an activation server that reads one or more parameters in the device credentials. The device credential information can be determined either through the device identification information associated with the access network connection itself (e.g., MEID, IP address, phone number, security credentials, or other credentials identified for a device that gains access with the network), or with the aid of the device in a pre-arranged query-response sequence. The device can then be re-directed (or routed) to the appropriate activation server for that device, device group, device service owner or VSP. In some embodiments, the same process described above can be accomplished with a single re-direction from a service gateway - or -, or another router enable network element. In some embodiments, the gateway or network element itself decodes the device credential information as described herein and performs the correct re-direct (or route) to the appropriate activation server  for that device. In some embodiments, the activation server  can be incorporated directly into the gateway - or -, the base station or other network component. In some embodiments, the activation server  can be incorporated into the service controller  or the service controller device control system .","In some embodiments, apparatus other than the activation server are used to facilitate provisioning of credentials or partial credentials, or activation, during manufacturing or device distribution, and, for example, these apparatus can augment, supplement, compliment or replace the activation server function. Such apparatus include, for example, device programming equipment (e.g., device credential provisioning apparatus , device software loading and programming apparatus  or SIM inventory ), equipment that is networked into a central provider, MVNO or VSP database (e.g., device credential, software and settings server ) to gain access to provisioning information or activation information that is programmed into a device or group of devices, or to place device credential or partial credential information in a network database for later recognition, or to receive or communicate security information such as certificates for devices or SIM modules that will later be used to complete provisioning or complete activation or gain access to a network. For example, these apparatus, or any other apparatus including the activation server, can be networked into a service provider network or device database, an MVNO network or device database or a VSP network or device database. In some embodiments, programming of the device credentials or other information associated with the service processor or device is provided, so that, for example, the device can be recognized by an activation server or similar network function at a later point in time so that provisioning or activation can be completed in an automated manner, potentially with reduced or no user involvement, that provides a provisioning or activation configuration that is in some way unique for the service provider or service provider partner, device type, user group, VSP, MVNO, master agent or other entity. In some embodiments, this programming is provided in a manner that is difficult to change without the proper authorization so that the device is properly associated with the proper \u201cservice owner\u201d or master agent (e.g., for the purpose of activation incentive payments). For example, as discussed herein, various approaches can be applied to the device credential or other settings or software provisioning so that the settings or software are secure or protected, or so that if the software is removed, replaced or modified it is reported or replace or restored. In some embodiments, VSP control of the provisioning, partial provisioning or activation of devices is provided during manufacture or at different points in the distribution channel. As discussed herein, some of these embodiments allow the central provider to offer to service partners (e.g., VSPs, MVNOs, master agents, and\/or OEMs) similar types of control for device activation experience design or device service assignment control (e.g., sometimes referred to as service provider device locking so that other service providers cannot provide primary access to the device) during the manufacturing or distribution process that are possible with devices manufactured and distributed for the central service provider.","In some embodiments, the device is provisioned before the user obtains the device with permanent credentials, temporary credentials or partial credentials. In this case, the necessary credential programming of the device occurs during manufacture, at some point in the device distribution, such as at a distribution depot or in a store, or at the point of sale or point of shipment. In some embodiments, provisioning of network information as discussed above is used, and the network information is provisioned at the same time, before or after the device information is provisioned. In some embodiments, the device provisioning information is programmed with dedicated apparatus that connects to the device either with wires or wirelessly. For example, the dedicated apparatus can be local to the location where the device is being provisioned, or it can be partially or entirely networked into a database or provisioning solution located elsewhere and operated by the central provider, a VSP, OEM or other entity. For example, the apparatus to program the network portions of the provisioning information can also be networked and the operators who set up the required network programming for a device or group of devices may be in the vicinity of the servers that host the provisioning and management tools or they may network into the servers. In some embodiments, provisioning system operators have full or partial control of any device provisioning equipment associated with the entity they work for (e.g., OEM, VSP or master agent) but only have remote access via secure terminal, secure website or other techniques to network into a central provider or VSP server farm in which they control or partially control the network portion of provisioning capabilities for that subset of devices that are assigned to the entity they work for with (e.g., OEM, VSP or master agent).","In some embodiments, provisioning is accomplished over the air on the mobile access network for mobile devices, or over the wired access network or WLAN connection for wired access networks, either before the user receives the device or after the user receives the device. In some cases, the device can be connected to general purpose equipment, such as a computer to perform the programming required to complete provisioning. In the cases in which the device is provisioned at point of sale or after point of sale, the device provisioning can be triggered by a user initiated sequence, or can be initiated by an automated background sequence at any time after the device is powered on. In such cases, in some embodiments, partial credentials that include information such as device type, OEM or service provider are used to assist in determining how to complete the provisioning, and the information can also include secure information, certificate or signature programmed into the partial credentials that is required for the network to perform the provisioning of the remaining credential information in the device and possibly the network. In some embodiments, any network information used\/required to provision the device or service is generated at the time the partial credentials are determined rather than beforehand.","In some embodiments, the device is activated for service before the user obtains the device with permanent credentials, temporary credentials or partial credentials, or with a permanent service account or a temporary service account. For example, in this case, the necessary steps of provisioning and activating service for the device can occur during manufacture, at some point in the device distribution, such as at a distribution depot or in a store, or at the point of sale or point of shipment. In some embodiments, the steps for activating service include one or more of the following: provision the device (e.g., with permanent, temporary or partial credentials), provision the necessary network databases and equipment to prepare them to recognize the device and associate it with the service profile and\/or service plan, create or select the service account (e.g., permanent or temporary service account), select or create the service profile and\/or service plan, program any elements in the device required to activate service (e.g., account ID, device aspects of the service profile and\/or service plan), and program the necessary network databases and equipment with the required associations of device credentials and service profile and\/or service plan policy settings. In some embodiments, the device oriented programming portions of the service activation steps occur at the same time, before or after the network oriented programming portions of the service activation steps.","In some embodiments, the device activation information is programmed with dedicated apparatus that connects to the device via a wireless or wire line connection. For example, the dedicated apparatus can be local to the location where the device is being provisioned, or the dedicated apparatus can be partially or entirely networked into a database or service activation solution located elsewhere and operated by the central provider, a VSP, OEM or other entity. For example, the apparatus to program the network portions of the activation information can also be networked and the operators who set up the required network programming for a device or group of devices can be in the vicinity of the servers that host the service activation and management tools or they can network into the servers. In some embodiments, activation server tools operators have full or partial control of any device activation apparatus associated with the entity they work for (e.g., OEM, VSP or master agent) but only have remote and partial access via secure terminal, secure website or other techniques to network into the network portion of the activation tools that are controlled by the central provider or VSP. The server tools operators can be restricted in some embodiments to providing network activation information or settings only for those devices or device groups that are assigned to the entity they work for with (e.g., OEM, VSP or master agent). For example, the device control group restriction can be accomplished with a secure database that has secure sub-partitions for one or more entities so that they cannot impact the control of one another's network activation settings but can control their own devices. In this way, a centralized set of activation tools resources controlled by a central provider, VSP or other entity can be partitioned so that different entities can have partial or full control of the activation service definition for devices or groups of devices without impact or risk to others who share the network and activation tools resources.","In some embodiments, activation is accomplished with an over the air interface to a mobile device, or over the wired access network or WLAN connection for wired access networks, either before the user receives the device or after the user receives the device. In some cases, the device can be connected to general purpose equipment such as a computer to perform the programming required to complete activation. In the cases in which the device is activated at point of sale or after point of sale, the final device activation process can be triggered by a user initiated sequence, or can be initiated by an automated background sequence at any time after the device is powered on. In such cases, some embodiments call for a temporary service account that is used to bring the device onto the network before the user has input the information necessary to create a permanent service account. In some embodiments, a temporary or permanent service account can be applied to the device at the time the device reaches the network, and the type of account, service profile and\/or service plan can be influenced (e.g., partially determined or informed) or determined by information embedded in the device credentials or partial credentials, such as device type, device ID, SIM, OEM or service provider. For example, the device credentials can also include secure information, certificate or signature that can be required by the network to perform the activation steps for temporary or permanent service account status. In some embodiments, in which the device is activated in this manner before the user information is available, or before the user has selected a pay for service plan, the service profile and service plan are set up for ambient services as described herein.","In some embodiments, the device is activated during the manufacturing or distribution process, and then the activated device status is suspended. Once the temporary or permanent service account is set up, with appropriate service profile and\/or service plan and temporary or permanent credentials, in some networks and billing systems the service can often be more easily resumed once suspended as compared to provisioning and activating the device from scratch. The device is then later resumed (or re-activated) when some event triggers the resume process, such as when it ships to the end user or when the end user attempts to use it. This process prevents the network from needing to manage credentials and accounts for devices that have been activated but are not yet on the network.","In some embodiments, provisioning is accomplished at least in part with temporary credentials in a manner that is automated and convenient for the user or device owner. In some embodiments, at least some subset of the temporary credential elements replaced at a later point in time by permanent credential elements in a manner that is also automated and convenient for the user or device owner. In some embodiments, the temporary credential set is pre-programmed into the device along with a temporary or permanent service account including service profile during the manufacturing or distribution process so that the device is activated with temporary credentials when it ships. In some embodiments, the aforementioned pre-programming is performed for the network via a secure set of server access equipment that networks into the network databases used to define the service profile and\/or the service plan. In some embodiments, a subset of the temporary credentials is recycled once it is replaced, if a temporary service account is not activated or used after some period of time, if a permanent account is not activated or used after some period of time, or if the credentials subset is revoked from the device for some other reason.","In some embodiments, more than one device is assigned one or more elements of the temporary credentials, such as the phone number, which may be limited in supply. In some embodiments, a network will accept more than one set of temporary credentials, one or more redundant elements, for two or more different devices. In some embodiments, a device that has two or more temporary credential sets, in which at least a subset of the credential elements are different for the sets, so that if one set of credentials has elements that are already being used to access the network, then one or more reserve sets can be drawn upon to gain access to the network.","In some embodiments, the temporary credentials are used to log onto the network to conduct an over the air or over the network activation process in which an activation server reads at least a portion the device credentials to determine some aspect of how the device service profile. In some embodiments, the aforementioned over the air activation process is accomplished in the background without user intervention. In some embodiments, the over the air activation process is initiated when the user first attempts to use the device or when the user first attempts to access the network or upon user request or approval. In some embodiments, the over the air activation process is initiated using a temporary service account for the device and\/or network to gain access to the network. In some embodiments, the over the air activation process is initiated after the user has entered the information required to create a permanent user account into the device or into the network. In some embodiments, the user is required to enter the aforementioned user information before using the device or using some aspect of the device. In some embodiments, the temporary service account is replaced by a permanent service account some time after the user has entered the necessary information to create a permanent account into the device or network. In some embodiments, the over the air activation process is initiated using a permanent service account assignment for the device and\/or network to gain access to the network.","In some embodiments, the service profile is assigned to the device and\/or network during the aforementioned over the air activation to be a pay for service profile with a free trial period. In some embodiments, the service profile assigned to the device and\/or network during the aforementioned over the air activation includes pre-pay, post-pay, session based pay or pay as you go options for service. As will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art, various embodiments disclosed herein are particularly well suited for control or pre-pay services. In some embodiments, the service profile that is assigned to the device and\/or network during the aforementioned over the air activation is an ambient service profile providing service access before all the user information is available to assign a permanent account. In some embodiments, the service profile that is assigned to the device and\/or network during the aforementioned activation is an ambient service profile providing a service upgrade selection option interface to the user. In some embodiments, the service profile that is assigned to the device and\/or network during the aforementioned activation is an ambient service profile providing transaction services to the user. In some embodiments, the service profile that is assigned to the device and\/or network during the aforementioned activation is an ambient service profile providing bill by account functionality for the network. In some embodiments, the service profile that is assigned to the device and\/or network during the aforementioned activation is an ambient service profile providing some amount of free networking or information service to entice the user to use the other ambient services. In some embodiments, the aforementioned ambient service is at least partially implemented with device based service activity control or control assistance. In some embodiments, the aforementioned ambient service is at least partially implemented by gateways, routers or switches in the network that are programmed according to the ambient access profile for the device to implement the ambient policies for network access control, routing control, traffic control or service monitoring and reporting for bill by account.","In some embodiments, activation is accomplished at least in part with a temporary service account in a manner that is automated and convenient for the user or device owner. In some embodiments, at least some subset of the temporary service account is replaced at a later point in time by permanent service account subset in a manner that is also automated and convenient for the user or device owner. In some embodiments, the temporary service account settings (e.g., including the service profile settings and\/or the service plan settings) are pre-programmed into the device along with a temporary or permanent credentials set during the manufacturing or distribution process so that the device is activated with temporary credentials when it ships. In some embodiments, the aforementioned pre-programming for the network is performed via a secure set of server access equipment that networks into the network databases used to define the service profile and\/or the service plan. In some embodiments, the device is suspended once it is activated but before the user is using it, and then resumed before or commensurate with the point in time that the user begins to use it. In some embodiments, some subset of the temporary service account is recycled once it is replaced, if the temporary service account is not used after some period of time, if the temporary service account is not upgraded to a permanent service account after some period of time, or if the activation is revoked from the device for some other reason. In some embodiments, more than one device is assigned to the same temporary service account. In some embodiments, a network accepts more than one device on the same temporary service account. In some embodiments, a device includes or is associated with two or more temporary service accounts, in which at least a subset of the temporary service account elements are different, so that if one account is already being used to access the network then one or more reserve accounts can be drawn upon to gain access to the network. In some embodiments, the temporary service account is associated with a temporary credentials set. In some embodiments, the temporary service account is associated with a permanent credentials set.","In some embodiments, un-activated devices are detected by the network routing equipment (e.g., service gateways or routers in hierarchical networks or base stations with embedded gateways in flat networks) and the device routing is programmed to re-direct un-activated devices to an activation server network destination. For example, the activation server can first inspect the information associated with the device to determine if the device belongs to the list of devices, device types or device groups that the network is programmed to provide access to. For example, the information used to determine this can include device type, service provider, phone number, device ID, SIM ID or configuration, secure information used to qualify the device, IP address, MAC address, user, user group, VSP, OEM, device distributor, service distributor (master agent), service processor presence or configuration, presence or configuration of other software or hardware. There can also be some activation definition information embedded in the credentials, or associated with some portion of the credentials, or programmed additionally on the device that informs the activation server as to the service profile and\/or service plan and\/or service account that should be established for the device. If activation information (the service profile, service plan and\/or service account information) is found through association with the device credentials (e.g., device ID, phone number, IP address, MAC address, SIM or other security credentials) rather than being read directly from information embedded in the device or device credentials, then the pertinent aspects of the credentials can be used as a cross reference to look up the service plan and\/or service profile information stored in a database networked to or within the activation server. The activation information can include information to define a wide variety of service plans and service profiles that when properly implemented on the network functions, and perhaps device if necessary, can provide for a wide range of service activity policies, service billing policies, transaction billing policies and service account types that can be associated with the device over the air or over the network.","In some embodiments, once the activation server has determined the activation information from the device or from a look up based on some aspect of the device credentials, then the activation server initiates the necessary network settings and billing database entries to be programmed by sending the service profile instructions to the network provisioning and activation apparatus and the service plan instructions to the billing system. In some embodiments, the activation server can then also send the any necessary service profile and\/or service plan settings required for the device to a provisioning and activation support software function on the device, such as various embodiments of the service processor, so that the device provisioning and activation can be completed. The provisioning can be with permanent credentials or temporary credentials, and the service account that is set up may be permanent or temporary. In some embodiments, the activation process described above is completed perhaps before the user has entered some or all of the user information necessary to set up a permanent service account, and, in these cases, a temporary service account can be set up. In some cases, the activation process can be completed in the background before the user has completed an attempt to access the network and the service profile can be set up to provide ambient services to a temporary service account. In some embodiments, the user is required to enter the information required to establish a permanent service account prior to gaining full use of the device, either on the device, on a computer or in the store, so that by the time the user begins using the device the above activation embodiments can provide for ambient services activation with permanent account status so that the user can purchase a service upgrade or any transaction without entering any more account information.","In some embodiments, a device status is changed from a temporary service account to a permanent service account. If the device is activated with a temporary service account, and the user information is available to set up a permanent account, then if the billing system rules and interfaces allow for such, the user information can be changed from the mock information to the actual user information while maintaining the same account identifiers in the billing system. If the billing system will not allow for such, then the user information can be used to establish a new account, the device credentials can be re-associated with the new account, in some cases, after modifying one or more of the device credential parameters, and the network functions can be re-programmed as required, and, in some cases, the device can be re-programmed as required to accommodate the new permanent account.","In some embodiments, code on the device pulls a temporary or permanent set of credentials. When the credentials are pulled, the network associates the device with an ambient service profile according to one or more of the following: embedded device information identifying device type, service owner (e.g., VSP), user group, or user, or device ID is cross referenced to a database that is populated some time from manufacturing time to post sale where the database provides information identifying device type, service owner (e.g., VSP), user group, or user. The device is then re-directed accordingly (e.g., for device based this is a matter of setting the policies or loading the software for the service processor, for the network based approach this is a matter of populating the routing tables and service profile). For example, credentials can be re-cycled after a period of time, and\/or some portion of the credentials can be redundant with other devices. For example, this is essentially a dynamic service for (temporarily) assigning device credentials, and the duration of the temporary credential validity for that device ID can be time limited to give the user time to activate a real account or a free trial, session limited, or a longer duration of time that is perhaps refreshed each time the device logs on. For example, the device could also already have permanent or temporary credentials but not have a service account. The above process can be used to assign a temporary or permanent service account as well. Once the service account is assigned and the appropriate service profile is propagated to the network elements, the device can then be directed to or use the appropriate activation profile service activities or the appropriate ambient service activities.","In some embodiments, the device is activated in the background in a manner that is virtually transparent to the user. For example, at some point in the distribution channel, the device is programmed to seek the activation server system described above as soon as it is turned on, or as soon as some other event occurs like the user using the device or the user attempting to gain access. When the pre-programmed event is triggered, the device connects to the network and the gateways or routers re-direct the device to an activation server, as discussed above. As also described herein, the activation server either derives information from the device that informs the server what service the device should be activated with, or the server derives that information from a database look up with a portion of the device credentials as the cross reference parameter. Once the activation server has determined the activation information from the device or from a look up based on some aspect of the device credentials, then the activation server causes all the necessary network settings and billing database entries to be configured\/programmed by sending the service profile instructions to the network provisioning and activation apparatus and the service plan instructions to the billing system. In some embodiments, the activation server can then also send the any necessary service profile and\/or service plan settings required for the device to a provisioning and activation support software function on the device, such as various embodiments of the service processor, so that the device provisioning and activation can be completed. For example, the provisioning can be with permanent credentials or temporary credentials, and the service account that is set up can be permanent or temporary.","In some embodiments, background activation is performed using the aforementioned activate\/suspend process. At some point in the distribution channel, the device is programmed to seek to resume service as soon as it is turned on, or as soon as some other event occurs like the user using the device or the user attempting to gain access. When the pre-programmed event is triggered, the device attempts to connect to the network and the gateways or routers re-direct the device to an activation server as described herein. As also described herein, the activation server either derives information from the device that informs the server that the device is ready to resume service, or the server derives that information from a database look up with a portion of the device credentials as the cross reference parameter. Once the server is aware of this information, it sends a message to resume service to the billing system, or other network function that controls the suspend\/resume function, and the service is resumed.","In some embodiments, background activation is performed as described below. The service processor and the credentials are pre-programmed during the manufacturing or distribution process to provide the desired service profile support and\/or billing profile support for the desired initial ambient service. As described herein, this programming can be accomplished with dedicated apparatus at the manufacturer or distribution depot. Furthermore, the party responsible for defining the service (e.g., typically the central provider, OEM, VSP, distributor or master agent) can network into the service processor programming apparatus to control service processor and\/or credential programming for all or a subset or group of the devices or device types locally available. The service processor enabled device is programmed to seek the activation server system described above as soon as it is turned on, or as soon as some other event occurs like the user using the device or the user attempting to gain access. In some embodiments, the activation server is the access control server previously discussed or the access control server can act in concert with another server that performs the activation function. When the pre-programmed event is triggered, the device connects to the network and the gateways or routers re-direct the device to the activation server. As also described herein, the activation server can communicate with the service processor to verify the service processor security credentials, agents and configuration.","In some embodiments, if the activation server determines that the pre-programmed settings stored in the service processor need to be modified to provide the latest version of the desired service, or if the service processor agent software needs to be updated, then this can be accomplished prior to completing the activation process. Once the service processor configuration and settings are confirmed, the activation server causes the necessary network settings and billing database entries to be programmed by sending the service profile instructions to the network provisioning and activation apparatus and the service plan instructions to the billing system. Given that the service processor can perform some or much of the service activity control or control assistance, the service control options are generally larger than without the service processor, and there can be less configuration to perform for other networking equipment to complete the provisioning and activation process. The provisioning can be with permanent credentials or temporary credentials, and the service account that is set up can be permanent or temporary.","In some embodiments, pre-programming and pre-activation of devices with temporary credentials and a temporary service account are used to ship devices that are pre-activated. Given that the credentials are temporary and can be recycled when the permanent credentials are assigned, concerns about using up too many pre-assigned credentials are reduced. In embodiments in which a portion of credentials elements can be used for multiple devices, this concern is further reduced. If there is a concern about too many activated devices being assigned that are not actually active and generating service revenue, then the suspend\/resume process discussed herein can be employed. In some embodiments, the temporary credentials and\/or temporary account can be replaced with permanent credentials and\/or account assignments at any time as follows. When a pre-programmed event in the device is triggered, then the device initiates a program that seeks the aforementioned activation server or another server that has the capability of fulfilling the device request to exchange the temporary credentials for permanent credentials and\/or exchange the temporary account for a permanent account. The event that triggers the credential exchange can be the same or different than the event that triggers the service account exchange. The service account exchange can typically be triggered by the point in time that the user enters account information.","In some embodiments, the aforementioned ambient service is partly implemented with a combination of the techniques for pre-provisioning during manufacturing or distribution and at least partially implementing the service activity control (e.g., access control, routing policy, traffic control, usage limits, and\/or policy for usage limit overage) required for implementing ambient using the service policy provisioning capabilities in the data path gateways, routers or switches in the network. The gateways, router or switches are pre-programmed as discussed herein according to the ambient access profile for the device to implement the ambient policies for network access control, routing control, traffic control or service monitoring and reporting for bill by account. In some embodiments, the provisioning credential elements are not all pre-programmed before the device ships, but a subset of the credential elements are programmed using the activation server technique discussed herein. This over the air automated provisioning is combined with the activation server reading the device credentials to derive the service activity control settings for the gateways, routers or switches that will result in the desired ambient services activity controls.","In some embodiments, the aforementioned ambient service is implemented with a combination of the techniques for pre-activation during manufacturing or distribution and at least partially implementing the service activity control (e.g., access control, routing policy, traffic control, usage limits, and\/or policy for usage limit overage) required for implementing ambient using the service policy control capabilities in the data path gateways, routers or switches in the network. The gateways, router or switches are programmed to recognize the pre-activated device credentials as discussed herein according to the ambient access profile for the device to implement the ambient policies for network access control, routing control, traffic control or service monitoring and reporting for bill by account. In some embodiments, the device activation profile and\/or service account are not pre-programmed in the network and\/or the device before the device ships but the activation profile and\/or service account are programmed using the activation server technique discussed herein. This over the air automated provisioning is combined with the activation server reading the device credentials to derive the service profile activity control settings for the gateways, routers or switches that results in the desired ambient services activity controls.","In some embodiment, a VSP capability is enabled by providing a secure network connection to the service policy settings tools that define the device pre-provisioning settings, the device pre-activation service profile settings, the network equipment service activity control policy settings (e.g., access control, routing policy, traffic control, usage limits, and\/or policy for usage limit overage), and the network billing system database. By providing server tools that enable all these settings to be controlled (or perhaps only observed in the case of the billing system) by a secure workstation or secure website interface that networks into the equipment that programs the settings, and providing for a secure partitioning of the devices that can be controlled by a given secure workstation or secure website interface, a central provider can provide VSP services to multiple entities who all have different device and service plan combinations that they desire different flavors of ambient services for. These techniques can also be extended beyond ambient to any device\/service profile\/service plan combo the VSP desires to create. In some embodiments, the networking equipment is implemented to secure device service group domains in which the service policies for a group of devices can be controlled. In some embodiments, the pre-provisioning and pre-activation techniques are substituted with the over the air activation server techniques discussed herein, and a secure device group partition capability is provided in the activation server as well so that the activation server device group partition control capabilities can be added to the secure device group partition control capabilities of the network gateways, routers and\/or switches, the device programming tools and the billing system to form a VSP partition solution for over the air activation of various device\/service plan combinations. In some embodiments, the device groups are relatively small so that beta trials of arbitrarily large or small size can be designed and implemented by defining a service control group as described above, and after fine tuning and perfecting the beta trial settings the device group can be expanded to publish the automated provisioning and activation service settings to a larger user or device group for production services.","In some embodiments, device based service activity control assistance (e.g., based on the various service processor embodiments described herein) is combined with simplified provisioning techniques described herein so that service processor enabled devices can be shipped with pre-provisioned credentials (temporary or permanent) or can obtain credentials in an automated manner that is convenient and efficient for the user or device owner. In some embodiments, the service processor embodiments in combination with the manufacturing and supply chain credentials and provisioning apparatus described elsewhere provide various approaches for provisioning pre-provisioned service processor enabled devices. In some embodiments, the service processor embodiments in combination with the activation server variants discussed above provide various approaches for over the air or over the network simplified post-sale provisioning for service processor enabled devices. For example, these embodiments can also be used for ambient services given that as discussed herein the service processor has capability to implement service profile policies for deep control of ambient service activity control.","In some embodiments, provisioning includes provisioning partial device credentials that include, for example, a secure certificate that is used to authorize full credential provisioning and\/or activation by performing a process for a later look-up\/validation of the full device credentials. For example, the look-up\/validation of the full device credentials can be performed by a gateway, router or similar network device that re-directs to a provisioning server and\/or activation server or other network components that either: (1) recognizes the partial credentials that serve as a reference to direct the device communication to a specific provisioning\/activation server determined from the partial credentials; or (2) does not recognize the partial credentials, and directs the device communication to a less specific provisioning\/activation server that is not necessarily associated with a reference to the partial credentials.","In some embodiments, if the partial device credentials (e.g., temporary or permanent credentials) are being used for provisioning, then the partial credentials are read (e.g., and\/or other credentials can be looked up based on the partial credentials as described above). The device is authorized if the proper credentials and\/or secure certificate is present. The device credential provisioning is then completed (e.g., using activation server commands or settings to a device based software and\/or hardware element), and the credentials are, in some cases, also communicated to the various network equipment elements.","In some embodiments, if the partial device credentials are being used for activation, then partial or full device credential provisioning is performed, such as described above. A service account (e.g., temporary or permanent service account) is created or looked up based on the partial device credentials (e.g., a user account associated with the device through embedded partial or full credentials or a look up process, or based on a dynamically created\/assigned temporary account associated with the device through embedded partial or full credentials). An initial service profile and, in some cases, an initial service plan (e.g., service control policy settings including a billing profile) are determined from embedded information and\/or using a look up process (e.g., based on the device type and\/or partial or full device credentials). The device is then programmed to enable access with the service profile and plan, and, in some cases, the various network components\/elements are programmed to enable the service profile and plan, and, in some cases, proper entries in the billing system are made or confirmed, and the device credentials are, thus, activated for service.","In some embodiments, the above described provisioning and\/or activation processes are performed with the provisioning server(s) and\/or activation server(s) in the background with reduced, minimal or no user input required, for example, after the device is sold to the user and the user turns on the device so that by the time the user attempts to access the service using the device, the provisioning and\/or activation process is already completed.","In some embodiments, device based service activity control assistance (e.g., based on the service processor embodiments) is combined with simplified activation techniques described herein so that service processor enabled devices can be shipped with pre-activated accounts (temporary or permanent), or can obtain activated account status in an automated manner that is convenient and efficient for the user or device owner. In some embodiments, the service processor embodiments in combination with the manufacturing and supply chain activation and provisioning apparatus described elsewhere provide various approaches for pre-activated service processor enabled devices. In some embodiments, the service processor embodiments in combination with the activation server variants discussed above provide various approaches for over the air or over the network simplified post-sale account activation for service processor enabled devices. These embodiments can also be used for ambient services given that as discussed herein the service processor has capability to implement service profile policies for deep control of ambient service activity control.","As discussed herein, in some embodiments for activation, the network AAA (or other network function) either recognizes one or more aspects of a pre-activated device credentials and routes the pre-activated device communication to an activation server that is appropriate for that device (routing information either derived through look up of the credential aspect or by obtaining the required information directly from the credential itself), or the AAA (or other network function) does not recognize the credentials and routes the device communication to an activation server for unrecognized device credentials. In either case, in some embodiments, one or more of the credential aspects can then be used to perform a secondary determination of what provisioning and\/or activation sequence to perform in association with the device, or which activation server sequence the device should be directed to. For example, one or more device credential aspects can be read and used as a cross-reference to determine a routing for the device communication (or the information required for routing can be in the device credential information itself) so that the device can be routed to the appropriate activation server sequence.","In some embodiments, an activation server sequence can be determined at least in part by using a browser server or a portal (e.g., http server, https server, WAP server or another standard or custom protocol server for a browser, embedded or automated browser or a portal client in the device). In some embodiments, the browser server is an http or https server. The pre-activated device communication can be routed to the https server in a manner similar to that described above, and the server can read the information embedded in the https communication to determine the device credential information required to initiate the correct provisioning completion and\/or activation sequences. For example, the https header information, tokens, cookies or other secure information communicated over https from a secure embedded client on the device (or user) can either provide the activation server with the information required to perform the cross-reference to an appropriate provisioning and\/or activation sequence, or the https embedded information or the embedded client (or user) information can instruct the activation server on which services the device is to be provisioned and\/or activated on and any necessary device or user information (e.g., device owner and\/or billing information) can be exchanged, or the device might be provisioned and\/or activated first on a free ambient service with temporary or permanent credentials or account.","In some embodiments, the service processor can be combined with the pre-provisioning and pre-activation techniques described above to create an ambient service solution that will work on roaming networks in which the central provider or VSP has no control or minimal control over the network elements. For example, the device includes a service processor pre-programmed for ambient service activity control as discussed herein, and the device credentials and other settings are pre-provisioned and pre-activated for the central provider network, all of which is described in numerous embodiments disclosed herein. Provided that the service provider has a roaming agreement with other service providers, or provided that the device may gain access to the roaming network, when the device is roaming it will be capable of ambient connectivity with bill by account functionality and all the other features of ambient. Furthermore, as also discussed herein, the ambient service activity control policies can be different for different roaming networks to accommodate the varying network costs and performance. Also, for example, it would be permissible to sign up for initial services or additional upgrade services with the central provider while roaming on the roaming partner network. One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that this also allows for creating a VSP or MVNO for the purpose of creating a clearing house for central provider service activations according to geography or user choice. By using a global multi-mode modem module, and maintaining service agreements with a multitude of carriers, the MVNO or VSP can provide consistent ambient services across multiple carriers and multiple geographies while still maintaining a good degree of cost control. Using bill by account capabilities, it is also possible to have an activation agreement where a roaming service provider agrees to refund the cost of ambient roaming. From the ambient service platform, the VSP or MVNO can then provide service purchase options to the user based on the carrier networks available to the device, or the VSP or MVNO can broker the user off to any of the carriers by activating the device onto the carriers main central provider service.","Accordingly, these embodiments provide flexible capabilities for activating a device or group of devices with a broad range of service profiles and service plans by simply programming the device with the proper credentials at some time during manufacturing or distribution, or simply programming a database associated with the network so that a portion of the device credentials can be used to look up the desired service profile and service plan. For example, various activation embodiments described herein are highly convenient for the end user and need not, in many cases, involve any human intervention.","The service processor , service controller , policy implementation, and\/or profile implementation, and various embodiments disclosed herein are applicable to conventional communication products as well as machine to machine applications. For example, if the machine to machine device includes a service processor  with an activated account, then the service profile settings can be optimized for machine communications to provide only the limited access required to support the particular machine to machine application. This allows for cost optimized access services and prevents the machine to machine device or access modem from being misappropriated and used for some other service access than that intended. For example, by programming the machine to machine communications device at time of manufacture or during distribution with credentials or partial credentials that provide for automated provisioning and activation as described herein, the device can be automatically provisioned and activated on the service network with a service account when deployed, thus eliminating the need for costly or time consuming human intervention. The various embodiments that make it simpler to design, manufacture, test and deploy devices may also be equally applied to machine-to-machine devices. These embodiments include the service processor , developer's kit, and the automated provisioning and activation management tools among others. Also, the service analysis and test tools and the virtual service provider embodiments can also be applied to machine-to-machine applications.","User Interfaces",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0626","num":"0625"},"figref":["FIG. 58","FIG. 58"],"b":["10220","10214","10206","101","10214","10222","100","10222","10224","10222","10222","10224","10222","10224","10222","10226","10224","10222","10226","100","10224","10222","10226","100","10222","10226"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0627","num":"0626"},"figref":["FIG. 59","FIG. 59"],"b":["10230","10232","10212","10206","10232","101","101","10232","100","10232","100","10230","10222","10222","10234","10234","10234"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0628","num":"0627"},"figref":["FIG. 60","FIG. 60","FIG. 61"],"b":["10240","10244","10246","10242","10244","10246","10246","10242","101","10246","10240","100","10244","100"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0629","num":"0628"},"figref":["FIG. 61","FIG. 60","FIG. 59"],"b":["10250","10212","10244","10240","10234","10230","10206","10234","10244","10234","10244","10234","10244","10254","10234","10244","10242","10252","100","10234","10244","10252","10234","10244","10252","10234","10244","10234","10244","10252","10242","10234","10244","10222"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0630","num":"0629"},"figref":"FIG. 62","b":["10260","100","10214","10206","10242","100","10242","100"]},"For a displayed service plan or service plan bundle, a minimal amount of summary information can be provided in the partition .

For example, in some embodiments, the user can tap the \u201cVoice\u201d region shown on the home screen (as shown in, e.g., ) during a phone call to see the service usage meter incrementing during the call.","In some embodiments, the user receives an audible notification related to a service plan or usage of a service plan during a phone call. For example, in some embodiments, a user or a service provider establishes a service usage threshold, and the user receives an audible notification that the established threshold has been reached. The service usage threshold may be a number of minutes, a number of seconds, a cost, a percentage, or any other measure of usage. The notification may be any audible indicator, such as a tone, a bell, content of a sound file, a computer-generated voice, etc. In some embodiments, the notification is a vibration.","In some embodiments, the user receives a visual notification related to a service plan or usage of a service plan during a phone call. For example, in some embodiments, a user or a service provider establishes a service usage threshold, and the user receives a visual notification that the established threshold has been reached. The service usage threshold may be a number of minutes, a number of seconds, a cost, a percentage, or any other measure of service usage. The notification may be a text message, a pop-up, an e-mail, etc.","In some embodiments, the notification is audible\/vibrating or visual based on the status of the mobile wireless communication device . For example, in some embodiments, the notification is audible or a vibration when the user is on a phone call with no connected devices such as a headset or a dock, and otherwise the notification is visual. In some embodiments, the form of the notification, or when or whether the notification occurs, can be configured by the user of the mobile wireless communication device . In some embodiments, the user configures the notifications through the user interface  of the mobile wireless communication device .","In some embodiments, in order to prevent the party on the other end of a voice connection from hearing the audible notification, a processor on the mobile wireless communication device  causes the microphone of the mobile wireless communication device  to be muted during the time that the audible notification is presented to the user of the mobile wireless communication device . In some embodiments, the microphone is muted when a user responds to the audible notification in an audible way, e.g., by pressing a dial pad button (which causes a DTMF tone).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0702","num":"0701"},"figref":["FIG. 112","FIG. 109","FIG. 112","FIG. 112","FIG. 112"],"b":["10496","135","170","1","100","135","170","1","135","170","1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0703","num":"0702"},"figref":["FIG. 113","FIG. 112","FIG. 113","FIGS. 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93"],"b":["10497","10497"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0704","num":"0703"},"figref":["FIG. 114","FIG. 112","FIG. 114","FIG. 114","FIG. 115","FIGS. 114 and 115"],"b":"10498"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0705","num":"0704"},"figref":["FIG. 116","FIG. 116","FIG. 116","FIG. 116","FIG. 116"],"b":["10505","10505","10505","100","101","100"]},"In some embodiments, the mobile wireless communication device  presents an audible or visual upsell offer before a service plan has run out. In some embodiments, if a call is being placed (e.g., the user is dialing or preparing to place the call) and the number of minutes left on the voice service plan is below a threshold number of minutes, an audible notification prompts the user with an upsell audible message. In some embodiments, the audible upsell message provides the user with information about a service plan and prompts the user to select the service plan by pressing one or more keys on the keypad. In some embodiments, if a phone call is in progress when the number of minutes left on the voice service plan falls below the threshold, and the audible upsell notification was not played at the start of the call or before the call was placed, the audible upsell message is presented during the call. In some embodiments, the user may respond to the audible upsell by pressing a keypad button, and the service processor  or a device agent on the mobile wireless communication device  captures the DTMF tone to facilitate the user's purchase of the offered service plan. In some embodiments, the user receives an audible, vibrating, or visual purchase confirmation during the call, or, if the purchase failed, an audible, vibrating, or visual message that the purchase failed. In some embodiments, the microphone of the mobile wireless communication device  is temporarily disabled when audible notifications and user responses are entered so that the person on the other side of the phone call cannot hear the messages or the user's responses.","When the carrier network is incapable of supporting simultaneous voice and data communications, and a phone call is in progress, it may not be possible to complete the user's purchase of a service plan until the phone call has ended, because the network cannot support the data communications necessary to complete the purchase until after the voice call has ended. Therefore, in some embodiments, if the user responds positively to an upsell message presented during a phone call (e.g., by accepting the offered service plan or indicating a desire to purchase a new service plan), the service provider extends a \u201cservice lease\u201d that allows the in-progress phone call to continue for some time period beyond the expiration of the current plan so that the user's phone call is not terminated abruptly at the expiration of the current service plan. The service lease gives the user the impression that the purchase of the new service plan was instantaneous, even though the actual purchase cannot be completed until after the user's call has ended. Because extending a service lease is, in essence, akin to extending credit to a user, in some embodiments, the time period is selected so that if the user's planned purchase of the new or offered service plan is unsuccessful (e.g., if the user's credit card is declined, or for any other reason), the cost of the service lease, which is borne by the service provider, is not significant. By providing a service lease, the service provider enhances the customer's experience and prevents user frustration caused by phone calls abruptly terminating, even though the user wanted to renew a service plan or purchase a new service plan.","In some embodiments, when the user accepts a service offer made while a call is in progress, the purchase process proceeds as soon as the voice call ends. When the purchase is successful, the service provider may then debit the new service plan for the service lease provided on the call that was in progress when the previous service plan expired.","In some embodiments, the user may configure aspects of audible upsells. For example, the user can disable audible upsells or specify that all upsells should be visual.","In some embodiments, upsell messages, whether audible, vibrating, or visual, are configured in the SDC  or device management system -. In some embodiments, audible upsells are played as text-to-speech, or they are audio files.","Service leases can also be extended in other circumstances such as, for example, when the time required to complete the purchase of a service plan would inconvenience a user. In some embodiments, a service lease is extended to users who have exhausted their messaging plans but have initiated the purchase of a new service plan. The service lease is extended so that these users can continue to send text messages while the purchase process, which takes a finite amount of time, is being completed. In some embodiments, the number of messages the user is allowed to send under the service lease is selected so that if the purchase is unsuccessful, the cost to the service provider bearing the cost of the user's out-of-plan messages is reasonable.","As would be understood by a person having ordinary skill in the art in light of the disclosures herein, a service provider can use service leases in a variety of circumstances in order to enhance the user's experience without the service provider having to undertake a large financial risk.

Similarly, when the subscriber has purchased a service plan bundle, such as \u201cStarter Plan,\u201d the subscriber may choose to share constituent service plans of the service plan bundle differently (e.g., a parent may choose to share 80% of the text messages but only 50% of the voice minutes with a child), or she may choose to share all service plans included in a service plan bundle in the same way (e.g., a parent may allow a child to use up to 50% of each service plan included in the service plan bundle.)","In some embodiments, the subscriber chooses to place limits on a service usage amount (e.g., impose a cap or specify an allocation) that can be consumed by a particular device in the device group, e.g., by entering a specific service usage limit using the master device or by using another device and providing a credential that indicates that the subscriber has permission to set service usage limits. By providing a limit for a service usage amount, the subscriber can prevent the particular device from \u201chogging\u201d the service plan. In some embodiments, the particular device that is limited is the master device. In some embodiments, the particular device that is limited is a child device in a device group shared with the master device. In some embodiments, the particular device is another device in a device group shared with the master device. In some embodiments, the particular device is a device managed by a system administrator.","In some embodiments, the subscriber specifies a \u201cmicro-lease\u201d allocation, wherein a device (master or child) is provided an allocation of service usage, and the device subsequently requests an additional allocation after the initial allocation is exhausted.","In some embodiments, the master device monitors usage by devices in the device group and changes one or more plan-sharing parameters based on the monitored usage. In some embodiments, the master device revokes an allocation when the master device determines that the allocation is not being used, or when the master device determines that another device has a greater need for the allocation. In some embodiments, the master device changes an allocation (i.e., increases or decreases an allocation) based on a metric. In some embodiments, the metric is an amount of usage (or a failure to use a service plan) during a time period. In some embodiments, the metric is an expected usage during a time period. In some embodiments, the metric is based on service plan usage by one or more other devices in the device group. In some embodiments, the master device reapportions a service plan or an allocation of a service plan to one or more devices based on a determination that the reapportionment will reduce waste of the service plan.","In some embodiments, the subscriber specifies one or more parameters to assist the master device in managing plan sharing. In some embodiments, the master device manages plan sharing without subscriber involvement.","In some embodiments, the subscriber allocates a maximum amount of a service plan for a period of time and establishes a \u201cmetering\u201d of the total during a sequence of time periods (e.g., a total of 100 text messages during a month and no more than 25 text messages per week). In some embodiments, the subscriber allocates an initial allocation to a child device and then allocates an additional allocation (e.g., a smaller allocation) when the child device exhausts the initial allocation.","In the examples provided herein, none of the \u201cStarter Plan\u201d service plan bundle had been consumed when the subscriber shared the service plan bundle with another device. In some embodiments, had a portion of the service plan bundle been consumed prior to sharing, the subscriber would only be able to share what service usage allocation remained of the service plan bundle. In some embodiments, each service plan within a service plan bundle can be shared individually.","In some embodiments, a service activity can be associated with a specific service plan. In some embodiments, a service activity can be associated with multiple service plans. In some embodiments, service usage for a service activity can be counted against different service plans according to a hierarchy of the different service plans. In some embodiments, the user of the mobile wireless communication device can determine an order for the hierarchy in which different service plans can be allocated service usage for one or more service activities. In some embodiments, service usage for service activities can be counted against a set of service plans according to one or more properties of the service plans in the set of service plans, e.g., based on a cost incurred or an applicable time period for the service plans. In a representative embodiment, service usage for service activities can be allocated to free service plans first. In some embodiments, service usage for service activities can be allocated in a manner to minimize service cost. In some embodiments, service usage for service activities can be allocated among service plans according to when the service activity occurs. In some embodiments, service usage for service activities can be allocated to application specific service plans before generic service plans, e.g., allocate \u201cFacebook\u201d service usage to a \u201cFacebook\u201d specific service plan before allocating \u201cFacebook\u201d service usage to an \u201cInternet access\u201d data service plan.","Shared Service Plan Permissions","As described above, in some embodiments, service plans can be shared among multiple devices in a device group. In some embodiments, a \u201cprimary\u201d device (or a user with permissions capabilities) in the device group can share a service plan with a \u201csecondary\u201d device in the device group and can restrict service usage of the \u201csecondary device\u201d that can be allocated to the shared service plan to a specific subset of service activities. In some embodiments, the \u201cprimary\u201d device can determine a set of particular applications or a set of particular network destinations that can be used by the \u201csecondary\u201d device and that can be allocated to the shared service plan. In some embodiments, the user establishes sharing and permission controls through the \u201cprimary\u201d device. In some embodiments, the user establishes sharing and permission controls through the \u201csecondary\u201d device. In some embodiments, the user establishes sharing and permission controls through a website or web portal or through an application interface. In some embodiments, the user establishes sharing and permission controls through a network service provider console, e.g., through an interface of a service design center.","In some embodiments, a \u201cprimary\u201d device and a \u201csecondary\u201d device in a device group share a service plan, e.g., a data service plan having a fixed allocation of data service usage (an X GB shared data plan), a data service plan having \u201cunlimited\u201d allocation of data service usage (an \u201cunlimited\u201d shared data plan), or a service plan bundle, e.g., an \u201cunlimited\u201d talk, \u201cunlimited\u201d text and \u201cunlimited\u201d data plan, or an \u201cunlimited\u201d talk, \u201cunlimited\u201d text and a fixed allocation of data (an unlimited talk & text and X GB shared data plan). In some embodiments, a first set of permission controls can be applied to the shared service plan that applies to all devices in the device group. In some embodiments, a second set of permission controls can be applied to the shared service plan that applies only to a subset of devices in the device group. In some embodiments, a \u201cprimary\u201d device can establish the second set of permission controls for one or more \u201csecondary\u201d devices in the device group. In some embodiments, a shared bucket of service usage allocation (e.g., a shared amount of data) can have different restrictions applied for different devices in a device group. In some embodiments, the shared bucket of service usage allocation can be unrestricted for a \u201cprimary\u201d device and be restricted for a \u201csecondary\u201d device. In some embodiments, the shared bucket of service usage allocation can be restricted to a first set of service activities for the \u201cprimary\u201d device and be restricted to a second set of service activities for the \u201csecondary\u201d device. In some embodiments, the \u201cprimary\u201d device can share or assign the bucket of service usage allocation to the \u201csecondary\u201d device and establish restrictions as to how the bucket of service usage allocation can be used by the \u201csecondary\u201d device. In some embodiments, the \u201cprimary\u201d device can restrict the \u201csecondary\u201d device to use the bucket of service usage allocation with a particular application (or set of applications). In some embodiments, the \u201cprimary\u201d device can restrict an amount of service usage from the bucket of service usage allocation that the \u201csecondary\u201d device can use, and also restrict use of the service usage from the bucket of service usage by the \u201csecondary\u201d device to a particular set of service activities, e.g., only particular applications can be used by the \u201csecondary\u201d device when using the shared bucket of service usage allocation. In a representative embodiment, a parent can share a \u201cfamily\u201d data plan with other family members and restrict usage of the shared \u201cfamily\u201d data plan for one or more family members to particular applications. In a representative embodiment, the parent can restrict a child's usage of a shared bucket of service usage allocation (e.g., a portion of a shared family data plan) to use with only one or more particular applications.","In some embodiments, permission controls for restricting usage of a shared bucket of service usage allocation to a set of applications for a particular device in a device group are managed at least in part by a service processor  in the particular device and\/or by one or more network elements, e.g., a service controller . In some embodiments, permission controls for a \u201csecondary\u201d device are communicated to the \u201csecondary\u201d device by the one or more network elements and implemented at least in part by the service processor  on the \u201csecondary\u201d device. In some embodiments, the service processor  of the \u201csecondary\u201d device communicates information about service usage by the \u201csecondary\u201d device to the one or more network elements, e.g., the service controller . In some embodiments, the service usage information includes information about service usage for applications used, websites accessed, network endpoints communicated with, contacts (phone numbers, messaging identifiers, email addresses, etc.) communicated with. In some embodiments, the one or more network elements determine whether permission controls have been tampered with based at least in part on the service usage information. In some embodiments, the one or more network elements compare service usage reports from the device to service usage reports generated within the network to determine whether permission controls for the \u201csecondary\u201d device have been defeated. In some embodiments, the service processor  in the \u201csecondary\u201d device obtains information from one or more network elements to verify integrity of the permission controls for restricting usage of the shared bucket of service usage allocation. In some embodiments, the service processor  monitors usage of particular applications and communicates usage of the particular applications to one or more network elements to verify permission to use the particular applications by the \u201csecondary\u201d device and\/or by a user thereof. In some embodiments, In some embodiments, the service processor  obtains information of usage of the particular application from one or more network elements and uses the information to verify permission to use the particular application on the \u201csecondary\u201d device and\/or by a user thereof. In some embodiments, the service processor  compares service usage reports generated in the \u201csecondary\u201d device with service usage reports obtained from one or more network elements in order to verify proper operation of permission controls for restricting service usage of a shared bucket of service usage allocation by the \u201csecondary\u201d device and\/or by a user thereof. In some embodiments, the service processor  compares permission control settings stored in the \u201csecondary\u201d device to a set of permission control settings for the \u201csecondary\u201d device stored in one or more network elements to verify integrity of the permission control settings. In some embodiments, one or more network elements compare permission control settings stored in the \u201csecondary\u201d device to a set of permission control settings for the \u201csecondary\u201d device stored in one or more network elements to verify integrity of the permission control settings. In some embodiments, upon detection that one or more permission controls have been improperly modified, (e.g., the integrity of the permission controls is compromised), the service processor , alone or in combination with one or more network elements (e.g., the service controller ), disallows service usage of one or more applications by the \u201csecondary\u201d device and\/or a user thereof. In some embodiments, a \u201cmaster\u201d user (e.g., for a device group to which the \u201csecondary\u201d device belongs) reconfigures the permission controls for the \u201csecondary\u201d device to allow usage of one or more of the disallowed applications. In some embodiments, one or more network elements examine data traffic from the \u201csecondary\u201d device to verify integrity of permission controls on the \u201csecondary\u201d device. In some embodiments, the one or more network elements use deep packet inspection (DPI) to examine data traffic and\/or to classify the data traffic. In some embodiments, the one or more network elements compare the data traffic to a \u201cwhite list\u201d of supported applications (and\/or application servers, network endpoints, website names\/addresses) for the \u201csecondary\u201d device and\/or the user thereof. In some embodiments, the one or more network elements block data traffic of the \u201csecondary\u201d device, when the data traffic is destined for application servers and\/or network endpoints that are not included in (and\/or supported by) the \u201cwhite list\u201d of supported applications. In some embodiments, one or more network elements examine one or more properties of data traffic to determine whether the data traffic is allowed based on permission controls established for the \u201csecondary\u201d device. In some embodiments, the one or more properties of data traffic examined by the one or more network elements include one or more of: data type, application type, specific application, network endpoint, originating network address, destination endpoint address, website type, website address, network type, network state, or a time of day. In some embodiments, permission controls for the \u201csecondary\u201d device are specific to a user logged into the \u201csecondary\u201d device. In some embodiments, the one or more network elements provide for a notification message to be sent to the \u201csecondary\u201d device that indicates blocking of data traffic. In some embodiments, the notification message includes a reason for blocking of data traffic. In some embodiments, the notification message includes an option to request \u201cunblocking\u201d of the data traffic, e.g., by sending a second notification message to a \u201cmaster\u201d device (or \u201cmaster\u201d user) for the device group to which the \u201csecondary\u201d device belongs. In some embodiments, the one or more network elements provide for sending a notification message to a \u201cmaster\u201d device and\/or \u201cmaster\u201d user of a device group to which the \u201csecondary\u201d device belongs indicating the blocked data traffic. In some embodiments, the notification message to the \u201cmaster\u201d device\/user includes information about the blocked data traffic, e.g., a specific application used, a network endpoint, a website accessed and\/or other specific information about blocked data traffic. In some embodiments, the notification message to the \u201cmaster\u201d device\/user includes an option to \u201cunblock\u201d the data traffic, e.g., to modify the permission controls for the \u201csecondary\u201d device.","In some embodiments, permission controls for a \u201csecondary\u201d device can include restrictions that apply to any shared service plan on the \u201csecondary\u201d device. In some embodiments, permission controls for a \u201csecondary\u201d device can include restrictions that apply only to a subset of shared service plans on the \u201csecondary\u201d device.

In some embodiments, the rating groups are organized into an ordered hierarchy that determines in what order different rating groups apply to identifying, classifying and restricting traffic for a service activity. In some embodiments, traffic is classified to a specific rating group, and each rating group in the set of rules bases includes a set of rules that determine permissions for service activities. In some embodiments, the set of rules determines actions that occur when a service activity is detected and classified to the rating group. In some embodiments, service plans are associated with one or more specific rating groups. In some embodiments, when a service activity is classified to a particular rating group, one or more rules in the set of rules for the particular rating group are applied to the service activity. In some embodiments, when a service activity does not match a rating group, one or more of the following actions occurs: (1) search for a match of the service activity to additional rating groups, (2) restrict the service activity, e.g., disallow the service activity, and (3) provide notification messages to the user of the mobile wireless communication device when service activity is restricted.","In some embodiments a first network element, e.g., a PCRF, provides a rules base including a set of rules for one or more rating groups to a second network element, e.g., a gateway such as the GGSN, that tracks service usage of mobile device users (subscribers) according to the rating groups. In some embodiments, the gateway requests an allocation quota of service usage from a third network element, e.g., an online charging system (OCS), that maintains information about users (subscribers), service accounts, service usage allowances, subscriber groups, accounting rules, and\/or charging rules. In some embodiments, the third network element provides an allocation quota of service usage to the gateway in response to the request for the allocation quota. In some embodiments, the allocation quota is associated with a specific user (subscriber). In some embodiments, the allocation quota is associated with a specific user (subscriber) that belongs to a specific device group (user group, subscriber group). In some embodiments, the allocation quota response from the third network element provides information that maps subscribers to a subscriber group (or equivalently, a device to a device group). In some embodiments, the gateway tracks service usage based on the supplied subscriber group information. In some embodiments, the gateway manages service usage tracking based on both an identification of an individual subscriber (user, device) and an identification of a subscriber group (user group, device group) to which the individual subscriber belongs. In some embodiments, the gateway uses two rules bases, one for a subscriber group and another rules base for an individual subscriber. In some embodiments, a service provider maintains the rules bases. In some embodiments, an administrator having service provisioning privileges maintains the rules bases. In some embodiments, the gateway restricts service activities for shared service plans by applying a rules base for a subscriber group followed by applying a rules base for an individual subscriber. In some embodiments, the gateway applies permissions rules to a service activity by applying a carrier level permissions policy, a subscriber group level permissions policy, and a subscriber level permissions policy. In some embodiments, the gateway performs one or more of the following actions: identify traffic associated with an individual subscriber, determine a subscriber group to which the individual subscriber belongs, obtain a subscriber group permission policy, apply the subscriber group permission policy to the traffic, obtain a subscriber permission policy, and apply the subscriber permission policy to the traffic.","In some embodiments, subscriber group permission policies and\/or subscriber permission policies that apply to service activities for shared service plans are established and\/or modified through a user interface. In some embodiments, the user interface is provided through a device associated with a device group. In some embodiments, the user interface is provided through a \u201cprimary device\u201d in the device group. In some embodiments, the user interface is provided through a \u201csecondary device\u201d in the device group. In some embodiments, the user interface is provided through a website. In some embodiments, the user interface is provided through a network operator console, e.g., a service design center interface. In some embodiments, through the user interface, a set of one or more applications is associated with a shared service plan. In some embodiments, the set of one or more application is associated with a service usage allocation of the shared service plan. In some embodiments, the set of one or more applications associated with the service usage allocation of the shared service plan can consume a portion of the service usage allocation of the shared service plan. In some embodiments, one or more properties of service usage sharing for the shared service plan are defined through the user interface. In some embodiments, limitations on service usage for a device in a device group are defined through the user interface. In some embodiments, limitations for a particular device in the device group for a particular shared service plan are defined through the user interface. In some embodiments, a service usage classification that can access a shared service usage \u201cbucket\u201d is defined through the user interface. In some embodiments, restrictions on particular actions permitted for an application that shares service usage of a shared service usage \u201cbucket\u201d are defined through the user interface. In some embodiments, the shared service usage \u201cbucket\u201d is defined through the user interface. In some embodiments, aspects of a permission policy for a particular user (subscriber) and\/or particular device in a device group are defined through the user interface.

There are many ways the secondary subscriber can enter the one-time token, e.g., by scanning an image, sending or receiving or opening an email attachment, sending or receiving or opening an SMS, sending or receiving or opening an MMS attachment, sending or receiving or opening a sound file, through a near field communication (NFC), through a \u201cbump\u201d with another device (e.g., a master device), using a Bluetooth message, etc. The device agent B sends the entered token information plus its (e.g., device, user, etc.) credential (e.g., 2credential shown in ) from the secondary device B to the sign-up request processor . The sign-up request processor  looks up the token in the database  and obtains the master device credential (e.g., 1credential shown in ). The sign-up request processor  sends the master device credential, the secondary device credential and a request to join the secondary device B to the master service account, device group, or multi-device service plan to the subscriber management system . The subscriber management system  de-provisions (if necessary) the secondary device B from its current plan and adds it as a subscriber onto the master service account, device group, or multi-device service plan (e.g., for voice, text and data). (De-provisioning the secondary device B from its current plan is not shown explicitly in , but de-provisioning can occur, in some embodiments, before adding the secondary device B to the intended master service account, device group or multi-device service plan.) The subscriber management system  provisions the network elements to recognize that the secondary device B is now associated with the master service account, device group, or multi-device service plan. The master device subscriber and secondary device subscribers both receive a notification that the devices are associated with the master service account, device group, or multi-device service plan.","Optionally, in some embodiments, the network (or the master subscriber) can assign usage quotas to the secondary device B. In some embodiments, the master device subscriber shares the token with the secondary device B by displaying, on the master device A screen, an image that can be scanned, and the secondary device B's device agent B scans the image (e.g., with a built-in camera and scanning software). In some embodiments, the master device A's device agent A displays a PIN code on the master device A and the secondary device subscriber enters that PIN code into the secondary device B via the device agent B. In other embodiments, the master device A shares the token with the secondary device B via a Bluetooth link, a near-field communication (NFC), a \u201cbump,\u201d or any other type of communication that allows devices in relatively close proximity to communicate with each other.","In some embodiments, the sign-up request processor  does not send the token back to the master device A, but instead sends it directly to secondary device B to enable the secondary device subscriber to accept the \u201cinvitation\u201d to be added to the share plan. In this embodiment, when the secondary device subscriber accepts the invitation, the token is sent back to the sign-up request processor  as described above, and the provisioning process occurs.","In some embodiments, the master device subscriber initiates the share request from a web-site. In this embodiment, the process is very similar to the process where the share request is initiated from the master device A. In this embodiment, the master mevice subscriber logs into a secure website or portal and enters the necessary information to initiate the sharing request (e.g., his account number, user credential, device credential, etc.) and the request is then processed in the same manner as if the request originated from the master device A.","In some embodiments, the token is a PIN and the PIN is delivered out-of-band to the secondary device subscriber (e.g., via SMS, email message, etc.). In some embodiments, the secondary device subscriber calls an interactive voice recognition (IVR) system and enters the PIN. The IVR obtains the PIN (e.g., through DTMF tones or through voice-to-text processing) and delivers it to the sign-up request processor . From there, the process continues as if the request were handled by the device agent B on the secondary device B.","In some embodiments, the token is a PIN and the PIN is delivered out-of-band to the secondary device subscriber (e.g., via SMS, email message, etc.). In some embodiments, an IVR system automatically calls the secondary device subscriber (at a phone number specified by the master device subscriber in the share request or on the secondary device B itself, etc.). The secondary device subscriber then enters the PIN (e.g., using DTM voice-to-text processing) on the IVR and the IVR delivers the PIN to the sign-up request processor . From there, the process continues as if the request were handled by the device agent B on the secondary device B.","In some embodiments, the master device A is a first device that has a master device credential provisioned into a network access service permission system by a subscriber management system  to provide for master device access network services in accordance with a multi-device service plan, and the secondary device B is a second device that has a secondary device credential provisioned into the network access service permission system by the subscriber management system  to provide for secondary device access network services in accordance with a multi-device service plan.","In some embodiments, the master device credential is provisioned into the network access service permission system before the secondary device credential is provisioned into the network access service permission system. In some embodiments, the secondary device credential is provisioned into the network access service permission system before the master device credential is provisioned into the network access service permission system. In some embodiments, the secondary device credential and the master device credential are provisioned at the same time into the network access service permission system.","In some embodiments, the sign-up request processor  is located in the carrier network.

Additional embodiments are also discussed further herein.","The secondary device subscriber (via the device agent B) sends a request to the sign-up request processor  requesting to be added as a device to the master device A's master service account, device group, or multi-device service plan. The request includes the secondary device B's and\/or user's credential (e.g., MEID, IMEI, IMSI, MSID, phone number, account number, etc.) and a credential for the master device A's account (e.g., MEID, IMEI, phone number, IMSI, MSID, account number, etc.).

In other embodiments, it is located in a third-party provider network (e.g., device OEM, VSP, MVNO, device OS provider, VoIP provider, etc.).","Service Plan Sharing with Allowance Limits","In some embodiments in which a service plan is shared, the master device subscriber may wish to only share a portion of the total service plan with a secondary device subscriber. In some embodiments, the sharing process includes a step where the master device subscriber defines what portion or portions of the service plan (voice service plan, messaging service plan, data access service plan, etc.) are to be shared with the secondary device subscriber. In some embodiments, the portions represent a set of services less than all of the services offered by the service plan to be shared. In some embodiments, the portions are represented by imitations expressed in voice minutes, long distance minutes, international calling destinations, international calling minutes, number of text messages, number of MMS messages, access to specific data services (e.g., website, domain, content type (e.g., streaming audio, streaming video, VoIP, etc.), quality-of-service (QoS) rated services, protocol type, general data access in time or usage (e.g., MB, kB, etc.), application usage, content downloads, content uploads, 3G access, 4G access, Wi-Fi access, etc.), time periods (e.g., days of the week, specific hours in a day, or total hours in a day, total hours in a week, total days in a month, etc.), or other units that are applicable to the shared portion of the service plan. In some embodiments, the portions can be expressed as percentage of the service plans' service usage allowance for a category of service (e.g., 5% of the voice minute allowance, 20% of the data allowance, etc.) or absolute values (e.g., 20 minutes of voice, 100 messages, 5 MB of data, 5 hours of data use, 1 hour of VoIP calling, 30 minutes of media streaming, etc.). In some embodiments, the sharing limits are set up with the initial offer to share. In some embodiments, the sharing limits are set up after the plan has been shared with the secondary device. In some embodiments, in which sharing limits are set up with the initial offer to share, the sharing attributes may be stored in the sign-up request processor database and associated with the sharing token. When the secondary device subscriber is provisioned onto the sharing plan, the sharing attributes are also communicated to the subscriber management system  along with the \u201cadd\u201d request.","In some embodiments, the master device subscriber may purchase an add-on service plan for the secondary device subscriber and allocate (e.g., assign) the entire add-on service plan to the secondary device subscriber (e.g., the secondary device subscriber gets an add-on service plan that provides additional service usage quota for a service that the secondary device subscriber uses more frequently than other users (e.g., an application-specific (e.g., facebook, email, etc.) service plan, an additional allocation of voice minutes or text messages, etc.). In some embodiments, the master device subscriber adds certain capabilities (that might be offered at a discount) to certain users so that those users do not consume the quotas of the shared service plan while using these activities. For example, a master device subscriber might share a non-streaming data plan with a secondary device subscriber, but the secondary device subscriber desires to stream data (e.g., by watching a video, listening to streaming audio, video conferencing, etc.) The master device subscriber may purchase an audio\/video streaming-capable service plan and assign that service plan to the secondary device, but not to other devices. This allows the secondary device subscriber to stream data without the master device subscriber having to purchase a larger streaming capable plan.","Sharing with Curfews","In some embodiments in which a service plan is shared, the master device subscriber may wish to set curfews (e.g., no messaging between 10:00 P.M. and 6:00 A.M., email data access only during school hours, no voice calls except certain numbers during the school day (e.g., numbers on a \u201cwhitelist\u201d), no international long distance calls, etc.) associated with the secondary device as part of the sharing process. In some embodiments, these curfews provide limits on usage of certain aspects of the shared portion of the service plan and thus provide for further control service plan sharing. In some embodiments, the service plan sharing process includes a step where the master device subscriber defines the curfews on the portion or portions of a service plan (voice service plan, messaging service plan, data access service plan, etc.) that are to be shared with the secondary device. The curfews can be expressed as limits on certain aspects of the service plan during certain time periods (no text messaging from 10:00 P.M. until 6:00 A.M. Monday-Friday, only allow voice calls to a certain set of numbers during school hours, no Hulu videos after 8:00 P.M., etc.), maximum usage of an aspect of a service plan during a time period (e.g., maximum of 30 minutes of voice calling per day on weekdays, maximum of 20 MB of Facebook during school hours, no text messaging on Mondays, etc.). In some embodiments, the curfews restrict certain types of access during a specified interval. In some embodiments, the curfews limit certain types of access during a specified interval. In some embodiments, the curfews are set up with the initial offer to share. In some embodiments, the curfews are set up after the secondary device subscriber has been joined to a shared service plan. In some embodiments in which the curfews are set up with the initial offer to share, the curfew attributes are stored in the sign-up request processor database and associated with the sharing token. When the secondary device subscriber is provisioned onto a shared service plan, the curfew attributes are communicated to the subscriber management system  along with the \u201cadd\u201d request. In some embodiments, curfews are combined with sharing limits (e.g., 100 MB of data usage during the service plan cycle and no data usage allowed during school hours, etc.).","User-Established Quotas\/Curfews\/Limitations on Service Usage","In some embodiments, a user may want to set quotas, curfews or limitations on his own service usage. One motivation for doing this may be cost related (e.g., a user wants to ensure a service plan allowance is not exhausted before the end of the service plan cycle, or a user wants to prevent overages, a user's company subsidizes only a certain percentage of service plan usage and the user does not want to exhaust his portion of the allowance, etc.), but there may be other reasons. In some embodiments, the notification enables the secondary subscriber to request additional service from the master subscriber when the notification is triggered. In some embodiments, the notification enables an automatic purchase (or re-purchase) of a specified service plan. In some embodiments, the automatic purchase of a service plan also delivers a notification to the master subscriber. In some embodiments, the notification that is delivered to the master subscriber is delivered via email, SMS, MMS, a message on the master device's device agent , a message on a portal, or a message on a website. In some embodiments, the user interacts with the device agent  on his device to set the desired service controls. The device agent  communicates the service limits to the subscriber management system  (either directly or via an intermediate element), and the subscriber management system  provisions the controls to the appropriate enforcement elements. In some embodiments, the control elements are network elements (e.g., policy controller, policy charging and rules function (PCRF), policy charging enforcement function (PCEF), etc.). In some embodiments, the control elements are device-based agents\/elements. In some embodiments, the control agents\/elements exist both in the network and on the device.","Notifications","In some embodiments, the master device subscriber may desire to set up notifications for secondary users to alert them when they are reaching plan allowances, their individual quota allowances, plan time elapsed or remaining, usage velocity (e.g., rate of service usage), etc. In these types of embodiments, the master device user can, from his device or from an alternative device (e.g., a secondary device, another device associated with the master service account, device group, or multi-device service plan, a website visited from a computer or tablet, etc.) to set up these notifications. In some embodiments, the notifications can also include actions or offers to modify an aspect of service usage (e.g., turn off or block certain services because an allocated quota is running out, or because a service is expensive while roaming, etc.). In other embodiments, the notifications can include an action to also inform the master device subscriber of a secondary device subscriber's activity within the service. In some embodiments, this alert to the master device subscriber can also include a request from the secondary device subscriber to increase his quota allocation, purchase additional service and assign an additional allocation to him, re-allocate other users' quotas on the service towards this particular secondary user, etc. In some embodiments, these notifications can be initiated because a particular secondary user is not using much of his allocated quota, and the notification is sent to the master device subscriber to inform him of the condition and allow the master device subscriber to reallocate the quota as the master device subscriber deems appropriate (e.g., the subscriber may give more service allocation to a different user (including himself) since the particular secondary device subscriber is not going to use his allocation based on current usage velocity (e.g., the average rate of data consumption over a period of time (e.g., one hour, one day, one week, etc.)) trends).","In some embodiments, the master device subscriber uses an application (e.g., application locally on his device, a website from a computer, an application on a secondary device subscriber's device, etc.) to configure the notifications. In some embodiments, the master device subscriber enters a login credential, an account number, a phone number, etc. to identify him as someone who is authorized to make changes to the account. Once logged in, the master device subscriber interacts with the application to set up the desired notifications for the specific secondary device subscriber (or users). In some embodiments, the notifications are configured to be the same for all secondary device subscribers. In some embodiments, the notifications are specific to each secondary device subscriber. In some embodiments, the notifications are specific to a subset of secondary device subscribers. For example, in an enterprise scenario, there may be groups of users based on their position or function within the enterprise (e.g., sales, executive, field service, etc.). Each group of users may have different sets on notifications configured by the master device subscriber because each group of users may have different aspects of a service plan shared with them. For example, a sales group and a field service group may have a larger allocation of service usage for maps and navigation services and there could be notifications for service usage within that particular allocation for those groups, so they know if they are running out of that type of service. In a family share scenario, the children might have limited access to a social networking application during school hours (e.g., 10 MB, 30 minutes, etc.) and the master device subscriber sets a notification to notify the child when she is reaching her daily limit. In some embodiments, the notification that is configured is delivered to the specific user of the service (e.g., the child, etc.). In some embodiments, the notification is delivered to the master device subscriber. In some embodiments, the notification is delivered to both the master device subscriber and the specific user of the service. Once the notifications are configured, they are sent to the subscriber management system . The subscriber management system  provisions the notification type, parameters, text, actions, etc. to the various elements that are responsible for implementing the notification policy. In some embodiments, the elements are network-based elements (e.g., OCS, PCRF, PCEF, notification element, etc.). In some embodiments, the elements are device-based agents (e.g., agents for local usage counting, local classification and policy management, local notification agent, etc.). In some embodiments, the elements are located in both the network and the device (e.g., accounting and policy control in the network, notification agent on the device, etc.). Once the elements are provisioned, the notification policy is associated with the appropriate subscribers (e.g., the one or more secondary device subscribers) and enabled when the subscriber is actively using the services.","As discussed previously, in some embodiments, the notification is actionable by either the secondary device subscriber or the master device subscriber. For example, in an enterprise scenario, when the user is reaching the limit of an enterprise-paid service, the notification can include an option for the secondary device subscriber to purchase additional service just for him (e.g., not shared with other users). In some embodiments, the notification action is to alert the master device subscriber so he can take action (e.g., purchase additional shared service, purchase service just for that user, reallocate usage quotas, etc.). In some embodiments, the notification to the master device subscriber includes an option to purchase additional service. In some embodiments, the additional service includes shared service (e.g., additional usage for all subscribers on the shared account). In some embodiments, the additional service is specifically for the subscriber whose usage profile generated the notification. In some embodiments, the additional service is for a specific subset of subscribers on the shared service plan. In some embodiments, the master device subscriber has the option to decline the additional service offer. In some embodiments, the action taken by the master device subscriber (e.g., additional service purchased, no additional service purchased, etc.) is communicated to the secondary device subscriber. In some embodiments, the communication is via email, SMS, MMS, a message delivered to the device agent  on the secondary device, a message displayed on a portal, or a message displayed on a website.","In some embodiments, the system is configured to detect when the device agent  on the secondary device has been tampered with. In some embodiments, tampering includes removal of the device agent , modification of the device agent, or modification of the configuration data used by the device agent. In some embodiments, this is achieved by detecting that the device agent on the secondary device has not sent a heartbeat message (e.g., a message configured to inform a network element that the device agent is present and operating properly, where such messages are possibly sent periodically or upon request by the network element) to the sign-up request processor  (or other monitoring network element) or to the device agent  on the master device in the configured time interval. In some embodiments, the detection is achieved by inspecting traffic to or from the secondary device and determining if the inspected traffic conforms to the controls that are expected to be enforced (e.g., whether there is data usage when data curfews are in place, whether there is a voice call to a non-whitelisted number when a voice curfew is in place, etc.). In some embodiments, detecting tampering is achieved by verifying a device agent credential, software signing key, software hash, software configuration integrity, software configuration hash, operating system (OS) credential, OS software hash, or OS signing key. In some embodiments, the detection occurs on the secondary device. In some embodiments, the detection occurs on the master device. In some embodiments, the detection occurs in the Network. In some embodiments, the detection is performed by two or more elements (e.g., missing heartbeat message between the secondary device and a network element). In some embodiments, when it has been detected that tampering has occurred on the secondary device, a notification is sent to the master device user. In some embodiments, the notification is delivered directly to the master device via, for example, SMS, device agent notification, email or IVR phone call. In some embodiments, the notification also includes an alert sound to bring immediate attention to the notification. In some embodiments, the notification is displayed on top of all other UI elements on the master device. In some embodiments, the notification is delivered to other account entities in addition to the master. In some embodiments, the notification is delivered to multiple account entities.","In some embodiments, the master device credential is provisioned into the network access service permission system to provide a master device user with a higher level of control over multi-device service plan configuration, and the secondary device credential is provisioned into the network access service permission system to provide a secondary device user with a lesser degree of control over multi-device service plan configuration. In some embodiments, the secondary device credential is provisioned into the network access service permission system to provide a secondary device user with a higher level of control over multi-device service plan configuration, and the master device credential is provisioned into the network access service permission system to provide a master device user with a lesser degree of control over multi-device service plan configuration. In some embodiments, the master device credential and the secondary device credential are provisioned into the network access service permission system to provide the same degree of control over multi-device service plan configuration to a user of the master device and a user of the secondary device.","In some embodiments, the control over multi-device service plan configuration comprises the ability to approve or initiate purchasing, upgrading, downgrading or discontinuing a service plan or a multi-device service plan. In some embodiments, the control over multi-device service plan configuration comprises the ability to approve or initiate adding or deleting one or more devices associated with the master service account, device group, or multi-device service plan. In some embodiments, the control over multi-device service plan configuration comprises the assignment of or approval of a service usage allowance for one or more devices capable of receiving services in accordance with the multi-device service plan. In some embodiments, the service usage allowance comprises a voice, text or data usage allowance for one or more wireless access networks. In some embodiments, the allowance comprises an allowance on one or more applications or one or more application types that may be used on one or more wireless access networks. In some embodiments, the allowance comprises a time of day or time period allowance during which one or more access network services may be used. In some embodiments, the allowance comprises an allowance for communication with one or more network end points or websites or one or more network endpoint types or website types over one or more wireless access networks. In some embodiments, the allowance comprises an allowance for one or more content types or traffic types on one or more wireless access networks. In some embodiments, the allowance comprises an allowance for one or more QoS levels on one or more wireless access networks. In some embodiments, the allowance comprises one or more roaming permission levels for one or more wireless roaming networks. In some embodiments, an allowance is implemented by provisioning an allowance policy instruction or allowance policy setting into one or more device agents on the device associated with the allowance.
