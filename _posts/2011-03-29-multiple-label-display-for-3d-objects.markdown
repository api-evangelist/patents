Field","The present disclosure generally relates to displaying labels associated with the visualization of three-dimensional objects using a computer.","2. Description of the Related Art","Current three-dimensional (3D) rendering systems display 3D objects in a 3D space and allow the objects to be viewed from numerous viewpoints surrounding the 3D object. However, when portions or items of these objects are labeled, the labels often overlap or overlay one another and\/or obstruct the view and\/or label of portions or items of the object a user may wish to see. As such, it is difficult for the user viewing the 3D object to read the labels associated with the 3D object and also view the 3D object.","According to one aspect of the present disclosure, a method for viewing a labeled three-dimensional (3D) object is disclosed. The method includes obtaining viewable data of a 3D object, and displaying at least a portion of the 3D object based on a current view comprising an initial default view, or a user selected view based on a query received from a user. The method also includes retrieving, from storage, at least one identification label for each of a plurality of items within the current view, defining a first axis within the current view, and selecting, from a plurality of positions along the first axis, a position that has a smallest angle between the selected position and a selected item from the plurality of items. The method further includes displaying the identification label associated with the selected item at a point along a second axis within the current view between the selected position and the selected item.","According to another aspect of the present disclosure, a system for viewing a labeled three-dimensional (3D) object is disclosed. The system includes a memory for storing viewable data of a 3D object, and a plurality of identification labels associated with the 3D object, and a processor. The processor is configured to display at least a portion of the 3D object based on a current view comprising an initial default view, or a user selected view based on a query received from a user, and retrieve at least one identification label, from the plurality of identification labels, for each of a plurality of items within the current view. The processor is further configured to define a first axis within the current view, select, from a plurality of positions along the first axis, a position that has a smallest angle between the selected position and a selected item from the plurality of items, and display the identification label associated with the selected item at a point along a second axis within the current view between the selected position and the selected item.","According to a further aspect of the present disclosure, a machine-readable storage medium comprising machine-readable instructions for causing a processor to execute a method for viewing a labeled three-dimensional (3D) object is disclosed. The method includes obtaining viewable data of a 3D object, and displaying at least a portion of the 3D object based on a current view comprising an initial default view, or a user selected view based on a query received from a user. The method also includes retrieving, from storage, at least one identification label for each of a plurality of items within the current view, defining a first axis within the current view, and selecting, from a plurality of positions along the first axis, a position that has a smallest angle between the selected position and a selected item from the plurality of items. The method further includes displaying the identification label associated with the selected item at a point along a second axis within the current view between the selected position and the selected item.","In the following detailed description, numerous specific details are set forth to provide a full understanding of the present disclosure. It will be apparent, however, to one ordinarily skilled in the art that the embodiments of the present disclosure may be practiced without some of these specific details. In other instances, well-known structures and techniques have not been shown in detail so as not to obscure the disclosure.","The disclosed system uses a web browser with integrated (e.g., built in) 3D modeling and searching capabilities for viewing and searching a 3D image or object, such as a web browser pre-installed with WebGL. Using the enhanced web browser, the user can view the 3D image, including labels that identify portions of the 3D image. The labels are dynamically placed according to an algorithm in a location that clearly identifies the portion of the 3D image being labeled in a manner that does not obstruct the user's view of that portion of the 3D image, but also in a way that labels do not overlap one another.","Exemplary Architecture",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","130","110","150","130","130"]},"The servers  can be any device having an appropriate processor, memory, and communications capability for hosting the searchable data of the 3D object and related content. The clients  to which the servers are connected over the network  can be, for example, desktop computers, mobile computers, tablet computers, mobile devices (e.g., a smartphone or PDA), set top boxes (e.g., for a television), video game consoles, or any other devices having appropriate processor, memory, and communications capabilities. The network  can include, for example, any one or more of a personal area network (PAN), a local area network (LAN), a campus area network (CAN), a metropolitan area network (MAN), a wide area network (WAN), a broadband network (BBN), the Internet, and the like. Further, the network  can include, but is not limited to, any one or more of the following network topologies, including a bus network, a star network, a ring network, a mesh network, a star-bus network, tree or hierarchical network, and the like.","Each of the clients  is configured to receive part or all of the searchable data of the 3D object and display the searchable data to a user of the client  for the user to view in a 3D space, search, edit, and annotate. The user can view, at varying levels of detail, the 3D object from a position at any point outside or inside of the object, and can move the position of the view using an input device such as a keyboard, mouse, or a touchscreen. The user can also to choose adjust the opacity of portions of the 3D object, such as by reducing the opacity of a surface layer to zero in order to see through the surface layer and view an inner layer. The user can further search the 3D object by entering a query. For example, when the user types \u201clung,\u201d the opacity of the skin, muscular, and skeletal layers of a 3D human body is reduced and the position of the view is adjusted so that the user can see a lung. These features will be discussed in more detail herein below.","The searchable data of the 3D object is retrieved by the client  from the server  using a 3D enhanced application, such as a web browser or mobile application. The 3D enhanced web browser includes an integrated 3D modeling and searching capability that is built-in to the web browser, e.g., a part of the web browser by default, as a standard, at the time the web browser is downloaded and installed on the client . An exemplary 3D modeling and searching capability is provided by WebGL, a 3D graphics application programming interface. Exemplary 3D enhanced web browsers include web browsers pre-installed with WebGL.","Exemplary Client and Server",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["200","110","130","100","110","130","150","118","138","118","138","150","118","138"]},"The server  includes a processor , the communications module , and a memory . The memory  includes searchable data of the 3D object , a web page  for instructing a 3D enhanced web browser on how to model and search the 3D object (hereinafter \u201cobject browser web page \u201d) using the searchable data of the 3D object , and user generated content  related to the searchable data of the 3D object . The client  includes a processor , the communications module , an input device , an output device , and a memory . The memory  of the client  includes the 3D enhanced web browser  and optionally includes a local copy of the object browser web page  and a local copy of the searchable data of the 3D object . Thus, the object browser web page  and the searchable data of the 3D object  can be locally stored or remotely stored. A determination of whether to store a local copy of the object browser web page  and a local copy of the searchable data of the 3D object  can be made by the 3D enhanced web browser . For example, the 3D enhanced web browser  can include a setting of whether to store files in a local cache, or the object browser web page  itself can determine, for example, to stream only necessary information from the searchable data of the 3D object  to the client  and not store it in the memory  of the client.","The local copy of the object browser web page  and the local copy of the searchable data of the 3D object  are loaded into the memory  of the client  after a user of the client  (hereinafter simply \u201cthe user\u201d) selects the web address for the object browser web page  in the 3D enhanced web browser , and the 3D enhanced web browser  sends a request to the server  for the object browser web page  and related searchable data of the 3D object . The processor  of the server is configured to receive the request from the 3D enhanced web browser , and provide to the 3D enhanced web browser  of the client , in response to the request, the searchable data of the 3D object  and the object browser web page . The client  can then store the local copy of the object browser web page  and the local copy of the searchable data of the 3D object  in its memory . In the alternative, the web browser  of the client  downloads the searchable data of the 3D object  on demand (e.g., streaming), and\/or an initial portion of the searchable data of the 3D object  is stored locally (e.g., as the local copy of the searchable data of the 3D object ) to begin the display of the 3D object on the output device  and the remaining portion of the searchable data of the 3D object  is downloaded as requested or needed by the 3D enhanced web browser  for display on the output device .","The processor  of the client  is configured to execute instructions, such as instructions physically coded into the processor , instructions received from software in memory , or a combination of both. For example, the processor  of the client  is configured to execute instructions from the local copy of the object browser web page  causing the processor  to display, in the 3D enhanced web browser  on the output device , at least a portion of the 3D object based on an initial default view, or a user selected view based on a query received from the user using the input device . As discussed herein in more detail, a view of the 3D object can include features to provide an opacity of the different portions of the 3D object, rotation of the 3D object, zoom, whether any portion of the 3D object has been selected, the state of any interfaces displayed, parameters related to customization of the 3D object generated by a user, and any annotations on the 3D object. The output device  can be a computer display, such as a touch screen display. The query can be an alphanumeric input, such as \u201cliver\u201d or \u201c2\u201d (for cervical spinal nerve ), or input from an input device . Similarly, the query can be an alphanumeric input indirectly related to a portion of the 3D object (e.g., for a human body, the entry \u201ccirrhosis\u201d can map to the liver) based on, for example, pre-defined mappings, user-generated contents, or implicit connections, such as prior user history. Exemplary input devices  include a keyboard, mouse, or touch screen display. Using the input device , the user can view any portion of the 3D object in the 3D enhanced web browser  from any angle at any position inside or outside the 3D object. The user can also use the input device  to search the 3D object and create, edit, and delete user generated content  related to the 3D object that is displayed on the output device .","Although the block diagram  illustrates, in the same memory  of a single server , the searchable data of the 3D object , the user generated content , and the object browser web page , the searchable data of the 3D object , the user generated content , and the object browser web page  can be in different memories and\/or on different servers  as discussed above with reference to .","Obtaining Searchable Data for a 3D Object on the Client",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["300","130","124","110"]},"The process  begins by proceeding from step  to step  when the user of a desktop client  loads the 3D enhanced web browser  and enters an address, such as a Uniform Resource Locator (URL), for the object browser web page. In step , the 3D enhanced web browser  sends a request to the server  for the object browser web page  and its related searchable data of the 3D object . In step , the server  receives the request. A copy of the searchable data of the 3D object  is available on the server  to provide in response to the request.","The copy of the related searchable data of the 3D object  and a copy of object browser web page  is provided in step  by the server , in response to the request from the desktop client , to the 3D enhanced web browser  on the desktop client . In step , the desktop client  obtains the copy of the object browser web page  and a copy of the searchable data of the 3D object  via the 3D enhanced web browser . A local copy of the object browser web page  and a local copy of the searchable data of the 3D object  are stored in the memory  of the desktop client . In step , the desktop client  uses a monitor  to display the exemplary screenshot of an initial default view of the 3D object loaded in the 3D enhanced web browser  as shown in , and the process  ends in step .","Viewing the 3D Image in a 3D Enhanced Web Browser","Having obtained searchable data of the 3D object at the client  from the server  using the 3D enhanced web browser ,  illustrates a screenshot  of an initial default view of the 3D object as displayed on the output device . In exemplary , the 3D object  is a human body. The initial default view shows an outer surface of a portion of a 3D object , a female object , and more specifically, the outside of a clothed female human body, including skin. Although a female human body is used in the screenshots, a male human body can also be used.","The user interface of  includes the 3D object , an input field  for entering a query to be searched, a position control  for moving the position of the current view, a zoom control  for adjusting the zoom of the current view, and an opacity adjustment interface  (hereinafter referred to as \u201cslider \u201d) having a movable indicator for adjusting the opacity of the outer surface and\/or internal structures (collectively referred to as \u201clayers\u201d) of the 3D object . The slider  includes a labeling option  to display all relevant labels in the current view. As discussed herein, the outer surface for a human body includes, but is not limited to, the skin and portions of the body near to or in contact with the external surface of the skin, such as eyes, hair, teeth, ears, nails, and lips. The internal structures include, but are not limited to, inner anatomical layers, biological systems, and organs, down to the tissues, cells, and molecular structures such as DNA or proteins.","Any part of the 3D object , whether as a whole or in part, let alone any part of the outer surface or the internal structures, are often referred to herein as \u201cportions\u201d or \u201citems\u201d of the 3D object  and can be displayed by the 3D enhanced web browser  using the searchable data of the 3D object . Furthermore, in addition to the displayed user interface controls , , and , the user can use the input device , illustrated by cursor , to change the position of the view and the level of zoom of the view of the 3D object  to view any portion of the 3D object  from any angle (e.g., not limited to any axis). For example, the user can view the heart from the outside of the heart or the inside of the heart. As another example, the user can press and hold a button on a mouse input device  while dragging the cursor  across the screen in any direction in order to rotate the 3D object  in that direction.","Any internal structure or portion of the 3D object  can be rendered by the 3D enhanced web browser  and viewed from any position using the searchable data of the 3D object , including, with reference to a human body, inner anatomical layers, biological systems, organs, tissues, cells, and molecular structures.","Label Untangling",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 4B","b":["430","124","444","402","444","112","112","444","124","402","402","402","402"]},"For example, in , displaying a 3D human body as the 3D object , a first axis  is defined within the display of the 3D enhanced web browser . Next, a position  is selected, from a plurality of positions along the first axis , that is associated with a smallest angle between the selected position  and the portions of the body (e.g., body nerves ) that still needed to have a label displayed. The smallest angle is the angle  at the intersection , at the body nerves , of a second axis  between the selected position  and the body nerves  with a third axis  that is substantially perpendicular to the first axis . Afterwards, the label  associated with the body nerves  is displayed at a point  along the second axis .  is a further exemplary screenshot  of the 3D enhanced web browser  that includes labels  displayed for portions of the 3D object  using the above-described procedure.","In certain aspects, if there are multiple labels to display, then a label that is blocking another label is either moved until it no longer blocks the label, or it is removed completely. Other aspects taken into account when determining when and where to display a label include the size of the label, the transparency of portions within the display, the size of the portions, what side of the label the portion is on, and the inertia of the query (e.g., the pointing device) in getting or moving away from the current view.","Annotations","The user can further generate annotations for any portion of the 3D object  for display in the 3D enhanced web browser . In certain aspects, annotations are a special type of label that otherwise follow the rules for displaying labels disclosed above and are searchable using the input field . Annotations include user-defined labels. The user can assign annotations to one or many portions of the 3D object , such as by creating an arbitrary group of body parts for a human body and assigning the arbitrary group an annotation. These annotations can be shared in, and displayed with, the bookmarks described above. For example, the content, location, and display parameters of an annotation can be stored as part of the URL of the bookmark. The annotations can be stored in the user generated content  database in the memory  of the server  for accessibility and viewing by other users.","With reference to a human body, the annotations can include text describing the associated body portion, such as a definition of the associated body portion or an explanation of a medical procedure or condition related to the associated body portion. The annotations can be used to teach students, such as by providing annotations with definitions or annotations that are examination questions.","Exemplary Computer System for the Server and\/or Client",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 1"],"b":["110","130","500"]},"Computer system  (e.g., clients  and servers ) includes a bus  or other communication mechanism for communicating information, and a processor  (e.g., processor  and ) coupled with bus  for processing information.
