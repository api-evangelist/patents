No. 13\/156,787, \u201cINTELLIGENT NETWORK MANAGEMENT OF SUBSCRIBER-RELATED EVENTS\u201d to Weppler et al.","Various exemplary embodiments disclosed herein relate generally to network management.","As mobile telecommunication becomes more widely accepted and as more complex applications are developed, the demand on network infrastructure is ever-increasing. While service providers attempt to keep up with the increased need for bandwidth and generally reliable service by installing faster and additional equipment, it appears that such service may be difficult to provide while network traffic remains unregulated. In particular, two major factors that contribute to reduced end-user experience are congested network elements and unfair use of the network by certain users.","In many networks, there are multiple routes between two communication endpoints through many different intermediate devices. Without a way to assess the congestions of different routes, however, a particular session may be routed through an over-worked or failing node, leading to an appreciable delay in data transfer. In many of these cases, sessions could have been routed through other underutilized nodes, thereby providing better transfer rates for those sessions while reducing the load on the congested nodes.","Individual users may also have an adverse effect on the quality of service delivered to other users. For instance, if a user consistently uses a high amount of data transfer, such as in the case of streaming high quality video and\/or downloading large files, this detracts from the total amount of available bandwidth that may be shared among other users. In other cases, malicious users may purposefully impact the quality of service delivered to other users, utilizing various tactics to degrade or even fully deny service. In some cases, the user may even be unaware that they have a virus that is causing the degradation of services for themselves and others.","Various exemplary embodiments relate to a method performed by a network node for resolving network-related events, the method including one or more of the following: receiving, at the network node, an indication of an event from a network monitor, the event associated with a network element; identifying an applicable rule of a plurality of rules based on the event, the applicable rule specifying at least one action; and initiating performance of the at least one action with respect to at least one session associated with the network element.","Various exemplary embodiments relate to a network node for resolving network related events, the network node including one or more of the following: a network monitor interface for receiving an indication of an event from a network monitor, the event associated with a network element; a rules storage for storing a plurality of rules, each rule of the plurality of rule specifying at least one criteria and at least one action; and a rules engine configured to identify an applicable rule of the plurality of rules by comparing the event to the at least one criteria of the applicable rule.","Various exemplary embodiments relate to a tangible and non-transitory machine-readable storage medium encoded with instructions for execution by a network node for resolving network-related events, the tangible and non-transitory machine-readable storage medium including one or more of the following: instructions for receiving, at the network node, an indication of an event from a network monitor, the event associated with a network element; instructions for identifying an applicable rule of a plurality of rules based on the event, the applicable rule specifying at least one action; instructions for initiating performance of the at least one action with respect to at least one session associated with the network element.","Various embodiments are described wherein the step of initiating performance of the at least one action comprises: identifying a group of sessions associated with the network element; and initiating performance of the at least one action with respect to each session of the group of sessions.","Various embodiments additionally include identifying a group of sessions associated with the network element; and wherein the steps of identifying an applicable rule and initiating performance of the at least one action are performed for each session of the group of sessions.","Various embodiments additionally include one of more of the following: updating an object associated with the network element based on the event; receiving a request associated with a session associated with the network node; wherein the steps of identifying an applicable rule and initiating performance of the at least one action are performed in response to receiving the request.","Various embodiments additionally include receiving a second indication of a second event, the second event associated with a subscriber; wherein the step of identifying an applicable rule comprises identifying an applicable rule of the plurality of rules based on both the event and the second event.","Various embodiments are described wherein the indication of an event includes an indication of at least one of a presence of congestion, an intensity of utilization, and intensity of congestion, a number of active devices, a number of signaling events, and a number of failures.","Various embodiments are described wherein the network element is one of a gateway GPRS support node, a packet data serving node, a home agent, a serving GPRS support node, a packet data network gateway, a serving gateway, a radio network controller, a node B, an enodeB, an associated cell, and an associated sector.","In view of the foregoing, there exists a need for a system that may intelligently manage various events that may detract from user experience in a network. In particular, there is a need for various types of nodes that may receive an indication of a network event and respond to the event appropriately according to the various nodes' functions.","Referring now to the drawings, in which like numerals refer to like components or steps, there are disclosed broad aspects of various exemplary embodiments.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","110","120","130","140"]},"User equipment (UE)  may be a device that communicates with packet data network  for providing the end-user with a data service. Such data service may include, for example, voice communication, text messaging, multimedia streaming, and Internet access. More specifically, in various exemplary embodiments, user equipment  is a personal or laptop computer, tablet, wireless email device, cell phone, smart phone, television set-top box, or any other device capable of communicating with other devices via EPC .","Base station  may be a device that enables communication between user equipment  and EPC . For example, base station  may be a base transceiver station such as an evolved node B (eNodeB) as defined by 3GPP standards. Thus, base station  may be a device that communicates with user equipment  via a first medium, such as radio communication, and communicates with EPC  via a second medium, such as Ethernet cable. Base station  may be in direct communication with EPC  or may communicate via a number of intermediate nodes (not shown) such as, for example, radio network controllers. In various embodiments, multiple base stations (not shown) may be present to provide mobility to user equipment . Note that in various alternative embodiments, user equipment  may communicate directly with evolved packet core. In such embodiments, base station  may not be present.","Packet core or evolved packet core (EPC)  may be a device or network of devices that provides user equipment  with gateway access to packet data network , EPC  may further charge a subscriber for use of provided data services and ensure that particular quality of experience (QoE) standards are met. Thus, EPC  may be implemented, at least in part, according to the 3GPP Technical Specifications (TS) 29.212, 29.213, and 29.214 standards. Accordingly, EPC  may include a serving gateway (SGW) , a packet data network gateway (PGW) , a session management node , and a network monitor . EPC  may contain numerous additional nodes (not shown) such as, for example, a subscription profile repository (SPR) and\/or a mobility management entity (MME). It will be appreciated that in various embodiments, the components of network  may be arranged differently. For example, network monitor  may not be a part of EPC  and, instead, may monitor various traffic from outside EPC .","Serving gateway (SGW)  may be a device that provides gateway access to the EPC . SGW  may be the first device within the EPC  that receives packets sent by user equipment  and may forward such packets toward PGW . SGW  may perform a number of additional functions such as, for example, managing mobility of user equipment  between multiple base stations (not shown) and enforcing particular quality of service (QoS) characteristics, such as guaranteed bit rate, for each flow being served. In various implementations, such as those implementing the Proxy Mobile IP (PMIP) standard, SGW  may include a Bearer Binding and Event Reporting Function (BBERF). In various exemplary embodiments, EPC  may include multiple SGWs (not shown) and each SGW may communicate with multiple base stations (not shown).","Packet data network gateway (PGW)  may be a device that provides gateway access to packet data network . PGW  may be the final device within the EPC  that receives packets sent by user equipment  toward packet data network  via SGW . PGW  may include a policy and charging enforcement function (PCEF) that enforces policy and charging control (PCC) rules for each service data flow (SDF). Thus, PGW  may be a policy and charging enforcement node (PCEN). PGW  may include a number of additional features such as, for example, packet filtering, deep packet inspection, and subscriber charging support.","Session management node  may be a device that establishes and manages various sessions for user equipment such as UE  within EPC . Such sessions may include, for example, IP connectivity access network (IP-CAN) sessions and service data flows (SDFs). In various embodiments, session management node may implement a policy and charging rules function (PCRF) and, therefore, may be referred to as a policy and charging rules node (PCRN). According to various implementations, session management node  may receive various request messages from PGW . Such request messages may request the establishment, modification, and termination of various sessions. In response, session management node  may fulfill such requests by installing policy and charging control (PCC) rules at PGW .","Network monitor  may be a device adapted to monitor one or more portions of network  for various network- and subscriber-related events. As illustrated, network monitor  monitors connections between base station  and SGW  and between SGW  and PGW . It should be noted, however, that network monitor  may be adapted to monitor any combination of connections within network . For example, network monitor  may monitor connections such as connections between UE  and base station  and\/or connections between sectors and\/or cells within base station . Further, network  may contain numerous additional network monitors (not shown) in communication with EPC .","Network monitor  may detect network-related events such as congestion or utilization on a particular network element. For example, network monitor  may monitor the throughput of serving gateway  and determine that the element is congested when the throughput exceeds a predetermined threshold or when the rate of incoming traffic is significantly higher than the rate of outgoing traffic. Network monitor  may detect a number of different types of network-related events such as, for example, element signaling and element failures. Various additional events and methods for detection of such will be apparent to those of skill in the art.","Network monitor  may additionally detect subscriber-related events. For example, network monitor may determine that the user of UE  is a high usage subscriber by monitoring the portion of traffic associated with the subscriber as compared to a predetermined threshold or the average portion of traffic dedicated to a subscriber. Network monitor  may also monitor for discrete events that may be indicative of a malicious user. For example, network monitor  may log each user that attempts a horizontal or vertical port scan. Network monitor  may detect a number of additional types of subscriber-related events such as, for example, signal attacks, battery attacks, peer to peer traffic, always-active subscribers, high-signaling subscribers, unwanted sources, flooding, discovery abuse, and\/or signaling abuse. Various additional events and methods for detection of such will be apparent to those of skill in the art.","Upon detection of a network- or subscriber-related event, network monitor  may send a notification to session management node . Such notification may include an identification of the observed event as well as additional information. In the case of a network-related event, the message may include information such as an identification of the affected network elements (for example, SGWs, PGWs, NodeBs, cells, etc.), an estimation of event intensity, a number of devices currently served by the network element, a number of signals observed with respect to the network element, and\/or a number of failures or other errors occurring at the network element. In the case of a subscriber-related event, the notification may include a subscriber identifier, an estimation of event intensity, and\/or an access point name.","In the case of both network- and subscriber-related events, network monitor  may further be capable of communicating the end of an event. For example, if network monitor  detects that the throughput of SGW  has dropped below the congested threshold, network monitor may transmit a message to session management node  indicating that SGW  is no longer congested.","In response to various messages sent by network monitor , session management node  may be adapted to take remedial action. In various embodiments, upon receiving a network-related event message, session management node  may modify each session associated with the affected network element by, for example, moving the session to a different network element, throttling the connection speed or even notification towards the subscriber (email or SMS). In response to subscriber-related events, session management node  may take similar remedial action with respect to sessions associated with the offending subscriber. Additionally or alternatively, session management node  may store the reported event data for later use. For example, upon receiving a request for a new session through a congested node, session management node  may propose an alternate route around the congested node or may only approve the session at a reduced bandwidth.","Packet data network  may be any network for providing data communications between user equipment  and other devices connected to packet data network  such as, for example, nodes including an application function (AF). In various embodiments, packet data network  may include the Internet. Packet data network  may further provide, for example, phone and\/or Internet service to various user devices in communication with packet data network .","As previously noted, while various embodiments herein relate to improvements for a session management node such as a PCRN, the improvements detailed herein may be applied to other devices and\/or environments. For example, various nodes such as deep packet inspection (DPI) devices, video optimizers, traffic steering applications, customer care applications, caching and streaming functions, analytics and reporting engines, and\/or content optimization and enrichment devices may benefit from resolving various reported events in manners similar to those described herein. Various modifications appropriate for such applications will be apparent to those of skill in the art.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","200","136","100","200","200","205","210","215","220","225","230","235","240","245","250","255"]},"Gateway interface  may be an interface comprising hardware and\/or executable instructions encoded on a machine-readable storage medium configured to communicate with other network nodes such as, for example, PGW . In various embodiments, gateway interface  may communicate with some nodes according to the Diameter and\/or RADIUS protocols. Accordingly gateway interface  may include at least one Ethernet network interface device.","Request handler  may include hardware and\/or executable instructions on a machine-readable storage medium configured to process various requests related to various sessions received via gateway interface . For example, request handler  may establish, modify, and\/or terminate IP-CAN sessions and SDFs upon request by another node. In fulfilling such requests, request handler  may request one or more rule results from rules engine . For example, request handler  may request one or more attribute values to be used in fulfilling a request or may request a determination of some other action to take with respect to the request. Upon receiving a rule result, request handler  may process the result by initiating performance of the specified action locally or by determining that network node  should initiate performance of the action at a different node. Once request handler  appropriately processes a request, request handler  may indicate to message generator  that one or more messages should be transmitted via gateway interface  to one or more other nodes to initiate performance of one or more actions specified by a rules result, to effect fulfillment of the request, and\/or to otherwise notify other nodes of request fulfillment. For example, request handler  may indicate to message generator  that a PCC rule should be installed at a particular PGW.","Rules engine  may include hardware and\/or executable instructions on a machine-readable storage medium configured to, upon request by another component, locate an applicable rule stored in rule storage  and return a rule result to the requesting component. In various embodiments, each rule stored in rule storage  may indicate various criteria for determining whether the rule is applicable. Rules engine  may make use of any context data available in evaluating various rule criteria. Various examples of context information may include data carried by an event notification, data carried by a received request, a current time and date, subscriber objects stored in subscriber storage , network element objects stored in network element storage , data stored in a subscription profile repository, and\/or system operating parameters.","Each rule stored in rule storage  may additionally include one or more results indicating actions to be taken such as, for example, setting an attribute to a particular value when fulfilling a request or terminating a particular session. Upon identifying an applicable rule, rules engine  may return the entire rule or just the rule result to the requesting component for further processing.","Rules engine  may process different rule tables based on the context of the request. For example, rules engine  may only consider rules belonging to a first rule table when a rule result is requested for an IP-CAN session establishment request while rules engine  may only consider rules belonging to a second rule table when a rule result is requested in response to the receipt of an event indication via network monitor interface . Additional rule tables may be defined for other contexts such as, for example, IP-CAN session modification, SPR notifications, rule creation, application function (AF) session creation, AF session modification, and\/or QoS management.","Rule storage  may be any machine-readable medium capable of storing various rule sets for application by rules engine . Accordingly, rule storage  may include a machine-readable storage medium such as read-only memory (ROM), random-access memory (RAM), magnetic disk storage media, optical storage media, flash-memory devices, and\/or similar storage media. In various alternative embodiments, rule storage  may be an external device which may be accessed by one or more network nodes such as network node . An exemplary rule set is described in further detail below with respect to .","Message generator  may include hardware and\/or executable instructions on a machine-readable storage medium configured to generate various messages for transmission to other network nodes via gateway interface . In various embodiments wherein network node  communicates with other nodes using the Diameter protocol, message generator  may be configured to construct reauthorization requests (RARs) and credit control answers (CCAs). Upon instruction by another component such as request handler , for example, message generator may construct a message to install one or more PCC rules at a PGW. Message generator  may additionally or alternatively be configured to propagate event information to other network nodes.","Network monitor interface  may be an interface comprising hardware and\/or executable instructions encoded on a machine-readable storage medium configured to communicate with one or more network monitors such as network monitor . In various embodiments, such communication may include various event reports transmitted by network monitors and may occur according to the representational state transfer (REST) paradigm. Accordingly network monitor interface  may include at least one Ethernet network interface device. In various embodiments, network monitor interface  may be the same component as gateway interface .","Event classifier  may include hardware and\/or executable instructions on a machine-readable storage medium configured to receive an indication of an event via network monitor interface  and forward the indication to an appropriate handler. Accordingly, event classifier  may examine one or more fields of an event indication to determine whether the event is related to a network node, subscriber, or some other entity. For example, event classifier  may include a lookup table that relates the value of an event type field to a proper component for processing the indication. Alternatively, each indication may carry an identifier that specifically indicates that the event is network-related or subscriber-related. Various alternative methods for relating an indication to an appropriate handler will be apparent to those of skill in the art.","Upon determining that a received indication describes a network-related event, event classifier  may forward the indication to network event handler . Likewise, upon determining that a received indication describes a subscriber-related event, event classifier  may forward the indication to subscriber event handler . If the indication is related to a different entity or unrelated to any specific entity, event classifier  may forward the indication to some other appropriate handler component (not shown) or may simply ignore the indication.","Network event handler  may include hardware and\/or executable instructions on a machine-readable storage medium configured to process a received indication of a network-related event. Upon receiving such an indication, network event handler  may identify one or more network elements affected by the event by, for example, extracting one or more network element identifiers from the indication. Network event handler  may then locate the corresponding network element objects in network element storage and update the objects based on the indication. For example, if the indication informs network event handler  that the network is experiencing congestion between network elements 0x4E33 and 0x73AD, network event handler  may update the objects associated with those network elements to reflect the congestion. Thereafter, rules engine  may use the updated objects in making decisions with respect to various sessions.","Network event handler  may additionally or alternatively take immediate action in response to receiving the event indication. For example, network event handler  may request one or more rule results from rules engine  to determine what actions should be taken in response to the event indication. In various embodiments, network event handler  may identify all sessions currently known to network node  as using the affected network nodes or that would otherwise be impacted by the event. Network event handler  may then iterate through each session and request a rule result from rules engine  for each session. Alternatively, rules engine may request one rule result to be applied with respect to all affected sessions. Upon receiving a rule result, network event handler  may initiate performance of any actions specified by the rule result, locally and\/or at other network nodes, including, if appropriate, notifying message generator  that one or more messages should be constructed and transmitted to other network nodes.","Network element storage  may be any machine-readable medium capable of storing objects representing various network elements. Accordingly, network element storage  may include a machine-readable storage medium such as read-only memory (ROM), random-access memory (RAM), magnetic disk storage media, optical storage media, flash-memory devices, and\/or similar storage media. In various alternative embodiments, network element storage  may be an external device which may be accessed by one or more network nodes such as network node . In various embodiments, network element storage  may be the same device as rule storage . An exemplary data structure for storing network element objects is described in further detail below with respect to .","Subscriber event handler  may include hardware and\/or executable instructions on a machine-readable storage medium configured to may include hardware and\/or executable instructions on a machine-readable storage medium configured to process a received indication of a subscriber-related event. Upon receiving such an indication, subscriber event handler  may identify one or more subscribers affected by the event by, for example, extracting one or more subscriber identifiers from the indication. Subscriber event handler  may then locate the corresponding subscriber objects in network element storage and update the objects based on the indication. For example, if the indication informs subscriber event handler  that subscriber 0x563C90 has been identified as a high usage subscriber, subscriber event handler  may update the objects associated with that subscriber to reflect the new status. Thereafter, rules engine  may use the updated object in making decisions with respect to various sessions.","Subscriber event handler  may additionally or alternatively take immediate action in response to receiving the event indication. For example, subscriber event handler  may request one or more rule results from rules engine  to determine what actions should be taken in response to the event indication. In various embodiments, subscriber event handler  may identify all sessions currently known to network node  as being associated with the identified subscriber. Subscriber event handler  may then iterate through each session and request a rule result from rules engine  for each session. Alternatively, rules engine may request one rule result to be applied with respect to all affected sessions. Upon receiving a rule result, subscriber event handler  may initiate performance of any actions specified by the rule result, locally and\/or at other network nodes, including, if appropriate, notifying message generator  that one or more messages should be constructed and transmitted to other network nodes.","Subscriber storage  may be any machine-readable medium capable of storing objects representing various subscribers. Accordingly, subscriber storage  may include a machine-readable storage medium such as read-only memory (ROM), random-access memory (RAM), magnetic disk storage media, optical storage media, flash-memory devices, and\/or similar storage media. In various alternative embodiments, subscriber storage  may be an external device which may be accessed by one or more network nodes such as network node .

In the illustrated example, data arrangement includes network element ID field , congestion field , active mobiles field , signaling events field , and failures field . Various embodiments may omit some of these fields and\/or may include additional fields (not shown).","Network element ID field  may store an identifier for a network element represented by each object. Such network elements may be any type of network element such as, for example, a base station, radio network controller, home agent, SGW, PGW, and\/or cells or sectors associated with such equipment. Congestion field  may indicate the presence of congestion with respect to the network element represented by an object. For example, congestion field  may include a set of network element identifiers, indicating that congestion has been reported between the element represented by the object and the elements identified in the set. Alternatively, congestion  may store a congestion intensity along with each network element identifier or may simply indicate the presence of congestion without specifying any additional network element identifiers.","Active mobiles field  may store a count of mobile devices currently being served by the network element. Signaling events field  may store a count of signaling events observed with respect to the network element. Such count may be a total count of signaling events observed since installation or since the last reset or may be a count of signaling events observed over a most recent predefined time window. Failures field  may store a count of failures observed with respect to the network element. Like signaling events field , such count may be a total count of signaling failures observed since installation or since the last reset or may be a count of failures observed over a most recent predefined time window.","As an example, network element object  indicates that NE 0x4E33 is currently serving 15 mobile devices, has experienced 23 signaling events, and has had 4 failures. NE 0x4E33 is currently experiencing congestion on its link toward NE 0x73AB. As another example, network element object  indicates that NE 0x73AB is currently serving 65 mobile devices, has experienced 43 signaling events, and has had 5 failures. NE 0x73AB is also experiencing congestion on its links toward NEs 0x4E33 and 0x540D. As yet another example, network element object  indicates that NE 0xF406 is not currently experiencing any congestion, is currently serving 9 mobile devices, has experienced 24 signaling events, and has had 1 failure.

Various embodiments may omit some of these fields and\/or may include additional fields (not shown).","Subscriber ID field  may store an identifier for a subscriber represented by an object. In various embodiments, each subscriber may be associated with multiple types of identifiers. In such embodiments, data arrangement may include multiple subscriber id fields (not shown) for storing such varying subscriber identifiers. Anomalies field  may store a set of anomalies detected for each subscriber. In various embodiments, anomalies field  may also store a reported intensity along with each anomaly. Such reported anomalies may include, for example, identification as a high usage subscriber or detection of a port scan.","As an example, subscriber object  indicates that subscriber 0x563C90 has been identified as a high usage subscriber.

Each rule table may include a number of rules that may be applicable in particular contexts. For example, rule table  includes a number of rules that may be applied in response to a network node receiving an indication of an event from a network monitor such as network monitor . As another example, rule table  includes a number of rules that may be applied in response to a request for establishment of a session. Rule set  may include numerous additional rule tables .","Each rule table may include a plurality of rules. Each rule may include a number of fields. For example, in the illustrated rule tables, each rule includes a criteria field  and a result field . Criteria field  may store a number of conditions that, if present, indicate that a particular rule is applicable. Such conditions may make use of a variety of context information, including any information carried by an event indication received from a network monitor, network element objects, and\/or subscriber objects. Result field  may indicate one or more actions that should be performed when a rule is applicable. Such actions may include terminating a session, moving a session, throttling a connection, and\/or using a particular value for an attribute such as a QoS attribute.","The rules within each rule set may be ordered in terms of precedence. Accordingly, if multiple criteria are met for multiple rules, a rules engine may only return the first matching rule as such a rule may carry the highest precedence. In various alternative embodiments, however, rules engine may be configured to return all matching rules, rather than only the highest precedence rule.","As an example, rule table  includes a number of rules. Rule  may indicate that if a reported event indicates that a subscriber has been identified as a peer-to-peer user, peer-to-peer sessions associated with that subscriber should be throttled to 10% of the bandwidth normally available to that subscriber. Rule  may indicate that if a reported event indicates that a subscriber has been identified as a high usage subscriber and if any NE serving that subscriber is currently congested, the subscriber sessions should be moved so they are served by a different NE. Rule  may indicate that if a reported event indicates that a particular NE is congested, any sessions associated with the NE should be reauthorized. Such reauthorization may include additional invocations of the rules engine under a session reauthorization context.

Rule  may indicate that if an NE that would serve the session is currently identified as congested and if the requesting subscriber has a subscriber category of \u201cGold,\u201d the session should be established as normal. Rule  may indicate that if an NE that would serve the session is currently identified as congested, the session should be established but throttled to 80% of the bandwidth normally available to that subscriber for such a session. Note here that, in various embodiments implementing rule precedence, rule  may only be evaluated if the criteria for rule  are not met.

If the event notification indicates a network-related event, method  may proceed to step  where network node  may locate and update one or more NE objects in view of the reported event. For example, if the event indicates congestion between two NEs, network node  may update the objects associated with those NEs to reflect the congestion.

After constructing this group, method  may proceed to step .","If, on the other hand, network node  determines at step  that the event notification does not indicate a network-related event, method  may instead proceed to step , where network node  may determine whether the event notification includes an indication of a subscriber-related event.

Next, in step , network node  may update an object associated with the subscriber identified by the event notification. For example, if the event notification indicates that a subscriber has been identified as a high usage subscriber, network node  may update the object the represents that subscriber to reflect the new status. Method  may then proceed to step  where network node  identifies a group of sessions established by, or otherwise associated with, the affected subscriber. After constructing this group, method  may proceed to step .","If, on the other hand, network node  determines at step  that the event notification does not indicate a subscriber-related event, method  may instead proceed to step , where network node  may perform other processing with respect to the event. For example, network node  may store an indication of the event in some other data structure and\/or invoke the rules engine with regard to a number of affected sessions. After completion of such processing, method  may end in step .","In step , network node  may retrieve a session from the group of sessions (created in either step  or ) to process. Next, in step , network node  may invoke the rules engine with respect to the session. Thus, network node  may retrieve a rule result indicating a particular action to take with respect to the session. Accordingly, in step , network node  may take any actions specified by the rule result such as, for example, modifying a PCC rule or terminating a connection. Next, in step , network node  may determine whether the just-processed session was the last session in the group. If more sessions remain to be processed, method  may loop back to step . Otherwise, method  may proceed to end in step .","Having described exemplary components and methods for the operation of exemplary network  and network node , an example of the operation of exemplary network  and network node  will now be provided with reference to . For the purposes of this example, network node  may correspond to session management node ; data arrangement  may indicate the contents of network element storage ; data arrangement  may indicate the contents of subscriber storage ; rule set  may indicate the contents of rule storage ; and method  may describe the operation of network node .","The process may begin in step , where event classifier  receives an event indication from network monitor  via network monitor interface . Event classifier  extracts an event type from the event indication and determines that the event is a congestion event, which is a network-related event. Accordingly, event classifier  passes the event indication to network event handler . Network event handler  extracts two network element identifiers, 0x73AB and 0xF406, from the event indication and updates network element objects  and  accordingly in step . In particular, network event handler  updates congestion field  of network element object  to store the set {0x4E33; 0x540D; 0xF406}. Likewise, network event handler  updates congestion field  of network element object  to store the set {0x73AB}. Network event handler  determines that only a single session is served by these two NEs and requests a rule result from rules engine  in step  with respect to that session. Rules engine  then evaluates rule table  because the request for a rule result was made in response to a network monitor event. Rules engine  determines that rule  is applicable to the current context because the event indication was of a congested NE. Accordingly, rules engine indicates that the session should be reauthorized. Thus, in step , network event handler  may take additional steps necessary or useful in reauthorizing a session such as, for example, invoking the rules engine for additional instruction and\/or instructing message generator  to install an updated PCC rule at an appropriate PGW.","Subsequently, subscriber 0x563C90 may request establishment of a new session. Accordingly, request handler  may receive this request via gateway interface . In fulfilling the request, request handler may request a rule result from rules engine . This time, rules engine  may evaluate rule table  because the request for a rule result was made in response to a request for a new session. Rule engine  may determine that, because subscriber object  indicates that subscriber 0x563C90 is a high usage subscriber, rule  is applicable. Thus, rule engine  may indicate to request handler that the session should be established but throttled to 50% of the bandwidth that would otherwise be provided. Request handler  may then construct a PCC rule accordingly and instruct message generator  to install the PCC rule at PGW .","According to the foregoing, various embodiments enable the intelligent management of a network, responsive to various network- and subscriber-related events. In particular, by analyzing reported events and storing indications of such events in relation to network elements and subscribers, a network node may take such information into account during its normal operation. Further, by invoking a rules engine upon receipt of an event report with respect to affected sessions, a network node may take immediate remedial action.","It should be apparent from the foregoing description that various exemplary embodiments of the invention may be implemented in hardware and\/or firmware.
