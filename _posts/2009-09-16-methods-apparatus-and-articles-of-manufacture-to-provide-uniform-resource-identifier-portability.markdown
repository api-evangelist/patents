{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This disclosure relates generally to communication networks and, more particularly, to methods, apparatus and articles of manufacture to provide uniform resource identifier (URI) portability for communication networks.","In communication networks, such as Internet Protocol (IP) Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) networks, communication sessions are routed through a communication network from an originating device (e.g., a voice over IP (VoIP) telephone, plain old telephone service (POTS) telephone, mobile phone and\/or cellular phone) to a terminating device (e.g., a VoIP telephone, a POTS telephone, mobile phone and\/or cellular phone). Server-based URIs are widely used in IMS networks to route communication sessions. An example server-based URI is john.doe@serviceprovider.net, where john.doe identifies a particular subscriber and serviceprovider.net identifies the host and\/or service provider that provides one or more communication services to john.doe via that server-based URI.","Example methods, apparatus and articles of manufacture to provide uniform resource identifier (URI) portability for communication networks are disclosed. A disclosed example method includes receiving a first communication session initiation message identifying a called party, identifying a URI associated with the called party, querying a global URI database based on the URI to identify a domain name associated with a service provider network based on the URI, and sending a second communication session initiation message including the URI to the service provider network via the domain name.","A disclosed example call session control function server (CSCF) of a first Internet Protocol (IP) Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) network includes a client to query a global URI server based on a URI associated with a called party to identify a domain name associated with a second IMS network, and a session initiation protocol (SIP) interface to receive a first SIP INVITE message identifying the called party, and to send a second SIP INVITE message including the called party URI to the second IMS network via the domain name.","A disclosed example apparatus includes a machine accessible memory, an data structure stored on the machine accessible memory, the data structure defining a plurality of service provider domain names for respective ones of a plurality of terminating party uniform resource identifiers, and a database interface to query the data structure to determine at the apparatus a terminating network for a communication session initiation message based on the data structure.","Another disclosed example method includes receiving a query request identifying a URI associated with a terminating party of a communication service initiation request, querying a URI portability database based on the URI to identify a domain name associated with a service provider network, and sending a query response message identifying the domain name.","In the interest of brevity and clarity, throughout the following disclosure references will be made to an example IMS-based communication system  implemented using SIP messages and\/or SIP-based message exchanges. However, the methods, apparatus and articles of manufacture described herein to provide URI portability are applicable to any number and\/or type(s) of additional and\/or alternative communication systems and\/or networks implemented using any number and\/or type(s) of additional and\/or alternative devices, servers, network technologies, network topologies and\/or network protocols. Moreover, while the examples disclosed herein are described with reference to voice over Internet protocol (VoIP) communication services, the methods, apparatus and articles of manufacture may be used to provide URI portability for any number and\/or type(s) of additional and\/or alternative communication services, IMS-based or otherwise. Other example communication services include, but are not limited to, Internet services, data services, messaging services, instant messaging services, electronic mail (email) services, chat services, video services, audio services, gaming services, etc.","The example IMS-based communication system  of  includes any number and\/or type(s) of VoIP user devices, two of which are designated at reference numerals  and . Example VoIP user devices  and  include, but are not limited to, an IMS (e.g., VoIP) phone, a VoIP residential gateway, a VoIP enabled personal computer (PC), a VoIP endpoint, a wireless VoIP device (e.g., a wireless-fidelity (WiFi) Internet protocol (IP) phone, a 3G cellular VoIP phone, and\/or a 4G Cellular VOIP phone), a VoIP adapter (e.g., an analog telephone adapter (ATA)), a VoIP enabled personal digital assistant (PDA), and\/or a VoIP kiosk. The example VoIP devices  and  of  may be implemented and\/or be found at any number and\/or type(s) of location(s). Further, the VoIP devices  and  may be fixed location devices, substantially fixed location devices and\/or mobile devices. Further, the VoIP devices  and  may have equipment communicatively and\/or electrically coupled to them. For example, a VoIP ATA may be coupled to a telephone, and\/or a VoIP residential gateway may be coupled to a PC and\/or set-top box.","To provide communication services to and\/or between VoIP devices, such as the example VoIP devices  and , the example IMS based communication system  of  includes any number and\/or type(s) of IMS networks, three of which are designated in  with reference numerals ,  and . While not shown in , the example IMS networks  and  can be implemented similarly to the example IMS network .","When a communication session (e.g., a telephone call) is initiated from a calling device to a called device, the originating IMS network associated with the calling device needs to identify the terminating IMS network associated with the called device. Traditionally, the terminating IMS network is identified by and\/or within a called party URI associated with the called device. An example server-based called party URI as defined by Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Request for Comment (RFC) 2396 is john.doe@serviceprovider.net, where john.doe identifies the called device and\/or called party (e.g., John Doe) associated with the called device, and serviceprovider.net identifies the terminating IMS network that provides the requested communication service to John Doe via that server-based URI. In such examples, the called party URI represents a fixed association of the called device to that service provider. Thus, when a subscriber changes service providers (as shown in ), their associated called party URI has to change. For example, John Doe's URI might change to john.doe@newserviceprovider2.net. Whenever John Doe changes service providers, he must notify other subscribers of his new called party URI in order for them to continue to initiate communication sessions to his device.","To overcome at least these deficiencies, the example communication system  of  includes a global URI server  that facilitates URI portability for and\/or between the example IMS networks -. As described in detail below, the example global URI server  of  hosts, contains and\/or implements a global URI portability database  that associates called and\/or terminating party URIs, and\/or called and\/or terminating device URIs with service provider and\/or IMS network host and\/or domain names. The example global URI server  and the example global URI portability database  of  enable the originating IMS network  to identify the terminating IMS network ,  associated with a called device  based on a global and\/or non-service provider specific called and\/or terminating device and\/or party URI associated with and\/or assigned to the called and\/or terminating device . The VoIP device  of  is associated with a global and\/or portable URI of john.doe@globalURIexample1.net, where globalURIexample1.net indicates that the URI is not associated with any particular service provider. When the originating IMS network  is to initiate a communication service to that global called and\/or terminating party URI, the example IMS network  queries the global URI server  to identify the service provider host and\/or domain name (e.g., serviceprovider2.net) associated with the service provider and\/or IMS network  that is currently providing communication services to the called and\/or terminating device . As illustrated in , even though John Doe changed service providers from IMS network  to IMS network , his associated global called and\/or terminating party URI (john.doe@globalURIexample1.net) remains the same, only the association of that global URI to a different service provider domain name (serviceprovider2.net rather than serviceprovider.net) within the global URI portability database  need change. By resolving the called party's global URI to a terminating IMS network and\/or service provider domain name, the example communication system of  provides and\/or implements URI portability within the communication system , and obviates the need for John Doe to notify other users and\/or subscribers whenever he changes service providers. While a single global URI server  is illustrated in , the communication system  may include any number of geographically distributed, redundant and\/or backup global URI servers . An example manner of implementing the example global URI server  and the example global URI portability database  are described below in connection with , respectively.","To provide IMS communication services throughout and\/or within a site, location, building, geographic area and\/or geographic region, the example IMS-based communication system  of  includes any number and\/or type(s) of access networks, one of which is designated in  with reference number . The example access network  of  provides and\/or facilitates a communicative coupling of the VoIP user device  to and\/or with the IMS network , which provides and\/or enables IMS communication services (e.g., telephone services, Internet services, data services, messaging services, instant messaging services, electronic mail (email) services, chat services, video services, audio services, gaming services, voicemail, facsimile services, etc.) to the VoIP device . In some examples, a VoIP device  may access the IMS network  without use of the access network . The example access network  of  can be implemented using any number and\/or type(s) of past, present and\/or future standards, specifications, communication devices, networks, technologies and\/or systems, such as public switched telephone network (PSTN) systems, public land mobile network (PLMN) systems (e.g., cellular), wireless distribution systems, wired or cable distribution systems, coaxial cable distribution systems, Ultra High Frequency (UHF)\/Very High Frequency (VHF) radio frequency systems, satellite or other extra-terrestrial systems, cellular distribution systems, power-line broadcast systems, fiber optic networks, and\/or any combinations and\/or hybrids of these devices, systems and\/or networks. While in the illustrated example of , the example VoIP device  is depicted as having an associated access network , such a depiction is merely illustrative. For example, a VoIP device  may be configured and\/or capable to utilize more than one access network  at the same and\/or different times, a VoIP device  may be configured to access the IMS network  directly and\/or via an IP network  without an intervening access network , etc.","In the example IMS-based communication system  of , the example VoIP device  is communicatively coupled to the example IMS network  via the example access network , and\/or any number and\/or type(s) of private and\/or public IP based communication networks such as, for example, the Internet, one of which is illustrated in  with reference numeral . While in the illustrated example of , the example VoIP device  is depicted as having an associated IP network , such a depiction is merely illustrative. For example, the example VoIP device  may be configured and\/or capable to utilize more than one IP network  at the same and\/or different times, etc. In general, the example IP network  of  provides and\/or facilitates a communicative coupling of the VoIP device  to and\/or with the IMS network .","While not shown in  for clarity of illustration and discussion, the example IMS networks  and  of  can have any number and\/or type(s) of associated access network(s) and\/or IP network(s) via which VoIP devices (e.g., the example VoIP device ) can be communicatively coupled to the IMS networks  and .","In some examples, the VoIP device  is communicatively coupled to the access network , the example IP network  and\/or, more generally, the example IMS network  via one or more additional IP-based networks and\/or devices (not shown), such as a local area network (LAN), a gateway and\/or a router located within a place of business, a school and\/or a residence. For instance, the example VoIP device  may be coupled to the example access network , the example IP network , and\/or the example IMS network  via any type(s) of voice-band modem(s), digital subscriber line (DSL) modem(s), cable modem(s), Ethernet transceiver(s), optical transceiver(s), IP virtual private network (VPN) connection(s), Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.11x (a.k.a. WiFi) transceiver(s), IEEE 802.16 (a.k.a. WiMax), wireless local area network (WLAN) access point(s), general packet radio services (GPRS) networks in 3G wireless networks, etc. Further, any or all of the example IMS network , the example access network , and\/or the example IP network  of  may extend geographically to include one or more locations near to and\/or encompassing one or more of the VoIP device . For example, the access network  may include a wireless access point (not shown) by which, for example, a WiFi IP phone  connects to the IP network  and the IMS network .","In the example IMS-based communication system  of , the example access network , the example IP network , and the IMS networks - need not be owned, implemented, and\/or operated by a single service provider. For example, the VoIP device  may access IMS services provided by the IMS network  that is owned, operated and\/or implemented by a first service provider via the access network , which is owned, operated and\/or implemented by a different service provider. Additionally or alternatively, the IMS networks - may be owned, operated and\/or implemented by the same or different service providers. However, any or all of the access network , the IMS networks - and\/or the IP network  may be operated by the same service provider.","In the illustrated example IMS-based communication system  of , each VoIP device (e.g., the example VoIP device ) that is registered to the example IMS network  is associated with and\/or assigned to a serving call session control function (S-CSCF) server (one of which are designated in  with reference numeral ). The example S-CSCF server  of  is responsible for handling incoming and\/or outgoing IMS (e.g., VoIP) communication sessions (e.g., telephone calls, and\/or data and\/or video sessions) associated with its registered VoIP devices. An example manner of implementing the example S-CSCF  of  is described below in connection with .","While one S-CSCF server  is illustrated in , the example IMS network  may include any number and\/or type(s) of S-CSCF servers, and each such S-CSCF server may support any number and\/or type(s) of VoIP devices . The example S-CSCF server  of  performs session control, maintains session states and\/or enables communications with call feature servers (not shown) for its associated and\/or registered VoIP devices . For instance, when the calling VoIP device  initiates, for example, an outgoing telephone call to the example VoIP device , a communication session initiation message (e.g., a SIP INVITE message) is routed by the IMS network  from the VoIP device  to the S-CSCF server  associated with the VoIP device .","To locate and\/or identify the VoIP device and\/or endpoint (e.g., the example VoIP device ) associated with a called telephone number, the example IMS network  of  includes any number of ENUM servers, one of which is designated in  with reference numeral . Based upon an ENUM query request message received from the example S-CSCF server , the example ENUM server  of  performs a lookup and\/or query in an ENUM database (not shown) that stores associations of called party identifiers (e.g., E.164 telephone numbers) to one or more called party URIs. However, the ENUM database may store any number and\/or type(s) of associations between any number and\/or type(s) of identifiers.","In response to a communication session initiation message (e.g., a SIP INVITE message) including a called telephone number (e.g., in a Tel URI format as described in IETF RFC 3966 and\/or or in SIP URI representation of a Tel URI format), the example S-CSCF server  of  sends an ENUM query request message to the example ENUM server  to obtain the called and\/or terminating party URI associated with the called telephone number. The URI obtained from the example ENUM server  is used by the S-CSCF server  to establish the requested communication session to the called device. In response to a communication session initiating message including a called party SIP URI, the example S-CSCF server  need not query the example ENUM server .","When the called and\/or terminating party's URI (e.g., john.doe@serviceprovider.net) obtained either from the ENUM server  or from the communication session initiation request message includes, specifies and\/or identifies a domain name associated with a particular service provider and\/or terminating IMS network ,  for the called device, the example S-CSCF server  of  establishes the requested communication session via the service provider and\/or terminating IMS network ,  identified in the called party's URI.","When the called party's URI (e.g., john.doe@globalURIexample1.net) includes a domain name that is not specific to any service provider and\/or terminating IMS network , , a global URI client  () of the example S-CSCF server  obtains a service provider domain name for the current service provider and\/or terminating IMS network ,  associated with the called party URI by querying the example global URI server . The example S-CSCF server  establishes the requested communication session via the service provider domain name obtained from the global URI server .","In some examples, the S-CSCF server  compares the domain name contained in a called party's URI with a list of domain names associated with global and\/or portable URIs. When the domain name contained in a called party's URI is included in this list, the S-CSCF server  queries the global URI server  to obtain the service provider domain name. Additionally or alternatively, the S-CSCF server  queries the global URI server  for each called party URI. If the called party URI is a global and\/or portable URI, the global-URI server  returns the domain name of the terminating service provider. If the called party URI is not a global and\/or portable URI, the global-URI server  returns the domain name contained in the called party URI. Alternatively, the global-URI server  can return a flag indicating that the S-CSCF server  should handle the requested communication session to the called party URI in accordance with any past, present and\/or future communication session initiation protocol.","Upon receipt of a communication session initiation message directed to a global and\/or portable URI, the example terminating IMS networks  and  maps the received global and\/or portable URI to a URI and\/or device identifier associated with the called VoIP device .","To provide an access entry point for a VoIP device (e.g., the example VoIP device ) into the IMS network , the example IMS network  of  includes any number and\/or type(s) of proxy call session control function (P-CSCF) servers, one of which is designated in  with reference numeral . The example P-CSCF server  of , among other things, routes SIP messages between VoIP devices and their associated S-CSCF server .","To facilitate communication between devices (e.g., the example VoIP device ) of the example IMS network  and devices of other communication networks, such as the example IMS networks  and , a public land mobile network (PLMN) (e.g., a cellular communication network), a public switched telephone network (PSTN), etc., the example IMS network  includes any number and\/or type(s) of gateway(s), border element(s), and\/or interworking elements, one of which is designated at reference numeral . When a called party is associated with a device  that is not associated with the IMS network  (e.g., a PSTN device, a PLMN device and\/or a VoIP device served by a different IMS and\/or VoIP network), data and\/or protocol messages directed to the destination are routed via the example interworking element . While a single interworking element  is illustrated in , it will be understood that any number and\/or type(s) of interworking elements  may be implemented by the example IMS network  to facilitate communication between the IMS network  and any number and\/or type(s) of other communication networks. Example interworking elements  include, but are not limited to, a media gateway and\/or a peered border element.","As illustrated in , the example S-CSCF server , the example ENUM server , the example P-SCSCF server , and\/or the example interworking element  communicate and\/or are communicatively coupled via any number, type(s) and\/or combination of communication paths, communication networks, busses and\/or communication devices .","While an example IMS-based VoIP communication system  and an example IMS network  have been illustrated in , the devices, networks, systems, servers and\/or processors illustrated in  may be combined, divided, re-arranged, eliminated and\/or implemented in any way. For example, it will be readily appreciated by persons of ordinary skill in the art that the example global URI server , the example global URI portability database , the example S-CSCF server , the example global URI client , the example ENUM server , the example P-SCSCF server , and\/or the example interworking element  illustrated in  are logical entities of the example IMS network . They may, therefore, be implemented separately and\/or in any combination using, for example, machine accessible instructions executed by one or more computing devices and\/or computing platforms (e.g., the example processing platform P of ). Further, the example VoIP devices  and , the example global URI server , the example global URI portability database , the example S-CSCF server , the example global URI client , the example ENUM server , the example P-SCSCF server , the example interworking element  and\/or, more generally, the example IMS network  may be implemented by hardware, software, firmware and\/or any combination of hardware, software and\/or firmware. Thus, for example, any of the example VoIP devices  and , the example global URI server , the example global URI portability database , the example S-CSCF server , the example global URI client , the example ENUM server , the example P-SCSCF server , the example interworking element  and\/or, more generally, the example IMS network  may be implemented by one or more circuit(s), programmable processor(s), application specific integrated circuit(s) (ASIC(s)), programmable logic device(s) (PLD(s)) and\/or field programmable logic device(s) (FPLD(s)), etc. Further still, the example IMS-based VoIP communication system  and\/or the example IMS network  may include additional devices, servers, systems, networks, gateways, portals, and\/or processors in addition to, or instead of, those illustrated in , and\/or may include more than one of any or all of the illustrated devices, servers, networks, systems, gateways, portals, and\/or processors. For example, an IMS network  may include any number and\/or type(s) of interrogating call session control function (I-CSCF) servers, home subscriber server(s) (HSSs), media gateways, media gateway control function (MGCF) servers, breakout gateway control function (BGCF) severs, soft switches, feature servers, application servers, and\/or session border controllers.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["135","135","135","210","210","135"]},"To interact with an ENUM server (e.g., the example ENUM server  of ), the example S-CSCF server  of  includes an ENUM client . The example ENUM client  of  is used to send an ENUM query message to an ENUM server and\/or to receive an ENUM query response message from the ENUM server. An example ENUM client  is implemented in accordance with Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Request for Comment (RFC) 3761.","To process and\/or handle SIP messages, the example S-CSCF  of  includes SIP server logic .

For example, when a communication session request is received from a calling party at the S-CSCF , the example SIP server logic  of  can perform an ENUM lookup for a called telephone number by sending an ENUM query message to an ENUM server (e.g., the example ENUM server  of ) via the example ENUM client  to obtain an associated called and\/or terminating party URI.","To obtain a service provider domain name associated with a global and\/or portable called and\/or terminating party URI, the example S-CSCF server  of  includes the example global URI client .
