For example, FreeStyle Navigator\u00ae Continuous Glucose Monitoring System available from Abbott Diabetes Care Inc., provides diabetes management tools for monitoring glucose levels of a patient over an extended time period using a subcutaneous analyte sensor, for example, in contact with interstitial fluid of the patient. Such devices and systems provide real time glucose information to the patient to assist in improving glycemic control. Also available are infusion devices such as external insulin pumps which are programmable to deliver insulin based on a programmed delivery profile to diabetic patients, for example. Typically, such pumps are programmed to deliver a predetermined basal delivery profile, and periodically administer user specified bolus dosage or temporary basal delivery.","In recent years, developments have been on going in closed loop therapy systems which automate the control of the insulin delivery based on real time feedback of the patient's glucose levels. There are known closed loop control algorithms that are intended to model artificial pancreas to provide a fully automated and integrated system of glucose monitoring and insulin delivery.","With the development of different algorithms for closed loop control as well as glucose monitoring systems and infusion devices, integration of such components to provide compatibility has become a challenge.","In view of the foregoing, a closed loop system interface device and methods are provided in accordance with various embodiments of the present disclosure which provide compatibility with any developing closed loop algorithm, and integration with the analyte monitoring system.","In one aspect, method and apparatus for calling a programmed function in conjunction with execution of one or more commands related to a closed loop control algorithm, receiving one or more data in response to the one or more commands over a data interface, and executing the one or more commands related to the closed loop control algorithm based on the received one or more data are provided.","These and other objects, features and advantages of the present disclosure will become more fully apparent from the following detailed description of the embodiments, the appended claims and the accompanying drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","110","130","170","170","150","150","160","120","150","140"]},"Referring to , in one embodiment of the present disclosure, the transmitter unit  is configured for unidirectional wireless communication over the communication path  to the analyte monitor unit .

The analyte monitor unit  may be configured to receive the signals from the transmitter unit  and in one embodiment, is configured to perform data storage and processing based on one or more preprogrammed or predetermined processes.","For example, in one embodiment, the analyte monitor unit  is configured to store the received signals associated with analyte levels in a data storage unit (not shown). Alternatively, or in addition, the analyte monitor unit  may be configured to process the signals associated with the analyte levels to generate trend indication by, for example, visual display of a line chart or an angular icon based display for output display on its display unit . Additional information may be output displayed on the display unit  of the analyte monitor unit  including, but not limited to, the substantially contemporaneous and real time analyte level of the patient received from the transmitter unit  as detected by the sensor .

The concentration of drugs, such as, for example, antibiotics (e.g., gentamicin, vancomycin, and the like), digitoxin, digoxin, drugs of abuse, theophylline, and warfarin, may also be determined.","Referring back to , the sensor  may include a short term (for example, 3 day, 5 day or 7 day use) analyte sensor which is replaced after its intended useful life. Moreover, in one embodiment, the sensor  is configured to be positioned subcutaneous to the skin of the patient such that at least a portion of the analyte sensor is maintained in fluid contact with the patient's analyte such as, for example, interstitial fluid or blood. In addition, the cannula , which is configured to similarly be positioned under the patient's skin, is connected to the infusion tubing  of the infusion device  so as to deliver medication such as insulin to the patient. Moreover, in one embodiment, the cannula  is configured to be replaced with the replacement of the sensor .","In one aspect of the present disclosure, the cannula  and the sensor  may be configured to be subcutaneously positioned under the skin of the patient using an insertion mechanism (not shown) such as an insertion gun which may include, for example, a spring biased or loaded insertion mechanism to substantially accurately position the cannula  and the sensor  under the patient's skin. In this manner, the cannula  and the sensor  may be subcutaneously positioned with substantially little or no perceived pain by the patient. Alternatively, the cannula  and\/or the sensor  may be configured to be manually inserted by the patient through the patient's skin. After positioning the cannula  and the sensor , they may be substantially firmly retained in position by an adhesive layer  which is configured to adhere to the skin of the patient for the duration of the time period during which the sensor  and the cannula  are subcutaneously positioned.","Moreover, in one embodiment, the transmitter unit  may be mounted after the subcutaneous positioning of the sensor  and the cannula  so as to be in electrical contact with the sensor electrodes. Similarly, the infusion tubing  may be configured to operatively couple to the housing of the transmitter unit  so as to be in accurately positioned for alignment with the cannula  and to provide a substantially water tight seal.

In a further embodiment, the bolus calculation capabilities may also be provided in the analyte monitor unit .","In one embodiment, the analyte monitor unit  is configured with a substantially compact housing that can be easily carried by the patient. In addition, the infusion device  similarly may be configured as a substantially compact device which can be easily and conveniently worn on the patient's clothing (for example, housed in a holster or a carrying device worn or clipped to the patient's belt or other parts of the clothing). Referring yet again to , the analyte monitor unit  and\/or the infusion device  may include a user interface such as information input mechanism ,  by the patient as well as data output including, for example, the display unit  on the analyte monitor unit , or similarly a display unit  on the infusion device .","One or more audio output devices such as, for example, speakers or buzzers may be integrated with the housing of the infusion device  and\/or the analyte monitor unit  so as to output audible alerts or alarms based on the occurrence of one or more predetermined conditions associated with the infusion device  or the analyte monitor unit . For example, the infusion device  may be configured to output an audible alarm or alert to the patient upon detection of an occlusion in the infusion tubing  or the occurrence of a timed event such as a reminder to prime the infusion tubing upon replacement of the cannula , and the like. The analyte monitor unit  may similarly be configured to output an audible alarm or alert when a predetermined condition or a pre-programmed event occurs, such as, for example, a reminder to replace the sensor  after its useful life (of 3 days, 5 days or 7 days), or one or more alerts associated with the data received from the transmitter unit  corresponding to the patient's monitored analyte levels. Such alerts or alarms may include a warning alert to the patient that the detected analyte level is beyond a predetermined threshold level, or the trend of the detected analyte levels within a given time period is indicative of a significant condition such as potential hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia, which require attention or corrective action. It is to be noted that the examples of audible alarms and\/or alerts are described above for illustrative purposes only, that within the scope of the present disclosure, other events or conditions may be programmed into the infusion device  or the analyte monitor unit  or both, so as to alert or notify the patient of the occurrence or the potential occurrence of such events or conditions.","In addition, within the scope of the present disclosure, audible alarms may be output alone, or in combination with one or more of a visual alert such as an output display on the display unit ,  of the infusion device  or the analyte monitor unit , respectively, or vibratory alert which would provide a tactile indication to the patient of the associated alarm and\/or alert.","Moreover, referring yet again to , while one analyte monitor unit  and one transmitter unit  are shown, within the scope of the present disclosure, additional analyte monitor units or transmitter units may be provided such that, for example, the transmitter unit  may be configured to transmit to multiple analyte monitor units substantially simultaneously. Alternatively, multiple transmitter units coupled to multiple sensors concurrently in fluid contact with the patient's analyte may be configured to transmit to the analyte monitor unit , or to multiple analyte monitor units. For example, an additional transmitter unit coupled to an additional sensor may be provided in the integrated infusion device and analyte monitoring system  which does not include the cannula , and which may be used to perform functions associated with the sensor  such as sensor calibration, sensor data verification, and the like.","In one embodiment, the transmitter unit  is configured to transmit the sampled data signals received from the sensor  without acknowledgement from the analyte monitor unit  that the transmitted sampled data signals have been received. For example, the transmitter unit  may be configured to transmit the encoded sampled data signals at a fixed rate (e.g., at one minute intervals) after the completion of the initial power on procedure. Likewise, the analyte monitor unit  may be configured to detect such transmitted encoded sampled data signals at predetermined time intervals. Alternatively, the transmitter unit  and the analyte monitor unit  may be configured for bi-directional communication over the communication path .","Additionally, in one aspect, the analyte monitor unit  may include two sections. The first section of the analyte monitor unit  may include an analog interface section that is configured to communicate with the transmitter unit  via the communication path . In one embodiment, the analog interface section may include an RF receiver and an antenna for receiving and amplifying the data signals from the transmitter unit , which are thereafter, demodulated with a local oscillator and filtered through a band-pass filter. The second section of the analyte monitor unit  may include a data processing section which is configured to process the data signals received from the transmitter unit  such as by performing data decoding, error detection and correction, data clock generation, and data bit recovery, for example.","In operation, upon completing the power-on procedure, the analyte monitor unit  is configured to detect the presence of the transmitter unit  within its range based on, for example, the strength of the detected data signals received from the transmitter unit  or a predetermined transmitter identification information. Upon successful synchronization with the transmitter unit , the analyte monitor unit  is configured to begin receiving from the transmitter unit  data signals corresponding to the patient's detected analyte, for example glucose, levels.","Referring again to , the analyte monitor unit  or the infusion device , or both may be configured to further communicate with a data processing terminal (not shown) which may include a desktop computer terminal, a data communication enabled kiosk, a laptop computer, a handheld computing device such as a personal digital assistant (PDAs), or a data communication enabled mobile telephone, and the like, each of which may be configured for data communication via a wired or a wireless connection. The data processing terminal for example may include physician's terminal and\/or a bedside terminal in a hospital environment, for example.","The communication path  for data communication between the transmitter unit  and the analyte monitor unit  of  may include an RF communication link, Bluetooth\u00ae communication link, infrared communication link, or any other type of suitable wireless communication connection between two or more electronic devices. The data communication link may also include a wired cable connection such as, for example, but not limited to, an RS232 connection, USB connection, or serial cable connection.","Referring yet again to , in a further aspect of the present disclosure, the analyte monitor unit  or the infusion device  (or both) may also include a test strip port configured to receive a blood glucose test strip for discrete sampling of the patient's blood for glucose level determination. An example of the functionality of blood glucose test strip meter unit may be found in Freestyle Blood Glucose Meter available from the assignee of the present disclosure, Abbott Diabetes Care Inc.","In the manner described above, in one embodiment of the present disclosure, the cannula  for infusing insulin or other suitable medication is integrated with the adhesive patch  for the sensor  and the transmitter unit  of the analyte monitoring system. Accordingly, only one on-skin patch can be worn by the patient (for example, on the skin of the abdomen) rather than two separate patches for the infusion device cannula , and the analyte monitoring system sensor  (with the transmitter unit ). Thus, the Type-1 diabetic patient may conveniently implement infusion therapy in conjunction with real time glucose monitoring while minimizing potential skin irritation on the adhesive patch  site on the patient's skin, and thus provide more insertion sites with less irritation.","In addition, the integrated infusion device and analyte monitoring system  as shown in  may be configured such that the infusion tubing  may be disconnected from the infusion device  as well as from the housing of the transmitter unit  (or the adhesive patch ) such that, optionally, the patient may configure the system as continuous analyte monitoring system while disabling the infusion device  functionality.","Moreover, in accordance with one embodiment of the present disclosure, the patient may better manage the physiological conditions associated with diabetes by having substantially continuous real time glucose data, trend information based on the substantially continuous real time glucose data, and accordingly, modify or adjust the infusion levels delivered by the infusion device  from the pre-programmed basal profiles that the infusion device  is configured to implement.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["200","210","220","260","240","250","260","250","270"]},"Referring to , the integrated infusion device and analyte monitor unit  is configured to wirelessly communicate with the transmitter unit  over a communication path  such as an RF communication link.
