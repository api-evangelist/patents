{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","FIELD OF THE TECHNOLOGY","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY OF THE DESCRIPTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61\/349,162, filed May 27, 2010, entitled \u201cPRESENTING A NEW USER SCREEN IN RESPONSE TO DETECTION OF A USER MOTION,\u201d by Michael Holzer et al., the entire contents of which application are incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein.","At least some embodiments disclosed herein relate to user interfaces in general, and more particularly, but not limited to, presenting information to a user of an end-user device based on a current state of the end-user device.","Electronic communications between persons for both business and personal use are now extensively used. In addition to e-mail communications and telephone communications, additional forms of communication are common, including instant messaging, social network messaging and commenting, message board posting, and text messaging.","Conventional computing systems and devices are configured to support applications such as e-mail or instant messaging that implement an address book. The address book may be accessed by a user of the application (or by the application itself) for a variety of purposes. Typically, the address book is unique for a given application and may contain unique application specific data.","In conventional applications, each address book entry must be manually entered and maintained by a user. Over time, some entries become outdated due to a lack of regular maintenance, while other entries become obsolete. As the number of contacts grow, the maintenance of the address book may become difficult and time consuming.","Further, access to the address book during regular usage of a personal communication device typically requires that the user manually navigate to an address book screen of the device using a combination of buttons, keys (e.g., keys located on the face of a phone or other user device), and other cursor navigational devices, and\/or the clicking on one or more icons or highlighted regions located on a screen of a user interface of the device. In addition, the foregoing navigation results in the user being presented a different screen in order to access the information in the address book. Finally, the user must typically manually type a few letters corresponding to a person's name in order to search for and obtain that person's information from among all of the typically numerous records stored in the address book.","Systems and methods to present information to a user of an end-user device based on a current state (e.g., user context, mobile device status, and current and\/or historical user actions or user motions such as by using keys on a keyboard or by gestures on a touch screen) of the end-user device. Some embodiments are summarized in this section.","In one embodiment, a method includes: detecting, via a user device (e.g., a mobile phone), a predefined user motion of a user (e.g., a flick of a trackball or gesture on a touch screen); determining a current state of the user device based on at least one characteristic; and in response to detecting the user motion, presenting, via a display of the user device, information (e.g., a person profile) to the user based on the current state.","In another embodiment, a method includes: running an application (e.g., an email application or a voice communications application), on a user device, requested by a user via a user interface of the user device; receiving a request for information from the user associated with use of the application by the user; determining a current state of the user device based on at least one characteristic of the user device; and in response to the request, presenting, via a display of the user device, information to the user based on the current state.","In an alternative embodiment, a method includes: presenting, via a display of an end-user device, a first user interface screen; detecting, via a user input device of the end-user device, a predefined user motion associated with the first screen, wherein the user motion is substantially in a single direction of movement in a plane parallel to the display; and in response to detecting the user motion, presenting a second user interface screen via the display, the second screen including information corresponding to the first screen.","In another alternative embodiment, a method includes: presenting, via a display of an end-user device, a first user interface screen including an input field to identify a person; detecting, via a user input device of the end-user device, a predefined user motion associated with the first screen; in response to detecting the user motion, presenting a second user interface screen via the display, the second screen including a list of persons and further including a search input field configured to initiate a search of stored personal data available for use as a data input for the first screen; and updating the list of persons of the second screen in response to the searching of the stored personal data.","In yet another alternative embodiment, a method includes: presenting, via a display of a mobile device, a first user interface screen including an input field to identify a person; detecting, via a trackball of the mobile device, a predefined user motion associated with the first screen, wherein the user motion is an upward movement on the trackball by a user of the mobile device; in response to detecting the user motion, presenting a second user interface screen via the display, the second screen including a list of persons and corresponding personal data, the personal data being available as input data for the first screen upon selection of a person by the user; receiving a selection by the user of a first person from the list of persons of the second screen; and displaying personal data corresponding to the first person on the first screen.","The disclosure includes methods and apparatuses which perform these methods, including data processing systems and user devices which perform these methods, and computer readable media containing instructions which when executed on data processing systems and user devices cause the systems to perform these methods.","Other features will be apparent from the accompanying drawings and from the detailed description which follows.","The following description and drawings are illustrative and are not to be construed as limiting. Numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding. However, in certain instances, well known or conventional details are not described in order to avoid obscuring the description. References to one or an embodiment in the present disclosure are not necessarily references to the same embodiment; and, such references mean at least one.","Reference in this specification to \u201cone embodiment\u201d or \u201can embodiment\u201d means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the disclosure. The appearances of the phrase \u201cin one embodiment\u201d in various places in the specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment, nor are separate or alternative embodiments mutually exclusive of other embodiments. Moreover, various features are described which may be exhibited by some embodiments and not by others. Similarly, various requirements are described which may be requirements for some embodiments but not other embodiments.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["150","141","143","145","123","141","143","145","150","123","121","150","150","150","123","141","143","145"]},"In addition, server  may communicate with social network site  over network . Server  may, for example, update the address book or personal profile or other personal information stored at server  by accessing and retrieving updated data from social network site , then updating the personal information using the updated data. The updated personal information may be communicated to the user devices (e.g., , , . . . , ).","The address book may be implemented in volatile memory (e.g., RAM) or non-volatile memory (e.g., flash memory) of a computing system (e.g., a personal PC) or a wireless device (e.g., iPhone\u00ae, BlackBerry\u00ae, Treo\u00ae, etc.), in an element external to the computing system or wireless device through a network (e.g., a server or host PC), or a combination of some or all of these elements. The address book may be used in conjunction with other software applications such as, without limitation, an information manager, a personal organizer, a personal calendar, a personal wiki, or any other source of contact information.","In one embodiment, the address book may be included as part of an e-mail client executing on the user device. Alternatively, the address book may be a stand-alone application that is either client or web-based. When used as a stand-alone application, the address book may include one or more application program interfaces for allowing for information retrieval and access by other applications.","In some implementations, the address book may be developed as a stand-alone application for managing one or more contacts associated with a user of the user device (e.g., owner of the address book). The address book may import contacts from (or export to) other applications, systems or devices (e.g., Microsoft Outlook\u00ae applications, BlackBerry\u00ae devices, iPhone devices, etc.) forming a record (e.g., person profile including several data items) for each. Where the address book is developed as a stand-alone application, the user associated with the address book also may access the address book from, for example, the owner's e-mail clients, social networks, mobile phones, instant messaging networks and the like.","Contact information associated with existing contacts stored on a user device also may be collected or updated from outside sources (e.g., using a search engine that is part of or accessible by routines associated with the address book) over communication network . The information may be collected by processes running on a user device or may be supported by processes running on server .","The outside sources may include information gathered from company web sites, personal web sites, social network web pages (e.g., available on social network site ) or other information sources (e.g., person search directory pages, photo or video sharing websites, travel websites, online retailers, and maps and directions websites). As an example, the address book may update or expand its profiles (e.g., including updating or populating entry fields associated with the existing contacts) by crawling through web pages to gather additional information to be included in a profile. For example, the address book may utilize conventional web crawlers to crawl through web sites such as, without limitation, social networking web sites such as Facebook\u00ae, Myspace\u00ae, LinkedIn\u00ae, Twitter\u00ae, Xanga\u00ae, Friendster\u00ae, YouTube\u00ae and Orkut\u00ae, gaming sites, gaming networks, photo services, and content sharing sites such as music and video sharing sites, people search engines, telephone directories, scanned business card data, and the like. Other types of online networks, communities or personal web pages may be searched including, for example, job hunting websites (e.g., monster.com), school alumni websites, organizations of professionals, Internet dating sites, ratings sites (e.g., epinions.com, Yelp.com), closed or proprietary networks, instant message networks, and company internal websites (e.g., Intranet). Web pages may be crawled on a scheduled basis or in response to a user input, and the retrieved information may be sorted and stored in the address book on the user device.","The address book may be presented as a user interface (e.g., facilitated by a presentation process on the user device that displays information in one or more user interface screens on a display of the user device) that includes one or more entries with each entry containing contact information associated with a contact such as name, e-mail address (e.g., business and personal), phone number, job title, message histories with the contact, e-mail history associated with the contact, usage history (e.g., date and time) indicating prior calls from the contact, information indicating past, present and future events involving the contact (e.g., meetings with the contact), SMS\/MMS messages with the contact, contacts who are part of the contact's network, and social network profile URLs. Other information such as screen names (e.g., instant messenger screen names), personal web site URLs, physical address and the like also may be included.","As discussed below in more detail, each user device has a display to present a first user interface screen (e.g., an email composition screen) to a user. An operating system, application, or process executing on the user device detects, via a user input device (e.g., a trackball on a BlackBerry device or phone) of the user device, a predefined user motion associated with the first screen. In one embodiment, the user motion is performed substantially in a single direction of movement in a plane parallel to the display (e.g., a rolling of a trackball in an upwards direction). In other embodiments, the user motion may be performed as a motion made substantially in a plane parallel to the display (e.g., a movement of a trackball in any direction). In yet other embodiments, the movement may be any type of detectable user motion on a trackball, key, button, or other input device and\/or on a touch screen.","In response to detecting this user motion, the user device presents a second user interface screen to the user on the display. The second screen includes information corresponding to the first screen. In one embodiment, the information is a list of persons and includes data items corresponding to each person. The data items may be, for example, email addresses, phone numbers, or other data associated with a particular person. The email addresses may be selected one by one by the user, for example, by scrolling down the list and clicking on an address for a particular person. After clicking in this manner, the address is added as an input data item to a \u201cTo:\u201d field on the first email composition screen. The address is displayed to the user on this screen. The user may perform the predefined user motion a second and further additional times as desired to add additional addresses to the email being composed.","In other embodiments, the first screen may be configured for a purpose other than email creation (e.g., calendar appointment or task creation). In such other embodiments, the second screen would present data items for persons that is relevant to the context of the first screen (i.e., the data items made available for selection by the user on the second screen would be contextually selected and be relevant to completion of input fields or other input data required or desirable or optionally entered on the first user interface screen).","The online social network site  may be connected to a data storage facility to store user provided content , such as multimedia content , preference data , etc., provided from the user devices (it is not necessary that all user devices communicate with server ). The multimedia content  may include, for example, photos of a user of the user device or of another identified person. The user may upload address or other personal information regarding the user and\/or other persons to social network site  as user provided content , and such information may subsequently be communicated to server  as described herein, and then ultimately be communicated to an address book or another form of information stored on a user device and accessible to a user on a second screen as discussed herein.","In , the users may use the devices (e.g., , , . . . , ) to make implicit or explicit recommendations or provide other information that may also be stored as user provided content . Such other information may include, for example, a still picture or a video clip taken at a recommended location, a text message or a sound clip to describe a location, etc. This other information may be included in information obtained by a process executing on server  that searches for and collects relevant information to use in creating or updating an address book or other list of personal information stored on a user device. Alternatively, a process on a user device may directly search for and collect such information to update an address book or other personal information stored on the user device.","In one embodiment, the personal information may be a person profile including contact information. The contact information displayed to a user of the user device may include e-mail addresses, telephone numbers, screen names, social network profile names, social network profile URLs, physical addresses, facsimile numbers, or website URLs. The contact information may be collected from a variety of sources including communications between the person and the user, communications between the user and other persons, e-mail body text, e-mail meta data, e-mail header information, e-mail attachments, web search engines, people search engines, social networks, e-mail clients, instant messages, personal web pages, telephone directories, scanned business card data, text messages, picture sharing websites, video sharing websites, person profile pages, telephone communications, or customer relationship management systems. For example, when the user receives an e-mail from a person, that person's e-mail address may be added to the list of contact information for that person's profile (e.g., as a person profile stored in the address book on the user device). In another example, when the user makes a phone call to a person, that person's telephone number may be added to the list of contact information for that person's profile.","In one embodiment, the user device is a phone (e.g., voice over IP phone) used by the user. For example, the phone may include a system or process for detecting when the user makes or receives a phone call or text message using the phone and display information related to a recipient or initiator of the phone call or text message in a person profile. For example, this information may be displayed in response to detection of a predefined user motion (or even a series of motions).","In one embodiment, the user device (e.g., , , . . . , ) can also be used to submit multimedia content (e.g., ) tagged with one or more attributes (e.g., GPS location associated with a photo). For example, in one embodiment, the user device includes a digital still picture camera, or a digital video camera. The user device can be used to create multimedia content or other files for sharing with friends in the online social network. Some or all of this information may be made available to the general public such that server  (or other user devices) may access it without specific permission from the user that originally provided the information to social network site , and then update stored personal information based on this access. In an alternative embodiment, the multimedia content can be created using a separate device and loaded into the online social network using the user device (e.g., , , . . . , ).","In another embodiment, the user devices communicate with one another over communication network . The user devices may be desktop computers, laptop computers, cell phones, web enabled televisions, or personal digital assistants. The communication transmitted from one user device to another user device may be an e-mail, phone call, instant message, text message, social network message or comment, message board post, or voice over IP communication.","A second user device may extract data from a communication it receives from a first user device about the first user. This data may be used to make a person profile. Data extracted from other communications with the first user may also be used to create a person profile for the first user. Data that is extracted from communications with the first user may be used to query websites, search engines, person search directories and other sources of information for additional information about the first user that may be used to create a person profile. Information from communications that may be used as search criteria include names, screen names, social network profile names, social network profile URLs, physical addresses, website URLs, e-mail addresses, or telephone numbers. Information that is collected as a result of these queries may be used in future searches to identify additional information that may be used to create a person profile.","The second user device may receive an e-mail sent by the first user from the first user device. The second user device may perform a search using a search engine with the first user's e-mail address as the search criteria. The search engine may return a search result that includes the first user's phone number. This phone number may be displayed as part of a person profile for the first user. The search engine may also return the URL for or link to a personal website belonging to the first user. The personal website may contain additional information about the first user that may be used to create a person profile, such as additional contact information or biographical information.","Although  illustrates an example system implemented in client server architecture, embodiments of the disclosure can be implemented in various alternative architectures. For example, the server  or online social network  can be implemented via a peer to peer network of user devices, where information is shared via peer to peer communication connections. Also, portions of the processing described herein may be implemented in the individual user devices, instead of running on one or more centralized servers. In some embodiments, a combination of client server architecture and peer to peer architecture can be used, in which one or more centralized server may be used to provide some of the information and\/or services and the peer to peer network is used to provide other information and\/or services. Thus, embodiments of the disclosure are not limited to a particular architecture.","Various examples of systems and methods that may be used with the systems and methods of the present disclosure, including exemplary end-user devices, address books, methods for handling and collecting contact and other information, and methods for the presentation of such information to a user of a device, is described in pending U.S. provisional application Ser. No. 61\/183,315, filed Jun. 2, 2009 (titled \u201cSelf Populating Address Book\u201d by Smith et al.), which is hereby incorporated by reference herein for all of its teachings.","In one embodiment, a process collects and presents historical communication and personal data to a user in one or more screens of the user device. The process may, for example, be implemented in an e-mail application of the user device. In another example, the process may be implemented on server , and the updated or new data communicated to the user device for display.","In this process, historical communication data and personal data are collected. For example, communications such as e-mails, instant messages, phone calls, text messages, internet message board postings, social network messages or comments, or voice over IP communications may be collected. Historical communication data and personal data may also be collected from web search engines, people search engines, social networks, e-mail clients, personal web pages, telephone directories, scanned business card data, picture sharing websites, video sharing websites, person profile pages, travel websites, on-line retailers, or customer relationship management systems.","The collected historical communication data and personal data may include contact information, biographical information, communication text, communication summaries, physical location information, mapping information, attachments to communications, weather information, travel information, and retail information.","The collected data is deposited into a repository (e.g., stored as records in an address book on a user device). For example, the collected data may be stored in a database on a user's laptop computer. The collected data may also be stored on a network server, a web server, a removable storage device, or as part of an e-mail client, other communication client or stand-alone application (e.g., an address book application).","In some embodiments, the user's behavior may be monitored. For example, the user device may track the mouse movements, keyboard strokes, or mouse clicks of a user, or active windows or mouse locations displayed on a monitor or other display device of the system. The user's behavior may be monitored to determine if a user has opened, viewed, read, or composed a communication, such as an e-mail. The user's behavior may also be monitored to determine if the user has performed a search, clicked on a particular item, or selected a particular item.","In one embodiment, data from the repository may be presented in response to user behavior. For example, a person profile may be displayed in response to a user selecting an e-mail in an inbox viewing panel or screen. In another example, information about a person may be displayed in response to a user performing a search for the person's name from a different screen. In another example, information about a file may be displayed in response to a user clicking on the file in an e-mail or other communication. In another example, information about a topic may be displayed in response to a user clicking on or selecting text within the body of a communication. Thus, the type of information presented to the user may be dependent upon the context of a combination of the current user interface screen, and the historical user interface actions of the user.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["221","229","231","233","227","225","223"]},"In , the position identification unit  is used to identify a geographic location for user content created for uploading to social network site . The position identification unit  may include a satellite positioning system receiver, such as a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver, to automatically identify the current position of the user device. In , the communication device  is configured to communicate with online social network  to provide user data content tagged with navigation data or other attributes. The communication device  is also configured to communicate with server .","In one embodiment, the user input device  is configured to generate user data content which is to be tagged with attributes for sharing. The user input device  may include a text input device, a still image camera, a video camera, and\/or a sound recorder, etc.","In one embodiment, the user input device  and the position identification unit  are configured to automatically tag the user data content created by the user input device  with navigation information identified by the position identification unit  or with other data generated by the user device.","In one embodiment, one or more sensors  are coupled to sense motion by user input device . Predefined user motions are stored in memory , and processor  executes a process to detect data from sensors  and to process and compare the data with the stored user motions to detect whether a user has performed a predefined motion. Sensors  may be integral with the user input device, or may be an additional component coupled to sense the operation of the input device. In one embodiment, sensors  detect a direction and\/or a velocity or an acceleration of a user motion (e.g., on a trackball) to determine if a predefined user motion is being performed. The detection may include determining if the velocity or acceleration equals or exceeds a predetermined threshold level. The detection may also include a determination of whether the user is continuing the roll the trackball in successive movements closely spaced in time (e.g., less than 1 second apart), which would indicate that the user is intending to navigate rather than launch a second user interface screen.","In one embodiment, the predefined user motion is a flick of the user via a trackball. The flick may be defined to be a short, quick movement of the trackball in a given direction (e.g., an upwards flick). The detection may include determining the velocity or acceleration of the flick. In another embodiment, the presentation of the second user interface screen is conditioned on the context of the user's experience (historical and\/or present as described herein). In other words, the presentation of a second screen and the data included therein may be a contextual response (e.g., based on a state awareness of the context of the user's experience as determined from present and historical data). This context may include the user interface path by which the user has arrived at the currently-viewed screen or other user interface.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0063"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["300","141","143","145","302","300","302","304"]},"The presence of the status indicator  indicates to the user that a process executing on the user device is presently able to detect the user motion (e.g., here as a flick upwards). The upward movement via the trackball (or another input device) corresponds to the user's indication of a desire to select or activate the second user interface screen. The status indicator  indicates to the user the service provider, software proprietor, or other nature of the data or service process or software that will be providing contextually relevant information in a second user screen. In some embodiments, the lack of any status indicator  (e.g., on other screens) may be used to indicate to the user that a flick will not activate a second screen from the current first screen.","In this embodiment, the user motion is substantially in a single upwards direction. Some allowance may be made for user inaccuracy in moving the trackball such that a combination of motion upwards and partially leftwards or rightwards (e.g., less than 45 degrees left or right) is still detected as a predefined upwards user motion that launches the display of the second screen.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0067","num":"0066"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","402","404","304","304"]},"Determining the presence of a flick motion may be based on acceleration. A determination is made, for example, if the trackball movement in the upward direction is significantly faster than a normal upward navigation based on movement (e.g., typical movement for users in general, or historical, stored data on movement for that particular user). The speed of the movement is compared to a normal movement. If the speed or velocity of the movement is, for example, twice that of a normal speed, then the motion is interpreted as a predefined flick user motion.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0069","num":"0068"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["504","502","304","502","504","504"]},"A list of persons  (e.g., contacts from the address book of the user device) are displayed in screen . The persons listed may be selected from the address book based on their relevance and ranking of importance, or based on other factors known by the user device (e.g., historical actions by user, or context of the current user interface environment). In one embodiment, the persons are listed using ranking based on a combination of factors including the following: the number of email messages sent to and from a particular person, the timing that emails have been sent including an emphasis on emails sent more recently (e.g., it may be inferred that a meeting or appointment being created is more likely to be created for inviting a person associated with a more recent email).","The user selects one of the persons. The selected person is used by the user device as, for example, a recipient  of an email being composed.

In alternative embodiments, the providing of universal, contextual access to relevant relationships is not necessarily based on user motion, but may be based on other operational or state characteristics of a user device. These characteristics may also include data obtained from sensors or systems associated with or operating on the user device.","For example, while on a call (e.g., using a mobile or desktop\/Cisco IP phone), a user request for personal information (e.g., user profile or relationships data) presents additional data regarding the caller and the company. The user device also may show additional information about likely-related contacts (e.g., in this case, people that the user most likely would desire to add for a planned conference call). The state awareness simplifies the user interface by reducing the keystrokes\/gestures (e.g., pressing of an arrow or other input key, or movement of a finger on a touch screen) required to perform the most typical or common follow-on tasks. The user's actual use and behavior with the user device is more efficient due to the easier access to relevant data (e.g., recent contacts, upcoming appointments, alternate contact data, etc.).","For example, reading email, and checking the people in the thread and their relationship to the user are more efficiently performed (this efficiency in usage also applies to related items, like conversations and attachments exchanged). In a customer relationship management (CRM) or similar application, the state aware interface reduces the address book data for selecting a contact or adding a contact to a small subset of the total available data based on other information in the application. So, as a user is working on its, for example, \u201cCisco account\u201d, the subset of people that are offered\/favored to the user via the device interface are a ranked list of Cisco contacts, optionally including a relevance filter on the actual topic relevant to the current user task. This is useful when, for example, the user has information stored in the user device for tens or hundreds of contacts within a given topic or other subject area (e.g., by company, geographic location, etc.).","The presence on the user device of an overlay of contextually-related relationships that is available to the user at any point in navigating or using the user device is helpful to the user. For example, if the user is on the phone in a live conversation, and simply uses a flick motion on a home screen, the user device may show the user a ranked list of people that the user is likely to be dealing or interacting with based on various forms of data collected or accessible by the device (e.g., geographic data, calendar data, time of day, items and data in the user's inbox, etc.). The list of most likely information desired or needed by the user is a significantly smaller subset (e.g., in the tens of persons) when compared to the total available relationships stored on the user device (e.g., which may be in the thousands of persons).","For example, an overlay of relationships across applications may be now described with respect to a BlackBerry user device. When the user is composing an email, a flick motion upwards provides the user with relatively quick access to those persons the user might need to send an email. The user interface is made smarter by any input the user may have provided (e.g., subject, body, other recipient, or prior activity like a recent phone call). This analysis is independent of the core application. The person relationships are carried universally across the user device platform and offered for use by any of the applications that may be running on the platform.","This may be implemented similarly to the manner in which printing services are offered to all applications on a personal computer. In some embodiments, the application itself may modify or customize the implementation of the printing option. For example, a label printing application may provide formatting for label printing (even though the printing is handled universally by the operating system (OS) or a service that runs in addition to the application itself).","The application itself may allow for the service to be invoked. In this example, the user indicates it has an account with a third party service provider (e.g., the Xobni service), and then the service provider's computer systems interact with the application to supplement the application. For example, the application does not need to be integrated at the OS or device level.","Data Processing System, Processes, and Closing",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0088","num":"0087"},"figref":["FIG. 11","FIG. 11"],"b":"201"},"In , the system  includes an inter-connect  (e.g., bus and system core logic), which interconnects a microprocessor(s)  and memory .
