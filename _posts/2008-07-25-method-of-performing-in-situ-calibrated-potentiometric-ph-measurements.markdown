The Government has certain rights in the invention.","This invention relates to sensors for extended deployment in aquatic environments. More specifically, this invention relates to devices and associated methods for precise and accurate potentiometric pH measurements in situ over periods of extended deployment with occasional spectrophotometric calibrations.","Solution pH is widely conceptualized as a master variable in the regulation of natural aqueous systems. It is a key feature in descriptive models of carbonate system chemistry, trace metal speciation and bioavailability, oxidation-reduction equilibria and kinetics, biologically induced carbon system transformations, and the aqueous interactions and transformations of minerals. Rising levels of atmospheric COare leading to ocean acidification. The response of seawater and freshwaters to acidification processes has created a need for autonomous global monitoring of ocean water and fresh water pH. The importance of pH in investigations of terrestrial and oceanic biogeochemistry has necessitated improvements in not only the quality of measurements (precision and accuracy), but also the spatial and temporal resolution of measurements in the field. Potentiometric devices are rarely used for in situ environmental pH measurements because in situ buffer calibrations are problematic. Spectrophotometric devices have been developed for in situ environmental measurements but the endurance and measurement frequency of spectrophotometric devices is relatively low due to high power requirements and the limited longevity of lamps. Achieving meaningful spatial and temporal measurements in the field mandates the introduction of robust measurement devices capable of accurate and precise measurements over extended timeframes.","The present invention provides a device capable of precise and accurate potentiometric pH measurements in situ. Also provided are associated methods for in situ calibrated pH measurements. Embodiments of an in situ calibrated potentiometric device according to the invention couple potentiometric pH measurement systems to systems for calibrating the potentiometric pH measurement systems. The potentiometric system\/aspect of the device employs one or more glass pH-sensitive electrodes connected to a potentiometer (i.e., a device capable of measuring electrical potentials [voltages]). A key feature of the potentiometric system is that, rather than being calibrated conventionally with buffers, it can be calibrated with an in situ device that measures pH spectrophotometrically. Spectrophotometric pH measurements obtained via sulfonephthalein absorbance measurements are inherently calibrated and do not require the buffers necessary for the calibration of typical potentiometric devices. Thus, devices according to the invention allow for continuous potentiometric pH measurements with occasional spectrophotometric calibrations.","The spectrophotometric calibration system\/aspect of the device utilizes a spectrophotometer with associated pumps for combining a sulfonephthalein pH indicator with the aqueous medium whose pH is to be measured. After a sulfonephthalein indicator and the aqueous medium (e.g., seawater) are combined in an optical cell, light is passed through the combined mixture, an absorbance spectrum is obtained and solution pH is calculated from (a) optical absorbance ratios at multiple wavelengths, (b) temperature, and (c) the salt concentration (e.g., salinity) of the solution. Through contemporaneous potentiometric measurements, the potentiometric pH system (glass electrode plus volt meter) is calibrated without the use of buffers. The device will record potentiometric pH measurements for an extended period of time until the spectrophotometric device is autonomously activated for another calibration. In this manner precise and accurate pH measurements can be obtained continuously in the environment, and the low energy expenditure of the potentiometric device provides excellent endurance.","In a first aspect the present invention provides a device for in situ calibrated potentiometric pH measurement. The device includes a potentiometric pH measurement module, a spectrophotometric pH measurement module and a calibration module. The calibration module is in communication with the potentiometric pH measurement module and the spectrophotometric pH measurement module. The calibration module receives pH calibration data from the potentiometric pH measurement module and the spectrophotometric pH measurement module and performs calibrations to the potentiometric pH measurement module using the received pH calibration data.","In certain embodiments the received pH calibration data utilizes one or more substantially contemporaneous pH measurements from the potentiometric pH measurement module and the spectrophotometric pH measurement module. Thus, a potentiometric pH measurement is performed at substantially simultaneously to a spectrophotometric pH measurement. By performing the operations coextensively, fluctuations due to ambient conditions and sample identity are minimized.","In further embodiments of the device the spectrophotometric pH measurement module can include a first reservoir containing a sulfonephthalein pH indicator, one or more pumps in communication with the first reservoir and an aqueous medium, a second reservoir to receive combined aqueous medium\/pH indicator (combined mixture), and a spectrophotometer to measure the absorbance characteristics of the combined mixture. The one or more pumps combine a sulfonephthalein pH indicator with the aqueous medium. In an advantageous embodiment of the device the calibration module can include systems for the autonomous activation of the calibration module. The calibration module can be autonomously activated upon a defined time interval or at an event trigger indicating the necessity for calibration of the potentiometer. The potentiometric pH measurement module can include one or more glass pH-sensitive electrodes connected to a potentiometer. The device according to claim  wherein the calibration module is autonomously activated upon a defined time interval or at an event trigger indicating the necessity for calibration of the potentiometer.","In certain embodiments the device can include a housing containing the potentiometric pH measurement module, the spectrophotometric pH measurement module and the calibration module in communication. The housing can have one or more sample intake ports and one or more sample exhaust ports to allow the intake and exhaust of the samples. The housing can also be sealed to allow operation while partially or totally immersed in an aqueous medium.","In a second aspect the present invention provides a device for autonomously-activated in situ calibrated potentiometric pH measurement. The device includes a potentiometric pH measurement module, a spectrophotometric pH measurement module, and an autonomously-activated calibration module. The autonomously-activated calibration module is in communication with the potentiometric pH measurement module and the spectrophotometric pH measurement module. The calibration module receives pH calibration data from the potentiometric pH measurement module and the spectrophotometric pH measurement module and performs calibrations to the potentiometric pH measurement module using the received pH calibration data. The autonomously-activated calibration module can be activated upon a defined time interval or at an event trigger indicating the necessity for calibration of the potentiometer.","In certain embodiments of the device the spectrophotometric pH measurement module can include a first reservoir containing a sulfonephthalein pH indicator, one or more pumps in communication with the first reservoir and an aqueous medium a second reservoir to receive combined aqueous medium\/pH indicator (combined mixture), and a spectrophotometer to measure the absorbance characteristics of the combined mixture. The one or more pumps combine a sulfonephthalein pH indicator with the aqueous medium.","In a third aspect the present invention provides a method of performing in situ calibrated potentiometric pH measurements for extended periods of time. The method includes the steps of recording a plurality of potentiometric pH measurements using a potentiometric pH measurement device, activating a spectrophotometric calibration system, spectrophotmetrically calibrating the potentiometric pH measurement device, and resetting the activator of the spectrophotometric calibration system to allow the potentiometric pH measurement device to return to recording potentiometric pH measurements. The spectrophotometric calibration system can be autonomously activated. The autonomous activation can occur upon a defined time interval or at an event trigger indicating the necessity for calibration.","In certain embodiments the step of spectrophotmetrically calibrating the potentiometric pH measurement device includes the steps of sampling an aqueous medium, accessing data representative of the temperature and salt concentration of the sampled aqueous medium, combining a sulfonephthalein indicator and a first portion of the sampled aqueous medium, delivering the combined medium to an optical cell, obtaining an absorbance spectrum from the combined medium, calculating solution pH of the sampled aqueous medium utilizing the optical absorbance ratios at multiple wavelengths, the temperature, and the salt concentration, obtaining a potentiometric pH measurement of a second portion of the aqueous medium, calculating the deviation between the potentiometric pH measurement and the spectrophotometric pH measurement, and adjusting the potentiometric pH measurement device using the calculated deviation. The spectrophotometric pH measurement is considered accurate, while any deviation between the potentiometric pH measurement and the spectrophotometric pH measurement is due to discrepencies in the potentiometric pH measurement due to factors such as the inherent drift observed in this type of unit over time. The adjusting step calibrates the potentiometric pH measurement device.","In certain embodiments the step of obtaining a potentiometric pH measurement of a second portion of the aqueous medium is performed substantially contemporaneously with the step of obtaining an absorbance spectrum from the combined medium.","In a fourth aspect the present invention provides a method of spectrophotmetrically calibrating a potentiometric pH measurement device. The method includes the steps of obtaining one or more samples of an aqueous medium, accessing data representative of the temperature and salt concentration of the sampled aqueous medium, combining a sulfonephthalein indicator and a first portion of the sampled aqueous medium, delivering the combined medium to an optical cell, obtaining an absorbance spectrum from the combined medium and calculating solution pH of the sampled aqueous medium utilizing the optical absorbance ratios at multiple wavelengths, the temperature, and the salt concentration, obtaining a potentiometric pH measurement of a second portion of the aqueous medium, calculating the deviation between the potentiometric pH measurement and the spectrophotometric pH measurement, and adjusting the potentiometric pH measurement device using the calculated deviation. The adjusting step calibrates the potentiometric pH measurement device.","In certain embodiments the step of obtaining a potentiometric pH measurement of a second portion of the aqueous medium is performed substantially contemporaneously with the step of obtaining an absorbance spectrum from the combined medium. In additional embodiments the method of spectrophotmetrically calibrating the potentiometric pH measurement can be autonomously activated. Autonomous activation can occurs upon a defined time interval or at an event trigger indicating the necessity for calibration or under other conditions.","In a fifth aspect the present invention provides a method of measuring the salinity of an aqueous solution, the method includes the steps of obtaining a sample of an aqueous medium, adding a metal ion species the aqueous medium to produce a sample solution, spectrophotometrically measuring the absorbance of light passing through the sample solution at a plurality of wavelengths, wherein the ultraviolet absorbance of light is a function of the complexation in the sample solution of the added metal ion species with carbonate ions of the sample and computing the salinity of the aqueous medium based upon the absorbance ratio of the sample solution at the plurality of wavelengths.","In certain embodiments the spectrophotometric absorbance measurements are obtained in the ultraviolet range.","In certain embodiments the metal ion can include Pband Cu, yttrium, a lanthanide metal and an actinide metal. In embodiments where the metal ion species is Pb, one of the plurality spectrophotometric absorbance measurements used to calculate the absorbance ratio can be measured at about \u03bb=234 nm In further aspects of this embodiment a second of the plurality of spectrophotometric absorbance measurements used to calculate the absorbance ratio is measured at about \u03bb=240 nm. to about \u03bb=260 nm In still further aspects, the metal ion species is Pband the spetrophotometric absorbance measurements are measured at about \u03bb=234 nm. and about \u03bb=250 nm.","Rising levels of atmospheric COare leading to ocean acidification. The response of seawater and freshwaters to acidification processes has created a need for autonomous global monitoring of ocean water and fresh water pH. Potentiometric devices are rarely used for in situ environmental pH measurements because in situ buffer calibrations are problematic. Spectrophotometric devices have been developed for in situ environmental measurements but the endurance and measurement frequency of spectrophotometric devices is relatively low due to high power requirements and the limited longevity of lamps. Spectrophotometric and potentiometric devices can be combined to reduce power, enhance longevity and still provide high quality calibrated measurements.","Both potentiometric and spectrophotometric procedures can be used for pH measurements. Potentiometric pH measurements can be performed with relatively simple equipment and procedures required. This simplicity makes potentiometry a good choice for field measurements as long as there are not stringent requirements for accuracy and precision. Under ideal conditions, potentiometric measurements that utilize glass hydrogen ion selective electrodes can provide measurement precisions on the order of 0.003 pH units. However, measurement accuracy can be problematic. Potentiometric measurements generally require regular buffer calibrations, and special care must be taken to address artifacts associated with both residual liquid junction potentials and variations in asymmetry potentials. Seiter and DeGrandpre evaluated performance of six electrodes under identical operational conditions. They observed that individual electrodes generally have distinctive drift patterns, with drift rates up to 0.02 pH units per day (Seiter, J. C.; DeGrandpre, M. D. 2001, 54, 99). Electrode drift necessitates frequent calibrations, making autonomous operation somewhat problematic compared to spectrophotometric pH determinations. One important advantage of potentiometric devices is their low power consumption. This aspect would seem to make them well-suited for deployment over extended periods of time. Unfortunately, their use for such deployment is greatly limited by their inherent drift, making readings increasingly inaccurate and necessitating calibration for meaningful use.","Although potentiometric pH measurements are versatile and satisfactory for many applications, spectrophotometric pH measurement procedures have at least two important advantages that make them particularly desirable. Since spectrophotometric pH measurements can be determined via absorbance ratios, and the calibration of pH indicators is a laboratory exercise that establishes how each indicator's molecular properties vary with temperature, pressure and ionic strength, spectrophotometric pH measurements are inherently calibrated and can be termed \u201ccalibration free\u201d. Subsequent to careful laboratory calibration, spectrophotometric pH measurements do not require the use of buffers. Secondly, thousands of at-sea observations have demonstrated that the imprecision of shipboard spectrophotometric pH measurements is on the order of 0.0003 to 0.0004 pH units, approximately an order of magnitude better than potentiometric results. These advantageous attributes of spectrophotometric pH measurements have made spectrophotometric procedures valuable for not only observations of pH, but also for measurements of COfugacity and total dissolved inorganic carbon. However, the power consumption of spectrophotometers is considerably greater than potentiometers. This can be a limitation for their long-term deployment. The limited longevity of lamps in spectrophotometers is an additional impediment to their long-term deployment.","Spectrophotometric pH measurements have been increasingly utilized for measurements of pH in natural waters. Bellerby et al. developed a flow injection procedure for spectrophotometric measurement of seawater pH with a reported precision of 0.005 pH units and a sample frequency of 25 hr(Bellerby R. G. J.; Turner, D. R.; Millward, G. E.; Worsfold P. J. 1995, 309, 259.). Tapp et al. described the use of a shipboard system for spectrophotometric measurements of surface water pH with a reported precision on the order of 0.001 pH units and a 1-Hz measurement frequency (Tapp, M.; Hunter, K.; Currie, K.; Mackaskill, B. 2000, 72, 193.). Relative to discrete measurements however, observed discrepancies were as large as 0.02 pH units. Martz et al. described the construction of a submersible pH sensor with a 0.003 unit measurement precision and a measurement frequency of 6 hr(Martz, T. R.; Carr, J. J.; French, C. R.; DeGrandpre, M. D. Anal. Chem. 2003, 75, 1844.).","Submersible potentiometric sensors according to the present invention provide continuous unattended measurements of seawater pH for periods of six to twelve months with a measurement frequency up to 60 Hz. No calibrations are required on the part of the user. Both measurements and calibrations are performed in-situ. Measurement accuracy is on the order of 0.001 pH units. High measurement frequency, excellent endurance characteristics, and in situ calibration make this sensor system well suited to descriptions of acid-base equilibrium and kinetic phenomena on diurnal, seasonal and annual scales.","The present invention provides a device capable of precise and accurate potentiometric pH measurements in situ. Embodiments of a potentiometric device according to the invention consist of one or more glass pH-sensitive electrodes connected to a potentiometer (e.g., a device capable of measuring electrical potentials [voltages]). A key feature of the device is that, rather than being calibrated conventionally with buffers, it can be calibrated with an in situ device that measures pH spectrophotometrically. Spectrophotometric pH measurements obtained via sulfonephthalein absorbance measurements are inherently calibrated (do not require buffers). Thus, devices according to the invention allow for continuous potentiometric pH measurements with occasional spectrophotometric calibrations. The spectrophotometric calibration device consists of a spectrophotometer with associated pumps for combining a sulfonephthalein pH indicator with the aqueous medium whose pH is to be measured. After a sulfonephthalein indicator and the aqueous medium (e.g., seawater) are combined in an optical cell, light is passed through the combined mixture, an absorbance spectrum is obtained and solution pH is calculated from (a) optical absorbance ratios at multiple wavelengths, (b) temperature, and (c) the salt concentration (e.g., salinity) of the solution. Through contemporaneous potentiometric measurements the potentiometric pH system (glass electrode plus volt meter) is calibrated without the use of buffers. The device will record potentiometric pH measurements for an extended period of time until the spectrophotometric device is autonomously activated for another calibration. In this manner precise and accurate pH measurements can be obtained continuously in the environment, and the low energy expenditure of the potentiometric device provides excellent endurance.","It is contemplated that calibrations can be triggered by a variety of events or circumstances. For example, calibrations can be triggered based upon time intervals or other user-defined events. Alternatively, or in conjunction with such tachniques, calibrations can be triggered based upon observations of potentiometric pH changes. For example, a sudden pH cahnge outside of the typical deviations of pH recordings could trigger a calibration to ensure that the large recorded deviaiton was real.","A number of other solutions are available to avoid problems associated with potiometric drift in the long-term deployment of these devices. Pontiometric pH measurement devices consist of (a) a glass pH sensitive membrane and (b) a reference electrode. One of the main sources problems in a potentiometric pH measurement is clogging of what is called the \u2018liquid junction\u2019 of the reference cell. This is an event that could initiate drift. If the potentiometric system is initially calibrated, some slow drift may be acceptable because subsequent deviations between spectrophotometric and potentiometric measurements might be small. If deviations suddenly become large, the device could be told to select a different reference electrode (or a different glass electrode). Alternatively, or in conjunctions with the above procedures, the system could be directed to flush itself with a microbial inhibitor or to activate an ultrasonic device for cleaning.","Procedures for direct measurements of carbonate ion concentrations and saturation states in seawater have also been developed. Measurements are obtained via ultraviolet spectroscopic observations of Pb(II) spectra as the relative concentrations of PbCOand an ensemble of lead chloride complexes vary in response to dissolved CO. Measurement precision is enhanced by parameterization in terms of absorbance ratios. The PbCOstability constant, and Pb(II) molar absorbance ratios in seawater, were determined at 25\u00b0 C. over a range of salinity between 36 and 20. The procedures described herein are well suited to measurements throughout the normal range of carbonate ion concentrations in the oceans. Rapid equilibration rates for Pb(II) carbonate complexation make the procedures described in this work well suited to rapid direct analysis in situ.","The health of coral reefs and calcareous plankton is also strongly influenced by the carbonate saturation state of seawater. Calculations of carbonate saturation states currently require measurements of two COsystem parameters, such as pH and total dissolved carbon, plus thermodynamic calculations that relate carbonate ion concentrations to directly measured parameters.","Investigations of the marine COsystem are commonly conducted through measurements of four primary variables: total dissolved inorganic carbon (C), total solution alkalinity (A), COfugacity (CO), and solution pH. Thermodynamic models link these four primary variables, whereby measurements of any two variables can be used to calculate the two remaining parameters (DOE, 1994). These models also allow calculations of the concentrations of the individual forms of inorganic carbon in seawater: the dissolved concentrations of COand HCO, and the free plus ion paired concentrations of bicarbonate, HCO, and carbonate, CO. Two of the directly measured and derived COsystem variables can be highlighted because of their special significance in evaluations of global carbon fluxes and the biogeochemistry of marine carbonates in general. COfugacity measurements are essential to descriptions of COexchange at the air sea interface (DOE, 1994; McGillis and Wanninkhof, 2006; Millero, 2007), and carbonate ion concentrations are essential to evaluations of (a) the mineralization rates of marine calcifiers (Langdon and Atkinson, 2005) and (b) the dissolution rates of calcite and aragonite (CaCOpolymorphs) both on the seafloor and in the water column (Morse, 1978; Keir, 1980; Acker et al., 1987).","Rising atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations over the past two centuries have led to increasing COuptake by the oceans (Royal Society, 2005). This process, which is decreasing the pH of the upper ocean, is reducing oceanic carbonate ion concentrations and thus the level of saturation of calcium carbonate (Broecker et al, 1979; Feely et al., 2004; On et al., 2005). If the trend continues, it will have a seriously negative impact on key marine organisms such as corals and some plankton (Kleypas et al, 2006). In view of the importance of carbonate ion concentrations ([CO]) to the oceans' rapidly evolving carbonate system, it is then highly desirable to move [CO]from the rank of derived COsystem variables to the list of primary measured variables.","A variety of metals in seawater, including lead (Byrne, 1981), copper (Byrne and Miller, 1985), the lanthanides (Cantrell and Byrne, 1987), and various actinides (Byrne, 2002) have inorganic speciation schemes that are strongly dominated by carbonate complexation. Among these metals, the speciation of Pb(II) and Cu(II) has been examined directly by ultraviolet absorbance spectroscopy in natural seawater (Byrne, 1981; Byrne and Miller, 1985). Since the ultraviolet absorbance characteristics of these metals are strongly influenced by dissolved carbonate, it follows that observations of Pb(II) and Cu(II) absorbance spectra can be used to directly determine seawater carbonate ion concentrations. As a means of achieving high precisions in such determinations, we have developed procedures that involve measurements of absorbance ratios rather than absolute absorbance. Our techniques are closely analogous to those that were developed previously for seawater pH measurements with precisions on the order of 0.0004 pH units (Robert Baldo et al, 1985; Byrne, 1987; Byrne and Breland, 1989; Clayton and Byrne, 1993). Whereas spectrophotometric observations of sulfonephthalein acid\/base equilibria are utilized for seawater pH measurements, spectrophotometric observations of metal ion complexation can be used to quantify anion concentrations in seawater. Lead is especially well suited to such measurements because (a) PbCOand a variety of Pb(II) chloride complexes have dissimilar absorbance spectra in the ultraviolet, and (b) species other than PbCOand chloride complexes appear to be insignificant over a wide range of salinities in natural seawater. In this work, Pb(II) formation constants and molar absorbance ratios required for direct determinations of carbonate ion concentrations in seawater are characterized at 25\u00b0 C. as a function of salinity. In addition to development of procedures for measurement of carbonate ions and carbonate saturation state, we also show that measurements of Pb(II) absorbance ratios in acidified seawater can be used to determine seawater salinity with a precision on the order of \u00b10.1 salinity units. The procedures described in this work are suitable for rapid autonomous in-situ monitoring of carbonate ion concentration in seawater.","Theoretical Principles","The PbCOformation reaction in seawater,\n\nPb+COPbCO,\u2003\u2003(1)\n\ncan be quantitatively described with an equilibrium constant of the following form:\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mmultiscripts":{"mi":"\u03b2","mn":"1","none":[{},{}],"mprescripts":{},"mrow":{"mi":"CO","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mn":"3"}},"mo":"=","mfrac":{"msub":[{"mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"msubsup":{"mi":"PbCO","mn":["3","0"]}},"mi":"T"},{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mo":["[","]"],"msub":{"mi":["Pb","T"]}},{"mo":["[","]"],"msubsup":{"mi":"CO","mn":"3","mrow":{"mn":"2","mo":"-"}}}],"mo":"\u2061"},"mi":"T"}]}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"2"}}]}}}},"br":{},"sub":["T","3","2","3","4","3","T ","3","3","3","3","3","T ","3","3"],"sup":["0 ","2+","+","0 ","\u2212","0","2\u2212","2\u2212","\u2212","0 ","0","0","0 ","\u2212"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002","num":"00002"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mfrac":[{"mrow":[{"msub":{"mo":"\u2009","mi":"\u03bb"},"mo":"\u2062","mi":"A"},{"mi":"l","mo":"\u00b7","msub":{"mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mi":"Pb"},"mi":"T"}}]},{"mrow":[{"mmultiscripts":{"mi":["\u025b","Pb","\u03bb"],"none":[{},{}],"mprescripts":{}},"mo":"+","mrow":{"mmultiscripts":{"mi":["\u025b","\u03bb"],"mrow":{"mi":["PbCO","CO"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.6em","height":"0.6ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}],"mn":["3","3"]},"none":[{},{}],"mprescripts":{}},"mo":"\u2062","msub":{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":"\u03b2","mn":"1"},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"msubsup":{"mi":"CO","mn":"3","mrow":{"mn":"2","mo":"-"}}}},"mi":"T"}}},{"mn":"1","mo":"+","msub":{"mrow":{"mmultiscripts":{"mi":"\u03b2","mn":"1","none":[{},{}],"mprescripts":{},"mrow":{"mi":"CO","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mn":"3"}},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"msubsup":{"mi":"CO","mn":"3","mrow":{"mn":"2","mo":"-"}}}},"mi":"T"}}]}],"mo":"="}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"3"}}]}}}},"br":{},"sub":["\u03bb","T ","\u03bb","PbCO3 ","3","T ","\u03bb","Pb ","T","CO3","1 ","3","\u03bb","3","T ","\u03bb","Pb,\u03bb","PbCO3 ","CO3","1"],"sup":["0","0 ","2\u2212"]},"Use of Eq.

(4) can be written as:\n\n\u03b5\u2003\u2003(7)\n\nIt has been shown (Byrne et al., 1981) that characterizations of the molar absorptivities of individual species of Pb(II) can be used to directly determine the relative concentrations of Pb\u00b1, PbCl, PbCland PbCl in both synthetic solutions and seawater. Since the relative concentrations of these species are directly dependent on the chloride concentrations in synthetic solutions and seawater, it follows that Pb(II) absorbance ratios at low pH are directly dependent on salinity. In addition to developing a direct means of determining carbonate ion concentrations via Eq. (5), we show in this work that observations of Pb(II) absorbance ratios at low pH allow calculations of seawater salinity with a precision somewhat better than \u00b10.2%.\n\nMethods\n","Eq. (5) can be used to determine carbonate ion concentrations via direct measurements of Pb(II) absorbance ratios, and characterizations of \u03b2, e, e, and e. Observations of Pb(II) absorbance spectra at salinities typical of open ocean seawater (S=35.87) reveal isosbestic points near 234 nm (). On this basis, one of the two wavelengths chosen for absorbance observations was \u03bb=234 nm Although use of shorter wavelengths is desirable as a means of increasing sensitivity to formation of PbCO, small absorbance contributions from carbonate ions at shorter wavelengths make interpretations of absorbances at \u03bb<234 nm less direct. In view of the substantial absorbance variations between 240 and 260 nm (), the second of the two wavelengths chosen for absorbance ratio observations was \u03bb=250 nm.","Characterizations of log \u03b2in this work were obtained using Eq. (3) and measurements of A and [CO]in seawater samples at constant salinity and constant temperature. Along with characterizations of log \u03b2, these measurements also produced paired characterizations of \u03b5and \u03b5. Paired characterizations of \u03b5and \u03b5were obtained from measurements of A and [CO]using Eq. (3), and the log \u03b2values determined at each salinity, as described above. Paired characterizations of \u03b5and \u03b5were obtained from A observations at low pH (). The molar absorbance ratios e, eand ein Eq. (5) were then determined from these paired molar absorbance characterizations as follows:\n\n=(\u03b5\/\u03b5)\u00d7(\u03b5\/\u03b5)\u00d7(\u03b5\/\u03b5)\u2003\u2003(8)\n\n=(\u03b5\/\u03b5)\u00d7(\u03b5\/\u03b5)\u2003\u2003(9)\n\n=(\u03b5\/\u03b5)\u2003\u2003(10)\n","All chemicals used were analytical reagent grade. PbCand NaHCOwere from Sigma-Aldrich. HCl (1.000 M) was from J. T. Baker. The seawater used in this study was surface water from the Gulf of Mexico. Seawater salinity was measured with an SBE 49 CTD (Seabird). Seawater samples at various salinities were prepared by dilution with Milli-Q water. Absorbance measurements were obtained using quartz optical cells (10 cm pathlength) in an HP 8453 spectrophotometer. The slitwidth of this spectrophotometer is 1 nm. Use of a spectrophotometer with a substantially larger slitwidth can alter the wavelength-dependent absorbance characteristics of the parameters given in equations (8)-(10). The temperature of the samples in the optical cells was controlled (25\u00b10.05)\u00b0 C. with a Neslab refrigerating circulator and a water-jacketed spectrophotometric cell holder.","Seawater alkalinity was determined using a spectrophotometric procedure (Yao and Byrne, 1998) that is precise to better than 1 mmol\/kg. Seawater (140.0 g) was added gravimetrically to an open top optical cell (10 cm pathlength) which, in turn, was positioned in the thermostated cell holder. Sample pH was measured using an Orion Ross-type pH electrode (No. 800500) connected to an Orion pH meter (Model 720A) in the absolute millivolt mode. Nerstian behavior of the pH electrode was confirmed via titrations of 0.7 molal NaCl solutions with concentrated HCl. The electrode was calibrated on the total hydrogen ion concentration scale through measurements in natural seawater whose pH was determined by simultaneous spectrophotometric observations of thymol blue absorbance ratios (Zhang and Byrne, 1996).","Through addition of NaHCO, the alkalinity of each seawater sample was increased to values approximately double those of natural seawater (final alkalinity \u02dc4.0 millimolal). Seawater samples had COfugacities generally in excess of 500 \u03bcatm and pH\u22668.0. After each seawater sample was thermally equilibrated, a reference spectrum was taken and 1.05 ml of a 0.001 mol\/kg PbClstock solution was added to the sample (final [Pb(II)]\u02dc7.5 \u03bcmol kg). An absorbance spectrum was then taken along with a potentiometric measurement of pH. The sample was subsequently titrated with standard HCl using a Gilmont micrometer syringe. HCl additions were quantified gravimetrically. Pb(II) absorbance, alkalinity and pH were recorded for each titration point. Sample alkalinity was calculated by accounting for cumulative HCl additions to the initial seawater sample. Calculations of [CO]from alkalinity and pH utilized the total H scale dissociation constants of Dickson and Millero (1987) that were derived from the data of Mehrbach et al. (1973). All such calculations were performed using the COsystem program of Pierrot et al. (2006). Based on 95% confidence intervals for total alkalinities on the order of 0.1%, and 95% confidence intervals for open-cell pH measurements on the order of 0.01 units, corresponding relative errors in calculated carbonate ion concentrations are approximately 2.3% (e.g., \u00b15.8 \u03bcmol\/kg when [CO]=250 \u03bcmol\/kg). Non-linear least squares parameter estimates of \u03b5\u03b5and \u03b2were obtained using Eq. (3) and paired values of A and [CO]. Calculations of [CO]that accounted for minor contributions of PbCOto carbonate alkalinity did not cause significant changes in derived values of \u03b5\u03b5and \u03b2. Absorbance contributions of CO at short wavelengths were examined by performing titration experiments without addition of Pb(II) to samples. Observations of well defined isosbestic points near \u03bb=234 nm demonstrate that these corrections are very small at the wavelengths utilized in this work. The dependencies of e, eand eon salinity were described via quadratic functions.","Pb(II) absorbance measurements in acidified seawater (pH \u02dc3.7, [Pb(II)]\u02dc7.5 \u03bcmol kg) were used to determine \u03b5 values at \u03bb=234 and 250 nm. Absorbances, in this case, were measured against a reference solution of acidified seawater that contained no lead. The absorbance ratios obtained in these experiments (\u03b5\/\u03b5) were used in determinations of eand e, as described above, and were also used in a least squares quadratic regression that allows salinity (S) to be calculated from A\/A observations at low pH.","Results and Discussion","Salinity Dependencies of Pb(II) Molar Absorptivities and the PbCOFormation Constant","Estimates for \u03b2\u03b5and \u03b5obtained using Eq.

It should be noted that the residuals shown in  are derived from three independent sources. One of these is the absorbance ratios that are used to predict [CO]via Eq. (20), and the others are the alkalinity and pH measurements that are used to derive \u201cobserved\u201d values of [CO]. Of these three types of measurements, there is reason to suspect that potentiometric pH measurements may constitute the greatest source of scatter seen in . Since field measurements of [CO]based on absorbance ratios are independent of alkalinity and pH, the precision of [CO]measurements obtained via absorbance spectroscopy should be considerably better than that which is depicted in . The results shown in  suggest that Eq. (20) can be used to satisfactorily predict [CO]over a wide range of conditions in seawater. Preliminary assessment of the relative contributions of potentiometric and spectrophotometric contributions to the residuals in  suggest that the relative standard deviation for Eq. (20) calculations of [CO]is on the order of 2% or less. The best least squares descriptions for the salinity dependencies of the parameters in Eq.

Since ionic Pb(II) in seawater is not significantly volatile, the principal safety concern surrounding the manipulation of solutions enriched in lead is avoidance of inadvertent ingestion. This should especially be borne in mind with respect to handling of the 1 mM stock Pb titrant solution and safe disposal of waste solutions.","Determinations of Seawater Salinity","Salinity measurements required for calculations of log {(\u03b2)\/(e)}, e, and (e\/e) are commonly available from either shipboard or in situ conductimetric observations. When such is not the case, however, salinity can be calculated from absorbance ratios using the following relationship that is based on the data shown in  for acidified seawater:\n\n8.76+45.156.092\u2003\u2003(24)\n","where R=A\/A and 20\u2266S\u226636. The standard deviation for Eq. (24) estimates of salinity is \u00b10.06 salinity units. Thus, Eq. (24) provides seawater salinity estimates that are precise to approximately 0.2% over the normal salinity range of seawater.","Thus, salinity can be measured from absorbance ratio observations after Pb(II) is added to an acidic seawater solution. Other metals can be used to obtain sensitive salinity measurements over various ranges of salinity. The work reported herein was performed at 25\u00b0 C. It follows that the salinity measurements could be performed at other temperatures after suitable laboratory calibrations. This would allow salinity measurements and\/or carbonate measurements to be obtained without thermostatting. Such calibrations facilitate carbonate measurements in situ over a range of temperatures.","Potentiometric pH Measurements and Systems Calibration","The potentiometer measures the millivolts developed by a pH electrode vs a reference electrode. The solution measured consists of the aqueous medium plus a small amount of indicator. The pH of this mixture is assessed by both the spectrophotometer and the potentiometer. The potentiometric pH is determined by an equation of the following form:\n\npH=\u00b7(millivolts)\u2003\u2003(25)\n","The \u201cb\u201d term in the above equation (Eq. 25) is an electrode slope that depends on temperature. The \u201ca\u201d term depends on a number of variables and can be determined via calibrations. In the present instance, the potentiometric system (or the calibration system) is \u201ctold\u201d the pH of a given solution (i.e., the pH value is determined spectrophotometrically) whereupon the constant \u201ca\u201d is determined from the above equation. In such a system it is also possible to have an additional pump so that aqueous solution, indicator and acid are combined. In this case pH is again measured spectrotometrically and the above equation can be used to solve for both slope \u201cb\u201d and intercept \u201ca\u201d.","In the absence of direct spectrophotometric determinations of [CO]as described above, [CO]must be calculated from measurements of either total dissolved inorganic carbon or total alkalinity combined with either pH or COfugacity. While spectrophotometric pH measurements are rapid, with acquisition rates on the order of seconds, measurements of dissolved inorganic carbon, total alkalinity and COfugacity generally require several minutes (as a lower bound). Thus, the spectrophotometric procedures for measurements of carbonate ion concentrations described in this work, and those for spectrophotometric pH analysis (Liu, et al., 2006), are unique in their suitability for prompt in situ analysis. Although, in situ analysis will require evaluations of the influence of temperature on the various parameters in Eq. (20), the work of Soli et al. (2008) showed that the influence of temperature on log(\u03b2) is quite small. Since the influence of temperature on molar absorptivity ratios should be relatively minor, it is likely that Eq. (20) can easily be extended to include analysis at in situ conditions. With respect to both in situ and laboratory analysis, spectrophotometric pH and [CO]measurement procedures can be distinguished from those required for Cwith respect to both procedural and instrumental simplicity. In contrast to the equipment required for state of the art Canalyses, spectrophotometers are standard equipment in a wide variety of research and teaching laboratories.","As has been the case for spectrophotometric measurements of pH, it should be anticipated that the parameters required for quantitative [CO]measurements (e.g., Eqs. (21) through (24)) will periodically be reevaluated and refined. This process will include, in particular, comparisons obtained through ship-based oceanic carbon system expeditions wherein the thermodynamic consistency of all measurable COsystem parameters is commonly evaluated (Clayton et al., 1995; Lee et al., 2000). It should be emphasized in this case that any future revisions in characterizations of log {(\u03b2)\/(e)}, eand (e\/e) will allow refinements, with improved accuracy, of archived [CO]data. As long as data are recorded as R\u2014S pairs (i.e., absorbance ratios and salinity), all calculations of [CO]are amenable to quantitative reassessment. As such, observations of Pb(II) absorbance ratios provide a molecularly-based index of carbonate ion concentrations in seawater.","The procedures described in this work are suitable for rapid, quantitative assessments of calcite and aragonite saturation states in seawater. Since the solubility products of calcite and aragonite in S=35 seawater are approximately 10and 10(Millero, 2007), and the total calcium concentration is 0.0103 mol\/kg at salinity , the carbonate ion concentrations for saturation with calcite and aragonite are 41.7 \u03bcmol\/kg and 63.3 \u03bcmol\/kg. The log \u03b2results given by Eq. (11) (log \u03b2=4.106 at S=35) show that inorganic Pb(II) is partitioned equally between PbCOand lead chloride complexes when [CO]=78.3 mmol\/kg. Thus, the procedures described in this work are well suited to measurement of CaCOsaturation states both below and well above the saturation levels of calcite and aragonite.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0085","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003","list-style":"none"},"li":["Acker, J.
