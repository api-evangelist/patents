No. 61\/439,987, filed Feb. 7, 2011.","Wireless mobile communication technology uses various standards and protocols to transmit data between a base transceiver station (BTS) and a wireless mobile device. Some wireless devices communicate using an orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) digital modulation scheme via a physical layer. OFDM standards and protocols can include the third generation partnership project (3GPP) long term evolution (LTE), the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.16 standard (e.g., 802.16e, 802.16m), which is commonly known to industry groups as WiMax (Worldwide interoperability for Microwave Access), and the IEEE 802.11 standard, which is commonly known to industry groups as WiFi. In 3GPP radio access networks (RANs) LTE systems, the BTS can be a combination of evolved Node Bs (also commonly denoted as enhanced Node Bs, eNodeBs, or eNBs) and Radio Network Controllers (RNCs) in a Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network (UTRAN), which communicates with the wireless mobile device, known as a user equipment (UE). Both the BTS and wireless mobile device can transmit and receive data. The transmitting station (Transmitter or Tx) can transmit data via a signal on a channel to a receiving station (Receiver or Rx), where a channel uses a specified frequency bandwidth. Transmission modes can be used to allow different types of transmissions between a BTS and wireless mobile device.","Reference will now be made to the exemplary embodiments illustrated, and specific language will be used herein to describe the same. It will nevertheless be understood that no limitation of the scope of the invention is thereby intended.","Before the present invention is disclosed and described, it is to be understood that this invention is not limited to the particular structures, process steps, or materials disclosed herein, but is extended to equivalents thereof as would be recognized by those ordinarily skilled in the relevant arts. It should also be understood that terminology employed herein is used for the purpose of describing particular examples only and is not intended to be limiting. The same reference numerals in different drawings represent the same element.","An initial overview of technology embodiments is provided below and then specific technology embodiments are described in further detail later. This initial summary is intended to aid readers in understanding the technology more quickly but is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the technology nor is it intended to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter. The following definitions are provided for clarity of the overview and embodiments described below.","A precoder (and an associated transmission mode) for large delay (LD) cyclic delay diversity (CDD) can be configured for UE-specific reference signal (UE-specific RS or UE-RS) or a demodulation reference signal (DMRS), and data in a physical downlink shared channel (PDSCH). The precoder can generate a large delay cyclic delay diversity (CDD) vector block from an input vector block where the input vector block includes user equipment-specific reference signals (UE-RSs) or data in a physical downlink shared channel (PDSCH). Data can be mapped to a physical resource block (PRB) with UE-RSs or channel-state information reference signal (CSI-RSs) using an element resource mapper.","In one example, data in wireless mobile communications can be transmitted on the physical (PHY) layer by the transmitting station (Transmitter or Tx) to the receiving station (Receiver or Rx) using a generic long term evolution (LTE) frame structure, as illustrated in . While an LTE frame structure is illustrated, a frame structure for an IEEE 802.16 standard (WiMax), an IEEE 802.11 standard (WiFi), or another type of communication standard using OFDM may also be used.","In the example illustrated in , a radio frame  of a signal used to transmit the data can be configured to have a duration, T, of 10 milliseconds (ms). Each radio frame can be segmented or divided into ten subframes that are each 1 ms long. Each subframe can be further subdivided into two slots and , each with a duration, T, of 0.5 ms. The first slot (#) can include a physical downlink control channel (PDCCH)  and\/or a physical downlink shared channel (PDSCH) , and the second slot (#) can include data using the PDSCH. Each slot for a component carrier (CC) used by the transmitting station and the receiving station can include multiple resource blocks (RBs) , , , , and based on the CC frequency bandwidth. Each RB (physical RB or PRB) can include 12-15 kHz subcarriers  (on the frequency axis) and 6 or 7 orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) symbols  (on the time axis) per subcarrier. The RB can use seven OFDM symbols if a short or normal cyclic prefix is employed. The RB can use six OFDM symbols if an extended cyclic prefix is used. The resource block can be mapped to 84 resource elements (REs) using short or normal cyclic prefixing, or the resource block can be mapped to 72 REs (not shown) using extended cyclic prefixing. The RE can be a unit of one OFDM symbol  by one subcarrier (i.e., 15 kHz) . Each RE can transmit two bits and of information in the case of quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK) modulation. Other types of modulation may be used, such as 16 quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) or 64 QAM to transmit a greater number of bits in each RE, or bi-phase shift keying (BPSK) modulation to transmit a lesser number of bits (a single bit) in each RE. The RB can be configured for a downlink transmission from the eNodeB to the UE, or the RB can be configured for an uplink transmission from the UE to the eNodeB.","Reference signals can be transmitted by OFDM symbols via resource elements in the resource blocks. Reference signals (or pilot signals or tones) can be a known signal used for various reasons, such as to estimate a channel and\/or noise in the channel. Reference signals can be received and transmitted by transmitting stations and mobile communication devices. Different types of reference signals (RS) can be used in an RB. For example, in LTE systems, downlink reference signal types can include a cell-specific reference signal (CRS), a multicast\\broadcast single-frequency network (MBSFN) reference signal, a LTE-specific reference signal (UE-specific RS or UE-RS) or a demodulation reference signal (DMRS), positioning reference signal (PRS), and a channel-state information reference signal (CSI-RS).","In LTE systems, the CRS can be transmitted on antenna ports  to  for transceivers with up to four antenna ports and can be transmitted in downlink subframes in a cell supporting a physical downlink shared channel (PDSCH). Data can be transmitted from an eNodeB to a UE via a PDSCH. A physical downlink control channel (PDCCH) can be used to transfer downlink control information (DCI) that informs the UE about resource allocations or scheduling related to downlink resource assignments on the PDSCH, uplink resource grants, and uplink power control commands. The PDCCH can be transmitted prior to the PDSCH in each subframe transmitted from the eNodeB to the UE.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":["FIG. 2A","FIG. 2A","FIG. 2B"],"b":["252","7","272","1","2","3","4","6","7","8","7","274","254","8","7"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":["FIG. 2C","FIG. 2D"],"b":["276","256","9","278","258","10","9"]},"In LTE systems, the UE-specific reference signal (UE-RS) or a demodulation reference signal (DMRS) can be transmitted on antenna ports  and  to  and can be transmitted in downlink subframes supporting a PDSCH. The UE-RS (DMRS) can be transmitted within the resource blocks assigned for downlink shared channel (DL-SCH) transmission to a specific terminal (mobile communication device), used for beamforming to a single UE using multiple antennas, and used for PDSCH demodulation.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":["FIG. 3A","FIG. 3A","FIG. 3B","FIG. 3D"],"b":["232","15","242","0","15","16","15","244","234","17","18","17","3","246","236","19","20","19","248","238","21","22","21","15","16","17","18","19","22"]},"In LTE systems, the channel-state information reference signal (CSI-RS) can be transmitted on antenna ports  to  and can be used for cell search and initial acquisition, downlink channel estimation for coherent demodulation\/detection at the UE, and\/o downlink channel quality measurements for link adaption. The CST-RS can be found in the REs of the last two columns of the time-domain index of the even number slot of the RB. Cell specific antenna ports and the UE specific antenna port may not be simultaneously used (usage may be time-multiplexed). CSI reference signals can be relatively sparse in frequency but regularly transmitted from all antennas at the base station, while the UE-specific reference signals can be denser in frequency but may be only transmitted when data is transmitted on a corresponding transmission layer, where a transmission layer can correspond to a transmission antenna.","Both UE-RSs and CSI-RSs can be used in an open-loop multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) mobile communication system. The UE-RSs and CSI-RSs may be mapped in a PRB with data in a PDSCH by resource element mapper. The data in a PDSCH or the UE-RSs can be precoded for large delay cyclic delay diversity (CDD).","A wireless communication system can be subdivided into various sections referred to as layers. In the LTE system, communication layers can include the physical (PHY), media access control (MAC), radio link control (RLC), packet data convergence protocol (PDCP), and radio resource control (RRC) layers. The physical layer can include the basic hardware transmission components of a wireless communication system , as illustrated in . A basic multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system is used for simplicity in illustrating the basic hardware transmission components, but the components can also be adapted for a complex MIMO system, a SISO system, or similar system. For example in a MIMO system, at the transmitter , binary input data  can be protected through encoding using a channel encoder , interleaved against fading phenomenon using an interleaver , and mapped to improve reliability using a mapper . The mapped data can be separated into layers for antenna ports by a transmitter (TX) beamformer  and the layers can be OFDM modulated into OFDM symbols using modulators A-B. The modulators can use an inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) algorithm to compute the inverse discrete Fourier transform (IDFT) to generate modulated signals (vector x for each antenna port). The modulated signals can be converted to analog signals with digital-to-analog converters (DACs) A-B. The analog signals can be transmitted via radio frequency (RF) transmitters (Txs) A-B configured to send the signal to transmitter antennas A-B operable to communicate the signal. The analog signals will follow a path referred to as a channel. The analog signals travelling through that path can be referred to as a channel signal . The physical layer can include other components (not shown), such as series-to-parallel (S\/P) converters, parallel-to-serial (P\/S) converters, cyclic prefix (CP) inserters and deleters, guard band inserters and deleters, and other desired components.","The transmitted channel signal  can be subject to noise  and interference . The noise and interference is represented as an addition  to the channel signal, which can be received by receiver antennas A-B and one or more radio frequency (RF) receivers (Rxs) A-B at the receiver . The channel signal combined with the noise and interference can be converted to a digital modulated signal with analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) A-B. The digital signal can be OFDM demodulated using demodulators A-B. The demodulators can use a fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm to compute the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) to generate demodulated signals (vector y for each antenna port). A channel estimator  can use the demodulated signal to estimate the channel  and the noise and interference that occurs in the channel. The channel estimator can include a feedback generator or be in communication with the feedback generator, which can generate a physical uplink shared channel (PUSCH) feedback report, such as a channel quality indicator (CQI) report, a preceding matrix indicator (PMI) report, or a transmission rank indicator (RI) report. The CQI can be used to assist the MIMO transmissions modes. The demodulated signals can be combined using a MIMO decoder , demapped using a demapper , deinterleaved using a deinterleaver , and decoded by a channel decoder  to generate binary output data  that can be used by other layers of the receiving station.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":["FIG. 4B","FIG. 4A","FIG. 4B"],"b":["424","426","434","428","460","500","520","530","540","560","570","580","510","550","590"]},"The data in a PDSCH or the UE-RSs can be precoded for large delay cyclic delay diversity (LD-CDD) by the precoder , CDD is a diversity scheme used in OMNI-based telecommunication systems where spatial diversity can be transformed into frequency diversity and thereby avoids intersymbol interference. CDD can be used in a MIMO system with N transmit antennas.","Referring to , an OFDM modulation can be performed, which can includes forward error correction (FEC), interleaving, modulation, and an inverse fast Fourier transformation (IFFT). The signal can be split in N antenna branches by a transmitter beamformer , where N represents the number of antennas. The cyclic shift of the first antenna (Tx ) may be set to zero (a reference signal ), while in the other branches the signal may be cyclically shifted by an antenna specific cyclic shift \u03b4, where n is an integer representing the transmit antenna (or receive antenna) and n=0, 1, . . . , N\u22121, as illustrated in .","An equivalent representation of the delay in the frequency domain, which can be called phase diversity (PD) (not shown), can directly be calculated from the IFFT size (or length) N. Ncan be the IFFT size of the modulator (on the transmitter) or the FFT size of the demodulator (on the receiver). Ncan be the number of sub-channels or subcarriers.  illustrates the difference between delay diversity (DD)  and cyclic delay diversity (CDD)  in the time domain. The reference signal  on the antenna Tx  is undelayed, while the signal on the antenna Tx  is delayed by one sample  for DD and cyclically shifted by one sample  for CDD.  illustrates an example of an OFDM symbol  in a reference signal  for a first antenna (Tx ), an OFDM symbol  in a DD signal  for a second antenna (Tx ), an OFDM symbol  in a CDD signal  for the second antenna (Tx ), an OFDM symbol  in a long delay CDD signal  for the second antenna (Tx ), and an OFDM symbol  in a long delay CDD signal  for an n antenna (Tx n) in the discrete time  domain.","In DD, the non-delayed signal can be transmitted over a first antenna , while a delayed version of the signal may be transmitted aver a second antenna  or each additional antenna. In OFDM, DD can be used to increase the frequency diversity. A forward error correction (FEC) code can pick up the increased frequency diversity and thus lower the bit error rate (BER) and the frame error rate (FER). DD can cause inter-symbol interference if the delay is too large, which maximum delay may be determined by the length of a guard interval (GI)  and .","In contrast, CDD allows for increased frequency diversity and a lower BER without limitations by the guard interval  and  where the signal on the second antenna or each additional antenna is not delayed  but cyclically shifted . Hence, no inter-symbol interference may occur and thus the cyclic shift may not be limited. CDD may not add additional complexity in the receiver (less complexity relative to DD) and no rate loss may occur in contrast to other space-time codes, even for a large number of antennas, such as eight antennas.","After the cyclic shift in CDD, the prefix of the shifted signal can be added to fill the guard interval. The signals of the different transmit antennas superimpose on the channel and the receiver processes the sum signal by simply removing the guard interval and by performing the inverse OFDM (IOFDM), which contains the Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT), the demodulation, the deinterleaving, and the decoding. Receiver processing is possible, since the cyclic shifts can appear as multi-paths at the receiver and thus, no special combining and no additional effort may be necessary because only the characteristics of the channel seen by the receiver may have changed.","In a MIMO OFDM system, a transmitter can have M transmit antennas and a receiver can have N receive antennas, a transmit antenna can be m=0, 1, . . . M\u22121 and a receive antenna can be n=0, 1, . . . N\u22121. For illustration, the large delay will be defined for N receive antennas, but the large delay can also be applied to the transmit antennas. In an example, the large delay can be defined as \u03b4=n*N\/N (in samples).  illustrates the large delay \u03b4 for a Tx  and the large delay \u03b4 for a Tx n. For example, the large delay for a Tx  can be \u03b4=192 (in samples) (3*512\/64) when the receive antennas is N=8 and the number of subchannels is N=512. CDD has been extended to spatial multiplexing. However, CDD precoding may not be interpreted as a pure cyclic delay in the time domain, but rather CDD precoding can be implemented by phase shifts in the frequency domain (i.e., frequency domain precoding) (not shown).","For low mobility scenarios in LTE, closed loop MIMO schemes can be used where a precoder is chosen from a code book based on the feedback from the user equipment (UE) to the eNodeB. Feedback for closed loop MIMO can include PMI\/RI reporting. For scenarios with higher mobility in LTE, open loop (OL) MIMO may be used where the precoding can provide an increased level of diversity. The increased level of diversity can be achieved by cyclic delay diversity (CDD) based precoding. In CDD based precoding, the feedback from the UE to the eNodeB can contain the rank (number of spatial streams) supported by the channel as well as a channel quality indicator (CQI) for adaptation of code rate and modulation scheme, but no short-term feedback for the choice of the spatial precoder may be provided to the eNodeB.","In LTE, a transmission mode (e.g., transmission mode ) can provide for open loop MIMO using CSI-RS and UE-RS, instead of CRS, as illustrated by the table in . The transmission mode may be used by an eNodeB to configure a UE for large delay CDD decoding of a PDSCH using a cell radio network temporary identifier (C-RNTI). The eNodeB can assign a radio network temporary identifier (RNTI) to the UE in a cell for precutting and decoding the PDCCH and PDSCH. Transmission mode  can be configured for large delay CDD transmitted on up to eight antennas. A rank (or layers) can refer to the number of antennas used for transmission (or reception). For example, a rank of four can refer to a MIMO transmission configured for four antennas. Using four layers (v) can refer to a MIMO transmission configured for four antennas or four antenna ports. Transmission mode  can include a downlink control information (DCI) format (e.g., DCI format 2D), which can include at least three bits for precoding information, as illustrated by the table in . The bits for precoding information can allow for precoder cycling with large delay CDD for more than four layers, as illustrated by the table in . Open loop MIMO can be provided by aperiodic CSI reporting modes (modes - or -) or periodic CSI reporting modes (modes - or -) using PUSCH CQI feedback without PMI\/RI feedback. Mode - can use a wideband CQI value per codeword, mode - can use a UE-selected subband CQI, and mode - can use a higher layer-configured subband CQI. For CSI reporting modes, transmission mode  may be similar to transmission mode . For transmission mode , PRB bundling may not be applied.","As shown in , a physical channel processor can include a precoder . For open loop MIMO using CSI-RS and UE-RS, a precoder can be configured for large delay CDD on an antenna port. The precoder can receive an input vector block from a layer mapper. The input vector block can include user equipment-specific reference signals (UE-RSs) or data for a physical downlink shared channel (PDSCH). The UE-RSs can be used for channel estimation. The precoder can generate a large delay cyclic delay diversity (CDD) vector block from the input vector block. When data is precoded, the data can be resource element mapped with UE-RSs or channel-state information reference signals (CSI-RSs) in a physical resource block (PRB). The precoder can be configured for large delay CDD transmitted on up to eight antennas. The large delay CDD vector block can have a rank greater than four, but a rank of 1, 2, and 3 may also be used.","For the UE-RS, the large delay CDD vector block can use a precoding matrix W.

In random beamforming, a set of beamforming weights can be selected randomly and UEs can feed back a few bits to tell the transmitter which beam gives the best performance and what rate the UEs can support the beam transmission. When the number of users is large, each random beamforming weight can provide good performance for some user.","In random beamforming, random orthonormal beams are constructed and transmitted to users with the highest signal-to-noise-plus-interference ratios (SINRs). Orthonormal beams can have an isotropic distribution. To have full channel knowledge at the receiver without random beamforming, each UE can feed back complex numbers, such as the receiver's channel gains, to the transmitter. With random beamforming each UE can feed back one real number, such as the channel with the best SINR given by a corresponding index which can be an integer number. UEs having favorable SINRs can provide a single number, such as a CQI, which can considerably reduce the amount of feedback used in transmission.","The precoder can be configured for large delay CDD for UE-RSs or data in the PDSCH using a precoding matrix with precoding matrix W or represented by Equation 1, shown above. The precoding matrix Wean be a random beam forming matrix. The preceding matrix W or W(i) can be defined in a codebook on a wireless device, such as a UE or eNodeB. The precoding matrix W(i) can be selected according to W(i)=C, where k is the precoder index given by k=(imod 4)+1\u03b5{1, 2, 3, 4}, where i=f(i)\u03b50, 1, . . . , N, f(i) stands for the mapping relationship from i to the allocated PRB for the physical downlink shared channel.","In an example, the eNodeB can cyclically assign different precoders for the UE on the PDSCH. For two antenna ports, the precoding matrix W(i)=Cwhere Cdenotes the precoding matrix corresponding to precoder index 0 in the table illustrated in . For four antenna ports, C, C, C, Cdenote precoding matrices corresponding to precoder indices , , , and , respectively, in the table illustrated in . For eight antenna ports and two layers, C, C, C, Cdenote precoding matrices corresponding to precoder indices i=0, 4, 8, 12; i=0 respectively, in the table illustrated in . For eight antenna ports and three to seven layers, C, C, C, Cdenote precoding matrices corresponding to precoder indices i=0, 1, 2, 3; i=0 respectively, in the tables illustrated in  For eight antenna ports and eight layers, the precoding matrix W(i)=Cwhere Cdenotes the precoder mat the table illustrated in . Alternatively, for eight antenna ports and two layers, the precoder index it has other equivalent candidates such as i=2, 6, 10, 14 and i=0. Furthermore, the rotation of the precoder index on different RBs can be based on PRB indexes such as k=(imod 8)+1\u03b5{1, 2, . . . , 8}, where C, C, . . . , Cwhere denote precoding matrices corresponding to precoder indices i=0, 4, 8, 12, 2, 6, 10, 14; i=0. The precoding matrix can be configured to change from PRB to PRB, instead of from subcarrier to subcarrier. A different precoder can be used every PRB. Aperiodic CSI reporting modes (modes - or -) or periodic CSI reporting modes (modes - or -) can be used for random beamforming plus a large delay CDD in an open loop MIMO transmission.","A precoder configured for random beamforming plus a large delay CDD using the UE-RS can report at least two CQIs for the two transport blocks (TBs) in a PUSCH feedback providing CQI accuracy without the rotation matrix U.  illustrates the performance comparison with one CQI feedback  and two CQI feedback , where the horizontal axis represents SINR  (measured in decibels) for transmission to a uniform linear array (ULA)  at a velocity of 30 km\/h relative to the eNB, and the vertical axis represents spectral efficiency (SE)  (measured in bps\/Hz). A decibel (dB) is a logarithmic unit that indicates the ratio of a physical quantity (usually power or intensity) relative to a specified or implied reference level. A ratio in decibels is ten times the logarithm to base 10 of the ratio of two power quantities. A signal-to-noise-and-interference ratio (SINE) or signal-to-interference ratio (S\/I or SIR), also known as the carrier-to-interference ratio (C\/I, CIR), refers to the quotient between the average received modulated carrier power S or C and the average received co-channel interference power 1, i.e. cross-talk, from other transmitters than the useful signal. Spectral efficiency (SE) spectrum efficiency or bandwidth efficiency refers to the information rate that can be transmitted over a given bandwidth in a specific communication system. SE can be a measure of how efficiently a limited frequency spectrum is utilized by the physical layer protocol, and sometimes by the media access control (the channel access protocol).","Another example provides a method  for precoding for spatial multiplexing in an open-loop multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) mobile communication system, as shown in the flow chart in . The method includes the operation of receiving an input vector block from a layer mapper, wherein the input vector block includes user equipment-specific reference signals (UE-RSs) or data in a physical downlink shared channel (PDSCH), as in block . The operation of generating a large delay cyclic delay diversity (CDD) vector block from the input vector block using a precoder configured for large delay CDD on an antenna port, wherein the data is resource element mapped with UE-RSs or channel-state information reference signals (CSI-RSs) in a physical resource block (PRB) follows, as in block .","In another example, the physical channel processor can be included in a mobile device or a transmission station.  provides an example illustration of a mobile device, such as a user equipment (UE), a mobile station (MS), a mobile wireless device, a mobile communication device, a tablet, a handset, or other type of mobile wireless device. The mobile device can include one or more antennas configured to communicate with transmission station, such as a base station (BS), an evolved Node B (eNB), or other type of wireless wide area network (WWAN) access point. The mobile device can be configured to communicate using at least one wireless communication standard including 3GPP LTE, WiMAX, High Speed Packet Access (HSPA), Bluetooth, and WiFi (IEEE 802.11 standard). The mobile device can communicate using separate antennas for each wireless communication standard or shared antennas for multiple wireless communication standards.
