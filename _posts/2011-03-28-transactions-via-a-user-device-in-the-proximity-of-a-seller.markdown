{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["1. Technical Field","Embodiments of the present disclosure generally relate to transactions, and more particularly, to methods and systems for transactions conducted via a user device in the proximity of a seller.","2. Related Art","A customer regularly searches for, purchases and pays for products and\/or services from online sellers over communication networks, such as the Internet. At times, a customer engages in transactions at a seller's location and uses a transaction card or cash for payment. Routinely, customers engage in transactions with a variety of sellers by using their mobile device. However, typical ways of engaging in such transactions and making payments may be cumbersome and inconvenient. For example, a customer may not have enough cash for payment in connection with a transaction at a seller's location, or a seller may not be set up to run a credit card for payment. In electronic commerce, a common way of making payments over the Internet includes using a credit card. Use of a credit card may be inconvenient in that it requires, for example, a user to enter credit card information for each purpose, which may be especially cumbersome when using a mobile device. Accordingly, there is a need for a simple way of conducting transactions.","As will be further described herein in relation to various embodiments, methods and systems for transactions conducted via a user device are provided, allowing a user to easily conduct transactions when the user comes into a proximity of a seller.","In accordance with an embodiment of the disclosure, a method for transactions comprises loading, by a server at a remote location, an application on a user device of a user, wherein the application allows the user to upload an inventory comprising one or more items and\/or services offered for sale by the user, as well as to view on the user device other inventory offered for sale by one or more other users as the user comes into proximity of the one or more other users, and wherein an inventory list maintained at the user device is constantly updated with the other inventory viewed by the user device. The method also comprises receiving, by the server at the remote location, transaction information associated with conducting a transaction in connection with the inventory list over the user device. The method further comprises facilitating, by the server at the remote location, the transaction between the user via the user device and the one or more other users.","In accordance with another embodiment of the disclosure, a transaction system comprises one or more processors; and one or more memories adapted to store a plurality of machine-readable instructions which when executed by the one or more processors are adapted to cause the transaction system to: load, by a server at a remote location, an application on a user device of a user, wherein the application allows the user to upload an inventory comprising one or more items and\/or services offered for sale by the user, as well as to view on the user device other inventory offered for sale by one or more other users as the user comes into proximity of the one or more other users, and wherein an inventory list maintained at the user device is constantly updated with the other inventory viewed by the user device; receive, by the server at the remote location, transaction information associated with conducting a transaction in connection with the inventory list over the user device; and facilitate, by the server at the remote location, the transaction between the user via the user device and the one or more other users.","In accordance with another embodiment of the disclosure, a non-transitory computer readable medium on which are stored computer readable instructions and, when executed by a processor, cause the processor to: load an application on a user device of a user, wherein the application allows the user to upload an inventory comprising one or more items and\/or services offered for sale by the user, as well as to view on the user device other inventory offered for sale by one or more other users as the user comes into proximity of the one or more other users, and wherein an inventory list maintained at the user device is constantly updated with the other inventory viewed by the user device; receive transaction information associated with conducting a transaction in connection with the inventory list over the user device; and facilitate the transaction between the user via the user device and the one or more other users.","These and other features and advantages of the embodiments of the present disclosure will be more readily apparent from the detailed description of the embodiments set forth below taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.","Like element numbers in different figures represent the same or similar elements.","In accordance with various embodiments described herein, methods and systems are provided that enable a user to easily conduct transactions over a user device. A transaction application, which may be loaded on the user device from a service provider, enables the user, when the user comes into a certain proximity of one or more sellers, to see or view offers from the seller(s) including, for example, the seller(s)' inventories listed with an asking price, a photograph, a description, an icon and\/or any other appropriate identifier. As such, the user device may display seller(s)' digital representation of their inventory. The user may purchase and make payments for items and\/or services offered by the seller(s) when the user is in a certain proximity of the seller(s). In other embodiments, the user may be a seller and upload inventory for sale. Inventory lists may be kept and be constantly updated with new users and new inventory lists of available items and\/or services. The transaction application may be provided by a service provider such as PAYPAL and\/or EBAY of San Jose, Calif.","Advantageously, a user may safely and easily conduct transactions with sellers that are associated with the service provider (or that have an active transaction application) from a location of the user that is in proximity to such sellers. For example, because the user is located in proximity of the sellers, such as in front of a seller's venue or within a standard wireless communication technology range such as a hotspot WiFi or BLUETOOTH range, the user may decide to purchase and pay for an item and\/or service offered by the seller over a user device. The user may then transfer payment over the user device in a simple, convenient, and fast manner that is comparable to a cash transaction.","From a seller's perspective, the seller, which is associated with the service provider or has an active transaction application, may simplify transactions such as electronic payments without the need for a Point of Sales (POS) machine, laptop computer or other computing device, thus freeing up space for additional merchandise display. This may be advantageous for travelling vendors including for example, vendors that line up at art festivals, concerts, city or country festival days, sporting events and\/or the like. Furthermore, this may be advantageous for sellers that typically may be a \u201ccash only\u201d venue as a result of the inconvenience of having power or Internet access. Such \u201ccash only\u201d venues may easily conduct transactions by taking payments made over a user device according to one or more embodiments of the present disclosure.","Referring now to the drawings wherein the showings are for purposes of illustrating embodiments of the present disclosure only, and not for purposes of limiting the same,  illustrates a block diagram of a transaction system using a service provider according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","120","160","100","120","140","180","160"]},"The network , in one embodiment, may be implemented as a single network or a combination of multiple networks.

As such, in various embodiments, the user device , seller servers or devices , and service provider server or device  may be associated with a particular link (e.g., a link, such as a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) to an IP (Internet Protocol) address).","The user device , in various embodiments, may be implemented using any appropriate combination of hardware and\/or software configured for wired and\/or wireless communication over the network . In various examples, the user device  may be implemented as a wireless telephone (e.g., cellular, mobile, etc.), a smart phone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a personal computer, a notebook computer, and\/or various other generally known types of wired and\/or wireless computing devices. It should be appreciated that the user device  may be referred to as a client device or a customer device without departing from the scope of the present disclosure.","The user device , in one embodiment, includes a user interface application , which may be utilized by the user  to conduct transactions such as financial transactions (e.g., shopping, purchasing, bidding, etc.) with the service provider server  over the network . In one aspect, purchase expenses may be directly and\/or automatically debited from an account related to the user  via the user interface application , in a manner as described herein.","In one implementation, the user interface application  comprises a software program, such as a graphical user interface (GUI), executable by a processor that is configured to interface and communicate with the service provider server  via the network . In another implementation, the user interface application  comprises a browser module that provides a network interface to browse information available over the network . For example, the user interface application  may be implemented, in part, as a web browser to view information available over the network . In another example, the user  is able to access seller websites or lists of inventories via the one or more seller servers or devices  to view and select items and\/or services for purchase, and the user  is able to purchase items and\/or services from the one or more seller servers or devices  via the service provider server . Accordingly, the user  may conduct transactions such as financial transactions (e.g., view, purchase and pay for items and\/or services) from the one or more seller servers or devices  via the service provider server .","The user device , in various embodiments, may include other applications  as may be desired in one or more embodiments of the present disclosure to provide additional features available to the user . In one example, such other applications  may include security applications for implementing client-side security features, programmatic client applications for interfacing with appropriate application programming interfaces (APIs) over the network , and\/or various other types of generally known programs and\/or software applications. In still other examples, the other applications  may interface with the user interface application  for improved efficiency and convenience.","According to one or more embodiments, the user interface application  or the other applications  include a transaction application that may be loaded on user device  by service provider server . Such transaction application enables user  to see sellers that are associated with service provider server  with their inventories listed as user  comes into a proximity of the sellers. User  may then decide to purchase and easily make payments for items and\/or services offered by the sellers over user device . In various embodiments, the transaction application enables user  to be a buyer or a seller, that is, as an average user, user  may enter the free market and upload inventory to be offered for sale as will be described in further detail below.","User device , in one embodiment, may include at least one user identifier , which may be implemented, for example, as operating system registry entries, cookies associated with the user interface application , identifiers associated with hardware of the user device , or various other appropriate identifiers. The user identifier  may include one or more attributes related to user , such as personal information related to user  (e.g., one or more user names, passwords, photograph images, biometric IDs, addresses, phone numbers, etc.) and banking information and\/or funding sources (e.g., one or more banking institutions, credit card issuers, user account numbers, security data and information, etc.). In various implementations, user identifier  may be passed with a user login request to the service provider server  via the network , and the user identifier  may be used by the service provider server  to associate the user  with a particular user account maintained by the service provider server , in a manner as described herein.","The one or more seller servers or devices , in various embodiments, may be maintained by one or more individuals or business entities (or in some cases, by a partner of a business entity that processes transactions on behalf of business entities). It should be appreciated that individuals or business entities may also be referred to as \u201csellers\u201d or \u201cmerchants\u201d without departing from the scope of the present disclosure. Examples of sellers include individuals and also merchant sites, resource information sites, utility sites, real estate management sites, social networking sites, etc., which offer various items and\/or services for purchase and payment. In some embodiments, sellers may need registration of the user identity information as part of offering the items and\/or services to the user  over the network . As such, each of the one or more seller servers  may include a seller database  for identifying available items and\/or services, which may be made available to the user device  for viewing and purchase by the user . It should be appreciated that although a user-seller transaction is illustrated in this embodiment, the system may also be applicable to user-user, seller-seller and\/or seller-user transactions. In some embodiments, any user may be a seller or a buyer.","Each of the seller servers or devices , in one embodiment, may include a marketplace application , which may be configured to provide information over the network  to the user interface application  of the user device . For example, the user  may interact with the marketplace application  through the user interface application  over the network  to search and view various items and\/or services available for purchase in the seller database . According to one or more embodiments of the present disclosure, the various items and\/or services available in the seller database  may be displayed to user  via user device  as user  comes into a certain proximity (or within a certain range) of a seller.","Each of the seller servers or devices , in one embodiment, may include a checkout application , which may be configured to facilitate online financial transactions (e.g., purchase transactions) by the user  of items and\/or services identified by the marketplace application . As such, in one aspect, the checkout application  may be configured to accept payment information from the user  over the network .","Each of the seller servers or devices , in one embodiment, may include at least one seller identifier , which may be included as part of the one or more items and\/or services made available for purchase so that, e.g., particular items and\/or services are associated with particular sellers. In one implementation, the seller identifier  may include one or more attributes and\/or parameters related to the seller, such as business and banking information. User  may conduct transactions such as financial transactions (e.g., selection, monitoring, purchasing, and\/or providing payment for items and\/or services) with each seller server  via the service provider server  over the network .","The service provider server , in one embodiment, may be maintained by a transaction processing entity, which may provide processing for financial transactions and\/or information transactions between the user  and one or more of the seller servers . As such, the service provider server  includes a service application , which may be adapted to interact with each user device  and\/or each seller server  over the network  to facilitate the selection, purchase, and\/or payment of items and\/or services by the user  from one or more of the seller servers . In one example, the service provider server  may be provided by PayPal, Inc. and\/or eBay of San Jose, Calif., USA.","The service application , in one embodiment, utilizes a payment processing module  to process purchases and\/or payments for financial transactions between the user  and each of the seller servers . In one implementation, the payment processing module  assists with resolving financial transactions through validation, delivery, and settlement. As such, the service application  in conjunction with the payment processing module  settles indebtedness between the user  and each of the seller servers , wherein accounts may be directly and\/or automatically debited and\/or credited of monetary funds in a manner as accepted by the banking industry.","The service provider server , in one embodiment, may be maintained by a transaction processing entity, which may provide processing for financial transactions and\/or information transactions between the user  and one or more of the seller servers . As such, the service provider server  includes a service application , which may be adapted to interact with each user device  and\/or each seller server  over the network  to facilitate the selection, purchase, and\/or payment of items and\/or services by the user  from one or more of the seller servers . In one example, the service provider server  may be provided by PAYPAL, Inc. and\/or EBAY of San Jose, Calif., USA.","In one implementation, the user  may have identity attributes stored with the service provider server , and the user  may have credentials to authenticate or verify identity with the service provider server . User attributes may include personal information, banking information and\/or funding sources as previously described. In various aspects, the user attributes may be passed to the service provider server  as part of a login, selection, purchase, and\/or payment request, and the user attributes may be utilized by the service provider server  to associate the user  with one or more particular user accounts maintained by the service provider server .","The transaction system described above with respect to the embodiment of  may be used to set up and facilitate transactions using a user device wherein a user may view inventories offered by sellers within a certain proximity to the user or user device. In various embodiments, the user may be a seller or a buyer.","Referring now to , a flow diagram for facilitating a transaction using a user device is illustrated according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. According to one or more embodiments, the flow diagram of  may be implemented by system  of .","In block , when user  (referring also to ) has a pre-existing account with service provider server  wherein user  has identity attributes stored with service provider server  as described above, user  may download a transaction application on user device  from service provider server . The transaction application may allow user  to see or view associated sellers with their listed inventories on user device  as user  comes into a certain proximity of the sellers. In one or more embodiments, the transaction application may allow any user to also be a seller and offer inventories including items and\/or services for sale as will be described in further detail below with respect to the embodiment of .","In block , user  may turn on the transaction application and view one or more offers by sellers in the proximity of user  listing their inventories. According to one or more embodiments, user  may be in the proximity of one or more sellers, for example, when user  comes within a certain distance, area or radius of the sellers, or when user  is within a certain standard wireless communication technology range such as a hotspot WiFi, BLUETOOTH range, or the like. For example, an appropriate proximity may be when user  comes within a radius of a seller set at approximately 100 yards, 500 yards, 1000 yards, etc., or when user  is standing in the vicinity, or in front of the sellers' location.","According to one or more embodiments, sellers may list their inventories including items and\/or services offering such items and\/or services with an asking price, one or more photographs, descriptions, icons and\/or any applicable identifiers of the items and\/or services. In an embodiment, user device  holds the sellers' digital representation of their inventory. User  may browse the offered sellers' inventories maintained on seller server or device  and may decide to purchase a selected item and\/or service, as will be described in further detail with respect to  according to one or more embodiments.","Referring to , a flow diagram for updating inventory for sale on an ad-hoc basis is illustrated according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. In block , any average user that may want to list items and\/or services for sale, for example, on an ad-hoc basis, may use the transaction application to be a seller and upload items and\/or services to be offered sale along with corresponding prices, descriptions, photographs, icons, etc. In this regard, such user may declare global variables for identification of items and\/or services, for example, the user may have a unique identifier and declare a variable such as a Unique Application Identifier (\u201cUniqueAppID\u201d) as well as Location Services (\u201cGpsLoc\u201d). These two variables may be used as a primary key on an ITEMS table as illustrated below in Table 1 as an example.","In an embodiment, any user that wants to sell any item and\/or service may simply take a picture of the item and\/or service (\u201cimage.png\u201d) with his or her user device and quickly enter a description of the item and\/or service (\u201cItemDesc\u201d) and an asking price (\u201cAskPrice\u201d). Then, an Item Number (\u201cItemNum\u201d) may be created by using part or all of the \u201cUniqueAppID\u201d and adding the Item Number on a database as a self regulating incrementing number. The database may be a list that includes specific fields with built-in commands such as ADD\/REMOVE and QUERY for results.","It should be appreciated that the Item Number may be tied to any appropriate identifier including a user identifier, a user device identifier such as a phone number, or any other identifier, as well as a known geo location. That is, a unique item and\/or service may be uploaded and tagged with an Item Number that may reflect a unique application identifier and a geo location. In an example, if \u2018UniqueAppID\u2019=\u2018123456\u2019 and the user creates a first item, then \u2018ItemNum\u2019=\u20181234560001\u2019. All of these 6 digits of the item as well as a Date\/Timestamp, asking price, item description, photo, etc., may also be added to the ITEMS table as illustrated in Table 1 below:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"259pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 1"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"ITEMS Table"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"7"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Unique","GpsLoc","ItemNum","AskPrice","ItemDesc","Image.png","Date\/Timestamp"]},{"entry":"App ID"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"7","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"In block  of , when a user acting as an ad-hoc seller having a first user device with a transaction application loaded therein approaches other ad-hoc sellers or comes within a certain range, for example within a standard wireless communication technology range such as a hotspot WiFi or\/BLUETOOTH range of any other user devices having an active transaction application loaded therein, all items listed on the ITEMS table of the first user device may be compared with listed items of other sellers within the certain range.","In block , once the inventories are compared, any missing unique records may be added. The first user device may then display all items and\/or services available for sale that do not belong to the first user device, so that the items and\/or services that the user is selling may be filtered off the user's own viewable list. That is, the transaction application of the first user device may compare each \u201cItemNum\u201d corresponding to items and\/or services listed by other user devices of proximate sellers, and if such items and\/or services do not exist in the first user device's item list, such items and\/or services may be added to the first user device's item list.","In block , as the first user device comes within a certain range of other sellers, the list of items and\/or services may be updated with the other sellers' items and\/or services. The list may be constantly updated (e.g., in the background) as the list may be ever evolving within different ranges of even further sellers.","Inventory listings of available items and\/or services may be maintained by the user device based on an item identifier such as a phone number with a geo location attached to it. In this manner, the inventories are not listed just by location, for example, by state or city, but every item and\/or service may be listed based on where the user device has been or is located such that the inventory listings reflect what the user device itself has seen.","By having each user device search and quickly upload entries regarding items and\/or services for sale, a network is allowed to build in a geo location, which may be larger than, for example, a normal WIFI Access Point. As users walk around, the lists may get more unique sellers with general GPS location. Advantageously, an ad-hoc like network may remain or survive even if one user goes offline, for example, even if one user device's battery dies, or if users clear their own lists frequently, or other like circumstances.","According to one or more embodiments, the Date\/Timestamp field (e.g. as illustrated in Table 1 above) may allow items and\/or services to have a Time To Live (\u201cTTL\u201d) status that a user's individual settings may hold. If the user wants to set his or her TTL for a certain period of time, for example a set number of hours or days, this would be of little consequence to the larger network of ad-hoc sharing. In various examples, the user may set a timeline such that entries on a list of items and\/or services may be deleted when they are 24 hours old, or the list may be flushed completely.","Furthermore, the user may be allowed to control how much space to fill in the user device such as in memory. Allowing users to cap their lists of items and\/or services may benefit older user devices such as smartphones. But as user devices evolve, space may increase and the user device, e.g., a smart phone, may become more similar to a POS item.","According to an embodiment, if a user would like to purchase an item and\/or service, or if a user would like to request updated information, the user may be informed of a direction to head to in order to get in range of the appropriate seller. Once in range, higher resolution photos, for example, may be acquired.","In an embodiment, the transaction application may be running in the background with location services. As the user walks around, the list of items and\/or services may be updated offering unique options, which the user may decide to walk to and purchase.","According to one or more embodiments of the present disclosure, the transaction application may allow a first user device to carry two sets of inventories. One inventory may include all items and\/or services with corresponding photos and details taken by a first user (e.g., a \u201cRoot User\u201d or owner of the first user device). A second inventory may include all ad-hoc shared non Root User items and\/or services. With these two separate inventory lists, any user running the transaction application may turn on or off his or her own items and\/or services, and also browse everyone else's on or off inventory listings.","In various embodiments, as described above, the transaction application may allow users to communicate, for example in an ad-hoc basis, a list of items and\/or services to other user devices so that all items and\/or services on each user device may be the same list for all the user devices. Because the transaction application according to an embodiment may transfer data in the background, for example using a simple set of logic gates to ensure only unique items and\/or services are listed, and no duplicates exist on those lists, any user would only see active items and\/or services in their general location. By way of example and not of limitation, this may be similar to someone connecting to a website and doing a search, wherein the website may contact a server to request available data.","Referring back to , in block , if user  decides to accept a seller's offer and purchase and pay for a selected item and\/or service offered by a seller in the proximity of user , details of the transaction may be transferred to service provider server . In an embodiment, once user  decides to purchase and pay for the selected item and\/or service, service provider server  may be used to effect the payment. A login screen may be shown on an interface of user device  wherein user  may log in by entering, for example, a Username and Password to access his or her pre-existing account with service provider server  and may also choose to make payment for the selected item and\/or service. In an embodiment, user  may review the purchase details before completing payment and may decide to change, for example, payment arrangements such as funding sources. For example, user  may choose a specific credit card as a funding source. Once user  has reviewed and agreed to the purchase details, user  completes payment.","In block , service provider server  may facilitate the transaction and may log and provide receipts for the transaction. As described above with respect to  according to one or more embodiments, service provider server  may facilitate the transaction via payment processing module  to process transactions between user  and each of the seller servers . In one implementation, payment processing module  assists with resolving financial transactions through validation, delivery, and settlement. As such, the service application  in conjunction with the payment processing module  settles indebtedness between user  and each of the sellers , wherein accounts may be directly and\/or automatically debited and\/or credited of monetary funds in a manner as accepted by the banking industry.","Referring now to , a block diagram for a transaction conducted via a user interface of a user device is illustrated according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. According to one or more embodiments, user device  of  may include a user interface as illustrated in , which may interact, for example, with user interface application .","When a user has a pre-existing account with service provider server  (also referring to ) and user  has downloaded a transaction application on the user's user device from service provider server , user  may turn on the transaction application to allow user  to see or view sellers with their listed inventories on the user device  as user  comes into a certain proximity of the sellers. In this regard, in block  of the embodiment of , a user interface  of the user device may display a simple list of all sellers in the area, for example, sellers : Seller A, Seller B, Seller C, etc., as a user enters the proximity of such sellers. That is, when a user comes within a certain proximity or radius of sellers , the list of sellers in the area are displayed on user interface . Also, as described above with respect to the embodiment of , user  may be able to upload his or her inventory list in an ad-hoc basis.","In block , the user may select to view a particular listed seller in the area. For example, the user may select Seller A, which would expand to show its corresponding inventory. Seller A's inventory may include various items and\/or services  available and offered by Seller A.","In an embodiment, the user may be notified of sellers in the area once one is detected. Conversely, sellers may be notified of a user's request when the user is in a proximate location.","In one or more embodiments, users may take trips to establishments or events such as an in-town circus, concerts, sporting events, etc. Such trips may be easier for users having a transaction application, which allows the users to see what sellers are located in the area. Sellers associated with service provider server  (having an account with the server provider or an active transaction application) may display offers and inventories to such users. In one example, a user may walk up to a ticket counter at a sports event or concert to view any offered inventory, i.e., available tickets for the event. In this example, the user may go to a door or a ticket taker, who may sell the user an e-ticket to the event if maximum capacity has not been reached. In another example, bars charging a \u201ccover charge\u201d may be transacted via service provider server , for example, for those occasions when the user may want to start a tab, but did not have enough cash to get in the door. As such, the transaction application loaded on the user's user device may replace cash transactions for nearly any situation.","In block , the user may select a particular item and\/or service from seller A, for example, an Item\/Service A. User interface  then expands to show details  about Item\/Service A including for example, a photograph, a description and\/or a price for Item\/Service A.","In one embodiment, sellers may display their location or broadcast their locations, for example, if a user optionally requests to locate a seller for the item the user has selected, for example by selecting input . For instance, Seller A may display its location if the user requests the location upon selecting Item\/Service A.","In other embodiments, sellers may promote certain items and\/or products by, for example, listing a tag line or phrase (i.e., shout out).
