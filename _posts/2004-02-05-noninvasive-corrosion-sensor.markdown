title: Non-invasive corrosion sensor
abstract: The non-invasive corrosion sensor includes a heat sink, at least two peltiers, a reference standard and a data acquisition device. Each peltier has a negative side and a positive side, and each peltier communicates with the heat sink such that the negative side of each peltier is maintained at a common temperature. The reference standard communicates with the positive side of one of the peltiers while the test piece communicates with the positive side of the other peltier; and the data acquisition devise is able to record and compare the differences in temperatures between the test piece and the reference standard. A higher temperature in the test piece than in the reference standard indicates the presence of corrosion. The differences in temperatures of the test piece and the reference standard are obtained via electrical currents in the peltiers.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.","The present invention relates to a non-invasive corrosion sensor. More specifically, but without limitation, the present invention relates to a non-invasive corrosion sensor for detecting and measuring the rate of corrosion.","Current methods for detecting and measuring the rate of corrosion are non-quantitative, non-predictive and require visual observation of the surfaces. These methods often result in increased costs due to maintenance operations being performed prior to need or not soon enough. In either case the costs could be significantly reduced if maintenance could be performed at the most optimum time. This can only be accomplished through use of a method that will permit quantitative, continuous measurement of material surfaces not accessible during normal operations.","A commonly used method for detecting and measuring the rate of corrosion is visual inspection. To utilize this method the area must be accessible to viewing. Another method includes ultrasonic testing whereby sound waves detect changes in material properties (thickness and density). Additional methods are eddy current testing which detects changes in material\/magnetic properties, and resistively testing which measures changes in a material's electrical resistance. All of these methods suffer from one or more of the above listed liabilities.","Thus, there is a need in the art to provide a method or mechanism that incorporates the listed benefits without the limitations inherent in present methods. For the foregoing reasons, there is a need for a non-invasive corrosion sensor.","The present invention is directed to a non-invasive corrosion sensor. The non-invasive corrosion sensor includes a heat sink, at least two peltiers, a reference standard and a data acquisition device. Each peltier has a negative side and a positive side, and each peltier communicates with the heat sink such that the negative side of each peltier is maintained at a common temperature. The reference standard communicates with the positive side of one of the peltiers while the test piece communicates with the positive side of the other peltier; and the data acquisition device is able to record and compare the differences in temperatures between the test piece and the reference piece. A higher temperature in the test piece than in the reference standard indicates the presence of corrosion. The differences in temperatures of the test piece and the reference standard are obtained via electrical currents in the peltiers.","It is an object of the invention to provide a non-invasive corrosion sensor for detecting and measuring the rate of corrosion that is quantitative and predictive.","It is an object of the invention to provide a non-invasive corrosion sensor that does not require visual observation of the surfaces.","It is an object of the invention to provide a non-invasive corrosion sensor that does not require operators to perform a test or collect data.","The preferred embodiments of the present invention are illustrated by way of example in . As seen in , the non-invasive corrosion sensor  includes a heat sink , at least two peltiers , and a reference standard . Each peltier  may include a positive side  and a negative side . The peltiers  communicate with the heat sink  such that the negative side  of each of the peltiers  is maintained at a common temperature. The reference standard  communicates with the positive side  of one of the peltiers while the test piece  communicates with the positive side  of the other peltier . A data acquisition device  may be utilized to record and compare the differences in temperatures of the test piece  and the reference standard .","A heat sink  may be defined, but without limitation, as a material with high thermal conductivity used to equilibrate the temperatures on adjacent sides of the peltier . In the preferred embodiment of the invention the heat sink  is manufactured from aluminum.","A peltier  may be defined, but without limitation, as a thermo-electric device made of semiconductor material which heats or cools when an electric current is passed through the conductors. Conversely when the opposing surfaces of a peltier  are subjected to a temperature differential a measurable and calibratible current will be generated. This current can be converted to a microwatt heat load. As seen in , the preferred embodiment of the invention includes two peltiers : a reference peltier  and a test piece peltier . The reference peltier  thermally communicates with the reference standard , while the test piece peltier  thermally communicates with the test piece . The negative side  of each peltier  is maintained at a common temperature through contact with the common heat sink . The opposing positive side  of the each peltier  is in contact with the reference standard  and the test piece  respectively.","A reference standard  may be defined, but without limitation, as a material identical to the test piece  (the material being monitored). In the preferred embodiment, the reference standard  is polished to remove all surface corrosion\/contaminates and is sealed for protection.","The data acquisition device  may be defined, but without limitation, as a device capable of measuring and recording small electrical currents.","The non-invasive corrosion sensor  may also include an enclosure . The heat sink , the peltier(s) , and the reference standard  may be disposed within the enclosure . The preferred embodiment of the enclosure  is manufactured from polycarbonate. Polycarbonate may be defined, but without limitation, as a tough, highly impact resistant, corrosion resistant, non-conductive polymer. The interior of the enclosure  and its components may be environmentally sealed with flowable RTV (Room Temperature Vulcanizing) silicone coating . The preferred embodiment of the silicone coating is a one-part, flowable, solvent-free room temperature cure, which can be found under the brand name of Dow Corning\u00ae 3140 RTV Coating.","In the preferred embodiment of the sensor , the test piece peltier  is external to the enclosure . Each of the peltiers  may include peltier leads .","The enclosure  is designed to bolt into contact with the test piece . Twin peltier leads  from the reference peltier  and the test piece peltier  may protrude from the enclosure . Each negative side  of the two peltiers  is bonded to the heat sink  with thermal epoxy . The positive side  of the internal or reference peltier  is bonded to the reference standard  with thermal epoxy . Thermal epoxy  may be defined, but without limitation, as a two part epoxy which forms a permanent thermal bond. Thermal epoxy  may be, but without limitation, silver filled, aluminum oxide filled or aluminum nitride filled. The preferred thermal epoxy  may have a thermal conductivity of about 1.73 W\/m-K, and may operate in temperatures of about \u221255 to about 125\u00b0 C. The preferred thermal epoxy cures in about 1 hour at about 85\u00b0 C. The preferred thermal epoxy is a two-part aluminum oxide filled epoxy TEC manufactured by Melcor. Thermal interface material, constructed of aluminum oxide with Adhesive Interface Pads, may be substituted for the thermal epoxy. The preferred embodiment of the thermal interface material may have a thermal conductivity of about 1.7 W\/m-K and a maximum operating temperature of about 150\u00b0 C. However, it is understood that any material that can bond, bind, fasten, or the like can be used.","In operation, the sensor  is fastened to the test piece  with stainless cap screws  or any other type of fastener. These screws place the external peltier's (test piece peltier ) positive side , which is bonded to the test piece surface  with thermal grease , in compression (about 150-300 psi). Thermal grease  may be defined, but without limitation, as a grease that provides a thermal conductive path and allows the option of disassembly. Examples of thermal grease  include metal-oxide-filled synthetic grease, silicone based thermal grease, phase change thermal interface material, thermal joint compound, and the like. The preferred thermal grease  is Zinc-Oxide\/Silicon based grease or paste. The preferred thermal grease  is about 60% to about 80% zinc oxide with dimethyl polysiloxane, silicone fluid and polymethysiloxane. The preferred thermal grease  has a specific gravity of about 2.2, its solubility in water is negligible and has a flashpoint above 250 degrees Fahrenheit. Thermal interface material may be substituted for the thermal grease. However, it is understood that any material that can bond, bind, fasten, or the like and then allow the option of disassembly can be used.","The leads  of the peltiers  are connected to the data acquisition device . The negative side  of each peltier is maintained at a common temperature through contact with common heat sink . The opposing positive side  of each peltier  (reference peltier  and test piece ) is in contact with the reference standard  and the test piece  respectively. A difference in temperatures between the reference standard  and the test piece  will generate a differing electrical current from each peltier . This output is recorded and compared (reference vs. test piece) by the data acquisition device . An increase in current from the test piece peltier  over the reference peltier  indicates a positive heat differential and the presence of corrosion.","When introducing elements of the present invention or the preferred embodiment(s) thereof, the articles \u201ca,\u201d \u201can,\u201d \u201cthe,\u201d and \u201csaid\u201d are intended to mean there are one or more of the elements.
