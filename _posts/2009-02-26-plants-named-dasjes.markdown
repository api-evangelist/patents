{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"p":["Latin name of the genus and species of the claimed plant: -(now -).","Variety denomination: \u2018DASJES\u2019.","The present invention relates to a new and distinct cultivar of plant, botanically known as -(now -) of the Asteraceae family, commonly known as Michaelmas Daisy and New York Aster, and hereinafter referred to by the cultivar name \u2018DASJES\u2019.","The new cultivar is a product of a planned breeding program conducted by the inventor, Bent Juhl JENSEN, in Malling, Denmark. The objective of the breeding program is to develop a new variety with uniform plant growth habit, unique floret colors, and good postproduction longevity.","The new cultivar originated from a cross made in a controlled breeding program by the inventor on Apr. 1 2005, in Malling, Denmark. The female or seed parent is -\u2018WHITE SWAN\u2019 (unpatented). The male or pollen parent is \u2018WHITE PRESTIGE\u2019 (unpatented, described in terminated CPVO Grant No. 8521). The new \u2018DASJES\u2019 was discovered and selected by the inventor as a single flowering plant within the progeny of the stated cross in September of 2006 in a controlled environment in Malling, Denmark. The selection of the new \u2018DASJES\u2019 was based on its uniform plant growth habit and desirable inflorescence form and ray floret color.","Asexual reproduction of the new cultivar by vegetative tip cuttings was first performed in June of 2006 in Malling, Denmark, and has demonstrated that the combination of characteristics as herein disclosed for the new cultivar are firmly fixed and retained through successive generations of asexual reproduction. The new cultivar reproduces true to type.","The following traits have been repeatedly observed and are determined to be unique characteristics of \u2018DASJES\u2019, which in combination distinguish this as a new and distinct cultivar:\n\n","Plants of the new \u2018DASJES\u2019 differ from plants of the parents, -\u2018WHITE SWAN\u2019 (unpatented) and -\u2018WHITE PRESTIGE\u2019 (unpatented, described in terminated CPVO Grant No. 8521), in the characteristics described below:\n\n","Of the many commercial cultivars known to the present inventor, the most similar in comparison to the new \u2018DASJES\u2019 is -\u2018VICTORIA DIANA\u2019 (patented, U.S. Plant Pat. No. 13,359 and CPVO Grant 11802), in the characteristics described in Table 1.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0017"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 1"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":[{},{},"Comparison Cultivar"]},{"entry":[{},"New Cultivar","\u2018VICTORIA DIANA\u2019"]},{"entry":["Characteristic","\u2018DASJES\u2019","(patented)"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Leaf Shape:","Gladiate to oblanceolate","Lanceolate"]},{"entry":["Capitulum Size:","Diameter: 40 mm","Diameter: 32.5 mm"]},{"entry":["Ray Florets","About 250 ray florets per","About 150 ray florets per"]},{"entry":[{},"inflorescence, which are","flower, which are"]},{"entry":[{},"oval in shape, with","narrowly obovate in"]},{"entry":[{},"rounded, slightly retuse","shape, with rounded apex"]},{"entry":[{},"apex"]},{"entry":["Mature Ray Floret","Pure White, whiter than","Creamy white, RHS"]},{"entry":["Color","RHS 155D, and older","155D"]},{"entry":["(upper surface):","petals get a tinge of"]},{"entry":[{},"purple, RHS 75A"]},{"entry":["Disc Florets:","About 5 disc florets per","About 25-35 disc florets"]},{"entry":[{},"inflorescence","per inflorescence"]},{"entry":["Mature Disc Floret","Pure white, whiter","Yellow-green, RHS"]},{"entry":["Color:","than RHS 155D, with","151B"]},{"entry":[{},"green margin, RHS 134D"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"The new \u2018DASJES\u2019 has not been observed under all possible environmental conditions.
