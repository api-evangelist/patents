For example, a subscriber may dial an information number from their mobile device, such as \u201c411,\u201d Once the subscriber dials the number, an automated system may answer the call (or an operator) and provide the subscriber with a menu of options. The subscriber selects options from the menu by pressing buttons on the mobile device or through voice recognition software. Once the subscriber requests data by selecting an option, the automated system retrieves the data from a network and delivers the data to the subscriber over the mobile device.","Problems are associated with current implementations of customer assistance for mobile devices. Many existing systems rely on the use of an external network. In provide data to the subscriber. The use of an external network for customer self-support can consume a large amount of bandwidth, congest the network, provide for slower customer response times, and lead to increased costs for the mobile device carrier. In addition, the use of an automated system with multiple options can result in longer call wait times, increased call costs for the mobile carrier and customer, and lost customers due to the longer call wait times.","These and other problems exist with respect to assisting customers of wireless devices.","The headings provided herein are for convenience only and do not necessarily affect the scope or meaning of the claimed invention.","In the drawings, the same reference numbers and acronyms identify elements or acts with the same or similar functionality for ease of understanding and convenience. To easily identify the discussion of any particular element or act, the most significant digit or digits in a reference number refer to the Figure number in which that element is first introduced (e.g., element  is first introduced and discussed with respect to ).","A portion of this disclosure contains material to which a claim for copyright is made. The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent document or patent disclosure (including the Figures) as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent file or records, but the copyright owner reserves all other copyright rights whatsoever.","The invention will now be described with respect to various embodiments. The following description provides specific details for a thorough understanding of, and enabling description for, these embodiments of the invention. However, one skilled in the art will understand that the invention may be practiced without these details. In other instances, well-known structures and functions have not been shown or described in detail to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the description of the embodiments of the invention.","It is intended that the terminology used in the description presented below be interpreted in its broadest reasonable manner, even though it is being used in conjunction with a detailed description of certain specific embodiments of the invention. Certain terms may even be emphasized below; however, any terminology intended to be interpreted in any restricted manner will be overtly and specifically defined as such in this Detailed Description section.","A method for locally intercepting calls from a mobile device for providing enhanced services such as customer self-support is disclosed. Subscribers may dial one or more predetermined numbers on their respective mobile device. Software on the mobile device determines whether the number corresponds to one of the predetermined numbers (such as an information number). The phone provides information to the subscriber, and may intercept the call when the number is dialed, after the call has gone through, while the call is on hold, etc. For example, if the number dialed matches an information number, then the mobile device may interrupt the attempted call and display a list of possible solutions that address the subscriber's needs on the mobile device.","Additionally, if the number dialed matches a predetermined number, then the mobile device may display a list of solutions during the call that may address the subscriber's needs on the mobile device. For example, during an information call or a call to a user's voicemail, the system may display information related to the call, or may display paths to related information for the user to choose.","The list of potential solutions may be stored locally on the mobile device itself and not on the network. Each solution can be a combination of step by step procedures for the subscriber to perform, information and graphics, multiple executables that access and alter data on the phone, multiple executables that access and alter data on the carrier network or on a remote Internet server, or others.","Other interceptions may lead to the system providing assistance to a user. The system may determine an event (such as the phone taking a picture) on the mobile device and provide assistance with respect to the event.","Locally stored software or scripts may also assist in diagnosing problems with other equipment. For example, if customer premises equipment is unable to connect to a network to allow diagnostics to be performed, the mobile device can build the needed connection instead.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","104","102","106","108","112","114","108","110","112","120","112","120","122","112","116","118"]},"Additionally, the subscriber identity module, or SIM card, may contain any or all of the processing components, memory components or storage components described herein.

The network-based services  may include a network or networks , mobile network services , a mobile network operator customer service system , a host information management system , updated scripts , and report data . The components of the mobile device  and the network-based services  will be described below.","The components within the mobile device  allow the device to integrate both handset-based services  and network-based services . The authentication system  can implement SIM (Subscriber Identity Module) card-based or standalone authentication to meet network requirements for desired levels of security. Authenticating a system to meet network requirements may not be required but is often recommended.","The hardware interface  may retrieve hardware interface elements required for interfacing with network or phone-based customer support services. Examples of hardware interface elements include changing volume, changing frequency, retrieving SIM (Subscriber Identity Module) ID, connection status from the SIM or radio hardware, and others. The report system  may collect and forward the data reported by the mobile device to the network . The report system  can also encrypt the handset identification information to provide increased security. The information can be encoded so that only the host information management system  can decipher the handset identification information.","The script interface  serves as a standard application programming interface for customer support services. More specifically, the script interface  provides an interface between scripts  and the various hardware-specific and executable, program-specific functions. The script interface  allows a single customer service script to be deployed across multiple operating systems and hardware configurations. In addition, the script interface  includes a standard API (Application Programming Interface) for both the hardware\/OS side and the script interface.","The script platform  can mix and match calls through the script interface to acquire information, to change or correct settings on the phone, and to perform additional functions as described below. The script platform  authenticates, runs, and updates all scripts , manages reporting updates and changes, communicates with the host information management system , communicates with the GUI (Graphical User Interface), and manages customer surveys and interviews. The host information management system  can push a notification to the script platform  via USSD (Unstructured Supplementary Services Data), SMS (Short Message Service), IP (Internet Protocol), or any other network connectivity that the mobile device supports. The script platform  can run the scripts  after authentication, and the scripts  can be authenticated to the network  or to the phone.","The components within the network-based services  allow the mobile device  to communicate with and to retrieve data from the network . The network-based services  may include wired and wireless systems. The mobile network services  may consist of one or more systems including billing, CRM (Customer Relationship Management), provisioning, and others. Furthermore, mobile network services  are able to return data calls made by mobile devices via standard network protocols (e.g., IP, DTMF (Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency), SMS, USSD, etc.).","The mobile network operator customer service system  may also consist of one or more systems relating to customer service, including billing, CRM, provisioning, and others. The host information management system  controls interactions between the mobile device and the host customer support system. The host information management system  can transmit updates to the mobile device. The mobile device typically employs a unique handset ID or serial number, and a mobile phone number. The report data  provides storage for report information gathered from the mobile device. The updated scripts  consist of scripts that the host customer support system provides to the mobile device. The updated scripts  can be managed and versioned as desired by the host information management system , can be targeted at specific subscribers or groups of subscribers, and can include requests for reports and customer interview surveys.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["204","100","204","304","306","308","310","304","326","306","328","308","330","304","100","304","306","308","100","306","308"]},"The provisioning agent  interacts with the updated scripts  and report data . The provisioning agent collects report data  associated with the device data  and subscriber experience data  from the mobile device . The provisioning agent also corrects subscriber problems in real-time by transmitting appropriate scripts to the mobile device . The transmission of scripts to, and the collection of data from, the mobile device  may be hosted within the network or externally. In addition, the updated scripts  and the report data  may be stored in an SQL (Structured Query Language) database .","The mobile device  may include a rendering platform  (e.g., implemented in C++), an optional UI (User Interface) server , a client , and a script interface . The client  generates reports containing subscriber data and transmits the reports to the network-based services . The client  receives scripts  from the network-based services  that can correct subscriber problems. The script interface  allows a single script to be executed by multiple operating systems and hardware configurations. In addition, the mobile device  may also include an OS (Operating System) , specific OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) , and device hardware . In general, the mobile device scripts or applications may be customized via a European Computer Manufacture's Association (ECMA) compliant scripting language such as JavaScript. Such software can be installed by the manufacturer, or after manufacturing, such as over the air, particularly with open OS-based devices. For proprietary OS-based devices, a small kernel can be installed at the time of manufacturing or flashed onto the device at a later time, and then the full client application can be installed on the mobile device over the air.","As explained herein, the scripts or software applications on the mobile device provide for at least the following processes: providing customer care to a subscriber on the mobile device by intercepting calls; diagnostic tools to allow customer service representatives to remotely execute diagnostics and commands on the mobile device or to facilitate diagnostics with other equipment, with proactive tool to correct problems for subscribers on the mobile device; collecting and summarizing data and other metrics with respect to mobile devices; and, guides to train subscribers when they need it most, such as the first time they attempt to use an application.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["100","312","314","406","400","400","408","410","412","402","214","404","404","414","318","322","320"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["504","100"]},"The screens may be stored as display descriptions, graphical user interfaces, or other methods of depicting information on a computer screen (e.g., commands, links, fonts, colors, layout, sizes and relative positions, and the like), where the layout and information or content to be displayed on the page is stored in a database.

The display  automatically provides the subscriber with a list of top issues or questions , which may answer common customer support questions. Subscribers can scroll down on the display  using a more options button  to view additional issues. Subscribers can select an issue from the list using a select button . Selecting an issue allows the mobile device  to retrieve relevant data from the local, programmable non-volatile memory .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":"FIG. 6A","b":["602","604","608","606"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":"FIG. 6B","b":["600","100","610","100","612","100","614","616","612","618"]},"If the mobile device  determines that the subscriber's call should be intercepted at block , then the call, along with access information required to route a message to the mobile device, is directed to the mobile device application running on the subscriber's mobile device (block ). In one embodiment, the mobile device could play sounds or show a dialog on the display to indicate that a call has been intercepted. The mobile device application routes a signaling message, indicating that the subscriber's call has been intercepted, to the customer support call center via network signaling technologies such as SMS or USSD, and may receive a response message back. In block , the mobile device  receives and processes any signaling message from the mobile device application. The mobile device may also receive certain customer self-support data from the network. In block , a customer support session begins on the subscriber's mobile device using locally stored data received from the mobile device application. The mobile device may use a variety of technologies to display and respond to the customer support issue in question. In block , the mobile device addresses the subscriber's support issue locally, as described below. In an alternative embodiment, the mobile device retrieves data or scripts from the network to address the subscriber's support issue, as noted above (block ).","In an alternative embodiment, the call center determines if the subscriber's call should be intercepted and directs the call accordingly. The call center may utilize an IVRS (Interactive Voice Recognition System) to communicate with the subscriber. If the call center determines that the call should not be intercepted, then the call is allowed to continue through the call center for processing (block ). If the call center determines that the call should be intercepted, then the call is redirected back to the mobile device for local processing (block ). Thus, if the call goes through to the call center\/IVRS, and then is routed back to the mobile device, the call to the call center may includes access information to facilitate routing a message back to the mobile device via SMSUSSD or other network signaling technologies. The call center employs a software application to direct mobile equipment, so that it automatically processes requests it receives from mobile devices.","In some examples, the system may be utilized to handle information or \u201c411\u201d calls. In these examples, the mobile device may intercept a 411 call and provide options to the user, such as a list of previously requested numbers (with or without associated information associated with these numbers), options to access information via commonly or recently accessed web pages, and so forth.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":["FIGS. 7A through 7C","FIG. 7A"],"b":["700","700","702","704","706","708","710"]},"In response to the subscriber's  call, the wireless service provider may provide back information to be displayed on the subscriber's phone, such as that shown in upper portion  in . The wireless service provider may also provide detailed information, such as links to one or more web pages associated with the requested information, or specific information that needs to be displayed on the mobile device based on the options provided, such as providing to the mobile device a map of the requested information. In this example, the subscriber selects to view the map (via option ), and the now locally stored map may be shown on the mobile device, as shown in . The mobile device launches any appropriate device application to display or access data. In the example of , the mobile device launches a web browser to display the map. In some examples, the system may be utilized to handle directory assistance calls. In these examples, the mobile device may intercept a directory assistance call and provide options to the user, such as a list of previously requested contacts (with or without associated information associated with these contacts), options to access information via commonly or recently accessed contacts, and so forth.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"figref":["FIGS. 8A through 8C","FIG. 8A"],"b":["800","800","802","804","806","808"]},"In response to the customer's enquiry, the call center may provide back information to be displayed on the customer's phone, such as that shown in upper portion  in .

When a subscriber launches an application on their mobile device for the first time, the mobile device may be able to detect this first time usage. The mobile device may then locally launch an automated training tutorial that addresses the context of the application or situation. The tutorials serve to guide the subscriber along and include a set, of instructions. In addition, the mobile device may automatically collect configuration or setup data from the subscriber to deliver automated, context-sensitive tutorials and guides at relevant times. Alternatively or additionally, the mobile device may retrieve training tutorials or guides from the network, or the use of automated, context-sensitive training tutorials in one application or service may key automated training in another application or service. Results of the training tutorials may be logged for offline analysis. Further, rather than just providing the tutorial functionality the first time, the mobile device can monitor usage of device functions and initiate the tutorial functionality after a predetermined period of time has elapsed (e.g. three months). After the predetermined time, the mobile device may assume that the subscriber has forgotten how to perform the desired function and therefore again provides the tutorial functionality. Alternatively or additionally, the mobile device may provide a tutorial after a preset number of times. For example, if a subscriber has taken three pictures and has not emailed or otherwise sent any photo messages, then the mobile device launches a tutorial regarding how to send photos via the mobile device (or provides an indication to the subscriber asking whether he or she would like to view the tutorial).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0062"},"figref":["FIGS. 10A through 10D","FIGS. 10A-10D"],"b":["1002","1004","1006"]},"Upon receiving the \u201cyes\u201d selection, the tutorial may present options to begin, such as by asking the user if he\/she would like interactive help  or would like to review \u201cfrequently asked questions\u201d . Additionally, the tutorial may display marketing information , such as information related to the service provider's services or other sponsored services.","In some cases, the tutorial may help the user to configure the device and\/or user's account. For example,  displays an example of a user or device configuration of \u201cpicture messaging.\u201d In some cases, the tutorial provides information, such as step by step instructions, on how to use the capabilities of services provided by the device and\/or service provider. For example,  displays an example of help balloons  that provide instructions to assist a user in sending a picture via the \u201cpicture messaging\u201d service. In this embodiment, locally stored scripts provide contextual training, marketing, or both.","The tutorial software creates a single process flow that can interact with a variety of manufacturer's picture messaging products.  shows an example process flow as a routine  for displaying a tutorial screen over a user selected application based upon a recognized event. In some cases, the application runs in the background on the mobile phone, waiting for specific system events. For example, in step , the system detects a need to provide contextual information for another application via the detection of predetermined system events (such as a photo being taken combined with an image being saved, an initial text message received combined with a reply indication, and so on). In step , the system makes a copy of a screen buffer (the current image on the screen). In step , the system moves the application to the top of an application stack in the phone. In step , the system displays the copied image as the tutorial's main screen. This gives the appearance that the previous application (e.g. the picture messaging application) is still on top of the application stack. The system may also compare portions of the screen to verify that it is in an expected state. An image hashing comparison, discussed in greater detail with respect to , may be used for the comparison. For example, portions of the screen indicating activity of the camera application could be verified to be present. In the comparison, hash values may be stored to facilitate the comparison. These values are small is storage size and therefore the system may perform the comparison without expending a lot of the mobile device's resources.","In step , the system places the information that it wants to display (e.g. text bubble) on top of the copy of the previous application and processes user input and other events (e.g., received input from a user via a manual keypad) as needed. Looping back to step , the system may update the display as needed to maintain the illusion of the previous application still being active and provide the desired information. When finished, the system moves the application off the top of the application stack, effectively handing control back to the previous application. All or part of routine  may be repeated as needed to present step by step instructions or additional tutorial screens.","Although the above example relates to using guide or tutorial applications with \u201cpicture messaging\u201d applications, the system may use the guide or tutorial applications described above with other mobile device applications (or \u201cfunctions\u201d or \u201cservices\u201d).

In some cases, the guide asks users context based questions to facilitate the user of a certain or selection function or service of the mobile device.","The customer self-support and other features described herein are not limited to mobile devices, as noted above. Such features can apply to any remote device, including consumer appliances such as refrigerators, dishwashers, washers\/dryers, ovens, and so forth. With any of such appliances having computing capabilities (and\/or connection to the internet), such devices can locally store information and provide the functionality described above to handle customer inquiries that previously had been handled by a call center or web site accessed by the consumer via another device, such as the consumers computer.","Thus, in an alternate embodiment, a mobile device may use a Bluetooth or other wireless protocol link to communicate with the household appliances. For example, a Bluetooth link between a refrigerator and a mobile device may allow the mobile device to automatically detect a drop in the temperature of the refrigerator. Upon automatic detection, the mobile device may alert the user regarding the drop in temperature. Using the mobile device as an interface, the user may find information to address the drop in temperature on the mobile device itself, may download information from a network, or may call a customer support center for the specific appliance.","As noted above, each remote device may include the customer self-support functionality described herein. Further, since some remote devices may lack a sufficient display screen or other user interface, the remote device may communicate with the mobile device so that the mobile device operates as a more robust user interface for that remote device. Thus, consumers may receive instruction screens or tutorials from an appliance, and provide commands to that appliance, through the mobile device.","Alternatively, or additionally, the mobile device may locally perform diagnostic scripts on the device to gather user, device, and network data. Such scripts may be loaded over the air (OTA), and may be so loaded at any point, or initiated from a call center agent desktop computer. By either agent or mobile device initiation, diagnostic scripts on the phone are automatically initiated proactively to resolve problems encountered by the subscriber. In some embodiments, the mobile device or the call center agent can collect, via scripts, all the required information over the air without asking the subscriber.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0075","num":"0074"},"figref":"FIG. 12"},"For example,  shows a block diagram of components within a mobile phone network to perform connection diagnostics on fixed wireless equipment such as customer owned WIFI access points connected to a IP network. Mobile device , which contains scripted procedures , may access customer premises equipment at a number of points, including connections to a wireless access point , or to some or all of the devices , , and\/or  themselves. Using the mobile network associated with the device , the customer premises equipment can then access service provider equipment  to query the system and continue the diagnosis.","In some cases, diagnostics are remotely initiated by a customer care agent or an automated diagnostic system. In these cases, the diagnostics are initiated when a network management system loses connectivity, when a subscriber contacts a customer service agent and indicates that the system is not working, when the mobile device attempts to make a connection for voice over IP (VOIP) calling and the connection does no work, and so on. Additionally, the system may perform the scripted procedures with or without subscriber interaction.","In some cases, the scripts on the mobile device may be modified and updated based on information acquired post customer premises equipment (CPE) linking. Scripts may be server based or locally cached, or combinations of locally cached and server based. Scripts may be used to configure routers, access points (Bluetooth, WIFI, etc), and so on. Additionally, the chain of equipment may be analyzed and problems may be diagnosed from both ends of the wired (and\/or wireless) network.","In some cases, the system provides scripted procedures to determine the \u201cwireless detection of and \u201cwireless link-activation to\u201d wireless access points for convergent fixed-line and mobile telecommunications handsets. In these cases, the mobile phone recognizes an access point locally by trying to make a connection from the mobile phone back to an ACS or network connection. The mobile phone performs local analysis of access points to determine whether the phone can, for example, connect to the PSTN. The phone sniffs for useable networks and alerts the user when a useable network is identified. The phone can then query the user as to whether to connect to the newly identified network so as to route calls through the PSTN via this new access point. The phone can thus perform a diagnostic on the connection to see if that connection to the network at this newly discovered access point is sufficient to provide the service that the user requests. The phone may include business rules identifying the services that the user wishes from access points.","In some cases, the methods described above enable the mobile device to build LAN connections to customer equipment when a WAN between the equipment and a network is not working. The LAN connections enable diagnostics to be performed by an operator or other entities related to the equipment (suppliers, etc.). The system manages the diagnostic connections via the scripts described above.","In some embodiments, the system provides for an accurate interaction between a user of a mobile device and customer service support.  show a method for efficient digital comparison of visually displayed information. In these examples, the system provides a hash or unique number on a portion of a screen displayed on the user's mobile phone with a similar hash to see if the mobile device is \u201con the same page\u201d as an expected \u201cpage\u201d or on the same page as a customer service person following along with a user of the device in order to provide support to the user.","In some embodiments, the system uses the above comparison to verify that an application running on the mobile device is in an expected state. Hash values for an expected screen state may be precalculated and saved to the device. For example, If a running guide application determines that the state of the device is not as expected (such as the user takes an incoming call while in the middle of the guide application) then the guide application may close (that is, the guide application gets out of the users way.).","In some embodiments, the comparison may be between a guide application running on a customer's mobile device and a similar application running on a customer support agent's machine. Because the hash values are small, the comparison may be determined or verified with a minimum of network traffic. Looking at , the system may select a target pixel region  in a visual display field  of a rasterized image for comparison (such as a display field on a customer's device). The system may then save off the coordinates of the selected area (REGION). The system may then hash the selected raster pixels (such as an RGB (red-blue-green) value per pixel) of the selected area using a one-way hashing function, such as MD5, to determine a first hash value. The system then saves the resulting hash value (Hash1). Only a small hash value needs to be transmitted to or cached on the mobile device for evaluation, and not, for example, the entire display field. The MD5 hash algorithm, for example, gives an output of only 128 bits (16 bytes). Although the MD5 hash algorithm is used in this example, other suitable hash algorithms are possible.","Optionally or additionally, other data storage formats for representing an image region may be used in the comparison described above, although the format compares hash values should be similarly formatted (For example, if a baseline image format being hashed is RGB, band interleaved by pixel (BIP), and 8 bits per sample, then the comparison image should not be in band sequential format (BSQ), or band interleaved by line format (BIL), any non-RGB colorspace, or any bits per sample other than 8 for all bands).","At the customer support side, the system performs similar steps in order to compare the two. The system may select a target pixel region in the visual display field of a rasterized image based on coordinates determined in the \u201cpreparation\u201d step (REGION). The system may then hash the selected raster pixels such as an RGB value per pixel) of the selected area using a one-way hashing function, such as MD5, to determine a second hash value (hash2).","The system may then compare the current hash value (hash2) to a previously saved hash value (hash1) to determine if the visual display is the same as previously determined, such as determining if ([REGION]Hash1=Hash2[REGION]) is true or false. This comparison could also iterate through a list of HashN value to find a match. The system may then use the true\/false result to make decisions.","For example, the system may perform a remote comparison of expected and actual behavior on remote mobile devices, such as sending a hash1 value from a networked computer to a mobile phone. The mobile handset processor evaluates the image in REGION and creates a hash value (hash2) and responds back to the networked computer with the results of the comparison (or derivative of the comparison). Additionally, a list of HashN values could be sent to the device, and the index to the matching value could be returned.","As described above, the system may perform a local comparison of expected and actual behavior on mobile devices using the above detailed comparison. The pre-cached value for REGION and hash1 may be stored locally on the mobile device, and the result may be used locally.","The system may perform such comparisons of hash values to make decisions related to use of the system or effectiveness of the system. In some cases, a customer service agent may want to determine if the mobile device user followed the proper steps in a complex process. The agent may to determine if the user is in the correct state by performing the visual comparison. Also, when a complex series of tests are performed on a mobile device, and the tests involve multiple device applications, the comparison value can be used to determine that the device is in the expected state. The testing may be further enhanced by including unique visual elements in the visual display (such as a unique number) that can be used in the comparison.","Unless the context clearly requires otherwise, throughout the description and the claims, the words \u201ccomprise,\u201d \u201ccomprising,\u201d and the like are to be construed in an inclusive sense, as opposed to an exclusive or exhaustive sense; that is to say, in the sense of \u201cincluding, but not limited to.\u201d As used herein, the terms \u201cconnected,\u201d \u201ccoupled,\u201d or any variant thereof, means any connection or coupling, either direct or indirect, between two or more elements; the coupling of connection between the elements can be physical, logical, or a combination thereof.

While specific embodiments of, and examples for, the invention are described above for illustrative purposes, various equivalent modifications are possible within the scope of the invention, as those skilled in the relevant art will recognize. For example, while processes or blocks are presented in a given order, alternative embodiments may perform routines having steps, or employ systems having blocks, in a different order, and some processes or blocks may be deleted, moved, added, subdivided, combined, and\/or modified. Each of these processes or blocks may be implemented in a variety of different ways. Also, while processes or blocks are at times shown as being performed in series, these processes or blocks may instead be performed in parallel, or may be performed at different times.","Further, the mobile device may employ many other locally stored applications beyond those described above. For example, the mobile device may include its own IVR system, rather than employing an IVR system at the call center. Thus, the subscriber navigates through a series of IVR menus to access desired information, some of which may be stored on the phone. However, one option in the local IVR could be to have the device place a call to the customer support call center.","In another alternative embodiment, the system may provide links to web pages supplied by the wireless service provider, where these links are to specific web pages directly addressing a need or question relevant to a current status of a user's mobile device. Such an alternative is useful when a mobile device has a web browser and sufficient data connection to the service provider's web server. Thus, a call intercept function on the mobile device may provide a link to a relevant web page, or even access that page automatically so that it is displayed to the user (rather than, for example, displaying locally stored content).","While many embodiments described above employ software stored on the mobile device (either before being given to a subscriber, or during a subscriber call), the scripts and other software noted above may be hard coded into the mobile device (e.g. stored in EEPROM, PROM, etc.).
