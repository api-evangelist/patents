title: Sensor interface
abstract: The sensor interface includes a sensor, an optical fiber, a Bragg grating disposed on the optical fiber, and an optoelectronic circuit. The sensor communicates with the Bragg grating such that the sensor imposes a strain on the Bragg grating that is a function of the parameter sensed. The optoelectronic circuit reads the sensor by interrogating the Bragg grating with a light pulse carried by the optical fiber and detecting the timing and/or frequency of the light reflected by the Bragg grating. The timing and/or frequency of the light reflected is a function of the strain imposed on the Bragg grating.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.","The present invention relates to a sensor interface. More specifically, but without limitation, the present invention relates to an open system sensor interface using Bragg gratings and optical fiber.","Existing instrumentation and control systems use electrical interfaces and wiring harnesses to drive and acquire signals from sensors. Each sensor usually has unique electrical interface characteristics that in turn require tailored analog electrical interface circuitry in the associated electronic device (typically a display, recorder or control unit). This increases life cycle cost and impedes initial development and later changes to sensor configurations.","One solution often used to solve this problem is utilizing a standard electronic data bus that is connected to multiple sensors equipped with embedded data bus interfaces. This enables flexible application and connection of sensors to electronic controls with only software changes to accommodate different sensor arrangements. However, the embedded data bus interface electronics add costs and may be impracticable for sensors located in severe environments, particularly for any sensors used in military applications such as, but without limitation, a propulsion system.","Thus, there is a need in the art to provide a sensor interface that incorporates the listed benefits without the limitations inherent in present methods.","The present invention is directed to a sensor interface. The sensor interface includes a sensor, an optical fiber, a Bragg grating disposed on the optical fiber, and an optoelectronic circuit. The sensor communicates with the Bragg grating such that the sensor imposes a strain on the Bragg grating that is a function of the parameter sensed. The optoelectronic circuit reads the sensor by interrogating the Bragg grating with a light pulse carried by the optical fiber and detecting the timing and\/or frequency of the light reflected by the Bragg grating. The timing and\/or frequency of the light reflected is a function of the strain imposed on the Bragg grating.","A feature of the invention is an improved sensor interface that offers improved durability and reliability when exposed to a hot thermal environment, especially a propulsion system.","It is another feature of the invention to provide a sensor interface that has a reduced sensitivity to electromagnetic interference. It is also a feature of the invention to provide a sensor interface that offers lower electronic circuitry complexity and cost.","It is a feature of the invention to provide a sensor interface that simplifies sensor interface of electronic controls and data acquisition systems, while reducing cost, weight, volume, and improving reliability.","The preferred embodiments of the present invention are illustrated by way of example below and in . As seen in , the sensor interface  includes a sensor , an optical fiber , a Bragg grating  disposed on the optical fiber , and an optoelectronic signal acquisition circuit . The sensor  mechanically applies a strain to the Bragg grating . The strain applied is a function of the parameter sensed. The optoelectronic circuit  reads the sensor  by interrogating the Bragg grating  with a light pulse carried by the optical fiber  and detecting the timing and\/or frequency of the light reflected by the Bragg grating . The timing and\/or frequency of the light reflected is a function of the strain imposed on the Bragg grating . The sensor reading is then made available for display, recording and processing for monitoring and control in any suitable analog or digital electronic format.","In the discussion of the present invention, the system will be discussed in a propulsion system environment, specifically a propulsion system in a military aircraft environment; however, the system can also be utilized in any other type of environment that utilizes sensors.","A sensor  may be defined, but without limitation, as a component that converts mechanical energy into an electrical signal or an optical (photonic) signal and\/or as an information pickup device. The sensor  utilized may be, but without limitation, a pressure sensor , a position sensor , a temperature sensor , an acceleration sensor, an electric field sensor, a magnetic field sensor, or any other type of sensor. These sensors , but without limitation, may be utilized individually, in a group or in any possible combination. In the preferred embodiment, the sensor interface  may have one or more sensors . The preferred type of sensor  is a passive type sensor. A passive sensor may be defined, but without limitation, as a sensor not requiring electrical power and a sensor without embedded electronic circuitry.","Propulsion control and monitoring systems typically, but without limitation, incorporate the following types of sensors: position feedback sensors incorporated in an actuator  or other effectors (including fuel metering unit valves ); an on\/off switch indication  (including indications incorporated in solenoid operated devices  and pressure switches ); inlet pressure A; inlet temperature B; gas path pressure A; gas path temperature B; fuel pressure A; fuel temperature B; oil differential pressure A; oil temperature B; engine vibration ; shaft rpm ; and fuel flow .  shows an embodiment of the invention that may be utilized in a propulsion system.","An optical fiber  may be defined, but without limitation, as a transmission medium associated with the transmission of information as light pulses along a glass or plastic wire or fiber, often encoded by frequency of the light transmitted. The glass or plastic fiber is generally made with graduations in its properties, radially and longitudinally, and\/or with a central void or fluid filled core, to limit the attenuation of the signal and allow amplification, modulation and\/or other changes to the character of the optical signals transmitted via the optical fiber . A Bragg grating  may be incorporated in the optical fiber  by appropriate manipulation of the fiber's properties, which can be done by, but without limitation, varying concentration of chemical dopants.","A Bragg grating  may be defined, but without limitation, as an apparatus that can reflect a predetermined narrow or broad range of wavelengths of light incident on the grating, while passing all other wavelengths of light. In general, the wavelength of the reflected light is a function of the strain, the linear extension or contraction, imposed on a Bragg grating  by externally applied forces, such as by a sensor  and the temperature of the material of the Bragg grating . In an embodiment of the invention that includes more than one sensor, as seen in , each sensor  has a corresponding Bragg grating .","The optoelectronic signal acquisition circuit  or optoelectronic circuit may be defined, but without limitation, as an apparatus that illuminates the optical fiber  with light of a frequency that varies to sweep the range of frequencies of all the Bragg gratings  disposed along the fiber and which detects the reflection of the illumination. The preferred type of optoelectronic signal acquisition circuit  is a laser and optoelectronic circuit. The optoelectronic circuit  determines the frequency of the light reflected by each Bragg grating  disposed along the optical fiber , which encodes the corresponding level of strain and thus the reading of the associated sensor.","In operation, a sensor  obtains a reading, which in turn creates a proportional strain in the corresponding Bragg grating . The optoelectronic signal acquisition circuit  reads the applied strain by illuminating the Bragg grating  via the optical fiber  with a pulse of laser light of an appropriate range of wavelengths. The Bragg grating  reflects a portion of the laser pulse back to the source. The wavelength of the reflected light is determined by the level of strain applied to the Bragg grating . This information is sent back along the optical fiber  to a remote electronic unit , which can incorporate the optoelectronic circuit . The remote electronic unit  may be a control unit or a data bus node that allows communication with the relevant aircraft system. The wavelength and timing of the reflected light is detected by the optoelectronic circuit  and converted to an analog or digital electronic output (or any other convenient format) that shows usable information such as temperature, position, or pressure, etc. Responses from different Bragg gratings  are differentiated by the variation in the time delay between the laser pulse and reflections from Bragg gratings  at different distances along the optical fiber , and\/or by assigning different ranges of wavelength of the reflected light from the Bragg gratings  applied to different sensors . The remote electronic unit  then converts the wavelengths of the reflected light into usable information such as temperature, position, or pressure, etc. This information is then passed on to the user or pilot.","The sensor interface  allows for the standardization of the frequencies of the Bragg gratings , and their range of variation, and the gratings' disposition on the optical fiber  such that a common optoelectronic circuit can interrogate any assemblage of optical fiber  and sensors  with standardized Bragg gratings . The identity of any sensor  corresponds to a standard range of frequency bands assigned to the associated or corresponding Bragg grating  and\/or its location along the optical fiber . Each sensor  is designed to impose a strain and\/or temperature to the corresponding Bragg grating  in a predetermined relationship to the sensed parameter, resulting in a calibrated relationship between the frequency of light reflected, within the band assigned to the Bragg grating  and the sensed parameter or sensor reading. Thus, any type of sensor  can be assigned to a specific frequency and\/or position on the optical fiber  with no other physical modification to the sensor system.","The encoded sensor identification and sensor reading is reconstituted in the processing of the output of the optoelectronic signal acquisition circuit . Typically, but without limitation, this reconstitution may normally be performed as a software operation. The result is that standardized sensor\/optical fiber assemblies and individual standardized sensors can be replaced with others and only data tables and\/or software changes are required to accommodate the change.","When introducing elements of the present invention or the preferred embodiment(s) thereof, the articles \u201ca,\u201d \u201can,\u201d \u201cthe,\u201d and \u201csaid\u201d are intended to mean there are one or more of the elements.
