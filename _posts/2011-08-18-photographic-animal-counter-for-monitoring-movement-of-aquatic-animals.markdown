{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION(S)","STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS","EXAMPLE"],"p":["This application is related to and claims the benefit of priority to Provisional Application U.S. Ser. No. 61\/376,012, entitled \u201cPhotographic Animal Counter for Monitoring Movement of Aquatic Animals,\u201d by Stuart A. Welsh, filed Aug. 23, 2010 in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.","The invention described herein may be manufactured, used, and licensed by or for the U.S. Government for governmental purposes without payment of any royalties thereon.","The present invention relates in general to fish counters.","Scientists monitor the movement of aquatic animals for various reasons, including the determination of environmental influences on upstream migration. Fish counters are often used to monitor animal movement and may be positioned at fishways on dams to count the number of fish passing through the fishways. Additional data often needed to manage populations of certain types of fish, such as the American eel, include the date and time of passage of each individual through an area, identification of the species of animal passing through an area, and estimates of body length\/size of all individuals passing through an area.","However, periods of turbid (i.e., muddy) water conditions can interfere with the collection of data. Water turbidity limits the ability to observe fish underwater in their natural environment. Trapping fish is labor-intensive and may interfere with the behavior of the fish. Remotely-operated electronic monitoring devices, while overcoming the limitations of manual trapping, are still adversely affected by water turbidity. For example, the beams emitted from optical scanners that use infrared light may attenuate and not be detected, impairing the functioning of the scanner and interfering with achieving an accurate count of the number of fish passing through an area. Also, photographs taken in turbid water may not be clear, which interferes with identification of the animals and estimates of body size.","Thus, a need exists for an improved fish monitoring device that monitors aquatic animals such as the American eel without being limited by water turbidity.","The photographic counter, also referred to as a \u201cmovement monitoring device,\u201d described herein ameliorates many of the shortcomings of current fish counters. The photographic counter is used to photograph, count, and record the date\/time of passage of aquatic animals using fishways on dams in either clear or turbid water. The invention is not restricted to fishes or dams, and could be used to photograph, count, and record the date\/time of passage through an aquatic environment of any small aquatic animal, including invertebrates, amphibians, reptiles, and small mammals. Also, the invention allows for the recovery of tag data for marked animals (i.e., animals with external tags used in mark-recapture studies).","In accordance with an embodiment of the invention, there is provided a movement monitoring device to monitor movement of animals through an aquatic animal passage system, such as a fishway. The movement monitoring device includes a housing connected to the aquatic animal passage system. The housing has an entrance for an animal passing through the aquatic animal passage system to enter the housing, and an exit for the animal to leave the housing. A ramp within the housing has a lower end and an upper end, the lower end is positioned at the entrance. A platform within the housing has one end connected to the upper end of the ramp and the other end positioned at the exit. The platform is elevated so that water from the aquatic animal passage system flows underneath the platform. The animal climbs up the ramp, out of the water, and onto the platform. A photographic system focused on the platform records an image of the animal on the platform above the water.","The present disclosure describes a photographic animal counter, also referred to as a \u201cmovement monitoring device,\u201d for monitoring movement of aquatic animals through an existing aquatic animal passage system and taking clear photographs in either clear or turbid water conditions.","The embodiment shown in  illustrates a movement monitoring device  having a rectangular-shaped, transparent housing , a platform  with a ramp , and end connectors  and . The housing  has a removable lid , front and back sides  and , and a floor or base . The connectors ,  attach to the left and right sides of the housing  and are used to splice the housing  into a pipe or other conduit that passes water and aquatic animals, often referred to as a \u201cfish ladder\u201d or \u201cfishway\u201d (hereinafter referred to as a \u201cfishway\u201d).","The platform  is fitted inside the housing  and is connected to the ramp  at one end of the platform . Generally, the widths of the ramp  and the platform  are similar to the inside dimensions of the housing  to conveniently fit securely within the housing . The platform  is elevated using legs , which allows passing animals to move through the housing  at an elevation higher than that of the level of water flowing through the fishway pipe.","Using one ramp  at one end of the platform  restricts movement of animals to a single direction. Alternatively, a second ramp  can be located at the other end of the platform  for bi-directional passage of animals, or it can have a shorter length and a steeper slope than the length and slope of ramp  for uni-directional movement. The lengths and slopes of the ramp  and the second ramp  may be varied depending on the animal of interest.","The lid , the front side , the back side , and the floor  are made of a transparent material, preferably a transparent thermoplastic such as Plexiglas\u00ae acrylic sheets. Representative compositions of other parts of the housing , the platform , the ramp , and the connectors  and  include metals such as steel, copper, and the like; concrete; plastics such as thermoplastic and other polymeric compositions including polyvinylchloride, polyethylene, and polypropylene; and combinations and composites of these and other materials.","Referring to , the platform  and the ramp  are constructed using a frame  (also see ), and are covered with a mesh . The lower ends of the ramp  meet the floor  of the housing , but the platform  is elevated allowing water to pass through the mesh of the ramp  and underneath the platform . The water passing through the fishway and the movement monitoring device  is either pumped or gravity fed.","As shown in , the front and back sides ,  of the housing  are transparent to allow for a motion-activated sensor  having a transmitter and a receiver , located on the floor  outside of the housing , to detect an animal moving through the inside of the housing . Referring to , the lid  is transparent to allow for a digital motion sensor-activated camera or video recorder , located on the outside of the movement monitoring device , to record an image of an animal passing through the housing . The camera or video recorder  (hereinafter referred to as \u201ccamera\u201d) is connected to the motion-activated sensor  and records the images when the motion-activated sensor  is triggered. The camera  can be positioned above the lid  of the movement monitoring device  and point downwards toward the platform . For example, as shown in , the movement monitoring device  can be placed inside a container , which has been spliced into a fishway pipe , with the camera  mounted to the ceiling of the container . Alternatively, as shown in , the camera  can be positioned alongside the movement monitoring device  and point upwards toward a mirror  mounted to the ceiling of the container . The use of the mirror  allows for an extended focal length when space is limited.","The lid , the platform , and the ramp  of the movement monitoring device  are removable. The lid  is fastened to the top of the housing  using a latching or fastening mechanism, such as elasticized cord (not shown), for example. The fastening mechanism is placed near the borders of the lid  so that the view of the lid  by the camera  is not obstructed. Removability of the lid , the ramp , and the platform  allows for periodic cleaning and removal of algal growth, as algal growth on the inside of the housing  inhibits transparency. Further, algal growth on the ramp  and the platform  reduces the size of the openings of the mesh  and, thus, reduces the passage of water.","The dimensions of the movement monitoring device  are selected based upon the size of the aquatic animals of interest. The size of the mesh  must be small enough to prevent the animals of interest from passing through the mesh  because they must move across the top of the platform  to trigger the motion-activated sensor  of the camera . Also, the mesh size must be large enough to allow water to pass through the mesh  of the ramp  while remaining under the platform .","Animals of interest passing through the movement monitoring device  in an upstream or downstream direction move up the meshed ramp  and across the meshed platform . An animal passing through the movement monitoring device  is above the water flow when on the platform , which allows for the motion-activated sensor  to work even when the water passing through is turbid. Turbid water, which reduces visibility, is common in many aquatic systems, especially during periods of elevated water levels or discharge. The motion-activated sensor  is positioned along the side of the housing  and directed across and just above the meshed platform  so that it is triggered when an animal moves across the platform . While the distance of the motion-activated sensor  above the platform  is dependent upon the size of the animals of interest, the preferred position is approximately 0.25 to 0.50 inches above the platform , which allows for monitoring of a wide range of sizes of animals.","The camera  has a remote trigger connection and is connected to the motion sensor  to control the camera shutter. The camera  must be able to focus on the platform  and record the date and time of the picture or video recording. The camera  is positioned above the housing  and points downward, or it can be positioned next to the housing  and point upwards toward the mirror . The beam from the infrared or laser trigger of the motion sensor  is positioned to cross slightly above the meshed platform  so that an animal moving across the top surface of the platform  will interrupt the beam and trigger the camera shutter. The photograph of each animal that passes through the housing  is saved, for example, on the camera's flash card.","The movement monitoring device  resolves the problem of water turbidity (i.e., the clarity of the water due to suspended solids). Specifically, the meshed platform  positioned above the water level enables fish such as eels, which have serpentine motion, to move up the ramp  and across the platform  and be photographed out of the water. Eels generally are cued to upstream migration by increases in river flows, and increases in river flow are generally linked to increases in water turbidity. Thus, most eels move upstream in turbid water conditions. The infrared beam from a scanner or motion sensor may not be able to penetrate through water having high turbidity. The movement monitoring device  resolves this problem by directing the eel out of the turbid water and onto the ramp . The infrared beam of the motion sensor  is positioned out of the water and just above the platform  so that the infrared beam passes through air rather than through the water. The eel passing across the platform  \u201cbreaks\u201d the beam and triggers the camera shutter (see ). The movement monitoring device  can be used to monitor movements of other aquatic animals such as water snakes and crayfish (see ).","The data collected on animals passing through the movement monitoring device  by the camera  include the time and date that the animal passed through. Determination of the size of the animal, the species of animal, and the number of animals that passed through are possible through manual observation of the recorded images. Also, in studies where animals are marked dorsally with external tags, the picture or video recorded image will provide the recovery of tagging data. Alternatively, a passive integrated transponder (PIT) tag reader (not shown) can be used with the movement monitoring device  to read internal animal tags.","The size of the animal passing through is estimated from the image of the picture or video recording. Using a known distance for a reference, such as mesh width of the platform , the length, width, or other measurements of anatomical parts of the animal of interest can be estimated. Estimation of length, width, or other measurements of anatomical parts can be accomplished by manual measurements of printed images, or can be done electronically on a computer with various known software packages. The species identification is determined from the picture or video recorded image of the animal using anatomical features and readily available species identification manuals.","In some studies, it is important to count the number of individual animals passing through within a period of time, such as daily, monthly, or yearly counts. Each picture or video recorded image will generally represent an individual animal, so the number of animals passing through can be counted, and the recorded date\/time information is then used to determine the number of individuals within a selected time period. In some cases, more than one individual may pass through at the same time, and in those cases, the recorded image can be used to determine the total count of individuals.","The movement monitoring device provides several advantages, including the following:","(1) photographing each individual passing through an area, allowing remote data collection;","(2) recording the date and time of each individual passing through an area;","(3) identification of the species of animal passing through an area, providing species verification via the photographs;","(4) determining a total count of all individuals passing through an area, and a total count of the number of individuals of each species passing through the area;","(5) detection of animals having a small body depth, for example, migrant eels having a body depth of less than 20 mm;","(6) estimation of sizes of all individuals passing through an area; and","(7) recovery of tag data in the case of marked animals.","In addition, the movement monitoring device does not require the animal to be submerged in water when photographs are taken and, thus, facilitates clear photographic documentation of each animal during either clear water conditions or during periods of turbid water conditions.","The present invention will be understood more readily by reference to the following example, which is provided by way of illustration and is not intended to be limiting of the invention. Those skilled in the art will recognize, or be able to ascertain, using no more than routine experimentation, numerous equivalents to the specific substances and procedures described herein.","Referring to , a movement monitoring device  for monitoring movement of aquatic animals was constructed having a rectangular housing  with front and back sides  and , a floor , and a lid  made from 0.22-inch sheets of transparent thermoplastic. Connectors ,  attached to the ends of the housing  were schedule 40 PVC 3\u00d74\u00d74-inch downspout adapters. Each downspout adapter ,  had one rectangular end ,  of 3.5\u00d74.5 inches and a 4.5-inch outside diameter circular end which was coupled to 4-inch diameter PVC pipe in a fishway using a flexible pipe coupling.","The front and back sides ,  were cut to 18-inch length and 3.5-inch width, the lid  was 18-inch length and 6.5-inch width, and the floor  was 18-inch length and 10-inch width. The lid  and the floor  were cut to extend beyond the distance between the two sides ,  so that elastic fasteners (not shown) could be installed by connection through holes  from the floor  to the lid . Also, motion sensor devices , were connected to the floor  on the outside of the housing .","A waterproof glue appropriate for use with thermoplastic and PVC material was used for construction. The front and back sides ,  were glued at each end to the 3.5-inch sides of the downspout adapters , . The floor  was glued at each end to the bottom of the 4.5-inch side of the rectangular ends ,  of the downspout adapters  and , and to the bottom of each of the front and back sides  and . Lengths of 1-inch wide\u00d70.25-inch thick rubberized weather stripping (not shown) cut at the same length as the length and width of the lid  were adhered to the underside of the lid  centered along the contact point of the lid  and the top of the front and back sides  and , as well as across the ends of the lid , which provided a water tight gasket seal when the lid  was fastened to the top of the housing .","The total length of the movement monitoring device  was 21.75 inches measured from the circular ends of the downspout adapters  and , and the inside measurements of the housing  were 4.5 inches wide by 3.5 inches in height. A 4.375-inch wide ramp  and platform  were constructed with a frame  of 0.5-inch wide\u00d70.0625-inch depth aluminum (using aluminum rivets). The platform  was elevated with aluminum legs  of the same dimensions so that the platform  was 2.25 inches above the floor . A plastic mesh  of 0.33-inch mesh width was attached to the frame  using zip ties , and covered the entire surface of the ramp  and the platform .","The movement monitoring device  was spliced into a section of 4-inch schedule 40 PVC pipe located at the top of a fishway, which was installed on the downstream side of a dam. The pipe and attached movement monitoring device  were sloped at 10 degrees. River water was pumped into the top of the fishway, which was connected to the pipe, and gravity flow owing to the 10 degree slope allowed the water to run through the pipe and the attached movement monitoring device . To prevent theft or vandalism, the section of pipe containing the movement monitoring device  was housed inside a stainless steel box (not shown in ) with a lockable front door, where 4-inch diameter holes in the sides of the stainless steel box allow entry and exit of the 4-inch pipe.","The camera system was an Olympus\u00ae E-300 Evolt single lens reflex (SLR) camera (not shown in ), manufactured by Olympus America, Inc. of Center Valley, Pa., with built-in flash and a 50 mm 1:2 macro lens connected to a Phototrapper motion sensor system using infrared motion sensors manufactured by Phototrap of Amado, Ariz. Two infrared motion sensors , were mounted centrally (one on each side) on the extended floor  outside of the housing , and directed across the mesh platform  at an elevation of 0.25 inches above the mesh platform . The camera was positioned next to the housing , and angled upward toward a mirror (not shown in ) mounted on the ceiling of the stainless steel box. The flash on the camera was turned on to illuminate darkness inside the stainless steel box. An electrical power outlet was mounted inside the stainless steel box, and both the camera and the motion sensor system were powered using the electrical outlet.","In this example, the system was designed to obtain data on American eels, although when the movement monitoring device  was deployed, images were also recorded of crayfish and water snakes. The digital images were recorded on a 2 GB compact flash card, which allowed for 9,999 images to be recorded at a resolution size of 640\u00d7480 pixels. In this example, the movement monitoring device  recorded data on the time and date that American eels passed through. Also, through manual data collection from the recorded images, data were obtained on the size of each eel, and the number of eels that passed daily.","Thus, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that modifications and variations of the present invention are possible without departing from the principles and spirit of the invention, the scope of which is defined in the appended claims and their equivalents."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["Various aspects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent and more readily appreciated from the following description, appended claims, and accompanying drawings, of which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":["FIG. 5A","FIG. 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":["FIG. 5B","FIG. 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 3"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
