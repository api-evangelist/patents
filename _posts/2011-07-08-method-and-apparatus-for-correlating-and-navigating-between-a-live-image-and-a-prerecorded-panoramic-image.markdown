title: Method and apparatus for correlating and navigating between a live image and a prerecorded panoramic image
abstract: An approach is provided for correlating and navigating between a live camera image and a prerecorded panoramic image. A mapping and augmented reality application correlates at least one live image with a prerecorded panoramic image, when a first location of a device used to capture the at least one live image substantially matches or falls within a predetermined proximity of a second location of a device used to capture the panoramic prerecorded image. The mapping and augmented reality application causes, at least in part, alternating of the at least one live image and the prerecorded panoramic image in a presentation on a screen of the device capturing the at least one live image.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND","SOME EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS","DESCRIPTION OF SOME EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This application is a Continuation in Part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/637,057 filed Dec. 14, 2009, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","Service providers (e.g., wireless, cellular, Internet, content, social network, etc.) and device manufacturers are continually challenged to deliver value and convenience to consumers by, for example, providing compelling network services. One area of interest has been the development of mapping and navigating graphics (e.g., digital maps) and\/or images (e.g., 360\u00b0 panoramic street-level views of various locations and points of interest) augmented with, for instance, navigation tags and location relevant content. Typically, navigation, mapping, and other similar services can display prerecorded panoramic views in addition to two-dimensional and\/or three-dimensional rendered maps, while augmented reality applications display live camera views of surrounding points of interest. Each type of view (i.e., panoramic view and live view) has respective advantages and disadvantages. However, a user generally has to switch applications and\/or click through many layers of Internet browsing to switch between the two views manually. For example, prerecorded panoramic image data are well organized and geo-tagged with rich content. However, they may be out-dated (e.g., sometimes months or years old), such that they are significantly different from current views of the same locations. On the other hand, the live image views best represent the current locations, but the availability of live imagery is normally limited to what is currently visible to one or more cameras accessible to the user. Accordingly, to exploit the advantages of each type of view, service providers and device manufacturers face significant technical challenges to enabling users to efficiently navigate between the a live and a prerecorded view of points of interests.","Therefore, there is a need for an approach for correlating and navigating between a live camera image and a prerecorded panoramic image.","According to one embodiment, a method comprises correlating at least one live image with a prerecorded panoramic image, when a first location of a device used to capture the at least one live image substantially matches or falls within a predetermined proximity of a second location of a device used to capture the panoramic prerecorded image. The method also comprises causing, at least in part, alternating of the at least one live image and the prerecorded panoramic image in a presentation on a screen of the device capturing the at least one live image.","According to another embodiment, an apparatus comprising at least one processor, and at least one memory including computer program code, the at least one memory and the computer program code configured to, with the at least one processor, cause, at least in part, the apparatus to correlate at least one live image with a prerecorded panoramic image, when a first location of a device used to capture the at least one live image substantially matches or falls within a predetermined proximity of a second location of a device used to capture the panoramic prerecorded image. The apparatus is also caused to cause, at least in part, alternating of the at least one live image and the prerecorded panoramic image in a presentation on a screen of the device capturing the at least one live image.","According to another embodiment, a computer-readable storage medium carrying one or more sequences of one or more instructions which, when executed by one or more processors, cause, at least in part, an apparatus to correlate at least one live image with a prerecorded panoramic image, when a first location of a device used to capture the at least one live image substantially matches or falls within a predetermined proximity of a second location of a device used to capture the panoramic prerecorded image. The apparatus is also caused to cause, at least in part, alternating of the at least one live image and the prerecorded panoramic image in a presentation on a screen of the device capturing the at least one live image.","According to another embodiment, an apparatus comprises means for correlating at least one live image with a prerecorded panoramic image, when a first location of a device used to capture the at least one live image substantially matches or falls within a predetermined proximity of a second location of a device used to capture the panoramic prerecorded image. The apparatus also comprises means for causing, at least in part, alternating of the at least one live image and the prerecorded panoramic image in a presentation on a screen of the device capturing the at least one live image.","In addition, for various example embodiments of the invention, the following is applicable: a method comprising facilitating a processing of and\/or processing (1) data and\/or (2) information and\/or (3) at least one signal, the (1) data and\/or (2) information and\/or (3) at least one signal based, at least in part, on (including derived at least in part from) any one or any combination of methods (or processes) disclosed in this application as relevant to any embodiment of the invention.","For various example embodiments of the invention, the following is also applicable: a method comprising facilitating access to at least one interface configured to allow access to at least one service, the at least one service configured to perform any one or any combination of network or service provider methods (or processes) disclosed in this application.","For various example embodiments of the invention, the following is also applicable: a method comprising facilitating creating and\/or facilitating modifying (1) at least one device user interface element and\/or (2) at least one device user interface functionality, the (1) at least one device user interface element and\/or (2) at least one device user interface functionality based, at least in part, on data and\/or information resulting from one or any combination of methods or processes disclosed in this application as relevant to any embodiment of the invention, and\/or at least one signal resulting from one or any combination of methods (or processes) disclosed in this application as relevant to any embodiment of the invention.","For various example embodiments of the invention, the following is also applicable: a method comprising creating and\/or modifying (1) at least one device user interface element and\/or (2) at least one device user interface functionality, the (1) at least one device user interface element and\/or (2) at least one device user interface functionality based at least in part on data and\/or information resulting from one or any combination of methods (or processes) disclosed in this application as relevant to any embodiment of the invention, and\/or at least one signal resulting from one or any combination of methods (or processes) disclosed in this application as relevant to any embodiment of the invention.","In various example embodiments, the methods (or processes) can be accomplished on the service provider side or on the mobile device side or in any shared way between service provider and mobile device with actions being performed on both sides.","For various example embodiments, the following is applicable: An apparatus comprising means for performing the method of any of originally filed claims -, -, and -.","Still other aspects, features, and advantages of the invention are readily apparent from the following detailed description, simply by illustrating a number of particular embodiments and implementations, including the best mode contemplated for carrying out the invention. The invention is also capable of other and different embodiments, and its several details can be modified in various obvious respects, all without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly, the drawings and description are to be regarded as illustrative in nature, and not as restrictive.","Examples of a method, apparatus, and computer program for correlating and navigating between a live camera image and a prerecorded panoramic image are disclosed. In the following description, for the purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the embodiments of the invention. It is apparent, however, to one skilled in the art that the embodiments of the invention may be practiced without these specific details or with an equivalent arrangement. In other instances, well-known hardware components and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the embodiments of the invention.","As used herein, the term \u201cimage\u201d refers to one or a series of images taken by a camera (e.g., a still camera, digital camera, video camera, camera phone, etc.) or any other imaging equipment. Although various embodiments are described with respect to a live camera view, it is contemplated that the approach described herein may be used with other live images (e.g., a still image, a live view, a live webcam view, etc.) as long as the image is associated with a location, a tilt angle, and heading of the imaging device (e.g., camera) at the time of image capture.","As used herein, the term \u201cpoint of interest\u201d (POI) refers to any point specified by a user. By way of example, the point of interest can be a landmark, restaurant, museum, building, bridge, tower, dam, factory, manufacturing plant, space shuttle, etc.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"By way of example, when a user is standing at a particular location (e.g., near the Treasure Island on the Las Vegas Strip) and wants to view augmented content data (e.g., hours, prices, etc.) of one or more points of interest (e.g., casinos, restaurants, etc.) within the field of view of the current location (i.e. the Treasure Island), the user can activate either an existing prerecorded panoramic viewing system or an existing live image view system. If the user wants to switch between the two systems, the user needs to switch between the respective applications supporting the systems. The existing prerecorded panoramic viewing system can be accessed locally, but is usually accessed via the Internet if it is a completed system loaded with significant amount of information.","If the user wants to see the image of an Eiffel Tower look-alike that is outside of the user's field of view. The user needs to do a general search online to find out the address and\/or map of the Eiffel Tower look-alike, and then retrieves a prerecorded street view (e.g., a prerecorded panoramic view) of the point of interest. If a user wants to find out how to walk from the Treasure Island to an Eiffel Tower look-alike, the user needs to retrieve walking directions as well. During the walk, the user may want to switch between the prerecorded view of the Eiffel Tower look-alike and the live camera view of the Las Vegas Strip, to, for example, take photos or video clips in the live image view while exploring the content tagged in the prerecorded views of the Eiffel Tower look-alike and other points of interest on the route (such as the Venetian). However, the user has to maneuver via different applications and layers of screens and internet browsing to switch back and forth the two views according to the existing systems. As a result, the user may be discouraged from switching between the two views.","To address the problems described above, a system  of  introduces the capability of presenting a simple and intuitive interface which enables the user to correlate and navigate between a live camera image and a prerecorded panoramic image.","As another example, when the user stands at a current location (e.g., the Farragut West METRO Station), the user can operate in a panorama mode which displays the live image view and a prerecorded panoramic view seamlessly, without rotating or even moving a user device, e.g., the UE . The panoramic mode starts with a live camera view. The user can navigate \u201cout\u201d of the live image view by indicating a point of interest outside of the live image view and ordering the switch. Conversely, the user can navigate back to the live image view from the prerecorded panoramic view by ordering another switch, without going via two applications and layers of screens as in the conventions systems.","To indicate a point of interest, the user can enter the text describing the POI, touch the corresponding point on a 2D or 3D map on the screen, use a navigational arrow superimposed on the live image view, or any other ways conceivable by one skilled in the art. The POI can be at the same location as the current location or at a different location. In either situation, the system  enables the switch between the two views within the same software application.","The system  allows switching from a live image to a prerecorded panoramic image of the same background of a different time (e.g., a panoramic view taken at a different time of the day, a different day, a different season, a different year, etc.). For example, the user wants to see during the day time in the winter of 2009 the panorama view of the METRO station at a night time, in the spring, or in 1995, etc. The system also allows switching from a live image of a current scene (e.g., at or near the METRO Station) to a prerecorded panoramic image of a different background (e.g., at or near the IMF).","By way of example, the surrounding of the Station may contain one or more points of interest (e.g., restaurants) tagged with augmented content (e.g., cuisines, ratings, prices, hours, etc.), and the user can see the augmented content in a live image view. The system  allows the user to switch or enter from the live image view to a prerecorded panoramic view of one of the point of interest (e.g., one of the restaurants). The system  can show a prerecorded panoramic view taken at the current location or a nearby location associated with the selected restaurant. The near-by location may be fifteen feet away from the currently location (e.g., the White House Conference Center), and the prerecorded panoramic view taken from the near-by location shows the selected restaurant. As another example, the user can order a prerecorded panoramic view of a POI outside of the live image view, such the restaurant lounge, or the International Monetary Fund (IMF) headquarters in Washington, D.C.","Whenever the user wants to enter into a prerecorded view, the user can touch a Switch icon or press a Switch button to order the switch. In another embodiment, the user can navigate out\/in of the live image view by moving\/dragging an augmented navigational arrow out\/in of the live image view. Once the navigational arrow reaches the edge of the screen, the system  enters\/exits the above-described prerecorded panoramic images as selected by the user.","In another embodiment, rather than displaying a prerecorded panoramic view, the system  retrieves and stitches a prerecorded still image right next to the live image side by side then displays the seamlessly stitched images to the user.","To make the switch seamlessly, the system  correlates a prerecorded panoramic image that has the same tilt angle and has directional heading right next to the live image, and displays the correlated prerecorded panoramic image on the screen. Even if two images were taken by the same device at the same location with the same tilt angle and the same directional heading, the coverage of the images can be different due to a height of the user or the settings (e.g., digital zooming, contrast, resolution, edited, clipped, etc.). If two images were taken by two devices at the same location with the same tilt angle and the same directional heading, the coverage of the images can still be different due to different specifications of the two devices. The devices can have different imaging specifications, such as LCD size, optical zoom, digital zoom, zoom wide, zoom telephoto, effective pixels, pixel density, image stabilization, aperture range, etc. which affect the quality and depth of images taken by two devices.","However, the existing photo matching technology allows near 100% matching between the live image and the prerecorded panoramic images. There are photo matching applications (e.g., photo-match online search engines which compare images pixel by pixel) for choosing the best matched panoramic still image for the live image. There are also photo stitching applications which make the boundary between the live image and a prerecorded panoramic still image seamlessly. As the user continues touching the navigational arrow touching the edge of the screen, more prerecorded panoramic still images are matched and stitched to roll out to the screen as a panoramic view on the fly.","Conversely, the user can navigate back into the live image view from the prerecord image. The system  can switch back right away, since the live image view does not require selecting any POI, correlating the POI with the currently location, or any photo matching\/stitching. The user can touch a Switch icon or press a Switch button to switch right back to the live image view. In another embodiment, the user can navigate back to the live image view by moving\/dragging the augmented navigational arrow back to the live image view.","To navigate from the current location to a POI, the user indicates to the system  the POI as the destination. By way of example, when the system  receives a target location such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Building as the intended POI (e.g., received as text, or on a digital map on the screen of the UE , etc.), the system  retrieves location data (e.g., an address, GPS coordinates, etc.) of the IMF, or the location data of the device used to capture a prerecorded panoramic image of the IMF (e.g., if the POI is not as well-known as the IMF, such as a carousel in a park). The system  then maps a route from the current location (e.g., the METRO Station) to the designated POI, and presents the route on a digital map to the user. While the user is walking along the route, the system  presents a live image view of the surrounding location on the screen. Whenever the user wants to switch among a live image view, a prerecorded panoramic view of the destination, and a prerecorded panoramic view of other points of interests, the user can freely do so according to the above-described embodiments, without going through different applications and\/or layers of Internet browsing. The other points of interest may be located on the route, such as the World Bank Building located next to IMF, or not located on the route, such as the White House.","The system  correlates at least one of the live images with a prerecorded panoramic image on demand by a user or automatically based a condition. The condition may be a location condition (e.g., the UE  arrives at the destination POI). The condition may be a distance condition (e.g., the UE  is within 100 feet from the destination POI, or from another POI such as a restaurant), etc. As previously mentioned, the user may use a Switch icon, a Switch button, a navigational arrow, or other similar user interface element to switch between a live image and a prerecorded panoramic image.","In another embodiment, if the user continues touching the \u201cSwitch\u201d icon long enough (e.g., a few seconds), the system  will display a Switching Options dropdown next to the \u201cSwitch\u201d icon. By way of example, the switching options include a panorama mode, a \u201cgo to\u201d mode, a pre-set specific application, a pre-set webpage, etc. By selecting the panorama mode, the user sets the \u201cSwitch\u201d icon to switch between the live image view and the prerecorded panoramic view as default, such that the system  reacts to touching the \u201cSwitch\u201d icon each time by automatically switching between the two views. By selecting the \u201cgo to\u201d mode, the user sets the \u201cSwitch\u201d icon to switch between the live image view and the \u201cgo to\u201d website browsing screen as default, such that the system  reacts to touching the \u201cSwitch\u201d icon each time by automatically switching between the live image view and the \u201cgo to\u201d website browsing screen. The \u201cgo to\u201d website browsing screen contains websites previously entered\/browsed by the user and\/or favorite websites set by the user. By selecting the pre-set specific application (e.g., an augmented reality travel guide or planner), the user sets the \u201cSwitch\u201d icon to switch between the live image view and the pre-set specific application as default, such that the system  reacts to touching the \u201cSwitch\u201d icon each time by automatically switching between the live image view and the pre-set specific application. By selecting the pre-set webpage, the user sets the \u201cSwitch\u201d icon to switch between the live image view and the pre-set webpage as default, such that the system  reacts to touching the \u201cSwitch\u201d icon each time by automatically switching between the live image view and the pre-set webpage.","In one embodiment, the system  displays on the screen of the UE  different portions of the prerecorded panoramic view depending upon the tilt angle and directional heading of the UE  as tilted and\/or rotated by the user. In this embodiment, the user can change the prerecorded panoramic image in the prerecorded panoramic view, without moving\/dragging a viewing tag on the screen of the UE .","In another embodiment, when the UE  is displaying a live image, the user can switch to a prerecorded panoramic image of a portion or section of the live view that may be hidden or otherwise obscured with respect to the current view point. For example, the user has the Treasure Island Hotel displayed in the live image view that also depicts a view of turn on Las Vegas Boulevard. To see what is behind the turn, the user can tap at the turn of the Boulevard on the screen in the live view to switch to a prerecorded panoramic view taken from that turn. In one embodiment, the user can move the Switch icon to the turn of the Boulevard on the screen, and then tap the Switch icon to switch to the prerecorded panoramic view taken from the turn. In this prerecorded panoramic view, the user can rotate and tilt the UE  to preview what is behind the turn of the Boulevard, before the user actually walks to the turn. When the user rotates the UE  to point to the direction the user is in the real world, the prerecorded panoramic view is, for instance, augmented with an indicator (e.g., a human character or avatar) to show the user's current location in the prerecorded panorama view.","In another embodiment, the system  further utilizes the augmented reality or augmented virtuality (e.g., using 3D models and 3D mapping information) to insert rich content information relevant to the POI (e.g., drawn from the Internet) in the live image view in a real time manner. The content relevant to the POI can also be seen in the prerecorded panoramic view, and the contact may be already embedded\/tagged in the in the prerecorded panoramic view, or inserted in a real time manner. When the user rotates\/tilts the UE , the content relevant to any pre-set POIs in the live image view or the prerecorded panoramic view automatically pops out. The POIs can be pre-set by users, service providers (e.g., wireless, cellular, Internet, content, social network, etc.), and\/or device manufacturers, and the relevant content can be embedded\/tagged by any one of a combination of these entities as well.","By way of example, the user selects the fourth floor of a department as a POI, and tags content information of the POI retrieved from the department store website. The system  saves the POI and the tagged content, and presents to the user most updated content information in the live image view and\/or the prerecorded panoramic view, automatically or on demand. The content information may include: (1) a floor plan of the POI, (2) the occupants\/shops\/facilities located in the POI (e.g., in thumbnail images, animation, audio alerts, etc.), (3) introduction and background content with respect to the occupants\/shops\/facilities, (4) marketing and sales content with respect to the occupants\/shops\/facilities, or any other data or information tied to the POI. It is also contemplated that content may be associated with multiple floors. The content information includes live media, stored media, metadata associated with media, text information, location information of other user devices, mapping data, geo-tagged data, or a combination thereof.","In another embodiment, the system  enables the user to browse available content of the POI by time. For example, the user can specify a time in the past, present, or future. The system  then determines the content with respect to the specified period of time and matches the content based on the specified time. In this way, the user can view content relevant to the POI at any particular time. For example, to view upcoming 1-hour sales items for babies clothes and plan when to visit the POI, the system  enables the user to specify the 1-hour time period and displays to the user detailed sales content, a corresponding floor plan and a walking route to the store.","In another embodiment, the system  enables the user to send\/share user's location with one or more street views with one or more other users via emails and\/or social network websites. The street views include at least one live image taken by a user device, a prerecorded panoramic image taken at a location substantially matching or falling within a predetermined proximity (e.g., 25 meters) of the user device, the, one or more other prerecorded panoramic images that are geographically and\/or temporally associated with the prerecorded panoramic image, one or more other live images that are geographically and\/or temporally associated with the live image, or a combination thereof. The system  can pick a street view that is closest but not exactly where the user device was for sharing and rendering an avatar in the share street view image to indicate the location of the user device.","In one embodiment, when a user desired to share the location of the user device, the system  attaches one or more of the street views associated with that location to a message, and the send the message to one or more other user devices. In other embodiments, the message is attached with at least a link, a part, an abbreviation, or a combination of street views, such that a receiving user device can obtain the street views by retrieving via the link, or expanding the part or the abbreviation of street views. By way of example, the user is standing at the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, and wants to share the location via a social network website to the user's friends. After receiving an email form the user, the friends would see an association icon including a name of the location, a user's message (\u201cHaving a good time!\u201d), and a prerecorded panoramic image marked with the user's location. By clicking the association icon to expand the icon, the receiving user can interact with the expanded icon.","As shown in , a user equipment (UE)  may retrieve content information (e.g., content and location information) and mapping information (e.g., maps, GPS data, prerecorded panoramic views, etc.) from a content mapping platform  via a communication network . The content and mapping information can be used by a mapping and augmented reality application  on the UE  (e.g., an augmented reality application, navigation application, or other location-based application) to a live image view and\/or a prerecorded panoramic view. In the example of , the content mapping platform  stores mapping information in the map database and content information in the content catalog . By way of example, mapping information includes digital maps, GPS coordinates, prerecorded panoramic views, geo-tagged data, points of interest data, or a combination thereof. By way of example, content information includes one or more identifiers, metadata, access addresses (e.g., network address such as a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) or an Internet Protocol (IP) address; or a local address such as a file or storage location in a memory of the UE , description, or the like associated with content. In one embodiment, content includes live media (e.g., streaming broadcasts), stored media (e.g., stored on a network or locally), metadata associated with media, text information, location information of other user devices, or a combination thereof. The content may be provided by the service platform  which includes one or more services -(e.g., music service, mapping service, video service, social networking service, content broadcasting service, etc.), the one or more content providers -(e.g., online content retailers, public databases, etc.), other content source available or accessible over the communication network .","Additionally or alternatively, in certain embodiments, a user map and content database  of the UE  may be utilized in conjunction with the application  to present content information, location information (e.g., mapping and navigation information), availability information, etc. to the user. The user may be presented with an augmented reality interface associated with the application  and\/or the content mapping platform allowing 3D objects or other representations of content and related information to be superimposed onto an image of a physical environment on the UE . In certain embodiments, the user interface may display a hybrid physical and virtual environment where 3D objects from the map database are superimposed on top of a physical image.","By way of example, the UE  may execute the application  to receive content and\/or mapping information from the content mapping platform  or other component of the network . As mentioned above, the UE  utilizes GPS satellites  to determine the location of the UE  to utilize the content mapping functions of the content mapping platform  and\/or the application , and the map information stored in the map database may be created from live camera views of real-world buildings and other sites. As such, content can be augmented into prerecorded panoramic views and\/or live camera views of real world locations (e.g., based on location coordinates such as global positioning system (GPS) coordinates).","The application  and the content mapping platform  receive access information about content, determines the availability of the content based on the access information, and then presents a prerecorded panoramic view or a live image view with augmented content (e.g., a live camera view of the IMF building with augmented content, such as its origin, mission, facilities information: height, a number of floor, etc.). In certain embodiments, the content information may include 2D and 3D digital maps of objects, facilities, and structures in a physical environment (e.g., buildings).","By way of example, the communication network  of the system  includes one or more networks such as a data network (not shown), a wireless network (not shown), a telephony network (not shown), or any combination thereof. It is contemplated that the data network may be any local area network (LAN), metropolitan area network (MAN), wide area network (WAN), a public data network (e.g., the Internet), or any other suitable packet-switched network, such as a commercially owned, proprietary packet-switched network, e.g., a proprietary cable or fiber-optic network. In addition, the wireless network may be, for example, a cellular network and may employ various technologies including enhanced data rates for global evolution (EDGE), general packet radio service (GPRS), global system for mobile communications (GSM), Internet protocol multimedia subsystem (IMS), universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS), etc., as well as any other suitable wireless medium, e.g., worldwide interoperability for microwave access (WiMAX), Long Term Evolution (LTE) networks, code division multiple access (CDMA), wideband code division multiple access (WCDMA), wireless fidelity (WiFi), satellite, mobile ad-hoc network (MANET), and the like.","The UE  is any type of mobile terminal, fixed terminal, or portable terminal including a mobile handset, station, unit, device, multimedia computer, multimedia tablet, Internet node, communicator, desktop computer, laptop computer, Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), or any combination thereof. It is also contemplated that the UE  can support any type of interface to the user (such as \u201cwearable\u201d circuitry, etc.).","By way of example, the UE , and content mapping platform  communicate with each other and other components of the communication network  using well known, new or still developing protocols. In this context, a protocol includes a set of rules defining how the network nodes within the communication network  interact with each other based on information sent over the communication links. The protocols are effective at different layers of operation within each node, from generating and receiving physical signals of various types, to selecting a link for transferring those signals, to the format of information indicated by those signals, to identifying which software application executing on a computer system sends or receives the information. The conceptually different layers of protocols for exchanging information over a network are described in the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Reference Model.","Communications between the network nodes are typically effected by exchanging discrete packets of data. Each packet typically comprises (1) header information associated with a particular protocol, and (2) payload information that follows the header information and contains information that may be processed independently of that particular protocol. In some protocols, the packet includes (3) trailer information following the payload and indicating the end of the payload information. The header includes information such as the source of the packet, its destination, the length of the payload, and other properties used by the protocol. Often, the data in the payload for the particular protocol includes a header and payload for a different protocol associated with a different, higher layer of the OSI Reference Model. The header for a particular protocol typically indicates a type for the next protocol contained in its payload. The higher layer protocol is said to be encapsulated in the lower layer protocol. The headers included in a packet traversing multiple heterogeneous networks, such as the Internet, typically include a physical (layer 1) header, a data-link (layer 2) header, an internetwork (layer 3) header and a transport (layer 4) header, and various application headers (layer 5, layer 6 and layer 7) as defined by the OSI Reference Model.","In one embodiment, the application  and the content mapping platform  may interact according to a client-server model, so that the application  of the UE  requests mapping and\/or content data from the content mapping platform  on demand. According to the client-server model, a client process sends a message including a request to a server process, and the server process responds by providing a service (e.g., providing map information). The server process may also return a message with a response to the client process. Often the client process and server process execute on different computer devices, called hosts, and communicate via a network using one or more protocols for network communications. The term \u201cserver\u201d is conventionally used to refer to the process that provides the service, or the host computer on which the process operates. Similarly, the term \u201cclient\u201d is conventionally used to refer to the process that makes the request, or the host computer on which the process operates. As used herein, the terms \u201cclient\u201d and \u201cserver\u201d refer to the processes, rather than the host computers, unless otherwise clear from the context. In addition, the process performed by a server can be broken up to run as multiple processes on multiple hosts (sometimes called tiers) for reasons that include reliability, scalability, and redundancy, among others.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["107","107","201","107","201","203","101","203"]},"Next, the control logic  interacts with a location module  to retrieve location data of the current location of the UE . In one embodiment, the location data may include addresses, geographic coordinates (e.g., GPS coordinates) or other indicators (e.g., longitude and latitude information) that can be associated with the current location. For example, the location data may be manually entered by the user (e.g., entering an address or title, clicking on a digital map, etc.) or extracted or derived from any geo-tagged data. It is contemplated that the location data or geo-tagged data could also be created by the location module  by deriving the location associated metadata such as media titles, tags, and comments. More specifically, the location module  can parse the metadata for any terms that indicate association with a particular location. The control logic  also interacts with the location module  to retrieve location data of a location substantially matching or falling within a predetermined proximity (e.g., 25 meters) of UE  where a prerecorded panoramic image was taken. The control logic  further interacts with the location module  to retrieve location data of one or more other prerecorded panoramic images that are geographically and\/or temporally associated with the prerecorded panoramic image, and to retrieve location data of one or more other live images that are geographically and\/or temporally associated with the live image.","In one embodiment, the location module  determines the user's location by a triangulation system such as a GPS, assisted GPS (A-GPS) A-GPS, Cell of Origin, wireless local area network triangulation, or other location extrapolation technologies. Standard GPS and A-GPS systems can use satellites  to pinpoint the location (e.g., longitude, latitude, and altitude) of the UE . A Cell of Origin system can be used to determine the cellular tower that a cellular UE  is synchronized with. This information provides a coarse location of the UE  because the cellular tower can have a unique cellular identifier (cell-ID) that can be geographically mapped. The location module  may also utilize multiple technologies to detect the location of the UE . GPS coordinates can provide finer detail as to the location of the UE . As previously noted, the location module  may be utilized to determine location coordinates for use by the application  and\/or the content mapping platform .","Again, the control logic  interacts with the image module  to display the live camera view and location data of the current location (e.g., the Farragut West METRO Station).","While displaying the live camera view of the current location, the control logic  interacts with the image module  to receive an indication of switching views by the user by, for example, touching a \u201cSwitch\u201d icon on the screen of the UE . The control logic  interacts with a correlating module  to correlate the live image view with a prerecorded panoramic view with the location data, and also interacts with a switching module  to alternates\/switch the display from the live image view to the correlated prerecorded panoramic view.","In another embodiment, the control logic  interacts with a correlating module  to correlate the live image view with one or more other live images that are geographically and\/or temporally associated with the live image, to associate the images via an association icon. The control logic  also interacts with a correlating module  to correlate the prerecorded panoramic view with one or more other prerecorded panoramic images that are geographically and\/or temporally associated with the prerecorded panoramic image, to associate the images via an association icon.","In another embodiment, the switching module  interacts with a magnetometer module  which determines horizontal orientation or directional heading (e.g., a compass heading) of the UE , and an accelerometer module  which determines vertical orientation or an angle of elevation of the UE . Thereafter, the switching module  interact with the image module  to display on the screen of the UE  different portions of the prerecorded panoramic view depending upon the tilt angle and directional heading of the UE  as tilted and\/or rotated by the user. Under these circumstances, the user can view different portions of the prerecorded panoramic view, without moving\/dragging a viewing tag on the screen of the UE .","In one embodiment, horizontal directional data obtained from a magnetometer is utilized to determine the orientation of the UE . The magnetometer module  can include an instrument that can measure the strength and\/or direction of a magnetic field. Using the same approach as a compass, the magnetometer is capable of determining the directional heading of a UE  using the magnetic field of the Earth. The front of the image capture device (e.g., a digital camera) (or another reference point on the UE ) can be marked as a reference point in determining direction. Thus, if the magnetic field points north compared to the reference point, the angle the UE  reference point is from the magnetic field is known. Simple calculations can be made to determine the direction of the UE . This directional information may be correlated with the location information of the UE  to determine where (e.g., at which geographic feature or object) the UE  is pointing towards. This information may be utilized to select a portion of the prerecorded panoramic view to render to the user.","Further, the accelerometer module  may include an instrument that can measure acceleration. Using a three-axis accelerometer, with axes X, Y, and Z, provides the acceleration in three directions with known angles. Once again, the front of a media capture device can be marked as a reference point in determining direction. Because the acceleration due to gravity is known, when a UE  is stationary, the accelerometer module  can determine the angle the UE  is pointed as compared to Earth's gravity. In one embodiment, vertical directional data obtained from an accelerometer is used to determine the angle of elevation or tilt angle at which the UE  is pointing. This information in conjunction with the magnetometer information and location information may be utilized to determine a viewpoint in the prerecorded panoramic view to the user. As such, this information may be utilized in selecting available content items to present navigational information to the user. Moreover, the combined information may be utilized to determine portions of a particular digital map or a prerecorded panoramic view that may interest the user.","The control logic then interacts with the image module  to render a viewpoint in the prerecorded panoramic view to the user, whenever the user rotates\/tilts the UE . As mentioned, the correlating module  can obtain the live image from a camera and correlate the live image with a prerecorded panoramic view via location information. In addition, the correlating module  uses magnetometer information, accelerometer information, or a combination thereof to determine a viewpoint to display a portion of the prerecorded panoramic view to the user.","The control logic  then interacts with a content management module  and the image module  to augment content information related to one or more POIs in the live image therein. The content may be received from the service platform , the services -, the content providers -, other like components, or a combination thereof. It is also contemplated that the user or another party authorized by the user may manually enter a content item. The control logic  also interacts with the content management module  and the image module  to augment content information related to one or more POIs into the prerecorded panoramic view correlated to the live image, into one or more other prerecorded panoramic images that are geographically and\/or temporally associated with the prerecorded panoramic image, into one or more other live images that are geographically and\/or temporally associated with the live image.","In one embodiment, the content management module  may create a content catalog listing all content items and associated access addresses provided to the content management module . In certain embodiments, the content catalog may include additional descriptive information and other metadata describing the content. The available media content or stream can take many forms (e.g., live video feeds, photographs, audio files, etc.) and can be delivered using any number means (e.g., streaming media, downloaded media, spontaneously created media, etc.). The content management module  includes one or more sub-modules or application programming interfaces (APIs) (not pictured) for receiving and\/or detecting the media content in its native format or for converting the media content to a media format compatible with the mapping and augmented reality application . In other embodiments, the content management module  may initiate a download or installation of the components (e.g., codecs, player applications, etc.) needed to verify the content or stream. The content data can be cached or save in the user map and content database .","To facilitate finding specific content or features, the content management module  enables the user to input search criteria (e.g., a content item, person, city, weather, etc.) and to get guidance for finding the direction where the searched content item is located in the real physical world. The content management module  also enables a user to specify a time period so as to navigate content information using both location and time. In one embodiment, the default time for viewing the content and mapping information is the present. If a time period is set as future, the content management module  will determine the one or more content items based on the specified time, such as what will be on sales in the next three hours on the 4floor of the department store. By way of example, the sales content and product information can be presented on a floor plan with representations of each product placed according to the associated location information.","The content can be depicted as a thumbnail overlaid on the user interface map at the location corresponding to a point of interest (e.g., a floor) or a portion of the point of interest (e.g., facilities on the floor). As discussed, the user interface may be a graphical user interface. In addition or alternatively, the user interface may be an audio or tactile interface. In one embodiment, the content management nodule  presents only those content items that are available at the specified time and are not associated with any limitations or exclusive restrictions. This embodiment provides a user experience in which users can simply select from the presented content items and be assured that the selected item will be available with a single selection click. In other embodiments, the content management module  may present all available content and differentiate the presentation of content available with a single click versus content associated with additional limitations or restrictions. The specific types of presentations can be specified by the user, content provider , network operator, service platform , or a combination thereof. The content management module  then determines whether to periodically update the content information.","In certain embodiments, when there is much more content available than can be displayed in the existing user interface, the content management nodule  constantly animates the display of the content items so that new content keeps appearing while older content disappears. This animation process also makes the user interface more entertaining to users and gives a feeling of the world being \u201calive\u201d with activity.","In certain embodiments, the user map and content database  includes all or a portion the information in the map database and the content catalog . From the selected viewpoint, a live image view augmented with the content can be provided on the screen of the UE . In certain embodiments, the content management nodule  provides a correlated prerecorded panoramic view from the selected view point with content generated or retrieved from the database  or the content mapping platform . The content information can be embedded\/tagged in the correlated prerecorded panoramic view previously by another apparatus or by the content management nodule  on demand and\/or in a real time manner when displays the correlated prerecorded panoramic view on the screen of the UE .","Content and mapping information may be presented to the user via a user interface , which may include various methods of communication. For example, the user interface  can have outputs including a visual component (e.g., a screen), an audio component (e.g., a verbal instructions), a physical component (e.g., vibrations), and other methods of communication. User inputs can include a touch-screen interface, microphone, camera, a scroll-and-click interface, a button interface, etc. Further, the user may input a request to start the application  (e.g., a mapping and augmented reality application) and utilize the user interface  to receive content and mapping information. Through the user interface , the user may request different types of content, mapping, or location information to be presented. Further, the user may be presented with 3D or augmented reality representations of particular locations and related objects (e.g., buildings, terrain features, POIs, etc. at the particular location) as part of a graphical user interface on a screen of the UE . As mentioned, the UE  communicates with the content mapping platform  service platform , and\/or content providers -to fetch content, mapping, and or location information. The UE  may utilize requests in a client server format to retrieve the content and mapping information. Moreover, the UE  may specify location information and\/or orientation information in the request to retrieve the content and mapping information.","The control logic  also interacts with the image module  to receive an indication of sharing the user location by, for example, attaching one or more street views associated with the prerecorded panoramic view to one or more emails via an email module . The email module  sends the emails to other user devices and\/or social network websites. In other embodiments, the email module  attaches the message with at least a link, a part, an abbreviation, or a combination of street views, such that a receiving user device can obtain the street views by retrieving via the link, or expanding the part or the abbreviation of street views.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0079","num":"0078"},"figref":["FIG. 3A","FIG. 8"],"b":["107","300","301","107","101","107","101","303"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0080","num":"0079"},"figref":["FIG. 3B","FIG. 8"],"b":["107","320","321","107","107","107"]},"By way of example and continuing with the example of the department store discussed above, the application  sets the 4floor of the department store as a POI based upon the user's indication. The application  then retrieves the sales content and product information available for the 4floor, and augments the content into a live image or a correlated prerecord panoramic image.","An inherent property of an augmented reality user interface is that the displayed content is dependent on the viewpoint and that to view a specific point or content located on the ground, the user can specify a viewpoint of interest to the application  via the UE . The user can rotate\/tilt the UE  to specify the viewpoint of interest. After the user specifies specify the viewpoint of interest, the mapping and augmented reality application  causes, at least in part, presentation on the screen the viewpoint in the correlated prerecorded panoramic image according to a tilt angle and directional heading of the UE  (Step ).","The mapping and augmented reality application  causes, at least in part, presentation on the screen to display content updated based upon the viewpoint (Step ). By way of example, the application  presents the sales content and product information of the next hour on a floor plan with representations of each product placed according to their location on the 4th floor.","As noted previously, an inherent property of an augmented reality user interface is that the display follows the movement and pointing of the UE . In some cases (e.g., when the user has found and is displaying a favorite viewpoint), the user may wish to \u201clock\u201d or fix the display at a particular viewpoint without having to maintain the UE  in the same position. When seeing the 4floor of the department store, the user can fix the viewpoint of the correlated prerecorded panoramic image so as to save a POI in the system .","The application  also prompts the user to specify a time period so as to retrieve content using both location and time.

In one embodiment, one live image is stitched with at least one prerecorded panoramic image, for example, to piece together at least a part of the New York City skyline based upon the geographic coordinates or other metadata of the images. By way of example, a series of prerecorded panoramic images were taken along the New York City skyline every half a mile and the current location of UE  is right at or within 25 meters from a focal point of one of the prerecorded panoramic images. The mapping and augmented reality application  replaces the closest prerecorded panoramic image with the live image into a New York City skyline including the live image. However, if the focal point of the closest prerecorded panoramic image is almost \u00bc mile from the focal point of the live image, mapping and augmented reality application  slices the closest prerecorded panoramic image and its neighboring prerecorded panoramic image into half, and then stitches the live image in-between into a New York City skyline including the live image.","In step , the mapping and augmented reality application  causes, at least in part, an association of the prerecorded panoramic image, the at least one live image, one or more other prerecorded panoramic images, one or more other live images, or a combination thereof with the shared location. The association is based, at least in part, on the information (e.g., geographic coordinates of UEs taking live images, geographic coordinates of UEs taking prerecorded panoramic images, live image IDs, panoramic images IDs, image timestamps, POIs, etc.), the proximity information, or a combination thereof. For instance, the association in the Las Vegas Strip example includes the time stamps of ten years and twenty years from now, as well as the same POI: Las Vegas Strip. As another instance, the association in the New York City skyline example includes geographic coordinates of UEs taking live images, geographic coordinates of UEs taking prerecorded panoramic images, as well as the same POI: New York City skyline.","In step , the mapping and augmented reality application  causes, at least in part, a rendering of the association as an interactive user interface element including, at least in part, an icon, a thumbnail, or a combination thereof.

In general the coupling is with a network link  that is connected to a local network  to which a variety of external devices with their own processors are connected. For example, communication interface  may be a parallel port or a serial port or a universal serial bus (USB) port on a personal computer. In some embodiments, communications interface  is an integrated services digital network (ISDN) card or a digital subscriber line (DSL) card or a telephone modem that provides an information communication connection to a corresponding type of telephone line. In some embodiments, a communication interface  is a cable modem that converts signals on bus  into signals for a communication connection over a coaxial cable or into optical signals for a communication connection over a fiber optic cable. As another example, communications interface  may be a local area network (LAN) card to provide a data communication connection to a compatible LAN, such as Ethernet. Wireless links may also be implemented. For wireless links, the communications interface  sends or receives or both sends and receives electrical, acoustic or electromagnetic signals, including infrared and optical signals, that carry information streams, such as digital data. For example, in wireless handheld devices, such as mobile telephones like cell phones, the communications interface  includes a radio band electromagnetic transmitter and receiver called a radio transceiver. In certain embodiments, the communications interface  enables connection between the UE  and the communication network  for correlating and navigating between a live camera image and a prerecorded panoramic image.","The term \u201ccomputer-readable medium\u201d as used herein to refer to any medium that participates in providing information to processor , including instructions for execution.

For example, network link  may provide a connection through local network  to a host computer  or to equipment  operated by an Internet Service Provider (ISP). ISP equipment  in turn provides data communication services through the public, world-wide packet-switching communication network of networks now commonly referred to as the Internet .","A computer called a server host  connected to the Internet hosts a process that provides a service in response to information received over the Internet. For example, server host  hosts a process that provides information representing video data for presentation at display .

In this manner, computer system  may obtain application program code in the form of signals on a carrier wave.","Various forms of computer readable media may be involved in carrying one or more sequence of instructions or data or both to processor  for execution. For example, instructions and data may initially be carried on a magnetic disk of a remote computer such as host . The remote computer loads the instructions and data into its dynamic memory and sends the instructions and data over a telephone line using a modem. A modem local to the computer system  receives the instructions and data on a telephone line and uses an infra-red transmitter to convert the instructions and data to a signal on an infra-red carrier wave serving as the network link . An infrared detector serving as communications interface  receives the instructions and data carried in the infrared signal and places information representing the instructions and data onto bus .

The processor  may include one or more processing cores with each core configured to perform independently. A multi-core processor enables multiprocessing within a single physical package. Examples of a multi-core processor include two, four, eight, or greater numbers of processing cores. Alternatively or in addition, the processor  may include one or more microprocessors configured in tandem via the bus  to enable independent execution of instructions, pipelining, and multithreading. The processor  may also be accompanied with one or more specialized components to perform certain processing functions and tasks such as one or more digital signal processors (DSP) , or one or more application-specific integrated circuits (ASIC) .

A main display unit  provides a display to the user in support of various applications and mobile terminal functions that perform or support the steps of correlating and navigating between a live camera image and a prerecorded panoramic image. The display  includes display circuitry configured to display at least a portion of a user interface of the mobile terminal (e.g., mobile telephone). Additionally, the display  and display circuitry are configured to facilitate user control of at least some functions of the mobile terminal. An audio function circuitry  includes a microphone  and microphone amplifier that amplifies the speech signal output from the microphone . The amplified speech signal output from the microphone  is fed to a coder\/decoder (CODEC) .","A radio section  amplifies power and converts frequency in order to communicate with a base station, which is included in a mobile communication system, via antenna . The power amplifier (PA)  and the transmitter\/modulation circuitry are operationally responsive to the MCU , with an output from the PA  coupled to the duplexer  or circulator or antenna switch, as known in the art. The PA  also couples to a battery interface and power control unit .","In use, a user of mobile terminal  speaks into the microphone  and his or her voice along with any detected background noise is converted into an analog voltage. The analog voltage is then converted into a digital signal through the Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) . The control unit  routes the digital signal into the DSP  for processing therein, such as speech encoding, channel encoding, encrypting, and interleaving. In one embodiment, the processed voice signals are encoded, by units not separately shown, using a cellular transmission protocol such as global evolution (EDGE), general packet radio service (GPRS), global system for mobile communications (GSM), Internet protocol multimedia subsystem (IMS), universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS), etc., as well as any other suitable wireless medium, e.g., microwave access (WiMAX), Long Term Evolution (LTE) networks, code division multiple access (CDMA), wideband code division multiple access (WCDMA), wireless fidelity (WiFi), satellite, and the like.","The encoded signals are then routed to an equalizer  for compensation of any frequency-dependent impairments that occur during transmission though the air such as phase and amplitude distortion. After equalizing the bit stream, the modulator  combines the signal with a RF signal generated in the RF interface . The modulator  generates a sine wave by way of frequency or phase modulation. In order to prepare the signal for transmission, an up-converter  combines the sine wave output from the modulator  with another sine wave generated by a synthesizer  to achieve the desired frequency of transmission. The signal is then sent through a PA  to increase the signal to an appropriate power level. In practical systems, the PA  acts as a variable gain amplifier whose gain is controlled by the DSP  from information received from a network base station. The signal is then filtered within the duplexer  and optionally sent to an antenna coupler  to match impedances to provide maximum power transfer. Finally, the signal is transmitted via antenna  to a local base station. An automatic gain control (AGC) can be supplied to control the gain of the final stages of the receiver. The signals may be forwarded from there to a remote telephone which may be another cellular telephone, other mobile phone or a land-line connected to a Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), or other telephony networks.","Voice signals transmitted to the mobile terminal  are received via antenna  and immediately amplified by a low noise amplifier (LNA) . A down-converter  lowers the carrier frequency while the demodulator  strips away the RF leaving only a digital bit stream. The signal then goes through the equalizer  and is processed by the DSP . A Digital to Analog Converter (DAC)  converts the signal and the resulting output is transmitted to the user through the speaker , all under control of a Main Control Unit (MCU) \u2014which can be implemented as a Central Processing Unit (CPU) (not shown).","The MCU  receives various signals including input signals from the keyboard .

The MCU  also delivers a display command and a switch command to the display  and to the speech output switching controller, respectively. Further, the MCU  exchanges information with the DSP  and can access an optionally incorporated SIM card  and a memory . In addition, the MCU  executes various control functions required of the terminal. The DSP  may, depending upon the implementation, perform any of a variety of conventional digital processing functions on the voice signals. Additionally, DSP  determines the background noise level of the local environment from the signals detected by microphone  and sets the gain of microphone  to a level selected to compensate for the natural tendency of the user of the mobile terminal .","The CODEC  includes the ADC  and DAC . The memory  stores various data including call incoming tone data and is capable of storing other data including music data received via, e.g., the global Internet.

The SIM card  serves primarily to identify the mobile terminal  on a radio network. The card  also contains a memory for storing a personal telephone number registry, text messages, and user specific mobile terminal settings.","While the invention has been described in connection with a number of embodiments and implementations, the invention is not so limited but covers various obvious modifications and equivalent arrangements, which fall within the purview of the appended claims.
