{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This disclosure relates generally to routing tables and, more particularly, to methods and apparatus to selectively assign routing tables to router linecards.","Enterprise customers are increasingly adopting virtual private network (VPN) services to implement a communication network among their respective customer sites via a service provider's network. Such VPNs can provide direct any-to-any reachability among an enterprise's customer sites. In some examples, an enterprise customer may implement more than one VPN via the service provider's network.","Example methods and apparatus to selectively assign routing tables to router linecards are disclosed. A disclosed example method includes computing costs associated with assigning routing information for two or more subsets of virtual private networks (VPNs) to each of two or more subsets of linecards of a router, solving an uncapacitated facility location problem defined by the computed costs to determine an assignment of a particular subset of the VPNs to a particular subset of the linecards of the router, and configuring the particular subset of the linecards of the router with routing information for the particular subset of the VPNs.","A disclosed example apparatus includes a schema identifier to define a first non-empty subset of linecards of a router and to define a second non-empty subset of the linecards of the router, wherein the second subset of the linecards differs from the first subset of the linecards, a subset identifier to identify a first subset of VPNs having all their associated interfaces implemented by the first subset of the linecards and to identify a second subset of the VPNs having all their associated interfaces implemented by the second subset of the linecards, a cover analyzer to compute a first cost of assigning routing information for the first subset of the VPNs to the first subset of the linecards, to compute a second cost of assigning routing information for the second subset of the VPNs to the first subset of the linecards, to compute a third cost of assigning routing information for the first subset of the VPNs to the second subset of the linecards, and to compute a fourth cost of assigning routing information for the second subset of the VPNs to the second subset of the linecards, an optimizer to determine whether to assign the first subset of the VPNs to the first subset of the linecards or to the second subset of the linecards based on the first, second, third, and fourth costs, and a router interface to configure the first subset of the linecards of the router with routing information for the first subset of the VPNs based on an output of the optimizer.","A disclosed example article of manufacture stores machine readable instructions that, when executed, cause a machine to define a first non-empty subset of linecards of a router, define a second non-empty subset of the linecards of the router, wherein the second subset of the linecards differs from the first subset of the linecards, identify a first subset of VPNs having all their associated interfaces implemented by the first subset of the linecards, identify a second subset of the VPNs having all their associated interfaces implemented by the second subset of the linecards, compute a first cost of assigning routing information for the first subset of the VPNs to the first subset of the linecards, compute a second cost of assigning routing information for the second subset of the VPNs to the first subset of the linecards, compute a third cost of assigning routing information for the first subset of the VPNs to the second subset of the linecards, compute a fourth cost of assigning routing information for the second subset of the VPNs to the second subset of the linecards, determine whether to assign the first subset of the VPNs to the first subset of the linecards or to the second subset of the linecards based on the first, second, third, and fourth costs, and configure the first subset of the linecards of the router with routing information for the first subset of the VPNs when the first subset of the VPNs is assigned to the first subset of the linecards.","In the interest of brevity and clarity, throughout the following disclosure references will be made to VPNs and an example multiprotocol label switched (MPLS) based communication system  of . However, the methods and apparatus described herein to selectively assign routing tables to router linecards are applicable to other types of networks constructed using other network technologies, topologies and\/or protocols.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","105","106","107","108","109","100","110","105","107","108","109"]},"To route and\/or transport data between and\/or among the example CE routers -, the example MPLS-based service-provider network  of  includes a plurality of provider edge (PE) routers, three of which are designated at reference numerals , , and . The example PE routers - of  are communicatively coupled to each other via any number and\/or type(s) of communication paths (not shown) that allow any particular PE router - to communicate with at least some, but not necessarily all of, the other PE routers -.","For each VPN implemented by the MPLS-based service-provider network , each of the example PE routers - of  has a corresponding VPN routing and forwarding (VRF) table. For instance, for the VPN A the PE routers - have a VRF A, and for the VPN B the PE routers  and  have a VRF B. The VRF tables A and B are used by the PE routers - to route and\/or forward a packet received at a particular PE router - toward its final destination. In general, when a packet is received at a PE router - from a CE router - associated with a particular VPN, the PE router - uses the final destination specified and\/or identified in the packet to perform a query of the VRF table associated with that VPN. Based on a result of the query, the PE router - determines how the packet is to be routed or forwarded within the service provider network , and\/or delivered to a particular CE router -.","Each of the example PE routers - of  implements and\/or is implemented by any number and\/or type(s) of linecards (not shown). Each linecard may implement any number and\/or type(s) of interfaces that may be used to communicatively couple customer equipment, such as the CE routers -, to the PE router -. At a particular PE router -, any VPN may have equipment communicatively coupled to any number and\/or type(s) of interfaces on any number and\/or type(s) of linecards of the PE router -. For example, a VPN may not have any associated equipment coupled to any interface of any linecard of a particular PE router -, may have associated equipment coupled to one or more interfaces on each linecard of that PE router -, and\/or may have associated equipment coupled to one or more interfaces on a subset of the linecards of that PE router -.","Traditionally, each linecard of a PE router - creates, stores, maintains, and\/or utilizes a VRF table for each VPN having one or more interfaces on that PE router -. However, such traditional methods result in the storage of a VRF table for a particular VPN on each and every linecard even though that VPN may not be coupled to each linecard of the PE router -.","To reduce the memory required to store VRF tables on the linecards of the example PE routers -, the example service-provider network  of  includes a route table assignor . While a single route table assignor  is illustrated in , the example service-provider network  may include any number of route table assignors . For example, a route table assignor  may be located at each of the PE routers -, at a subset of the PE routers -, etc. An example manner of implementing the example route table assignor  is described below in connection with . In general, the interface(s) to which a VPN is connected may be different at each PE router -. Accordingly, in the examples described herein, the example route table assignor  determines the assignment of routing information to linecards separately for each PE router -.","For each PE router -, the example route table assignor  of  determines, assigns and\/or indicates which linecard(s) are to create, store, update and\/or maintain VRF table(s) for which VPN(s). In other words, the example route table assignor  assigns routing information for particular VPNs to particular linecards of the PE router - rather than simply storing all routing information for all VPNs on all linecards. For instance, in the illustrated example of , the example route table assignor  may indicate and\/or specify particular linecards of the example PE router  that need to create, store, update and\/or maintain a VRF table for VPN A. Likewise, were devices associated with VPN A only communicatively coupled to a portion of the linecards of the example PE router , the route table assignor  can indicate to the PE router  which linecard(s) of PE router  need to create, store, update and\/or maintain a VRF table for VPN A.","The assignment of routing information to PE router linecards can be affected using any number and\/or type(s) of method(s), criteria, rule(s) and\/or logic. In some examples, a multicast group is assigned to each VPN for each PE router -. Each of the multicast groups downloads one or more VRF tables to a given subset of linecards. The route processor card of each of the PE routers - receives VRF table information for each VPN via its associated multicast group, and determines which VRF table(s) should be created, stored, updated and\/or maintained on which of its linecards. However, there are potentially thousands of multicast groups even when there are only tens of linecards in a PE router -. Many of these multicast groups may never be used. The computational requirements to handle and\/or process such a large number of multicast groups can become burdensome.","In still other examples, the VRF table for a VPN is sent to each linecard of a particular PE router - to which one or more devices associated with the VPN are coupled to at least one interface of that PE router -. In response, each linecard determines which VRF table(s) to maintain in memory and which to discard. However, this approach places a high computational burden on linecard processors.","In a preferred example, an optimization problem is defined and solved to determine which routing information is assigned to which linecard(s). An example optimization problem balances two competing objectives: (1) saving memory by not downloading a VRF table to a linecard that does not need that VRF table, and (2) minimizing processor usage by not creating a multicast group for every VPN. The first objective represents the cost of storing a VRF table on linecards. For a given VRF table, this cost increases with the size of the VRF table and the number of linecards on which the VRF table is stored. The second objective reflects a cost associated with the handling and\/or processing of each multicast group. This cost reflects that each time a route is added\/deleted for a VPN, VRF table update information for the VPN is distributed via the multicast group and processed at the PE router -. In examples described below, these two criteria, memory consumption and processor utilization, are balanced and\/or traded-off against each other via a configurable and\/or selectable parameter ox. For example, the route table assignor  may assign routing information for a subset of the VPNs of the service-provider network  to a particular subset j of linecards of a presently considered PE router -, even though not every VPN in the subset has an interface on each linecard in the subset j of linecards. By grouping the subset of VPNs into a single multicast group, processing overhead can be lowered, albeit at the expense of increased memory. In particular, a VRF table may be assigned to a linecard via the multicast group even though the associated VPN uses no interfaces of the linecard.","While the examples described herein utilize multicast groups, any other additional and\/or alternative method(s) may be used to provide one or more VRF table(s) to one or more linecards. A multicast group is merely an example method of how to provide routing information to specific linecards and\/or specific PE routers -. Moreover, while the examples discussed herein describe downloading VRF tables to linecards, any other additional and\/or alternative method(s) may be used to assign and\/or provide routing information to linecards. In general, the PE router - and\/or the linecards create, update and\/or maintain the VRF table(s) under the control of the example route table assignor .","To store configuration information, the example service-provider network  of  includes any number and\/or type(s) of configuration databases, one of which is designated at reference numeral . The example configuration database  of  contains, among other information, data and\/or parameters that represent to which interface(s) on which linecard(s) of which PE router(s) - equipment associated with particular VPNs are communicatively coupled. In some examples there is a configuration database  implemented for each PE router -. Configuration information may be stored in the configuration database  using any number and\/or type(s) of data structures, and the configuration database  may be implemented by any number and\/or type(s) of tangible computer-readable tangible media, such as volatile memory, non-volatile memory, a memory device and\/or a storage device.","For a presently considered PE router -, the example route table assignor  of  uses information contained in the configuration database  to identify one or more subsets j of linecards. A subset j of linecards of the PE router - is also referred to herein as download schema j, as the subset j defines a group of linecards to which routing information can be downloaded and\/or assigned via an associated multicast group. A download schema j is defined by the subset of linecards belonging to the schema j. An example download schema j is the set {1, 3, 6, 7} representing a combination of linecard #1, linecard #3, linecard #6 and linecard #7. As used herein, S refers to the set of all download schemas j, that is, download schema j is a member of S (j\u03b5S). The set S of download schemas j may be selected, identified and\/or determined using any number and\/or type(s) of method(s), criteria and\/or logic. For example, the set S of download schemas j may be manually selected, may be randomly selected, and\/or may be adaptively determined based on analyzing past download schemas j to which routing information has been assigned.","For a presently considered PE router -, the example route table assignor  of  also uses information contained in the configuration database  to identify a subset V(j) of VPNs corresponding to particular download schema j. Each VPN v in the subset V(j) (v\u03b5V(j)) has at least one interface on every linecard of the download schema j, and does not have an interface on any linecard not included in download schema j. For example, if download schema j corresponds to the subset of linecards {3, 5, 6}, then V(j) is the subset of all VPNs having interfaces on each of and only on linecards #3, #5 and #6. Likewise, if example VPN #121 only has interfaces on linecards #3, #5 and #6, and download schema #15 is {2, 3, 4, 6}, then VPN #121 is not in V(15). Each of the VPN subsets V(j) belongs to the set V, that is, V(j)\u2282V.","Let i be a given download schema (i\u03b5S) and let j be another potentially different download schema (j\u03b5S). In a preferred example, j is selected to be a \u201ccover\u201d for i, which means that the set of linecards defined by schema i is a subset of the set of linecards defined by schema j. That is, the download schema j has to include every linecard in the download schema i, and may include additional linecards not in the download schema i. Because each download schema is a cover for itself, i and j may refer to the same download schema. The example route table assignor  of  assigns the VPN subsets V(i) to the download schema j, where download schema j covers download schema i. This means that the VRF table for each v E V(i) is downloaded to each linecard in schema j. Let S(i) be the set of download schemas that are covers for schema i. That is, if j\u03b5S(i), then schema j is a cover for schema i. The set S(i) is a subset of S, the set of all schemas. For example if download schema i is {3, 6}, then S(i) could include download schemas {3, 6}, {2, 3, 6} and {1, 3, 6, 7}.","An example VPN subset V(i) and example covering download schemas j are illustrated in . In  an example download schema i=7 includes linecards #2, #4 and #5, and the corresponding VPN subset V(i=7) includes VPN #34 and VPN #47. As shown, download schemas 7, 8 and 12 cover download schema i=7 and, thus, S(i\u03b57)={7, 8, 12}.","Returning to , the example route table assignor , for each particular i\u03b5S and j\u03b5S, computes the cost c(i, j) associated with assigning routing information for the particular subset V(i) of VPNs to the particular download schema j (i.e., a particular subset j of the linecards of a PE router -), and the cost f(j) associated with the download schema j. Based on the computed costs c(i,j) and f(j), the route table assignor  determines whether to assign the subset V(i) of VPNs to the download schema j. In some examples, the assignment is determined by solving an optimization problem that is generally expressible as an integer problem, but is more preferably expressed in the form of the uncapacitated facility location (UFL) problem. As used herein, the meaning of the phrases \u201cuncapacitated facility location problem\u201d and \u201cUFL problem,\u201d are consistent with their ordinary, well-known and widely accepted meanings. The UFL problem can be expressed canonically with the following mathematical expressions:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"min","mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"munder":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":["i","S"],"mo":"\u2208"}},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"munder":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":["j","S"],"mo":"\u2208"}},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"c","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":["i","j"],"mo":","}}},{"mi":"x","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":["i","j"],"mo":","}}}],"mo":"\u2062"}}}},{"mi":"\u03b1","mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"munder":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":["j","S"],"mo":"\u2208"}},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"f","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"j"}},{"mi":"y","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"j"}}],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}],"mi":["such","that"]}}}],"mo":"+"}},{"mrow":{"mi":"EQN","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"1"}}}]},{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"munder":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":["j","S"],"mo":"\u2208"}},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mi":"x","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":["i","j"],"mo":","}}}},{"mn":"1","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},"mrow":{"mo":"\u2200","mrow":{"mi":["i","S"],"mo":"\u2208"}}}],"mo":"="},"mo":";"}},{"mrow":{"mi":"EQN","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"2"}}}]},{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"x","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":["i","j"],"mo":","}}},{"mrow":[{"mi":"y","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"j"}},{"mo":"\u2200","mrow":{"mi":["i","S"],"mo":["\u2208","\u2208"],"mrow":{"mi":["S","and","j"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}]}}}],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}}],"mo":"\u2264"},"mo":";","mi":"and"}},{"mrow":{"mi":"EQN","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"3"}}}]},{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"x","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":["i","j"],"mo":","}}},{"mn":["0","1"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}],"mi":"or","mrow":{"mo":"\u2200","mrow":{"mi":"i","mo":["\u2208","\u2208"],"mrow":[{"mi":["S","and","j"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}]},{"mi":"S","mo":"."}]}}}],"mo":"="}},{"mrow":{"mi":"EQN","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"4"}}}]}]}}},"br":{}},"The cost c(i, j) of assigning routing information for subset V(i) of VPNs to download schema j is a sum of products of the number of routes in a VPN's VRF table and the number of linecards in the download schema j.
