{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["1. Field of the Invention","The field of the invention is data processing, or, more specifically, methods, apparatus, and products for record disambiguation in a multimodal application operating on a multimodal device.","2. Description of Related Art","User interaction with applications running on small devices through a keyboard or stylus has become increasingly limited and cumbersome as those devices have become increasingly smaller. In particular, small handheld devices like mobile phones and PDAs serve many functions and contain sufficient processing power to support user interaction through multimodal access, that is, by interaction in non-voice modes as well as voice mode. Devices which support multimodal access combine multiple user input modes or channels in the same interaction allowing a user to interact with the applications on the device simultaneously through multiple input modes or channels. The methods of input include speech recognition, keyboard, touch screen, stylus, mouse, handwriting, and others. Multimodal input often makes using a small device easier.","Multimodal applications are often formed by sets of markup documents served up by web servers for display on multimodal browsers. A \u2018multimodal browser,\u2019 as the term is used in this specification, generally means a web browser capable of receiving multimodal input and interacting with users with multimodal output, where modes of the multimodal input and output include at least a speech mode. Multimodal browsers typically render web pages written in XHTML+Voice (\u2018X+V\u2019). X+V provides a markup language that enables users to interact with an multimodal application often running on a server through spoken dialog in addition to traditional means of input such as keyboard strokes and mouse pointer action. Visual markup tells a multimodal browser what the user interface is look like and how it is to behave when the user types, points, or clicks. Similarly, voice markup tells a multimodal browser what to do when the user speaks to it. For visual markup, the multimodal browser uses a graphics engine; for voice markup, the multimodal browser uses a speech engine. X+V adds spoken interaction to standard web content by integrating XHTML (eXtensible Hypertext Markup Language) and speech recognition vocabularies supported by VoiceXML. For visual markup, X+V includes the XHTML standard. For voice markup, X+V includes a subset of VoiceXML. For synchronizing the VoiceXML elements with corresponding visual interface elements, X+V uses events. XHTML includes voice modules that support speech synthesis, speech dialogs, command and control, and speech grammars. Voice handlers can be attached to XHTML elements and respond to specific events. Voice interaction features are integrated with XHTML and can consequently be used directly within XHTML content.","In addition to X+V, multimodal applications also may be implemented with Speech Application Tags (\u2018SALT\u2019). SALT is a markup language developed by the Salt Forum. Both X+V and SALT are markup languages for creating applications that use voice input\/speech recognition and voice output\/speech synthesis. Both SALT applications and X+V applications use underlying speech recognition and synthesis technologies or \u2018speech engines\u2019 to do the work of recognizing and generating human speech. As markup languages, both X+V and SALT provide markup-based programming environments for using speech engines in an application's user interface. Both languages have language elements, markup tags, that specify what the speech-recognition engine should listen for and what the synthesis engine should \u2018say.\u2019 Whereas X+V combines XHTML, VoiceXML, and the XML Events standard to create multimodal applications, SALT does not provide a standard visual markup language or eventing model. Rather, it is a low-level set of tags for specifying voice interaction that can be embedded into other environments. In addition to X+V and SALT, multimodal applications may be implemented in Java with a Java speech framework, in C++, for example, and with other technologies and in other environments as well.","Current multimodal applications support a voice mode of user interaction using a speech engine. A speech engine provides recognition and generation or \u2018synthesis\u2019 of human speech though use of an acoustic model that associates speech waveform data representing recorded pronunciations of speech with textual representations of those pronunciations, also referred to as \u2018phonemes.\u2019 Because most languages include sets of words that have the same pronunciation but have different spellings to distinguish each word's semantics, a set of phonemes representing a pronunciation may refer to more than one word in the language. A set of words having the same pronunciation, regardless of the words' semantics, are referred to as a \u2018homophonic set.\u2019 When a voice utterance specifying a word in a homophonic set is provided to the speech engine for recognition, therefore, the speech engine may return any one or all of the words in the homophonic set, but not necessarily the word intended by the speaker of the voice utterance.","In many multimodal applications, the multimodal application retrieves information for dynamic rendering from a database or other data repository. For example, the multimodal application may retrieve contact information for a user from the user's contact database. In such a database or other data repository, values for a particular attribute for multiple records may belong to the same homophonic set. When such an attribute is utilized as the key to select information from a data repository, the multimodal application cannot disambiguate between records to select the record desired by the user.","Methods, apparatus, and products are disclosed for record disambiguation in a multimodal application operating on a multimodal device, the multimodal device supporting multiple modes of interaction including at least a voice mode and a visual mode, that include: prompting, by the multimodal application, a user to identify a particular record among a plurality of records; receiving, by the multimodal application in response to the prompt, a voice utterance from the user; determining, by the multimodal application, that the voice utterance ambiguously identifies more than one of the plurality of records; generating, by the multimodal application, a user interaction to disambiguate the records ambiguously identified by the voice utterance in dependence upon record attributes of the records ambiguously identified by the voice utterance; and selecting, by the multimodal application for further processing, one of the records ambiguously identified by the voice utterance in dependence upon the user interaction.","The foregoing and other objects, features and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following more particular descriptions of exemplary embodiments of the invention as illustrated in the accompanying drawings wherein like reference numbers generally represent like parts of exemplary embodiments of the invention.","Exemplary methods, apparatus, and products for record disambiguation in a multimodal application operating on a multimodal device according to embodiments of the present invention are described with reference to the accompanying drawings, beginning with .  sets forth a network diagram illustrating an exemplary system for record disambiguation in a multimodal application () operating on a multimodal device () according to embodiments of the present invention. The multimodal application () is a software component that supports user interaction in both a voice mode and visual mode, and optionally various other modes such as, for example, tactile modes. The multimodal application () may include computer program instructions implemented in machine code that may be scheduled for execution directly by an operating system on a processor of the multimodal device (). For example, the multimodal application () may be implemented as a compiled version of program written in C++.","In other embodiments, the multimodal application () may include computer program instructions implemented in a higher level, non-machine language that requires runtime translation into machine code. In such embodiments, the multimodal application () is supported as by a multimodal execution environment (). The multimodal execution environment () may support execution of the multimodal application () by processing the multimodal application () itself or coordinating with other components such as, for example, a voice interpreter () to process portions of the multimodal application (). The multimodal execution environment () may translate the multimodal application () into platform specific, machine code directly executable on the processors of the multimodal device (), perform memory management for the multimodal application () during execution, control access to platform hardware, and so on. The implementation of the multimodal execution environment () typically depends on the implementation of the multimodal application (). When the multimodal application () is implemented using X+V or SALT tags, then the multimodal execution environment may be implemented as a multimodal browser. When the multimodal application () is implemented using Java, then the multimodal execution environment may be implemented as a Java Virtual Machine. Readers will note that the implementations described above are for explanation only and not for limitation.","The multimodal device () of  supports multiple modes of user interaction with the multimodal application () including a voice mode and a visual mode, and optionally one or more other modes of user interaction with the multimodal application (). The voice mode is represented here with audio output of voice prompts and responses () from the multimodal devices () and audio input of speech for recognition () from a user (). Non-voice modes are represented by input\/output devices such as keyboards and display screens on the multimodal devices (). The voice mode of user interaction with the multimodal application is supported by a voice interpreter (), through which the multimodal application () is operatively coupled to a speech engine (). The operative coupling may be implemented with an application programming interface (\u2018API\u2019), a voice service module, or a VoIP connection as explained in more detail below.","In the exemplary system of , the voice interpreter () supports the voice mode of user interaction with the multimodal application () by providing grammars, speech for recognition, and text prompts for speech synthesis to the speech engine (), and by returning to the multimodal application () speech engine output in the form of recognized speech, semantic interpretation results, and digitized speech for voice prompts. The implementation of the voice interpreter () typically depends on the technology implementing the multimodal application (). The voice interpreter () of  may be implemented as a VoiceXML interpreter when the multimodal application () implements X+V. A VoiceXML interpreter is a software module of computer program instructions that accepts voice dialog instructions from a multimodal application, typically in the form of a VoiceXML <form> element. The voice dialog instructions include one or more grammars, data input elements, event handlers, and so on, that advise the VoiceXML interpreter how to administer voice input from a user and voice prompts and responses to be presented to a user. The VoiceXML interpreter administers such dialogs by processing the dialog instructions sequentially in accordance with a VoiceXML Form Interpretation Algorithm (\u2018FIA\u2019). When the multimodal application () is implemented according to SALT, the voice interpreter () may be implemented as a SALT interpreter. When the multimodal application () is implemented using Java, the voice interpreter () may be implemented using a VoiceXML interpreter that exposes a Java interface.","The multimodal application () of  includes a set of computer program instructions for record disambiguation according to embodiments of the present invention. The multimodal application () operates generally for record disambiguation according to embodiments of the present invention by: prompting a user to identify a particular record among a plurality of records; receiving, in response to the prompt, a voice utterance from the user (); determining that the voice utterance ambiguously identifies more than one of the plurality of records; generating a user interaction to disambiguate the records ambiguously identified by the voice utterance in dependence upon record attributes of the records ambiguously identified by the voice utterance; and selecting, for further processing, one of the records ambiguously identified by the voice utterance in dependence upon the user interaction.","A voice utterance represents a speech waveform spoken by a user. When the voice utterance specifies a word or phrase in a homophonic set, the multimodal application () is generally not capable of distinguishing which word in the homophonic set the user intended to reference with the voice utterance. Accordingly, when that voice utterance is used to identify records in a database, the multimodal application () ambiguously identifies more than one record based on the voice utterance. The multimodal application () operating according to embodiments of the present invention then further interacts with the user () to disambiguate the records ambiguously identified based on the voice utterance.","Each multimodal device () of  is an automated device, that is, automated computing machinery or a computer program running on an automated device, that is capable of accepting from users more than one mode of input, keyboard, mouse, stylus, and so on, including speech input\u2014and also rendering more than one mode of output, graphic, speech, and so on. A multimodal device is generally capable of accepting speech input from a user, digitizing the speech, and providing digitized speech to a speech engine for recognition. A multimodal device may be implemented, for example, as a voice-enabled browser on a laptop, a voice-enabled browser on a smart phone handset, an online game implemented with Java on a personal computer, and with other combinations of hardware and software as may occur to those of skill in the art. Because multimodal applications may be implemented in markup languages (X+V, SALT), object-oriented languages (Java, C++), procedural languages (the C programming language), and in other kinds of computer languages as may occur to those of skill in the art, this specification uses the term \u2018multimodal application\u2019 to refer to any software application, server-oriented or client-oriented, thin client or thick client, that administers more than one mode of input and more than one mode of output, typically including visual and speech modes.","The system of  includes several example multimodal devices:\n\n","Each of the example multimodal devices () in the system of  includes a microphone, an audio amplifier, a digital-to-analog converter, and a multimodal application capable of accepting from a user () speech for recognition (), digitizing the speech, and providing the digitized speech to a speech engine for recognition. The speech may be digitized according to industry standard codecs, including but not limited to those used for Distributed Speech Recognition as such. Methods for \u2018COding\/DECoding\u2019 speech are referred to as \u2018codecs.\u2019 The European Telecommunications Standards Institute (\u2018ETSI\u2019) provides several codecs for encoding speech for use in DSR, including, for example, the ETSI ES 201 108 DSR Front-end Codec, the ETSI ES 202 050 Advanced DSR Front-end Codec, the ETSI ES 202 211 Extended DSR Front-end Codec, and the ETSI ES 202 212 Extended Advanced DSR Front-end Codec. In standards such as RFC3557 entitled\n\n","As mentioned, a multimodal device according to embodiments of the present invention is capable of providing speech for recognition to a speech engine (). A speech engine is a functional module, typically a software module, although it may include specialized hardware also, that does the work of recognizing and generating or \u2018synthesizing\u2019 human speech. The speech engine implements speech recognition by use of a further module referred to in this specification as a ASR engine, and the speech engine carries out speech synthesis by use of a further module referred to in this specification as a text-to-speech (\u2018TTS\u2019) engine. As shown in , a speech engine () may be installed locally in the multimodal device () itself, or a speech engine () may be installed remotely with respect to the multimodal device, across a data communications network () in a voice server (). A multimodal device that itself contains its own speech engine is said to implement a \u2018thick client\u2019 or \u2018thick client,\u2019 because the thick client itself contains all the functionality needed to carry out speech recognition and speech synthesis\u2014through API calls to speech recognition and speech synthesis modules in the multimodal device itself with no need to send requests for speech recognition across a network and no need to receive synthesized speech across a network from a remote voice server. A multimodal device that does not contain its own speech engine is said to implement a \u2018thin client\u2019 because the thin client itself contains only a relatively thin layer of application software that obtains speech recognition and speech synthesis services from a voice server located remotely across a network from the thin client. For ease of explanation, only one () of the multimodal devices () in the system of  is shown with a speech engine (), but readers will recognize that any multimodal device may have a speech engine according to embodiments of the present invention.","As shown in , a speech engine () and a voice interpreter () may be installed locally in the multimodal device () itself, or a speech engine () and a voice interpreter () may be installed remotely with respect to the multimodal device, across a data communications network () in a voice server (). In a thick client architecture, a multimodal device () includes both its own speech engine () and its own voice interpreter (). The voice interpreter () exposes an API to the multimodal application () for use in providing speech recognition and speech synthesis for the multimodal application. The multimodal application provides, for example, dialog instructions, VoiceXML <form> elements, grammars, input elements, event handlers, and so on, through the API to the voice interpreter (), and the voice interpreter () administers the speech engine on behalf of the multimodal application. In the thick client architecture, a multimodal application, including for example, VoiceXML dialogs, is interpreted by a voice interpreter on the multimodal device. In the thin client architecture, a multimodal application, including for example VoiceXML dialogs, is interpreted by a voice interpreter on a voice server () located remotely across a data communications network () from the multimodal device running the multimodal application ().","In a thin client architecture, the speech engine () and the voice interpreter () are located remotely from the multimodal client device in a voice server (), the API for the voice interpreter is still implemented in the multimodal device, with the API modified to communicate voice dialog instructions, speech for recognition, and text and voice prompts to and from the voice interpreter on the voice server. For ease of explanation, only one () of the multimodal devices () in the system of  is shown with a voice interpreter (), but readers will recognize that any multimodal device may have a voice interpreter according to embodiments of the present invention.","The use of these three example multimodal devices () is for explanation only, not for limitation of the invention. Any automated computing machinery capable of accepting speech from a user, providing the speech digitized to a speech engine through a voice interpreter, and receiving and playing speech prompts and responses from the voice interpreter may be improved to function as a multimodal device for adjusting a speech engine based on background noise according to embodiments of the present invention.","The system of  also includes a voice server () which is connected to data communications network () through wireline connection (). The voice server () is a computer that runs a speech engine (). The voice server () provides voice recognition services for multimodal devices by accepting requests for speech recognition and returning text representing recognized speech. Voice server () also provides speech synthesis, text to speech (\u2018TTS\u2019) conversion, for voice prompts and voice responses () to user input in multimodal applications such as, for example, X+V applications, SALT applications, or Java voice applications.","The system of  includes a data communications network () that connects the multimodal devices () and the voice server () for data communications. A data communications network for record disambiguation in a multimodal application operating on a multimodal device according to embodiments of the present invention is a data communications network composed of a plurality of computers that function as data communications routers connected for data communications with packet switching protocols. Such a data communications network may be implemented with optical connections, wireline connections, or with wireless connections. Such a data communications network may include intranets, internets, local area data communications networks (\u2018LANs\u2019), and wide area data communications networks (\u2018WANs\u2019). Such a data communications network may implement, for example:\n\n","The system of  includes a web server () connected for data communications through wireline connection () to network () and therefore to the multimodal devices (). The web server () may be any server that provides to client devices markup documents that compose multimodal applications. The web server () typically provides such markup documents via a data communications protocol, HTTP, HDTP, WAP, or the like. That is, although the term \u2018web\u2019 is used to described the web server generally in this specification, there is no limitation of data communications between multimodal devices and the web server to HTTP alone. The markup documents also may be implemented in any markup language that supports non-speech display elements, data entry elements, and speech elements for identifying which speech to recognize and which words to speak, grammars, form elements, and the like, including, for example, X+V and SALT. A multimodal application in a multimodal device then, upon receiving from the web sever () a markup document as part of a multimodal application, may execute speech elements by use of a voice interpreter () and speech engine () in the multimodal device itself or by use of a voice interpreter () and speech engine () located remotely from the multimodal device in a voice server ().","The arrangement of the multimodal devices (), the web server (), the voice server (), and the data communications network () making up the exemplary system illustrated in  are for explanation, not for limitation. Data processing systems useful for record disambiguation in a multimodal application operating on a multimodal device according to various embodiments of the present invention may include additional servers, routers, other devices, and peer-to-peer architectures, not shown in , as will occur to those of skill in the art. Data communications networks in such data processing systems may support many data communications protocols in addition to those noted above. Various embodiments of the present invention may be implemented on a variety of hardware platforms in addition to those illustrated in .","Record disambiguation in a multimodal application operating on a multimodal device according to embodiments of the present invention in a thin client architecture may be implemented with one or more voice servers, computers, that is, automated computing machinery, that provide speech recognition and speech synthesis. For further explanation, therefore,  sets forth a block diagram of automated computing machinery comprising an example of a computer useful as a voice server () in record disambiguation in a multimodal application operating on a multimodal device according to embodiments of the present invention. The voice server () of  includes at least one computer processor () or \u2018CPU\u2019 as well as random access memory () (\u2018RAM\u2019) which is connected through a high speed memory bus () and bus adapter () to processor () and to other components of the voice server.","Stored in RAM () is a voice server application (), a module of computer program instructions capable of operating a voice server in a system that is configured to carry out record disambiguation in a multimodal application operating on a multimodal device according to embodiments of the present invention. Voice server application () provides voice recognition services for multimodal devices by accepting requests for speech recognition and returning speech recognition results, including text representing recognized speech, text for use as variable values in dialogs, and text as string representations of scripts for semantic interpretation. Voice server application () also includes computer program instructions that provide text-to-speech (\u2018TTS\u2019) conversion for voice prompts and voice responses to user input in multimodal applications such as, for example, X+V applications, SALT applications, or Java Speech applications.","Voice server application () may be implemented as a web server, implemented in Java, C++, or another language, that supports X+V, SALT, VoiceXML, or other multimodal languages, by providing responses to HTTP requests from X+V clients, SALT clients, Java Speech clients, or other multimodal clients. Voice server application () may, for a further example, be implemented as a Java server that runs on a Java Virtual Machine and supports a Java voice framework by providing responses to HTTP requests from Java client applications running on multimodal devices. And voice server applications that support record disambiguation in a multimodal application operating on a multimodal device may be implemented in other ways as may occur to those of skill in the art, and all such ways are well within the scope of the present invention.","Also stored in RAM is a voice interpreter (), a module of computer program instructions that supports the voice mode of user interaction with a multimodal application operating on a multimodal device. The voice interpreter () provides speech engine input such as grammars, speech for recognition, and text prompts for speech synthesis to the speech engine () and returns to the multimodal application speech engine output in the form of recognized speech, semantic interpretation results, and digitized speech for voice prompts. Input to voice interpreter () may originate, for example, from VoiceXML clients running remotely on multimodal devices, from X+V clients running remotely on multimodal devices, from SALT clients running on multimodal devices, or from Java client applications running remotely on multimodal devices. In this example, voice interpreter () interprets and executes VoiceXML segments representing voice dialog instructions received from remote multimodal devices and provided to voice interpreter () through voice server application ().","When implemented in X+V, a multimodal application in a thin client architecture may provide voice dialog instructions, VoiceXML segments, VoiceXML <form> elements, and the like, to voice interpreter () through data communications across a network with the multimodal application. The voice dialog instructions include one or more grammars, data input elements, event handlers, and so on, that advise the voice interpreter how to administer voice input from a user and voice prompts and responses to be presented to a user. The voice interpreter () administers such dialogs by processing the dialog instructions sequentially in accordance with a VoiceXML Form Interpretation Algorithm (\u2018FIA\u2019). The voice interpreter () interprets VoiceXML dialogs provided to the voice interpreter () by a multimodal application.","To provide voice services to a multimodal application, the voice server () in this example includes a speech engine (). The speech engine is a functional module, typically a software module, although it may include specialized hardware also, that does the work of recognizing and generating human speech. The speech engine () includes an automated speech recognition (\u2018ASR\u2019) engine () for speech recognition and a text-to-speech (\u2018TTS\u2019) engine () for generating speech. The speech engine also includes grammars (), lexicons (), and language-specific acoustic models (). Each lexicon () and language-specific acoustic model () may be associated with a separate language in a configuration parameter repository ().","The acoustic models () associate speech waveform data representing recorded pronunciations of speech with textual representations of those pronunciations, which are referred to as \u2018phonemes.\u2019 The speech waveform data may be implemented as a Speech Feature Vector (\u2018SFV\u2019) that may be represented, for example, by the first twelve or thirteen Fourier or frequency domain components of a sample of digitized speech waveform. Accordingly, the acoustic models () may be implemented as data structures or tables in a database, for example, that associates these SFVs with phonemes representing, to the extent that it is practically feasible to do so, all pronunciations of all the words in various human languages, each language having a separate acoustic model (). The lexicons () are associations of words in text form with phonemes representing pronunciations of each word; the lexicon effectively identifies words that are capable of recognition by an ASR engine. Each language has a separate lexicon (). Also stored in RAM () is a Text To Speech (\u2018TTS\u2019) Engine (), a module of computer program instructions that accepts text as input and returns the same text in the form of digitally encoded speech, for use in providing speech as prompts for and responses to users of multimodal systems.","The grammars () communicate to the ASR engine () the words and sequences of words that currently may be recognized. For precise understanding, distinguish the purpose of the grammar and the purpose of the lexicon. The lexicon associates with phonemes all the words that the ASR engine can recognize. The grammar communicates the words currently eligible for recognition. The set of words currently eligible for recognition and the set of words capable of recognition may or may not be the same.","Grammars for use in record disambiguation in a multimodal application operating on a multimodal device according to embodiments of the present invention may be expressed in any format supported by any ASR engine, including, for example, the Java Speech Grammar Format (\u2018JSGF\u2019), the format of the W3C Speech Recognition Grammar Specification (\u2018SRGS\u2019), the Augmented Backus-Naur Format (\u2018ABNF\u2019) from the IETF's RFC2234, in the form of a stochastic grammar as described in the W3C's Stochastic Language Models (N-Gram) Specification, and in other grammar formats as may occur to those of skill in the art. Grammars typically operate as elements of dialogs, such as, for example, a VoiceXML <menu> or an X+V<form>. A grammar's definition may be expressed in-line in a dialog. Or the grammar may be implemented externally in a separate grammar document and referenced from with a dialog with a URI. Here is an example of a grammar expressed in JSFG:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0072"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"left"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"<grammar scope=\u201cdialog\u201d ><![CDATA["},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003#JSGF V1.0;"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003grammar command;"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003<command> = [remind me to] call | phone | telephone <name>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003<when>;"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003<name> = bob | martha | joe | pete | chris | john | artoush | tom;"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003<when> = today | this afternoon | tomorrow | next week;"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003]]>"},{"entry":"<\/grammar>"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"In this example, the elements named <command>, <name>, and <when> are rules of the grammar. Rules are a combination of a rulename and an expansion of a rule that advises an ASR engine or a voice interpreter which words presently can be recognized. In this example, expansion includes conjunction and disjunction, and the vertical bars \u2018|\u2019 mean \u2018or.\u2019 An ASR engine or a voice interpreter processes the rules in sequence, first <command>, then <name>, then <when>. The <command> rule accepts for recognition \u2018call\u2019 or \u2018phone\u2019 or \u2018telephone\u2019 plus, that is, in conjunction with, whatever is returned from the <name> rule and the <when> rule.

ASR engine () is a module of computer program instructions, also stored in RAM in this example. In carrying out automated speech recognition, the ASR engine receives speech for recognition in the form of at least one digitized word and uses frequency components of the digitized word to derive a SFV for the digitized word. The ASR engine can use the SFV to infer phonemes for the word from the language-specific acoustic model (). The ASR engine then uses the phonemes to find the word in the lexicon ().","Also stored in RAM () is an operating system ().

In addition, non-volatile computer memory may be implemented for a voice server as an optical disk drive, electrically erasable programmable read-only memory (so-called \u2018EEPROM\u2019 or \u2018Flash\u2019 memory), RAM drives, and so on, as will occur to those of skill in the art.","The example voice server of  includes one or more input\/output (\u2018I\/O\u2019) adapters (). I\/O adapters in voice servers implement user-oriented input\/output through, for example, software drivers and computer hardware for controlling output to display devices such as computer display screens, as well as user input from user input devices () such as keyboards and mice. The example voice server of  includes a video adapter (), which is an example of an I\/O adapter specially designed for graphic output to a display device () such as a display screen or computer monitor. Video adapter () is connected to processor () through a high speed video bus (), bus adapter (), and the front side bus (), which is also a high speed bus.","The exemplary voice server () of  includes a communications adapter () for data communications with other computers () and for data communications with a data communications network (). Such data communications may be carried out serially through RS-232 connections, through external buses such as a Universal Serial Bus (\u2018USB\u2019), through data communications data communications networks such as IP data communications networks, and in other ways as will occur to those of skill in the art. Communications adapters implement the hardware level of data communications through which one computer sends data communications to another computer, directly or through a data communications network. Examples of communications adapters useful for record disambiguation in a multimodal application operating on a multimodal device according to embodiments of the present invention include modems for wired dial-up communications, Ethernet (IEEE 802.3) adapters for wired data communications network communications, and 802.11 adapters for wireless data communications network communications.","For further explanation,  sets forth a functional block diagram of exemplary apparatus for record disambiguation in a multimodal application () operating on a multimodal device () in a thin client architecture according to embodiments of the present invention. The example multimodal device () of  includes a sound card (), which is an example of an I\/O adapter specially designed for accepting analog audio signals from a microphone () and converting the audio analog signals to digital form for further processing by a codec ().","In some embodiments, the multimodal application () of  may include computer program instructions implemented in machine code that may be scheduled for execution directly by an operating system on a processor of the multimodal device (). For example, the multimodal application () may be implemented as a compiled version of program written in C++. In some other embodiments in which the multimodal application () is implemented in higher level, non-machine language, a multimodal execution environment () may support the multimodal application () by translating the multimodal application () into platform specific, machine code directly executable on the processors of the multimodal device (), performing memory management for the multimodal application () during execution, controlling access to platform hardware, and so on. The implementation of the multimodal execution environment () typically depends on the implementation of the multimodal application (). When the multimodal application () is implemented using X+V or SALT tags, then the multimodal execution environment may be implemented as a multimodal browser. When the multimodal application () is implemented using Java, then the multimodal execution environment may be implemented as a Java Virtual Machine.","The multimodal application () of  includes a set of computer program instructions for record disambiguation according to embodiments of the present invention. The multimodal application () operates generally for record disambiguation according to embodiments of the present invention by: prompting a user to identify a particular record among a plurality of records; receiving, in response to the prompt, a voice utterance from the user (); determining that the voice utterance ambiguously identifies more than one of the plurality of records; generating a user interaction to disambiguate the records ambiguously identified by the voice utterance in dependence upon record attributes of the records ambiguously identified by the voice utterance; and selecting, for further processing, one of the records ambiguously identified by the voice utterance in dependence upon the user interaction.","The example of  also includes a voice server () having installed upon it a voice server application (), a voice interpreter (), and a speech engine (). The speech engine () includes an ASR engine (), grammars (), lexicons (), acoustic models (), and a TTS engine (). The voice interpreter () of  is implemented as a VoiceXML interpreter that interprets and executes VoiceXML dialog instructions received from the multimodal application and provided to voice interpreter () through voice server application (). VoiceXML input to the voice interpreter () may originate from the multimodal application () implemented as an X+V client running remotely on the multimodal device (). As noted above, the multimodal application () also may be implemented as a Java client application running remotely on the multimedia device (), a SALT application running remotely on the multimedia device (), and in other ways as may occur to those of skill in the art.","In the example of , the voice server () connects to the multimodal device () for data communication by a VoIP connection () through a data communications network (). VoIP stands for \u2018Voice Over Internet Protocol,\u2019 a generic term for routing speech over an IP-based data communications network. The speech data flows over a general-purpose packet-switched data communications network, instead of traditional dedicated, circuit-switched voice transmission lines. Protocols used to carry voice signals over the IP data communications network are commonly referred to as \u2018Voice over IP\u2019 or \u2018VoIP\u2019 protocols. VoIP traffic may be deployed on any IP data communications network, including data communications networks lacking a connection to the rest of the Internet, for instance on a private building-wide local area data communications network or \u2018LAN.\u2019","Many protocols are used to effect VoIP. The two most popular types of VoIP are effected with the IETF's Session Initiation Protocol (\u2018SIP\u2019) and the ITU's protocol known as \u2018H.323.\u2019 SIP clients use TCP and UDP port 5060 to connect to SIP servers. SIP itself is used to set up and tear down calls for speech transmission. VoIP with SIP then uses RTP for transmitting the actual encoded speech. Similarly, H.323 is an umbrella recommendation from the standards branch of the International Telecommunications Union that defines protocols to provide audio-visual communication sessions on any packet data communications network.","The apparatus of  operate in a manner that is similar to the operation of the system of  described above. Multimodal application () is a user-level, multimodal, client-side computer program that presents a voice interface to user (), provides audio prompts and responses () and accepts input speech for recognition (). Multimodal application () provides a speech interface through which a user may provide oral speech for recognition through microphone () and have the speech digitized through an audio amplifier () and a coder\/decoder (\u2018codec\u2019) () of a sound card () and provide the digitized speech for recognition to ASR engine (). Multimodal application () then packages the digitized speech in a recognition request message according to a VoIP protocol, and transmits the speech to voice server () through the VoIP connection () on the network ().","Voice server application () provides voice recognition services for multimodal devices by accepting dialog instructions, VoiceXML segments, and returning speech recognition results, including text representing recognized speech, text for use as variable values in dialogs, and output from execution of semantic interpretation scripts as well as voice prompts. Voice server application () supports text-to-speech (\u2018TTS\u2019) conversion for voice prompts and voice responses to user input in multimodal applications such as, for example, X+V applications, SALT applications, or Java Speech applications.","The voice server application () receives speech for recognition from a user and passes the speech through API calls to voice interpreter () which in turn uses an ASR engine () for speech recognition. The ASR engine receives digitized speech for recognition, uses frequency components of the digitized speech to derive an SFV, uses the SFV to infer phonemes for the word from the language-specific acoustic model (), and uses the phonemes to find the speech in the lexicon (). The ASR engine then compares speech found as words in the lexicon to words in a grammar () to determine whether words or phrases in speech are recognized by the ASR engine.","The multimodal application () is operatively coupled to the speech engine (). In this example, the operative coupling between the multimodal application () and the speech engine () is implemented with a VoIP connection () through a voice services module (), then through the voice server application () and the voice interpreter (). Depending on whether the multimodal application is implemented in X+V, Java, or SALT, the voice interpreter () may be implemented using a VoiceXML interpreter, a VoiceXML interpreter exposing a Java interface, a SALT interpreter, or any other implementation as will occur to those of skill in the art. The voice services module () is a thin layer of functionality, a module of computer program instructions, that presents an API () for use by an application level program in providing dialog instructions and speech for recognition to a voice server application () and receiving in response voice prompts and other responses. In this example, application level programs are represented by multimodal application () and the multimodal execution environment ().","The voice services module () provides data communications services through the VoIP connection and the voice server application () between the multimodal device () and the voice interpreter (). The API () of  may be the same API presented to applications by a voice interpreter when the voice interpreter is installed on the multimodal device in a thick client architecture. So from the point of view of an application calling the API (), the application is calling the VoiceXML interpreter directly. The data communications functions of the voice services module () are transparent to applications that call the API (). At the application level, calls to the API () may be issued from the multimodal browser (), which provides an execution environment for the multimodal application () when the multimodal application is implemented with X+V. And calls to the API () may be issued from the JVM (), which provides an execution environment for the multimodal application () when the multimodal application is implemented with Java.","Record disambiguation in a multimodal application operating on a multimodal device according to embodiments of the present invention in thick client architectures is generally implemented with multimodal devices, that is, automated computing machinery or computers. In the system of , for example, all the multimodal devices () are implemented to some extent at least as computers. For further explanation, therefore,  sets forth a block diagram of automated computing machinery comprising an example of a computer useful as a multimodal device () in record disambiguation in a multimodal application () operating on the multimodal device () according to embodiments of the present invention. In a multimodal device implementing a thick client architecture as illustrated in , the multimodal device () has no connection to a remote voice server containing a voice interpreter and a speech engine. All the components needed for speech synthesis and voice recognition in record disambiguation in a multimodal application operating on a multimodal device according to embodiments of the present invention are installed or embedded in the multimodal device itself.","The example multimodal device () of  includes several components that are structured and operate similarly to the components of the voice server, having the same drawing reference numbers, as described above with reference to : at least one computer processor (), frontside bus (), RAM (), high speed memory bus (), bus adapter (), video adapter (), video bus (), expansion bus (), communications adapter (), I\/O adapter (), disk drive adapter (), an operating system (), a voice interpreter (), a speech engine (), and so on. As in the system of , the speech engine () in the multimodal device of  includes an ASR engine (), grammars (), lexicons (), acoustic models (), and a TTS engine (). The voice interpreter () may be implemented as a VoiceXML interpreter that administers dialogs by processing the dialog instructions sequentially in accordance with a VoiceXML Form Interpretation Algorithm (\u2018FIA\u2019).","The speech engine () in this kind of embodiment, a thick client architecture, often is implemented as an embedded module in a small form factor device such as a handheld device, a mobile phone, PDA, and the like. An example of an embedded speech engine that may be improved for record disambiguation in a multimodal application operating on a multimodal device according to embodiments of the present invention is IBM's Embedded ViaVoice Enterprise. The example multimodal device of  also includes a sound card (), which is an example of an I\/O adapter specially designed for accepting analog audio signals from a microphone () and converting the audio analog signals to digital form for further processing by a codec (). The sound card () is connected to processor () through expansion bus (), bus adapter (), and front side bus ().","Also stored in RAM () in this example is a multimodal application (), a module of computer program instructions capable of operating a multimodal device as an apparatus that supports multiple modes of user interaction, including a voice mode and one or more non-voice modes. The multimodal application () implements speech recognition by accepting speech for recognition from a user and sending the speech for recognition through API calls to the ASR engine (). The multimodal application () implements speech synthesis generally by sending words to be used as prompts for a user to the TTS engine (). As an example of thick client architecture, the multimodal application () in this example does not send speech for recognition across a network to a voice server for recognition, and the multimodal application () in this example does not receive synthesized speech, TTS prompts and responses, across a network from a voice server. All grammar processing, voice recognition, and text to speech conversion in this example is performed in an embedded fashion in the multimodal device () itself.","More particularly, multimodal application () in this example is a user-level, multimodal, client-side computer program that provides a speech interface through which a user may provide oral speech for recognition through microphone (), have the speech digitized through an audio amplifier () and a coder\/decoder (\u2018codec\u2019) () of a sound card () and provide the digitized speech for recognition to ASR engine (). The multimodal application () may be implemented as a set or sequence of X+V documents executing in a multimodal execution environment () implemented as a multimodal browser or microbrowser that passes VoiceXML grammars and digitized speech by calls through an API () directly to an embedded voice interpreter () for processing. The embedded voice interpreter () may in turn issue requests for speech recognition through API calls directly to the embedded ASR engine (). Multimodal application () also can provide speech synthesis, TTS conversion, by API calls to the embedded TTS engine () for voice prompts and voice responses to user input.","In a further class of exemplary embodiments, the multimodal application () may be implemented as a Java voice application that executes in a multimodal execution environment () implemented as a Java Virtual Machine and issues calls through an API of the voice interpreter () for speech recognition and speech synthesis services. In further exemplary embodiments, the multimodal application () may be implemented as a set or sequence of SALT documents executed in a multimodal execution environment () implemented as a multimodal browser or microbrowser that issues calls through an API of the voice interpreter () for speech recognition and speech synthesis services. In addition to X+V, SALT, and Java implementations, multimodal application () may be implemented in other technologies as will occur to those of skill in the art, and all such implementations are well within the scope of the present invention.","The multimodal application () of  includes a set of computer program instructions for record disambiguation according to embodiments of the present invention. The multimodal application () operates generally for record disambiguation according to embodiments of the present invention by: prompting a user to identify a particular record among a plurality of records; receiving, in response to the prompt, a voice utterance from the user; determining that the voice utterance ambiguously identifies more than one of the plurality of records; generating a user interaction to disambiguate the records ambiguously identified by the voice utterance in dependence upon record attributes of the records ambiguously identified by the voice utterance; and selecting, for further processing, one of the records ambiguously identified by the voice utterance in dependence upon the user interaction.","The multimodal application () of  is operatively coupled to the speech engine (). In this example, the operative coupling between the multimodal application and the speech engine () is implemented through the voice interpreter (). Depending on whether the multimodal application is implemented in X+V, Java, or SALT, the voice interpreter () may be implemented as a VoiceXML interpreter, a VoiceXML interpreter exposing a Java interface, or SALT interpreter. When the multimodal application () is implemented in X+V, the operative coupling is effected through the multimodal execution environment (), which provides an operating environment and an interpreter for the X+V application, and then through a VoiceXML interpreter, which passes grammars and voice utterances for recognition to the speech engine () through the voice interpreter (). When the multimodal application () is implemented in Java Speech, the multimodal execution environment () is implemented as a Java Virtual Machine, which provides an operating environment for the Java application and the voice interpreter (), which passes grammars and voice utterances for recognition to the speech engine (). When the multimodal application () is implemented in SALT, the multimodal execution environment () is implemented as a multimodal browser, which provides an operating environment and an interpreter for the X+V application, and then through a SALT interpreter, which passes grammars and voice utterances for recognition to the speech engine ().","The multimodal application () in this example, running on a multimodal device () that contains its own voice interpreter () and its own speech engine () with no network or VoIP connection to a remote voice server containing a remote VoiceXML interpreter or a remote speech engine, is an example of a so-called \u2018thick client architecture,\u2019 so-called because all of the functionality for processing voice mode interactions between a user and the multimodal application is implemented on the multimodal device itself.","For further explanation,  sets forth a flow chart illustrating an exemplary method of record disambiguation in a multimodal application operating on a multimodal device according to embodiments of the present invention. The multimodal device described with reference to  supports multiple modes of interaction, including at least a voice mode and a visual mode. The voice mode of interaction may be implemented using speakers or a microphone of the multimodal device along with a sound card to provide an interface for the speakers or the microphone with the remaining components of the device. The visual mode of interaction may be implemented using a display for the multimodal device on which the device may render a graphical user interface (\u2018GUI\u2019) along with a graphic card that provides an interface for the display with the other components of the multimodal device.","The method of  includes prompting (), by the multimodal application (), a user to identify a particular record among a plurality of records. The multimodal application () may request an identifier for a particular record among a plurality of records to further process that particular record. The type of further processing typically depends on the specific implementation of the multimodal application (). For example, when the multimodal application is implemented as personal information management (\u2018PIM\u2019) software, the multimodal application may request that the user identify a record representing the contact information for a particular individual among many other similar records so that the PIM can create a blank email to the particular individual into which the user can type. For another example, when the multimodal application is implemented as a personal finance application, the multimodal application may request that the user identify a record representing a particular financial transaction for display to the user.","The multimodal application () may prompt () a user to identify a particular record among a plurality of records according to the method of  by rendering a prompt () to the user through the voice mode or visual mode of user interaction. The prompt () of  represent information provided to the user that requests the user to providing information to the multimodal device through some user interaction. The multimodal application () may render the prompt through the voice mode by synthesizing text into speech using a TTS engine and playing the synthesized speech through a speaker for the multimodal device. The multimodal device may render the prompt () through the visual mode of user interaction by displaying text or graphics to the user using a GUI on the multimodal device's display.","For further explanation,  sets forth a line drawing illustrating an exemplary GUI () useful in prompting, by a multimodal application, a user to identify a particular record among a plurality of records () according to embodiments of the present invention. The exemplary multimodal application of  is an application for contacting an individual in an employee directory. Each record in the plurality of records () represents the contact information for a single employee in the company. The GUI () of  renders a prompt () in an exemplary multimodal application that requests the user to identify an employee by the employee's name. The prompt () of  is implemented using the text \u201cWho do you want to contact?\u201d Because the exemplary application is a multimodal application, the multimodal application may play a speech representation of the prompt () through the multimodal device's speakers.","To generate the GUI () and prompt the user using a speech representation and a visual representation of the prompt ()
