In one conventional approach to AC to DC power conversion, an AC to DC converter includes a diode rectifier with a pulse-width-modulated boost stage for converting the input AC voltage to an intermediate stiff DC voltage and for shaping the input AC current to have unity power factor. The intermediate stiff DC voltage is further processed by a transformer-isolated DC-DC converter with suitable gain to provide a DC output voltage to the load. This conventional approach often requires large filters and has poor efficiency due to multiple stages of power conversion and hard-switching of the semiconductor switches.","Hence, there is a need for an improved system to address the aforementioned issues.","In one embodiment, an alternating current to direct current (AC to DC) power conversion system is provided.

The method includes converting an input AC voltage to an initial pulsating DC voltage. The method also includes converting the initial pulsating DC voltage to a converted AC voltage. The method further includes splitting the converted AC voltage into a plurality of portions of the converted AC voltage.
