title: System and method for calculating the directivity index of a passive acoustic array
abstract: A software system and method is presented that calculates the sensor directivity at all spatial angles, and stores these values in a two dimensional matrix. These values are then used as additional “weighting” coefficients in the equation for the pressure detected by an array of directive sensors. The azimuthal and polar angles of a particular sensor normal vector are used to “rotate” the sensor directivity matrix to account for the angular orientation of each sensor within the array. The software system receives as input sensor and array geometry, shading functions, sensor shape, array structure baffling, steering, and shading. A sensor can have the shape of a point, line, plane, volume, baffled ring, or circular plane piston. The sensors within the array can either be baffled by the array structure or retain their free field directivity response, and array as a whole can have steering or no steering.

In particular, the present invention is directed to a system and method for calculating the directivity index of a passive acoustic array with directional sensors in an isotropic noise field, and to provide an efficient way to create, modify, and model any array geometry for the purposes of determining the directivity index of the array as a function of array geometry, sensor geometry, sensor to sensor spacing, and number of sensors.","(2) Description of the Prior Art","Passive acoustic arrays are a necessary component of an underwater vehicle's sonar system. In order to better develop the technology of passive acoustic arrays, it is necessary to develop a system and method for calculating the directivity index of an acoustic array. There are several prior art methods that calculate the directivity index of an array of sensors. The inputs to these prior art methods include the geometry of the array, the number of sensors, shading coefficients for each sensor, sound speed of the operating medium, and the array steering. The prior art methods are limited to array geometries with simple shapes such as a line, plane, cylinder, or sphere, and capable of addressing arrays with point receiver sensors only. In addition, prior art methods calculate the directivity of each sensor within the array as frequency independent and limited to either an omni-directional or cosine function dipole response. What is needed is a system and method for calculating the directivity index of a passive acoustic array that can factor in complex sensor and array geometries and can provide a directivity index that is also frequency dependant and not limited to either an omni-directional or cosine function dipole response.","It is a general purpose and object of the present invention to disclose a system and method for calculating the directivity index of a passive acoustic array that can factor in complex sensor and array geometries.","It is a further object of the present invention to disclose a system and method for calculating the directivity index of a passive acoustic array that is also frequency dependant.","It is a further object of the present invention to disclose a system and method for calculating the directivity index of a passive acoustic array that is not limited to either an omni-directional or cosine function dipole response.","The above objects are accomplished with the present invention by a software system and method that calculates the sensor directivity at all spatial angles, and stores these values in a two dimensional matrix. These values are then used as additional \u201cweighting\u201d coefficients in the equation for the pressure detected by an array of directive sensors. The azimuthal and polar angles of a particular sensor normal vector are used to \u201crotate\u201d the sensor directivity matrix to account for the angular orientation of each sensor within the array. The software system receives as input sensor and array geometry, shading functions, sensor shape, array structure baffling, steering, and shading. A sensor can have the shape of a point, line, plane, volume, baffled ring, or circular plane piston.","The sensors within the array can either be baffled by the array structure or retain their free field directivity response, and array as a whole can have steering or no steering.","Referring initially to , there is shown a flow chart  which represents the steps of the software method to calculate the directivity index of an array of acoustic sensors. It is assumed that the array is operating in an ideal isotropic noise field with a perfectly correlated signal relative to an omni-directional receiver. The first step is to create a virtual model of the sensor array. In a preferred embodiment, the virtual model of the sensor array is generated by a computer program using the following equation for the pressure detected by an array of directive sensors A:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"msub":{"mi":["A","a"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mrow":[{"msub":[{"mi":["\u03b8","a"]},{"mi":["\u03b8","s"]}],"mo":"-"},{"msub":[{"mi":["\u03d5","a"]},{"mi":["\u03d5","s"]}],"mo":"-"}],"mo":","}}},{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":"m","mo":"=","mn":"1"},"mi":"M"},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mrow":{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["H","e"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":["\u03b8","em"]},{"mi":["\u03d5","em"]}],"mo":","}}},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"msub":{"mi":["w","m"]},"msup":{"mi":"\u2147","mrow":{"mi":"\u2148","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mrow":{"mrow":[{"msub":{"mi":["X","m"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":["k","x"]},{"mi":["k","xs"]}],"mo":"-"}}},{"msub":{"mi":["Y","m"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":["k","y"]},{"mi":["k","ys"]}],"mo":"-"}}},{"msub":{"mi":["Z","m"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":["k","s"]},{"mi":["k","zs"]}],"mo":"-"}}}],"mo":["+","+"]}}}}}}],"mo":"="}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"1"}}]}}}},"br":{},"sub":["a ","a ","s ","s ","e ","m ","m","m","m "],"figref":"FIG. 2","sup":["th ","th "]},"The term His dependant on the azimuthal and polar angles of the msensor with respect to the array's coordinate system.

The primary objective when defining the geometry of the model is to have the sensors properly oriented in the array. In the present system, the geometry of the model is defined using the coordinate systems of the sensor and the array. Both coordinate systems must be considered simultaneously to obtain proper alignment of the sensors within the array. The sensor and array coordinate systems are shown in . Lowercase labels and the subscript \u201ce\u201d are used to signify the sensor's coordinate system and its variables; uppercase labels and the subscript \u201ca\u201d signify the array's coordinate system and its variables.","Proper orientation of the sensors within the array depends on two conditions: the direction of the sensor's maximum response axis (MRA) within the sensor coordinate system and the alignment of the array's axis within the coordinate system. When modeling sensors with omni-directional point receivers, the MRA of the sensor must be directed along the x-axis of the sensor's coordinate system. For all other sensor types, including sensors with cosine function directivity, baffled rings, and circular plane pistons, the present invention automatically directs the sensor's MRA along the x-axis.","The alignment of the array's axis within the array's coordinate system depends on the orientation of the sensor. If the x-zplane of the sensor is parallel to the axis of the array, the axis should be collinear with the Z-axis of the array's coordinate system. If the x-yplane of the sensor is parallel to the axis of the array, the array's axis must be collinear with either the X or Y-axis of the array's coordinate system. Examples of a properly aligned array axis for two possible orthogonal orientations of a baffled ring within an array are shown in and . Note that the MRA of the baffled ring in each figure is directed along the x-axis.","The next step in the method to calculate the directivity index requires defining the coordinate system parameters. In a preferred embodiment, the user enters the sensor and array geometries into the virtual model using both a graphical user interface and external data files such as spreadsheet files. The graphical user interface is used to define the sensor's parameters, but only for sensors with cosine-function directivity, baffled rings, and circular plane pistons, not for sensors modeled with omni-directional point receivers. An external sensor data file is necessary when a sensor is modeled with omni-directional point receivers. The graphical user interface is also not used to define the array geometry. A required array data file is used to define the geometry of the array.","To model sensors with omni-directional point receivers, the sensor data file must contain the geometric spacing and shading values of each point receiver in a matrix or spreadsheet format with rows and columns. The program reads only the first four columns of the sensor data file. All other columns may be used for computational space. The first three columns list the x-, y-, and z-coordinates of all the point receivers; the fourth column contains the shading coefficient of each point receiver. When every sensor within the array is omni-directional, H(\u03b8, \u03c6)=1 at all spatial angles for every sensor and equation (1) becomes the simplified case for an array of omni-directional point receivers.","The array data file is a required file that contains array parameters, such as the geometric spacing, normal vector angles, and shading coefficients for all sensors within the array. The array data is arranged in a matrix or spreadsheet format with rows and columns. The program reads only the first six columns of the array data file. The first three columns list the X-, Y-, and Z-coordinates of all the sensors. The fourth and fifth columns contain the azimuthal and polar angles, respectively, of the normal vector for each sensor. The sixth column contains the shading coefficient of each sensor.","The azimuthal and polar angles of a sensor's normal vector have defined ranges. These are defined using coordinate systems for both the sensor and the array. The angular position of the sensor's normal vector within the array's coordinate system is relative to its position within the sensor 's coordinate system. The range of the normal vector azimuthal angle within the array's coordinate system is 0\u00b0 to 180\u00b0. The range of the normal vector polar angle within the array's coordinate system is \u221290\u00b0 to 90\u00b0. The azimuthal and polar angles of the sensor's normal vector position are shown in . The variable \u03b8is the azimuthal angle of the sensor's normal vector, and \u03c6is the polar angle of the sensor's normal vector.","After defining the array coordinate system parameters and the sensor coordinate system parameters for omni-directional point receiver sensors, the next steps involve defining sensor coordinate system parameters for sensors that are not omni-directional point receiver sensors. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, sensor coordinate system parameter data for sensors that are not omni-directional point receivers sensors are defined using a graphical user interface. A preferred embodiment of the graphical user interface for the present invention is illustrated in . The system user can enter the name of the input file containing the array data or use the Browse button at the top of the graphical user interface screen to select the file name. The user can then use the remaining graphical user interface options to define the type of sensor used in the array, the operational data of the array, the frequencies of interest, and the type of DI calculation","The SENSOR DATA section of the graphical user interface is illustrated in . It contains the options for defining the directivity of the sensor used in the array. The sensor can either be baffled by the array structure or retain its free-field directivity response. If the sensor is baffled by the array structure, the user should select the Baffled by the array option on the user interface. If the behavior of the sensor within the array is the same as it is within the free field, the user should select the Not Baffled option.","There are four options for modeling sensor directivity: (1) as a single sensor modeled with omni-directional point receivers, (2) as a single sensor with cosine function directivity, (3) as a single baffled ring, or (4) as a single circular plane piston.","If the Sensor with Omni-Directional Point Receivers option is selected, no further user action is necessary.
