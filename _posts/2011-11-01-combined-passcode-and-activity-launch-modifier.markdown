{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The present disclosure relates generally to methods and systems for unlocking electronic devices.","Passwords may be used in many situations to authenticate a user before using a portion of an electronic device. Situations requiring authentication may include the ability to access or use a computer, mobile phone, tablet device, PDA (Personal Digital Assistant), or any other device. Authentication may also enable access to a physical location, or allow use of a credit\/debit card or similar instrument. Passwords are typically alpha-numeric strings or sequences entered on a keyboard. However, with the advent of touch sensitive input devices, graphical authentication systems are also available. For example, a user may have to align icons on a display or touch certain images in a particular order in order to authenticate.","There are many actions that users repeat frequently on their devices, such as macros within an application. Likewise, there are other actions that are not used commonly due to the amount of time or effort to access the actions. Examples of actions repeated frequently include entering a BBM (Blackberry Messager\u2122) conversation with a particular person, checking a particular website, making a phone call and sending an email. Examples of actions that may not be used as frequently as desired due to the time or effort involved might include taking a picture, recording a voice note and opening a document stored on the electronic device. Today these actions can be tedious because of the traditional access steps of unlock\/wakeup, enter password, open application, and activate the action within the application.","Providing shortcuts for specific actions outside of a password is known. However shortcuts can create security holes. By giving access to an application outside a security screen there is a risk that the devices data can be accessed or unlocked through the application. In some situations, shortcuts can create a very limited set of actions where the user is not able to access any data on the device. For example, a shortcut might allow the user to take a picture but not for communicate with someone over BBM.","There are examples of devices that provide access to a limited set of functions outside of a password. For example, on some smart phones, you can answer a phone call without entering a password.","Like reference numerals are used in the drawings to denote like elements and features.","Typically, authentication systems restrict access by requiring a user to authenticate before permitting access to a system or application. Some systems require a user to re-authenticate after a period of time. The present application combines a password\/unlock action with a shortcut command to a specific action\/macro. Examples of password\/unlock are Clixel\u2122, entering a code on a number pad (virtual or real), entering a password on a qwerty keyboard (virtual or real), and gesture passwords. Clixel\u2122 is a graphical authentication system in which a point from an overlay image must be aligned with a point on a base image in order to authenticate. In embodiments described herein, a modifier or activity launch modifier is combined with the password\/unlock process to trigger a macro\/shortcut that is defined for an action the user wants to take. For example, if the user's password is \u201cqwerty\u201d he or she can access the device in a traditional way be typing \u201cqwerty\u201d then enter. If the user wants to take a voice note immediately, the authentication process might be set up so that the user can type \u201cqwertyv\u201d then enter and the voice note application will automatically open. If the user wants to be placed in a BBM conversation with his wife, for example, the system might be set up so that \u201cqwertyw\u201d can be input followed by enter and the BBM conversation will automatically be started. For a Clixel\u2122 example where you are moving an element (number or symbol) to a target, the modifier might be in how you get it there, for example, the modifier could be moving the element in clearly clockwise or counter clockwise directions, or possibly using multi-touch to move the element. For example, the relative location of two fingers on a touch screen might be the modifier to allow for different commands. In a numerical pass code, the first or last number can be used as a modifier to provide different commands. In this case the security level is decreased because one digit is used as the activity launch modifier. However, in some cases this decrease in security might be an acceptable trade-off for the convenience. In a pass code or password a gesture on the final letter\/number might provide the modifier. In other embodiments, a fingerprint scanner might be set up so the direction in which a finger is scanned is the modifier.","In some embodiments, the modifier is indicative of an activity for which a shortcut is created. One or more activity launch modifiers can be factory preset in some embodiments. Alternatively or in addition to factory preset activity launch modifiers, some embodiments allow for users to set user-defined activity launch modifiers. In other words, users can create customize activity launch modifiers to combine with a passcode to create shortcuts to applications, portions of applications or actions within applications.","In one aspect, there is provided a method of activating an application on an electronic device comprising: receiving passcode input data from a user-interface, the passcode input data including a passcode combined with an activity launch modifier; checking the passcode input data for a valid passcode for operating the electronic device; determining a corresponding application for the activity launch modifier; and activating the corresponding application if the passcode input data includes the valid passcode.","In another aspect, there is provided a computer readable medium having computer readable instructions stored thereon that when implemented cause a processor to implement a method of activating an application on an electronic device, the comprising: receiving passcode input data from a user-interface, the passcode input data including a passcode combined with an activity launch modifier; checking the passcode input data for a valid passcode for operating the electronic device; determining a corresponding application for the activity launch modifier; and activating the corresponding application if the passcode input data includes the valid passcode.","In another aspect, there is provided an electronic system comprising: a processor; an input interface; a memory having computer readable instruction stored thereon that when executed cause the processor to implement a method of activating an application comprising: receiving passcode input data from the user-interface, the passcode input data including a passcode combined with an activity launch modifier; checking the passcode input data for a valid passcode for operating at least a portion of the electronic system; determining a corresponding application for the activity launch modifier; and activating the corresponding application if the passcode input data includes the valid passcode.","Non-limiting examples of a passcode include a password, an unlock code and a graphical authentication process. The passcode can be for operating or accessing at least a portion of the electronic device.","Reference is first made to  which shows in block diagram of a communication system  in which example embodiments of the present disclosure can be applied. The communication system  comprises a number of mobile electronic devices  which may be connected to the remainder of system  in any of several different ways. Accordingly, several instances of mobile electronic devices  are depicted in  employing different example ways of connecting to system . Mobile electronic devices  are connected to a wireless communication network  which may comprise one or more of a Wireless Wide Area Network (WWAN)  and a Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN)  or other suitable network arrangements. In some embodiments, the mobile electronic devices  are configured to communicate over both the WWAN  and WLAN , and to roam between these networks. In some embodiments, the wireless network  may comprise multiple WWANs  and WLANs .","The WWAN  may be implemented as any suitable wireless access network technology. By way of example, but not limitation, the WWAN  may be implemented as a wireless network that includes a number of transceiver base stations  (one of which is shown in ) where each of the base stations  provides wireless Radio Frequency (RF) coverage to a corresponding area or cell. The WWAN  is typically operated by a mobile network service provider that provides subscription packages to users of the mobile electronic devices . In some embodiments, the WWAN  conforms to one or more of the following wireless network types: Mobitex Radio Network, DataTAC, GSM (Global System for Mobile Communication), GPRS (General Packet Radio System), TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access), CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access), CDPD (Cellular Digital Packet Data), iDEN (integrated Digital Enhanced Network), EvDO (Evolution-Data Optimized) CDMA2000, EDGE (Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution), UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunication Systems), HSDPA (High-Speed Downlink Packet Access), IEEE 802.16e (also referred to as Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access or \u201cWiMAX), or various other networks. Although WWAN  is described as a \u201cWide-Area\u201d network, that term is intended herein also to incorporate wireless Metropolitan Area Networks (WMAN) and other similar technologies for providing coordinated service wirelessly over an area larger than that covered by typical WLANs.","The WWAN  may further comprise a wireless network gateway  which connects the mobile electronic devices  to transport facilities , and through the transport facilities  to a wireless connector system . Transport facilities may include one or more private networks or lines, the public internet, a virtual private network, or any other suitable network. The wireless connector system  may be operated, for example, by an organization or enterprise such as a corporation, university, or governmental department, which allows access to a network  such as an internal or enterprise network and its resources, or the wireless connector system , may be operated by a mobile network provider. In some embodiments, the network  may be realised using the internet rather than an internal or enterprise network.","The wireless network gateway  provides an interface between the wireless connector system  and the WWAN , which facilitates communication between the mobile electronic devices  and other devices (not shown) connected, directly or indirectly, to the WWAN . Accordingly, communications sent via the mobile electronic devices  are transported via the WWAN  and the wireless network gateway  through transport facilities  to the wireless connector system . Communications sent from the wireless connector system  are received by the wireless network gateway  and transported via the WWAN  to the mobile electronic devices .","The WLAN  comprises a wireless network which, in some embodiments, conforms to IEEE 802.11x standards (sometimes referred to as Wi-Fi) such as, for example, the IEEE 802.11a, 802.11b and\/or 802.11g standard. Other communication protocols may be used for the WLAN  in other embodiments such as, for example, IEEE 802.11n, IEEE 802.16e (also referred to as Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access or \u201cWiMAX\u201d), or IEEE 802.20 (also referred to as Mobile Wireless Broadband Access). The WLAN  includes one or more wireless RF Access Points (AP)  (one of which is shown in ) that collectively provide a WLAN coverage area.","The WLAN  may be a personal network of the user, an enterprise network, or a hotspot offered by an internet service provider (ISP), a mobile network provider, or a property owner in a public or semi-public area, for example. The access points  are connected to an access point (AP) interface  which may connect to the wireless connector system  directly (for example, if the access point  is part of an enterprise WLAN  in which the wireless connector system  resides), or indirectly via the transport facilities  if the access point  is a personal Wi-Fi network or Wi-Fi hotspot (in which case a mechanism for securely connecting to the wireless connector system , such as a virtual private network (VPN), may be appropriate). The AP interface  provides translation and routing services between the access points  and the wireless connector system  to facilitate communication, directly or indirectly, with the wireless connector system .","The wireless connector system  may be implemented as one or more servers, and is typically located behind a firewall . The wireless connector system  manages communications, including email messages, to and from a set of managed mobile electronic devices . The wireless connector system  also provides administrative control and management capabilities over users and mobile electronic devices  which may connect to the wireless connector system .","The wireless connector system  allows the mobile electronic devices  to access the network  and connected resources and services such as a messaging server  (for example, a Microsoft Exchange\u2122, IBM Lotus Domino\u2122, or Novell GroupWise\u2122 email messaging server) having a global address book , and optionally other servers . The other servers  may comprise a content server for providing content such as internet content or content from an organization's internal servers to the mobile electronic devices  in the wireless network , an authentication server and an application server for implementing server-based applications.","The global address book  comprises electronic contact records generated and maintained by an IT (information technology) administrator of the network . Typically, the global address book is maintained exclusively by the messaging server  and there is no local copy on the mobile electronic device . In addition, the global address book typically comprises contact records for all users of the respective network  (e.g., enterprise). The contact records in the global address book  may be one or more of individual contact records (or user records) or a group address or distribution list which lists multiple individual (users).","The wireless connector system  typically provides a secure exchange of data (e.g., email messages, personal information manager (PIM) data, and IM data) with the mobile electronic devices . In some embodiments, communications between the wireless connector system  and the mobile electronic devices  are encrypted. In some embodiments, communications are encrypted using a symmetric encryption key implemented using Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) or Triple Data Encryption Standard (Triple DES) encryption. Private encryption keys are generated in a secure, two-way authenticated environment and are used for both encryption and decryption of data.","The wireless network gateway  is adapted to send data packets received from the mobile electronic device  over the WWAN  to the wireless connector system . The wireless connector system  then sends the data packets to the appropriate connection point such as the messaging server , other servers  or application servers . Conversely, the wireless connector system  sends data packets received, for example, from the messaging server  or other servers  to the wireless network gateway  which then transmit the data packets to the destination mobile electronic device . The AP interfaces  of the WLAN  provide similar sending functions between the mobile electronic device , the wireless connector system  and network connection point such as the messaging server , other servers  and application server .","The network  may comprise a private local area network, metropolitan area network, wide area network, the public internet or combinations thereof and may include virtual networks constructed using any of these, alone, or in combination. Computers  may be connected to the network  directly or indirectly via an intermediate communication network such as the Internet . When computers  connect to the network indirectly, e.g. via the Internet , a VPN or other mechanism for securely connecting to the network  may be appropriate. Computers  may be of any suitable construction and include at least a processor, and a display screen, one or more user input devices, and a memory each connected to the processor as is known in the art. The computers  could be desktop computers, laptop\/notebook\/netbook computers, or combinations thereof, and may have wired or wireless communication subsystems for connecting to the network .","A mobile electronic device  may alternatively connect to the wireless connector system  using a computer  via the network . In at least some embodiments, for security purposes the computers  with which the mobile electronic devices  can connect to the wireless connector system  are limited to computers  which are directly connected to the network . A link  may be provided for exchanging information between the mobile electronic device  and computer  connected to the wireless connector system . The link  may comprise one or both of a physical interface and short-range wireless communication interface. The physical interface may comprise one or combinations of an Ethernet connection, Universal Serial Bus (USB) connection, Firewire\u2122 (also known as an IEEE 1394 interface) connection, or other serial data connection, via respective ports or interfaces of the mobile electronic device  and computer . The short-range wireless communication interface may be a personal area network (PAN) interface. A personal area network is a wireless point-to-point connection meaning no physical cables are required to connect the two end points.","It will be appreciated that the above-described communication system is provided for the purpose of illustration only, and that the above-described communication system comprises one possible communication network configuration of a multitude of possible configurations for use with the mobile electronic devices . The teachings of the present disclosure may be employed in connection with any other type of network and associated devices that are effective in implementing or facilitating wireless communication. Suitable variations of the communication system will be understood to a person of skill in the art and are intended to fall within the scope of the present disclosure.","Reference is now made to  which illustrates an exemplary embodiment of the mobile electronic device  in which example embodiments described in the present disclosure can be applied. The mobile electronic device  is a two-way communication device having data and voice communication capabilities, and the capability to communicate with other computer systems, for example, via the Internet. Depending on the functionality provided by the mobile electronic device , in various embodiments the mobile electronic device  may be a multiple-mode communication device configured for both data and voice communication, a smartphone, a mobile telephone or a PDA (personal digital assistant) enabled for wireless communication, a tablet device or a computer system with a wireless modem.","The mobile electronic device  includes a rigid case (not shown) housing the components of the mobile electronic device . The internal components of the mobile electronic device  are constructed on a printed circuit board (PCB). The mobile electronic device  includes a controller comprising at least one processor  (such as a microprocessor) which controls the overall operation of the mobile electronic device . The processor  interacts with device subsystems such as a wireless communication subsystem  (sometimes referred to as a radio layer) for exchanging radio frequency signals with the wireless network  to perform communication functions. The processor  interacts with additional device subsystems including a display screen  such as a liquid crystal display (LCD) screen and a touchscreen, input devices  such as a keyboard, a touchpad, a fingerprint sensor and control buttons, flash memory , random access memory (RAM) , read only memory (ROM) , auxiliary input\/output (I\/O) subsystems , data port  such as serial data port, such as a Universal Serial Bus (USB) data port, speaker , microphone , short-range communication subsystem , and other device subsystems generally designated as . Some of the subsystems shown in  perform communication-related functions, whereas other subsystems may provide \u201cresident\u201d or on-device functions.","The mobile electronic device  may comprise a touch screen display in some embodiments. The touch screen display may be constructed using a touch-sensitive input surface connected to an electronic controller and which overlays the display screen . The touch-sensitive overlay and the electronic controller provide a touch-sensitive input device and the processor  interacts with the touch-sensitive overlay via the electronic controller. In some embodiments, a touch screen is integrated directly with the display. In still other embodiments, a touch screen is placed behind the display.","The communication subsystem  includes a receiver , a transmitter , and associated components, such as one or more antenna elements  and , local oscillators (LOs) , and a processing module such as a digital signal processor (DSP) . The antenna elements  and  may be embedded or internal to the mobile electronic device  and a single antenna may be shared by both receiver and transmitter, as is known in the art. As will be apparent to those skilled in the field of communication, the particular design of the wireless communication subsystem  depends on the wireless network  in which mobile electronic device  is intended to operate.","The mobile electronic device  may communicate with any one of a plurality of fixed transceiver base stations  of the wireless network  within its geographic coverage area. The mobile electronic device  may send and receive communication signals over the wireless network  after the required network registration or activation procedures have been completed. Signals received by the antenna  through the wireless network  are input to the receiver , which may perform such common receiver functions as signal amplification, frequency down conversion, filtering, channel selection, etc., as well as analog-to-digital (A\/D) conversion. A\/D conversion of a received signal allows more complex communication functions such as demodulation and decoding to be performed in the DSP . In a similar manner, signals to be transmitted are processed, including modulation and encoding, for example, by the DSP . These DSP-processed signals are output to the transmitter  for digital-to-analog (D\/A) conversion, frequency up conversion, filtering, amplification, and transmission to the wireless network  via the antenna . The DSP  not only processes communication signals, but may also provide for receiver and transmitter control. For example, the gains applied to communication signals in the receiver  and the transmitter  may be adaptively controlled through automatic gain control algorithms implemented in the DSP .","The processor  operates under stored program control and executes software modules  stored in memory such as persistent memory, for example, in the flash memory . As illustrated in , the software modules  comprise operating system software , software applications  comprising an email messaging application  (also referred to as an email client ), a personal address book , a calendar application , a phone application , and an authentication module . The authentication module  includes instructions for implementing any of the methods described herein. It is recognized that the authentication module  and its various components as described herein can form a discrete module running on the mobile electronic device , or the functions of the authentication module  can be distributed on the mobile electronic device  as separate modules or integrated within other existing modules as desired. Such discrete or distributed implementations all fall within the embodiments of the authentication module  as described herein.","The software applications  also may include a range of applications, including, for example, a notepad application, Internet browser application, voice communication (i.e. telephony) application, mapping application, or a media player application, or any combination thereof. Each of the software applications  may include layout information defining the placement of particular fields and graphic elements (e.g. text fields, input fields, icons, etc.) in the user interface (i.e. the display screen ) according to the application.","Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the software modules  or parts thereof may be temporarily loaded into volatile memory such as the RAM . The RAM  is used for storing runtime data variables and other types of data or information, as will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Although specific functions are described for various types of memory, this is merely one example, and those skilled in the art will appreciate that a different assignment of functions to types of memory could also be used.","In some embodiments, the auxiliary I\/O subsystems  may comprise an external communication link or interface, for example, an Ethernet connection. The mobile electronic device  may comprise other wireless communication interfaces for communicating with other types of wireless networks, for example, a wireless network such as an orthogonal frequency division multiplexed (OFDM) network or a GPS (Global Positioning System) subsystem comprising a GPS receiver or transceiver for communicating with a GPS satellite network (not shown). The auxiliary I\/O subsystems  may comprise a pointing or navigational input device such as a touchpad, a clickable trackball or scroll wheel or thumbwheel, or a vibrator for providing vibratory notifications in response to various events on the mobile electronic device  such as receipt of an electronic message or incoming phone call, or for other purposes such as haptic feedback (touch feedback).","In some embodiments, the mobile electronic device  also includes a removable memory card or module  (typically comprising flash memory) and a memory card interface . Network access is typically associated with a subscriber or user of the mobile electronic device  via the memory card , which may be a Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) card for use in a GSM network or other type of memory card for use in the relevant wireless network type. The memory card  is inserted in or connected to the memory card interface  of the mobile electronic device  in order to operate in conjunction with the wireless network .","The mobile electronic device  also stores other data  in an erasable persistent memory, which in one example embodiment is the flash memory . In various embodiments, the data  includes service data comprising information required by the mobile electronic device  to establish and maintain communication with the wireless network . The data  may also include user application data such as email messages, address book and contact information, calendar and schedule information, notepad documents, image files, and other commonly stored user information stored on the mobile electronic device  by its user, and other data. The data  stored in the persistent memory (e.g. flash memory ) of the mobile electronic device  may be organized, at least partially, into a number of databases each containing data items of the same data type or associated with the same application. For example, email messages, contact records, and task items may be stored in individual databases within the device memory.","The mobile electronic device  also includes a battery  as a power source, which is typically one or more rechargeable batteries that may be charged, for example, through charging circuitry coupled to a battery interface such as the serial data port . The battery  provides electrical power to at least some of the electrical circuitry in the mobile electronic device , and the battery interface  provides a mechanical and electrical connection for the battery . The battery interface  is coupled to a regulator (not shown) which provides power V+ to the circuitry of the mobile electronic device .","The short-range communication subsystem  is an additional optional component which provides for communication between the mobile electronic device  and different systems or devices, which need not necessarily be similar devices. For example, the subsystem  may include an infrared device and associated circuits and components, or a wireless bus protocol compliant communication mechanism such as a Bluetooth\u00ae communication module to provide for communication with similarly-enabled systems and devices.","A predetermined set of applications that control basic device operations, including data and voice communication applications will normally be installed on the mobile electronic device  during or after manufacture. Additional applications and\/or upgrades to the operating system  or software applications  may also be loaded onto the mobile electronic device  through the wireless network , the auxiliary I\/O subsystem , the serial port , the short-range communication subsystem , or other suitable subsystem . The downloaded programs or code modules may be permanently installed, for example, written into the program memory (i.e. the flash memory ), or written into and executed from the RAM  for execution by the processor  at runtime. Such flexibility in application installation increases the functionality of the mobile electronic device  and may provide enhanced on-device functions, communication-related functions, or both. For example, secure communication applications may enable electronic commerce functions and other such financial transactions to be performed using the mobile electronic device .","The mobile electronic device  may provide two principal modes of communication: a data communication mode and a voice communication mode. In the data communication mode, a received data signal such as a text message, an email message, or Web page download will be processed by the communication subsystem  and input to the processor  for further processing. For example, a downloaded Web page may be further processed by a browser application or an email message may be processed by the email messaging application and output to the display . A user of the mobile electronic device  may also compose data items, such as email messages, for example, using the input devices in conjunction with the display screen . These composed items may be transmitted through the communication subsystem  over the wireless network .","In the voice communication mode, the mobile electronic device  provides telephony functions and operates as a typical cellular phone. The overall operation is similar, except that the received signals are output to the speaker  and signals for transmission are generated by a transducer such as the microphone . The telephony functions are provided by a combination of software\/firmware (i.e., the phone application ) and hardware (i.e., the microphone , the speaker  and input devices). Alternative voice or audio I\/O subsystems, such as a voice message recording subsystem, may also be implemented on the mobile electronic device . Although voice or audio signal output is typically accomplished primarily through the speaker , the display screen  may also be used to provide an indication of the identity of a calling party, duration of a voice call, or other voice call related information.","The phone application  can be split into multiple applications or sub-modules, for example one or more user phone modules and a call control module. The user phone modules provide a variety of telephony features through a user interface, while the call control module provides access to common telephony functions desired by the user phone modules, such that telephony requests from phone modules can be coordinated and so that the user phone modules do not need to each provide instructions understood by the wireless communications subsystem . The call control function typically makes telephony features available to user phone modules through an application programming interface (API). It is to be recognized that all or part of the phone application  features or functions could be provided through the operating system or otherwise distributed in the mobile electronic device , while continuing to fall within the term phone application .","Referring now to , a method of activating an application on an electronic device will be described. At action  the method starts with receiving passcode input data from a user-interface, the passcode input data including a passcode combined with an activity launch modifier. Then at action , the method continues with checking the passcode input data for a valid passcode. The next action  is determining a corresponding application for the activity launch modifier. The method ends with action  which is activating the corresponding application if the passcode input data includes the valid passcode.","In an embodiment, activating the corresponding application comprises activating a portion of the application corresponding to the activity launch modifier. Thus, activating the application in some cases is opening the application such that the user can navigate from a default start point in the application. In other cases, a particular the application is opened to a particular subroutine or menu item. For example, if the corresponding application is an email application, a new compose email window can be opened. In an embodiment, activating the corresponding application comprises implementing an action within the application corresponding to the activity launch modifier. Thus, in some embodiments, the corresponding application is instructed to perform a particular action. For example, if the application is a phone application, the action could be to dial a particular phone number. For the email application example previously given, the compose email window can have the addressee information filled out. Another non-limiting example is for a map application whereby the action could be to find a current location.","In some embodiments, checking for the valid passcode comprises determining if the valid passcode appears anywhere in the passcode input data. Thus, in the case of an alphanumeric code, the valid passcode could appear anywhere in the character string: at the beginning, in the middle or at the end. The passcode could feasibly comprise the entire passcode. In other words, there may be situations where no activity launch modifier is entered. Thus, where no activity launch modifier is found when checking for the activity launch modifier, entering a valid passcode can result in positive authentication with a default action, such as unlocking the electronic device.","In some embodiments, the passcode input data comprises a character string and checking for the valid passcode comprises determining if the valid passcode appears starting at the beginning of the character string. In some embodiments, checking for the activity launch modifier comprises determining if an additional character appears in the character string after the valid passcode.","In some embodiments, the passcode input data comprises a character string and checking for the valid passcode comprises determining if the valid passcode appears at the end of the character string. In some embodiments, checking for the activity launch modifier comprises determining if an additional character appears in the character string before the valid passcode.","In some embodiments, the valid passcode is a graphical authentication passcode and the activity launch modifier is a gesture. In some embodiments, such as the Clixel\u2122 example given above, the valid passcode requires alignment on a display of a first reference point on an overlay image with a second reference point on a base image. A gesture can be used as the activity launch modifier. In cases where a touch screen or a touch pad is used as an input interface, gestures are convenient activity launch modifiers.","In some embodiments where the valid passcode requires alignment on a display of a first reference point on an overlay image with a second reference point on a base image, the activity launch modifier is a manner of aligning the first reference point and the second reference point.","In some embodiments, the activity launch modifier is a selectable modifier displayed on a display. For example, in some embodiments, instead of hitting enter after entering a passcode, a user can select the modifier to go directly to an activity within an application.","In some embodiments, the user holds down a key or touches a touchscreen while one or more images changes on a display or portions of the display change. The changing images or portions of the display represent activity launch modifiers. Releasing the key when a particular activity launch modifier is displayed will start the activity if the passcode is entered correctly. For example, in some embodiments, the activity launch modifier is a colour of at least a portion of a display. For example, at some point in entering a passcode, graphic or alpha-numeric, the user may hold down a key or touch a touchscreen until the portion of the display turns the color associated with the action desired.","In some embodiments, the methods described herein are implemented by a processor. In one aspect, there is provided a computer readable medium having computer readable instructions stored thereon that when implemented cause a processor to implement any of the methods described herein.","Referring now to , an electronic system  will be described. The electronic system comprises a processor , an input interface  and a memory . The memory  has computer readable instruction stored thereon that when executed cause the processor to implement a method of activating an application according to any of the embodiments described herein. In some embodiments, the input interface  is a touch screen display. Other non-limiting examples of the input interface include a keyboard, a touch pad, and a joystick. In some embodiments, at least a portion of the electronic system  is a mobile electronic device, such as but not limited to the mobile electronic device  described with reference to . In some embodiments, the electronic system is one device. In some embodiments, the electronic system is composed of separate devices. For example, the input interface  and the memory  can be peripheral devices that are connectable to another device housing the processor .","While the present disclosure is sometimes described in terms of methods, a person of ordinary skill in the art will understand that the present disclosure is also directed to various apparatus including components for performing at least some of the aspects and features of the described methods, be it by way of hardware components, software or any combination of the two, or in any other manner. Moreover, an article of manufacture for use with the apparatus, such as a pre-recorded storage device or other similar computer readable medium including program instructions recorded thereon may direct an apparatus to facilitate the practice of the described methods. It is understood that such apparatus and articles of manufacture, also come within the scope of the present disclosure.","The various embodiments presented above are merely examples and are in no way meant to limit the scope of this disclosure. Variations of the innovations described herein will be apparent to persons of ordinary skill in the art, such variations being within the intended scope of the present application.
