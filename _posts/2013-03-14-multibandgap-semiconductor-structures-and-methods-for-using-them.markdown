{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This application is a U.S. National Phase of International Application No. PCT\/US2013\/031313, filed Mar. 14, 2013, which claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/636,942, filed Apr. 23, 2012, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties.","The invention was made with government support under W911NF-08-1-0471 awarded by the Army Research Office. The Government has certain rights in the invention.","The invention relates generally to multi-bandgap semiconductor structures and their use in light emitting devices, such as multicolor and white lasers. The invention relates more particularly to nanowires, nanobelts and nanosheets having multiple semiconductor compositions along one or more directions thereof, and their use in the emission of light.","Alloying two semiconductors of different bandgaps generally results in a semiconductor of bandgap different from that of either original constituent. Varying the relative compositions of the two constituents will lead to the corresponding change in bandgap. This has long been one of the standard methods of achieving a bandgap (and thus the operating wavelength of an optical device) that is not provided by naturally-occurring semiconductors. Unfortunately, this method of achieving wavelength variability is severely limited by existing methods of growing planar epitaxial heterostructures of semiconductor thin films on a crystalline substrate. Such methods invariably require a close match of lattice constants of the substrate and the materials to be grown (or a means of relieving the strain due to lattice mismatch). The very limited lattice constant mismatch required for growing high quality wafers has been the main obstacle of making semiconductor-based optoelectronic devices (such as lasers, detectors, multicolor detectors and solar cells) with controllable and widely variable (or tunable) operating wavelengths. With the advent of nanowire based technology, such restrictions are removed or are very much relaxed, depending on the method of growth. For epitaxial growth of nanowires, the relaxed requirement of lattice matching has led to the growth of materials with a mismatch as large as 8%. InP, GaAs, and other III-V nanowires have been epitaxially grown on Si (see, Martensson et al., 4, 1987-1990 (2004)) and InAs and InP nanowires have been grown into nanowire heterostructures (see, Bjork et al., 2, 87-89 (2002)) despite large lattice mismatches. In addition, nanowires can also be grown using an amorphous substrate as simply a mechanical support, allowing alloy nanowire growth with a much larger range of composition variation than is possible with planar growth technologies.","Multicolor lasing and dynamic color-tuning in a wide spectrum range are critically important in many areas of technology and daily life, such as general lighting, display, multicolor detection, and multi-band communication. Multicolor laser sources have an extremely wide range of applications including color display, general lighting, biological detection, holographic imaging and 3-D projection. Color display itself is important in many aspects of technology and daily life. One important advantage of multicolor lasers for color display is the more widely available color range, or color gamut, compared to the currently existing display technologies based on incoherent sources, such as cathode ray tube (CRT) and organic light emitting diode (OLED). The large spectral linewidth of incoherent light sources degrades the color purity and leads to a small color gamut. As coherent light sources, multicolor lasers render high purity monochromic colors and thus can extend the color range significantly if proper wavelengths are chosen. For lighting and illumination applications, the combination of four separate lasers with specifically selected wavelengths can achieve the large chromaticity range and similar color rendering ability as state-of-the-art LEDs or phosphors, even though lasers contain only a series of narrow emission lines. For many of the above applications that require high power output, multicolor lasers offer great advantages due to the much higher wall-plug efficiency than incoherent LED sources, thus leading to greater energy efficiency. While the importance of multicolor lasers and dynamical color control has been well-recognized for a long time, the realization of such sources has been challenging due to several technology barriers.","Multicolor lasers that are necessary for all these critical applications mentioned above require color ranges with widely separated wavelengths, or even across the entire visible spectrum. Such multicolor lasers are fundamentally different from multimode lasers. A multimode laser is conventionally made of a single semiconductor and relies on cavity structure to generate multiple lasing wavelengths corresponding to various cavity modes. Since these multiple modes are all supported by the same gain material, their separation is limited within the gain bandwidth of a semiconductor, typically in the range of 1-30 nm. Such a wavelength range is smaller than usually desired for display or lighting applications. Thus, multicolor lasers require integration or monolithic growth of multiple gain materials, or semiconductor alloys of different alloy compositions. This requirement poses a formidable challenge for traditional planar epitaxial technology due to the large degree of lattice mismatch typically involved. In addition to material challenges, cavity design is also a crucial issue when multiple gain materials are involved in a single integrated structure. This is because the light emitted by the wide-gap materials will be absorbed by the narrow-gap materials. Thus lasing is typically achieved only in the longest wavelength of the structures.","Although various semiconductor alloy nanowires of different compositions have been achieved under separate growth conditions, it is both challenging and important to achieve a full-range composition variation within a single substrate in a single run of growth. To achieve fully tunable lasing within the entire composition range on a single substrate would be even more appealing and challenging.","Therefore there exists a need in the art to provide semiconductor compositions and structural assemblies which enable continuously tunable bandgap on a single substrate. Further, methods for preparing the same which enable straightforward preparation of such semiconductor structures in a single step are needed in the art.","In one aspect, the invention provides a semiconductor nanowire, nanobelt or nanosheet having a length, the semiconductor nanowire, nanobelt or nanosheet being formed from a II-VI semiconductor material system, a III-V semiconductor material system, or a IV-VI semiconductor material system, the composition of the semiconductor nanowire, nanobelt or nanosheet varying along its length.

For example, multiple optical sources or a single tunable optical source can be configured to illuminate multiple segments of a segmented nanowire, nanobelt or nanosheet; since each segment will be pumped only by certain wavelengths, segments can be pumped individually or in combination by selecting the wavelength(s) of pump radiation individually or in combination.","In certain embodiments, the semiconductor nanowire, nanobelt or nanosheet is disposed on a substrate. The substrate can be of a size and composition suitable for the intended purpose.

In one embodiment, the substrate comprises SiO. Desirably, the substrate is of lower refractive index than the materials of the semiconductor nanowire, nanobelt or nanosheet. The nanowire, nanobelt or nanosheet can be disposed on the substrate in any convenient fashion. For example, in the embodiment shown in schematic view in , the nanosheet  is disposed horizontally on a substrate . In the embodiment shown in partial schematic view in , the looped nanowire  can be disposed horizontally on a substrate or vertically on a substrate  supported by other materials such as a polymer (e.g., polyimide), with laser sources  and  configured to pump segments R and R respectively.","Another embodiment of a light emitting device is shown in partial schematic view in .

The device includes a nanowires, nanobelts or nanosheets, with each segment thereof including a p-i-n multilayered structure. The layers at the junctions between two adjacent segments have the same doping type (i.e., each is n-doped or each is p-doped).

The term \u201cn-doped\u201d as used herein means atoms have been added to the material to increase the number of free negative charge carriers. The \u201ci-\u201d portion of the p-i-n structure refers to an \u201cintrinsic semiconductor\u201d which, as used herein, means a semiconductor material in which the concentration of charge carriers is characteristic of the material itself rather than the content of impurities (or dopants).

In such embodiments, doping can be realized by adding different dopants at different stages of the material growth process, as would be understood by the person of ordinary skill in the art. Such light emitting devices can be pumped by electrical injection, using methods familiar to the person of ordinary skill in the art.","While the embodiments above have been described with respect to a single nanowire, nanosheet or nanobelt, the person of skill in the art will appreciate that a device or method as described herein can include a plurality of semiconductor nanowires, nanosheets or nanobelts, each configured as described herein. In certain embodiments, the plurality of semiconductor nanowires, nanosheets or nanobelts do not contact one another. Of course in other embodiments, the plurality of semiconductor nanowires, nanosheets or nanobelts can be in contact with one another. In certain embodiments, the device or method as described herein uses at least three, at least ten, or even at least 50 individual nanowires, nanosheets or nanobelts. (As an example, device with 100 semiconductor nanowires, nanosheets or nanobelts can be configured to deliver laser output of multiple mW, and even on the order of 10 mW.) Multi-element structures can be made using manual placement and looping procedures, as appropriate. In certain embodiments, template-assisted placement techniques can be used to produce multi-element structures.","As the nanowires, nanobelts and nanosheets described herein include a plurality of different segments, each having a different bandgap, the different segments can be individually pumped to give different combinations of emission wavelengths. Thus, dynamic control of the color(s) of light emitted by the devices and methods described herein can be obtained through selection of pumping energies and powers. For example, in optical pumping schemes, a light source can be selected to selectively excite (e.g., optically pump) one of the segments of the nanowires. Where more than two light sources are present, each light source can be selected to independently and selectively excite (e.g., optically pump) separate segments of the nanowires. In other embodiments, dynamic control of colors emitted by the light emitting devices can be obtained through individually-addressed electrical injection of each segment.","As described in more detail below, the orientation of the nanowire can also be used to control the output of the light emitting devices. In one embodiment, at least one segment of the nanowire is looped and at least one segment of the nanowire is not looped. In another embodiment, the semiconductor nanowire has two segments wherein each segment of the nanowire is not looped. In another embodiment, the semiconductor nanowire has three segments wherein each segment of the nanowire is not looped. In another embodiment, the semiconductor nanowire has two segments wherein one segment of the nanowire is looped and one segment of the nanowire is not looped. In another embodiment, the semiconductor nanowire has three segments wherein two segments of the nanowire are looped and one segment of the nanowire is not looped. In another embodiment, the semiconductor nanowire has three segments wherein two segments of the nanowire are looped and one segment of the nanowire is not looped, wherein the two looped segments are adjacent segments.","Accordingly, in one embodiment, a method as described herein includes directing energy at one or more segments of the nanowire, nanobelt or nanosheet to provide a first emission profile (i.e., the relative wavelength characteristics of the emitted radiation), then directing energy at one or more segments of the nanowire, nanobelt or nanosheet to provide a second emission profile different from the first. In another embodiment, a method as described herein includes selecting a desired emission profile, then directing energy at one or more segments of semiconductor nanowires, nanosheets or nanobelts to provide the selected emission profile. Thus, a single nanowire can provide for a tunable emission profile, which depends on the relative amounts of energy directed at different segments of the nanowire, nanobelt or nanosheet.","For example, multicolor light emission can be obtained from three-segment nanowires, nanobelts or nanosheets by selection of the bandgap of each segment. In certain examples, three-segment straight nanowire can be used in LED operation. The three segments can be, for example, formed from ZnCdSSe, with x and\/or y being different for each segment. As the person of skill in the art will appreciate, the desired semiconductor compositions of the segments (e.g., values of x and y for the three segments described above) can be determined experimentally. The desired compositions (e.g., values of x and y) may also depend on other factors, such as the length of each of the three segments. In certain embodiments, nanowires, nanobelts or nanosheets can include three straight segments (e.g., each forming a laser cavity) in a single nanowire, nanosheet or nanobelt. In another embodiment, nanowires or nanobelts can include two segments each configured in a loop (e.g., each providing a laser cavity) and one straight segment (e.g., forming a laser cavity). Notably, the person of skill can adapt the three segment structures to provide white light, e.g., by selecting appropriate semiconductor materials and relative pumping powers among the three segments.","In another example, multicolor lasers can be obtained from two-segment nanowires, nanobelts or nanosheets. In one embodiment, a nanowire or nanobelt can include one segment in a loop (e.g., to form one laser cavity) and one straight segment (e.g., to form another laser cavity), interconnected through the nanowire, nanobelt or nanosheet. As described in more detail below, this configuration can have certain advantages with respect to dual-color lasing. In another embodiment, a nanowire, nanobelt or nanosheet can include two straight segment configured as coupled cavities within a single nanowire, nanobelt or nanosheet.","One exemplary design for a light emitting device is shown in schematic view in . The nanowire, nanosheet or nanobelt  has three segments, R, R and R, each having a different composition (e.g., of the composition ZnCdSSe), each of the different compositions having a bandgap emission wavelength in a different visible color range (e.g., blue, green, yellow, red). For example, in one embodiment, segment R has a bandgap emission wavelength of 700 nm; segment R has a bandgap emission wavelength of 540 nm; and segment R has a bandgap emission wavelength of 470 nm. Light sources , ,  are configured to pump the individual segments R, R, R, as described above. In the embodiment of , the semiconductor structure extends vertically from the substrate , which has a lower refractive index than the semiconductor material and therefore can act as a reflector. In other embodiments, one or more reflectors (e.g., in multilayer thin film form) are disposed on the ends of the semiconductor nanowire, nanosheet or nanobelt to provide the reflectance desired to form a laser cavity. Of course, in certain embodiments, the index contrast between the semiconductor nanowire, nanobelt or nanosheet and the surrounding materials (e.g., substrate, environment) can provide sufficient reflectance.","In one particular aspect of the invention, a novel combination of gain materials and cavity design can be used to provide room temperature lasing of two visible colors (here, red and green) from a single {Cd}{SSe} nanowire. The wavelength separation of 107 nm between the two emitted colors is much larger than the gain spectra bandwidth limitation of typical semiconductor materials. Moreover, as described above, the overall color of the device output can be controlled dynamically between the two fundamental colors by changing the relative pumping strength of the two segments. This can allow the laser generation of any color between the two fundamental colors according to the color map of International Commission on Illumination (CIE). The composition along the nanowire varies, with the bandgaps of the terminal segments varying enough from one to generate the two distinct colors. Moreover, the gradual composition change in the transition region between the two terminal segments helps to assure acceptable quality of the crystal structure of the semiconductor materials.","By looping the larger bandgap end of the nanowire, two relatively isolated (or weakly coupled) cavities are created, reducing the absorption of the short wavelength light in the smaller bandgap section and allowing both segments (cavities) to lase simultaneously. This way, two of the fundamental challenges (i.e., material and cavity structure) encountered in multicolor lasing are addressed simultaneously.","One embodiment is shown schematically in .  is a schematic view of a straight {Cd}{SSe} nanowire, with first segment R and second segment R separated by a transition zone T. The nanowire can be made, for example, as described in Gu et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 133, 2037-39 (2011). The person of skill in the art will appreciate that there may not be a sharp transition between the composition of segment R and the transition zone T in the neighborhood of segment R; and that there may not be a sharp transition between the composition of segment R and the transition zone T in the neighborhood of segment R. The variation in shading along the nanowire represents the continuously changing composition. The sulfur composition, x, of a CdSSecomposition can be changed from 1 at one end to 0 at the other end, resulting in a color variation of bandgap emission from green to red along the nanowire, as shown in . Accordingly, the bandgap of segment R corresponds to red light, and the bandgap of segment R corresponds to green light. In certain embodiments, such a nanowire may lase at different colors simultaneously since it contains different gain materials for different colors in one cavity. However, in certain configurations, the straight nanowire can only support red lasing due to the strong absorption of green light by the red segment. Because the wide-gap (CdS-rich) segment is transparent to the red light emitted by the CdSe-rich part, red light can easily reach the threshold and start lasing. However, the shorter wavelength emission from the CdS-rich section will experience a strong absorption in the narrower-gap (CdSe-rich) section, thus green lasing becomes nearly impossible without an extremely long segment.","In order to achieve simultaneous lasing at both long and short wavelengths, it can be advantageous to well-confine light emitted from the wide-gap semiconductor material within its own segment. One convenient and preferred way to create distinct cavities in a single nanowire or nanobelt structure is to loop the wide-gap section to form a relatively isolated cavity for the longer wavelength light.  is a schematic view of a looped nanowire. The junction coupling efficiency of such a ring cavity is very high, providing strong feedback for the longer wavelength emission and reducing the strong absorption in the narrower gap segment (here, R). As a result, the longer wavelength mode can oscillate in the ring cavity with sufficiently high gain and sufficiently low loss to achieve lasing. At the same time, the red emission from the narrow-gap segment can still propagate in the entire nanowire with a cavity defined by the two end-facets of the nanowire.","The use of a looped-cavity design as described herein can enable the active tuning of the output color, as the shorter wavelength light is not completely absorbed by the narrow-gap segment of the nanowire. Thus, as described above, the looped segment can be pumped independently from the straight segment (e.g., by illuminating them with different optical power), allowing for the control of the emission profile by controlling relative intensities of emission between the two segments. Accordingly, the overall output can be continuously varied from the shorter wavelength emission (e.g., green in this example) to the longer wavelength emission (e.g., red in this example) corresponding to the relative pumping powers of the two segments, as shown schematically in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0109","num":"0108"},"figref":["FIGS. 11A-11D","FIG. 11A","FIG. 11B","FIGS. 11A and 11B","FIG. 11C","FIG. 11D"],"sup":"2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0110","num":"0109"},"figref":["FIGS. 12A-12D","FIG. 11A","FIG. 12A","FIG. 12B","FIG. 12A","FIG. 12A","FIG. 11C","FIG. 12C","FIG. 12D","FIG. 12C","FIG. 12A"],"sup":["2 ","2 "]},"The confocal PL measurement in  demonstrates the output position of the two-color lasing. By inserting a pinhole into the image plane, emission spectra only from an area less than 5 \u03bcm were collected, at both the loop junction and the CdSe-rich end-facet (positions a and b in , respectively). The spectrum at the junction shows both green and red lasing peaks while the spectrum at CdSe-rich end only exhibits longer wavelength lasing, consistent with the previous discussions. Because of the spatial filtering effect of the confocal system, the relative intensity of the green peaks is stronger than that obtained with a large collection area in . The linewidth of a single lasing peak at 526 nm is 0.9 nm, limited by the resolution of the spectrometer. The longitudinal mode spacing is 1.1 nm. Using the approximate expression of the wavelength separation for a ring cavity: \u0394\u03bb=\u03bb\/Ln, where L=47 \u03bcm is the length of the loop, a group index nof 5.4 for the green mode was obtained.","As noted above, for the two-color lasing experiment performed, individual nanowires were first picked up from the substrate on which they were grown and then transferred to a new clean glass substrate using a custom-pulled tapered fiber. In such an operation, it is possible that multiple nanowires are transferred, or debris is transferred along with the nanowire. Due to the relative large size of the excitation spot of the pumping laser, it is sometimes possible that multiple nanowires are excited or that debris is excited along with the nanowire. When the other nanowire(s) or debris has a different composition than the nanowire under test, multiple lasing peaks might be observed due to the different materials present. Moreover, even a single long nanowire could be broken into pieces of different compositions at high enough optical pumping. Different pieces could form laser cavities, thus lasing at different wavelengths. In the experiments described herein, the looped nanowire was examined by SEM imaging after the lasing experiment to ensure only one nanowire was within the laser spot, the wire has not been broken into segments, and the contact junction of the loop remained intact.  shows the SEM image of the looped wire after the lasing experiment that produced two-color lasing shown in . The inset on the top left is a zoom-in of the loop part which forms the cavity for the green color lasing. The inset on the bottom right is a zoom-in showing a small particle attached to the nanowire causing scattering seen in . As is evident, one end of the nanowire remained as a closed loop with 15 \u03bcm in diameter, similar to the initial looped structure before the lasing experiment. The contact angle of this loop is somewhat large but still provides enough feedback into the loop cavity. The total length of this nanowire is about 200 \u03bcm and its diameter is 450 nm. The entire nanowire remains intact after looping and lasing experiment and no breaking point was observed. Such SEM examination together with mode analysis allows to conclude that our dual-color lasing is from a single looped nanowire structure. Moreover, the red emission point in  is due to the scattering of the red lasing mode by a small defect on the straight part of the nanowire.","Regarding the gain spectra of the composition graded nanowire and nanowire loop: Typically, only single color lasing has been achieved in both single composition nanowire and heterostructure nanowires. As described above with respect to , the straight composition graded nanowire can only achieve single color lasing due to the absorption of the short wavelengths by the narrow gap segments. In order to understand this more quantitatively, the analysis of the optical gain spectra is necessary. The total optical gain of the composition graded NW can be given by the following equation:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0114","num":"0113"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["G","tot"]},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mfrac":{"mrow":[{"mo":"\u222b","mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"g","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"msub":{"mi":["E","g"]}}},{"mo":"\u2146","mi":"l"}],"mo":"\u2062"}},{"mo":"\u222b","mrow":{"mo":"\u2146","mi":"l"}}]},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mfrac":{"mn":"1","mi":"L"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":"i","mo":"=","mn":"1"},"mi":"m"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mrow":{"mi":"g","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"msub":{"mi":["E","i"]}}},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mi":"\u0394","mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"msub":{"mi":["l","i"]}}}}}},"mo":","}}},"br":{},"sub":["g","x","1\u2212x ","g","x","1\u2212x"],"sup":["19 ","\u22123 "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0115","num":"0114"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Parameters used in gain spectra calculation."}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"6"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Effective",{},{},{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"electron","Effective heavy","Refractive","Bandgap","Split-off"]},{"entry":[{},"mass","hole mass","index","(eV)","energy"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"6"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["CdS","0.21","0.7","2.60","2.44","0.079 (39)"]},{"entry":["CdSe","0.13","0.45","2.56","1.74","0.42"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"6","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"The calculated optical gain spectra are shown in , in which the dashed line is for a pure CdS nanowire; the dotted line is for a pure CdSe nanowire; the solid line is for a composition graded CdSSe nanowire; and the dot-dashed line is for a CdS rich nanowire loop. The dash line and the dotted curves represent the gain spectra of a pure CdS and CdSe nanowire with the same length of 200 \u03bcm, respectively. The gain spectrum of the composition graded nanowire is shown in the solid curve. Such a gain curve can be understood as follows: First, although the peak gain of CdS at the green wavelength can be over 5000 cmwhen excitation is high enough, the optical loss of CdSe at the green wavelength is even larger (typically over 10000 cm). Such a large absorption would deplete the gain completely in the green wavelength. On the other hand, due to the red shift of the gain curve as Se composition increases, the total gain curve is flattened so that the gain spectra of the composition graded nanowire is much broader (with a smaller peak value) than that of a nanowire with a single composition. When the CdS rich end of the composition graded nanowire is looped, the optical gain spectrum of the loop has contributions only from the segment that forms the loop, if the weak leakage from the loop junction into the straight part of the nanowire is ignored. Depending on the size of the loop, the peak position of the gain spectrum can vary.  shows the peak wavelength of the gain spectra as a function of the emission wavelength at the point where the wide-gap end touches the nanowire. For example, if the nanowire is looped to where the emission wavelength is 546 nm (corresponding to the length of 50 microns from the wide-gap end), the gain spectrum of the loop has a peak gain at 519 nm, as shown in the green curve in . In this case, the looped cavity and the entire nanowire cavity reach maximum gain at 519 nm and 642 nm, respectively. The wavelength separation is 123 nm, close to the wavelength separation of 107 nm in our measurement of the two color nanowire laser, where the total length and the length of the loop are also around 200 \u03bcm and 50 \u03bcm, respectively ().","In fact, a nanowire consisting of two segments with different but constant composition in each is better for achieving dual-color lasing if the shorter wavelength end is looped. In theory, lasing wavelength separation of 200 nm is achievable if a pure CdS segment and a CdSe segment can be grown together to form a single nanowire. The nanowire of  can be configured with three segments: R: pure CdSe, T, continuously graded CdSeS from pure CdSe to pure CdS and R: pure CdS. The short T segment allows a gradual lattice mismatch relief and can act as a buffer layer between the two single composition CdS and CdSe segment, allowing high quality growth of all materials. In the configuration of , there are can be two weakly coupled cavities: the looped one with pure CdS as gain material and a straight cavity with mostly CdSe as gain material and a small segment of ternary alloy (as transparent material). The gain spectrum for this looped CdS cavity is shown by the dashed line in . Here the length of both R and R are taken as 50 \u03bcm and T is 1 \u03bcm. The solid curve represents the average gain of the entire nanowire. The optical gain for the straight part of the CdSe is shown as the dotted line. In this case, a single nanowire looped structure can support a dual-wavelength lasing simultaneously at \u02dc500 nm and \u02dc700 nm, providing with about 200 nm wavelength separation. This would allow a dynamic color variation within a 200 nm range. Besides that, the average gain curve of the entire nanowire at the red color wavelength range does not change much with varying the length of T.  shows average gain of the entire nanowire for different buffer segment length of 1, 3, 5 and 10 \u03bcm, demonstrating that the optical gain only decrease slightly when the length of T is increased from 1 \u03bcm to 10 \u03bcm. This is because that T is much shorter than the total length of the nanowire (\u02dc100 \u03bcm) and it does not contribute too much into the gain curve in the red color range. Thus the red color lasing wavelength would be independent on the length of the transition segment. Such flexibility in the transition segment length would further help us to realize two color lasing with large wavelength separation from the nanowire of .","One advantageous property of the looped nanowire\/nanobelt laser design described herein is the common output position for two-color lasing. Unlike RGB lasers and many other multicolor lasers, the dual-color light emitting devices described herein do not require external guiding to mix the multicolor lasing beams. More importantly, this feature allows color-tunable output via pumping the straight and looped segments separately, as described above and as indicated in . For example, a beam splitter can be used to split the excitation laser into two beams for pumping the CdSe-rich straight part and CdS-rich loop separately. Neutral density filters can be applied after the beam splitter to precisely control the incident power of two excitation beams. Of course, the person of skill in the art will appreciate that there are other ways to provide different intensities of pump radiation to the different segments.","In another embodiment green\/red dual-color lasing with maximum wavelength separation of 110 nm (0.42 eV) can be achieved in a single spatial bandgap-engineered CdSSealloy nanowire. The alloy composition changes spatially along the growth direction of the single nanowire, resulting in a bandgap changing from 2.44 eV to 1.72 eV within one single nanowire. Such a nanowire can supply optical gain for both green and red lasing. By looping the segment with the large bandgap (CdS dominated) which emits green color light) of the nanowire, two individual cavities are formed within one nanowire: a looped circle cavity for confining the green (CdS dominated) the original wire cavity for confining the red (CdSe dominated) emission. Dual-color lasing was observed at the end face of the wire loop when the entire nanowire was optically pumped by a laser beam. Dynamic color control of the output lasing can be achieved by adjusting the relative intensity of two lasing modes through two pumping laser beams which independently pump each individual cavity. The continuous tunability of lasing color from green to yellow to red in a single nanowire device was observed. The approach has great potential in lasing display and white lasing lighting.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0120","num":"0119"},"figref":["FIG. 13A","FIG. 13B","FIG. 13A","FIG. 13B","FIG. 13B","FIG. 13B","FIG. 13B","FIG. 13C","FIG. 13B","FIG. 13D","FIG. 13D","FIG. 13B"],"b":["1","4","1","2","3","4","1","4","2","3","2","3","13","1","4","1","4","2","3"]},"In another embodiment, a {Cd}{SSe} nanosheet is used as the gain medium. An example of such a nanosheet is shown in side cross-sectional view in , as described above. In one example, the CdSSe laterally segmented nanosheets (i.e., heterostructure nanosheets) were grown through a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) approach using CdS and CdSe powders (Alfa Aesar, 99.99% purity) as source materials. A Si substrate with 10 nm Au film as catalyst was used for the growth. The reactor was first evacuated to a pressure below 0.2 Torr by a mechanical pump. 150 sccm Nwas then introduced into the system, and flow was maintained for 30 min prior to growth. In the first step of the growth, only CdS powder was thermally evaporated at 880\u00b0 C. for 1 hour. Subsequently, CdSe source was introduced into the furnace, while the temperature was gradually lowered to 840\u00b0 C. and held for 40 min to grow the CdSe-rich sections.

Such sequential growth ensures a wide CdS-rich center section surrounded by CdSe-rich edges (see ). The large width of CdS-rich sections is especially significant as it needs to be wide enough to achieve sufficient optical confinement for the shorter wavelength lasing modes.  shows the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of a CdSSe laterally segmented nanosheet.

As seen in the image, the nanosheet consists of three stripes with (green in color) emission in the center (grown initially with CdS-rich composition) and (red\/orange in color) emission on both edges (grown subsequently with CdSe-rich composition). The green stripe and the wider red\/orange stripe (on the right side of ) form two rectangular, coupled cavities in a side-by-side arrangement. With proper end facets, the three stripes can form three coupled cavities capable of supporting various propagating modes along the length direction. Of particular interest are the two wider stripes (the green one in the center and the red\/orange one on the right side) which form two rectangular, coupled cavities in a side-by-side arrangement (as also schematically shown in ).

It can be useful to determine the confinement factor, defined as the ration of the modal gain to the material gain, it can be significantly large in nanowires and nanobelts. The confinement factors for all of these modes are slightly larger than unity at 1.03. In general, modes of both wavelengths can be confined in either the CdS-rich or CdSe-rich segment due to the contrast between the refractive indices. However, only the modes in appropriate gain medium with wavelength inside the gain bandwidth have the possibility to lase. As a result, high gain modes at 534 nm (or 592 nm) can only lase in the CdS-rich (or CdSe-rich) active regions. The refractive index contrast and the gain selection ensure that the modes of both wavelengths are confined within their respective gain media without much leakage to the lossy regions. This is especially important for the green modes, so that they will not be subject to strong absorption by the narrow gap material of the CdSe-rich side.

The total spontaneous emission output increases much more slowly than the lasing modes in the high excitation region, demonstrating the typical behavior associated with the lasing threshold. The log-log scale of the lasing output as a function of the excitation power features the well-known S-like behavior with three significantly different regions. At low pumping, the spontaneous emission is dominant, so the mode intensities increase linearly with a slope of 1.1 for orange and 1.3 for green. Around the thresholds, the output intensities of both lasing modes show superlinear increases with slopes of 5.1 for orange and 4.7 for green. With further increase of the excitation power, the slopes of both curves return to 1.1, indicating the above-threshold lasing operation of both colors.
