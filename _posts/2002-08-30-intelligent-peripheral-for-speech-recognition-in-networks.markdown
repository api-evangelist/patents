{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","PRIOR ART ","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION ","DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS ","Parlay\/OSA API Embodiment","IN IVR (Intelligent Network Interactive Voice Response) Embodiment","EXAMPLE","OTHER EXAMPLES"],"p":["The present invention relates in general to a method for providing speech recognition and in particular for providing speech recognition as an add-on to a telecommunications network.","Voice dialing in mobile telephones has been a success, and this feature is rated as one of best and innovative features in new handsets. Since some years, a number of mobile telephones include Speech Recognition (SR). SR in mobile telephones facilitates performing of good SR-quality as it could be implemented as speaker-dependent since, most of the time, only one user uses the mobile telephone.","SR implemented in networks, however, is more difficult to perform, as a SR service in a network must be able to be used by many users, and, consequently, then, the SR service must be speaker-independent. SR in networks exists in some implementations today, but the trend is that it now starts to be commodity for many applications. Important to consider is that SR in mobile telephones (or other telecommunication apparatus) and SR in networks do not compete, as they cover different user needs.","SR in mobile telephones is of a personal nature. The user enters mostly his\/her own colleagues, relatives, and friends with names or sometimes with nicknames in the memory of the mobile telephone. Moreover, sometimes some names of companies, shops, etc. which are frequently called are entered into the memory of the mobile telephone. However, the whole catalogue of worldwide companies, people, etc. is not entered due to practical and technical reasons. One could say that SR in mobile telephones serves a calling party with his\/her personal needs. Of importance is also that the user of the mobile telephone is responsible for service management, i.e., to keep the entered list of names in the memory of the mobile telephone updated with relevant information.","Nowadays, for technical reasons, mobile telephones lack features such as:\n\n","Apart from SR in mobile telephones, SR is to some extent integrated in network products. Examples of deployed speech driven services nowadays are:\n\n","To build up an Intelligent Network (IN) system in a network to introduce IN based services is\n\n","This is also true for making changes in the IN system, working in the traditional way, including introduction of SR. Therefore, the ideal situation is if we can find a way when a new feature can be introduced with minimum needs (or no needs) for updating the IN system, hence the introduced new feature should be substantially transparent for the existing IN-system.","This invention makes it possible to introduce SR in an existing network, with minimal changes to the IN system. Upon that, the invention facilitates the use of SR, making it possible to talk in plain text with the system, not having to remember- or looking up telephone numbers or email addresses.","In this description, the service VPN is used as an example. The invention is, however, applicable to all IN based services (2G) and all 3G services where the user makes a call or sends an email to either a person, place or terminal or service. Examples of IN based services (2G) at state of the art networks today, where the invention can be used are Freephone (also known as 800-service), Premium rate (also known as 900-service), UPT, Credit Call, Televoting, 3G services, etc. Combinations are also allowed and shows the strength of the invention, as when UPT and VPN are combined, by building up a private VPN network, where all members are persons with individual UPT-addresses.","The present invention provides an intelligent peripheral as claimed in claim . Such an intelligent peripheral can be easily developed. Intelligent peripherals are already on the market and need only be amended with the functionality according to the present invention. They perform the speech-to-VPN-address transition for the network apparatus that controls the switch in the telecommunication network. In that sense, the intelligent peripheral is an easy add-on, installed substantially transparent to the existing network. There is no need to either change the network apparatus or the switch heavily. The network apparatus and the switch need only be programmed to communicate with the intelligent peripheral. No new standards are necessary for either the network apparatus or the switch, which is considered as an operational advantage for the network provider in reducing the threshold for deployment of the invention. In an embodiment, the intelligent peripheral stores VPN-addresses including at least one of the following sets: private persons, personal functions (as people's roles, my dentist, my plumber, my bank man, \u201cgrandmother\u201d, . . . ), specific terminals or services. The intelligent peripheral translates the spoken name of the persons, personal functions, specific terminals or services into a corresponding code of said person, function, terminal or service. These codes represents the person, function, terminal or service and are transferred to the network apparatus which translates them into the current place or terminal where the person, personal function, terminal or service are reached, like the fixed telephone addresses, mobile telephone addresses, e-mail addresses, and facsimile addresses. Then, this intelligent peripheral can easily be used for all kinds of telecommunication apparatus, like fixed telephones, mobile telephones, personal computers, lap tops, palm tops, personal digital assistants, facsimile machines, etc., provided that they are provided with a microphone to receive speech instructions from a user.","The present invention also relates to a telecommunication network.","In such a network, speech recognition may have the following advantages:\n\n","As said above, VPN is one possible service, used here as an example. The list of services where this concept may be used is not limited.","Since the intelligent peripheral may be provided as an add-on to the network apparatus within an IN-system or anywhere else in a network, the existing functionality of the network apparatus in the network and the network itself is maintained. For instance, the network apparatus may, as in the prior art, provide services like divert, voicemail, etc.","In one embodiment, the telecommunication network may support a Parlay\/OSA API architecture. Then, to that end, the network apparatus comprises a Service Capability Server (SCS) arranged to control the switch, and at least one application server connected to the SCS, the intelligent peripheral being also connected to the SCS and the application server.","In another embodiment, the telecommunication network supports an intelligent network (IN) architecture. Then, the network apparatus may comprise a SCP arranged to control the switch, the intelligent peripheral being also connected to the service control point. In still another embodiment, in an IN architecture, the UPT service may be used, with support of the invention in combination with information on actual location of a user, to provide location dependent switching. A user calling for a person with a certain profession, e.g. a dentist, will be connected to the closest dentist in the actual neighborhood of the user, by requesting for \u201cA dentist\u201d instead of \u201cMy dentist\u201d, which would be addressed as the user's dentist, probably residing in the user's hometown.","Finally, the invention relates to a data carrier provided with such a computer program product.","The evolution of intelligent capabilities in conventional switched networks and data networks has generated opportunities to expose control of many telecommunication network capabilities to enterprises outside of the network operators domain. Historically, these capabilities have been exclusively under the control and exploitation of the network operators themselves. This has particularly been as a result of incompatible standards but also to ensure network security and integrity. This has resulted in:\n\n","As to the network centric approach the following is observed. This is an excellent approach for simple mass-market applications. The services are relatively easy to manage and they can be built in a very robust fashion. The disadvantages of this architecture in the modern market place are significant, as already observed in the introduction. For example, because the network operator is responsible for the creation and operation of all applications it is difficult to achieve the necessary flexibility to deploy many customized versions of services to different customer groups. Also the time-to-market for new applications is too long. This is due to the prolonged application development phase plus the requirement of network operators for extensive integration testing. Both these phases are long because the specialist software developers and the network operators apply rigorous quality control to ensure both the robustness of the new application and avoid any adverse impact on existing network services.","As to the edge of network approach the following is observed. This approach is good for providing customized services to meet the specific needs of a customer. However, often the ability to use information or resources within the network domain would provide a more efficient solution than an edge of network approach, e.g., calls are often unnecessarily \u201ctromboned\u201d to and from edge of network devices.","Here, an arrangement is proposed that combines the benefits of the network centric approach of economies of scale and reliability, and those of the edge of network approach with its inherent flexibility.","In the arrangement as proposed, the application may be built, tested and operated by enterprises outside of the network domain. However, like in the network centric approach, access to network information and resources (e.g., like IVR's) and control of network capabilities are available to the enterprise domain.","Two approaches will be illustrated hereinafter as examples only. The first approach is a Parlay\/OSA API (OSA=Open System Architecture, API=Application Programming Interface), embodiment whereas the second approach is an IN embodiment.","In the Parlay\/OSA API Architecture (which is next generation network architecture) an Application Programming Interface resides between an application layer and a service component layer as illustrated in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0053"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["1","5","5","1","3"]},"The unified service network  comprises one or more service capability servers . These service capability servers  are all connected to one or more of the application servers\/applications , as shown.","The unified service network  is also connected to a connectivity\/backbone network  providing different network protocols to connect to a plurality of access networks. The access networks may comprise one or more of the following, i.e. all 2G and 3G networks are relevant:\n\n","Of course, other access networks (also those to be developed in the future) may be provided in the network architecture of .","Each of the access networks - is \u201cconnected\u201d to a plurality of telecommunication devices. Again, these connections may be physical connections (like copper wire or glass fibers) or wireless.  shows some examples of telecommunication devices widely used, e.g., a fixed telephone , a facsimile machine , a personal computer , a laptop , and one or more mobile telephones .","In accordance with the invention, each one of the telecommunication devices is provided with a microphone. The facsimile machine  is shown to be provided with a separate microphone , whereas the personal computer  is also provided with a separate microphone . However, these microphones - may be integrated in the facsimile machine and the personal computer , respectively. The laptop  is also provided with a microphone , however, this is shown to be integrated with the apparatus itself.","The personal computer  is further shown to comprise box  that is provided with the intelligence (processor), the memories and the disc drives, etc., as is known to a personal skilled in the art, a monitor , a keyboard  and a mouse . Of course, other internal and external devices extending the capabilities of the personal computer  may be provided, as is known to a person skilled in the art.","By enabling access to network capabilities via the Parlay\/OSA API, service providers, independent software venders and other developers in the IT (Information Technology) and telecommunication industries are empowered to generate a new range of applications that benefit from, add value to, functionality resident in public and\/or private communications networks. The Parlay\/OSA API does not need to directly open up the networks signaling of public users. Rather, network capabilities that are useful to enterprise business applications can be encapsulated and may be visible in a manner that maintains the integrity, performance and security of networks. Network integrity protection is an integral part of the Parlay\/OSA API design and implementation. Only by achieving high integrity with deployed API's will the operation of applications in the enterprise domain be effectively prevented from impacting existing network-hosted applications. New applications can be developed to meet the needs of a particular customer group and can be tested in isolation from existing network applications, thus, enabling both rapid development and flexibility.","The Parlay\/OSA API specifications are provided by the Parlay group which, nowadays, consists not only of the major telecom network suppliers but also of major IT vendors, as well as of the operators including Ericsson, British Telecom, France Telecom, AT&T, CSELT, Siemens, Nokia, Alcatel, Lucent, Fujitsu, IBM, Cisco, Compaq, Hewlett Packard, Microsoft, Logica, and others. These specifications are in the public domain and are, e. g., available on the Internet.","The current Parlay specification addresses call control, messaging, security, wireless services and IP (Internet Protocol) services. It is an open and technology-independent specification. The specification is based on an architecture with two categories of interfaces: service interfaces and framework interfaces.","The services interfaces offer access to network capabilities and information. In phase 2 of the development of Parlay\/OSA API, these interfaces are restricted to generic, enhanced, conference, multi-media, INAP (Intelligent Network Application Part) and CAP (Competitive Access Provider) call control, generic messaging, generic user interaction, collectivity management, location and user status services.","The framework interfaces provide the supporting capabilities necessary for the service interfaces to be secure, resilient, located and managed: authentication, authorization, service discovery, event notification, integrity management, heart beat mechanism, logging, auditing, service registration and subscription.","The Parlay\/OSA interface provides access to the network-held information and capabilities but by carefully encapsulating them in capability features and forcing the access to be integrated with its framework mechanisms, it ensures the network's integrity and safety.","The Parlay interface is, thus, well suited to bind the service network together with the connectivity\/backbone network  to give the service network a secure access to the access networks.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0074"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["43","43","7","7","7","42","44","46"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0075"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["49","9"]},"The SRUI SCS  is connected via a connection  with the SSP , and with one or more of the application servers\/applications  that are connected to the service capability server  via a connection . The connection  between the SSP  and the SRUI SCS  is preferably an ISDN connection. However, any other suitable connection may be provided instead. The SSP  is connected via a connection  to the service capability server  via, preferably, an INAP\/SS 7 link (Intelligent Network Application Protocol\/CCITT Signaling System number 7). These connections may be physical or wireless.","The OSA framework  offers Parlay authentication, access, initial and registration services.","The user interface UI  offers the Parlay generic user interaction services. The call control CC  offers the Parley generic call control services.","The SRUI SCS  is an intelligent peripheral that is arranged to communicate with the application servers\/applications , the call control CC , and the service switching point SSP . It can be provided as a separate box with the appropriate input and output connections to the others components shown. Therefore, the SRUI SCS  does not demand any physical change to the Parlay\/OSA API architecture as shown in . The only amendment needed is that the application servers\/applications , the call control CC , and the SSP  need by provided with appropriate functionality to allow communications with the SRUI SCS  to provide the required functionality.","The SRUI SCS is arranged such that it provides the Parlay user interaction service with text-to-speech and speech recognition functions. The order of the functioning may be as follows.","An incoming call from a party A desiring to reach a party B is reported from SSP  to call control CC . The CC  informs one of the application servers\/applications . That application server\/application , then, asks the SRUI SCS  to perform a speech recognition operation. The SRUI SCS  is provided with a processor (or a plurality of processors) (). This processor of the SRUI SCS  is arranged to receive the request of the application server\/application  for speech recognition. The processor, then, asks the call control CC  to ask the SSP  to set up a link between the party A and the SRUI SCS  via the SSP . After the SSP  has provided this link between the SRUI SCS  and party A, party A is requested to speak the name of party B. Of course, this name need not be the \u201creal\u201d name of party B. It can be any code or term under which party B is registered in a memory (not shown) of the SRUI SCS . Upon receiving the name of party B, SRUI SCS  translates the name of party B with its speech recognition function into the VPN-address of party B (VPN=Virtual Private Network). The VPN-address is sent by the SRUI SCS  to the requesting application server\/application . Upon receiving the VPN-address, the application server\/application  instructs the SRUI SCS  to release the connection with the SSP . To that end, the SRUI SCS  instructs the call control CC  to further instruct the SSP  to disconnect the speech channel between the SSP  and the SRUI SCS . Then, the application server\/application  is able to route the call from party A to party B in accordance with prior art operations, since it is now knowing the VPN-address of the party B to be called.","The application server\/application  may support known functions like divert, voice, etc.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0083"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},"Like reference numbers in  as in  refer to the same components. It is observed, that the personal computers  in  are provided with a box \u2032 instead of a box  as in . This is just to show that the box  may be provided in the form of a tower.","The architecture shown in  comprises a Service Control Point  (SCP) and a Speech Recognition Intelligent Peripheral (SR IP) . The SSP  is connected to the SCP  via a connection \u2032. Communication between the SSP  and the SCP  may be provided using the INAP (Intelligent.Network Application Protocol).","The SSP  is connected to the SR IP  via a connection \u2032. Communications between the SSP  and the SR IP  may be provided using SUP, INAP or ISDN (ISUP=Integrated Services User Part; ISDN=Integrated Services Digital Network). A typical sequence of operations in accordance with the invention may be as follows. A party A desiring to call a party B notifies in some predetermined way to the SSP  that it likes to use speech recognition, instead of normal dialing. This may be done in any suitable way, as having Speech Recognition \u201calways-on\u201d and all calls from A are automatically directed to the Speech Recognition function via the SSP, or by having a special telephone number to reach the Speech Recognition function via the SSP. In the latter case, this telephone number could be programmed into the terminal of the user and be initiated by a short code or by just talking to the Speech Recognition function in the terminal ordering it to initiate the number to the Speech Recognition function in the network which initiates a connection to the SSP. The SSP sets up a Speech channel to the SR IF . After this speech channel is established between SSP  and the SR IF , the SR IF  notifies the party A that it can now speak the name of party B. The spoken name of party B is sent to the SR IP  through SSP  via connection \u2032. The SR IP  translates the received spoken name of party B to the VPN-address of party B as stored in its memory (of ). It then sends this VPN-address via the SSP to the SCP . Upon having sent this VPN-address, the SR IF  releases its speech channel with SSP . At this IVR embodiment according to the present invention (the main idea is that the SCP should not have to be changed when Speech Recognition is introduced), the SCP receives a VPN-number, and does not know if Speech Recognition was involved or if it was a normal dialing of the VPN number.","Then, SCP  is able to route the call of party A to party B in accordance with prior art techniques, since it now knows the VPN-address of party B.","The SCP  may support known functions like divert, voice mail, etc.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0089"},"figref":["FIGS. 5 and 6","FIGS. 5 and 6"],"b":["41","40","41","40","49"]},"In the  one box ;  is shown to schematically indicate a location of an SCS or an SCP, respectively.

This could be done in different ways, like pressing a short code on the mobile phone or the personal computer, speaking a word to the Speech Recognition function on the mobile phone or the personal computer or simply dialing a telephone number.","(b) One such action by party A results in a connection set up through the network from party A to the Speech Recognition function performed by intelligent peripheral ;  in the network.

The present invention may provide for speech recognition in UPT ( ), for a Freephone, a Premium Rate, etc in an easy way.","By its nature, Speech Recognition (SR) will always fail in some cases. All systems fail sometimes and the strength of a system is how it handles those failures. Therefore the key question for SR (like any other system) is to find applications, which compensate for that fact. If an application can be found where the probability of SR failure is of the same small magnitude, or less, as other failure, due to technical reasons, user mistakes etc, the SR is of no problem. But, to be confident with SR, it is always good to have a backup alterative, just in case. (See below)","SR for initiation of a communication to a person by using name, for addressing email or initiating calls by phone or addressing Home pages, has many advantages:\n\n","One only has to say his\/her name as usual.\n\n","Typically, characteristics on the VPN service are, that it:\n\n","Further requirements could be added:\n\n","This is the reason why VPN or Centrex (which is similar to VPN) is a good choice as a first service example for SR, preferably a VPN or Centrex of a maximum of 500 persons.","The benefits of Name Addressing in a VPN\/Centrex is understood better with the following example:","During a Name Addressing in a company of 500 persons the SR system happens to understand the last name, e.g. \u201cKarlsson\u201d correctly but is in doubt of the first name. Was it \u201cJan\u201d, \u201cJohn\u201d or \u201cJohan\u201d? However, as there is a person in the directory, \u201cJohn Karlsson\u201d but no \u201cJan Karlsson\u201d or \u201cJohan Karlsson\u201d the first name has to be \u201cJohn\u201d.","So, even if one word is not understood exactly by the SR system, it can often in a VPN\/Centrex draw an intelligent conclusion and still find the right person.","Impact of Introduction of SR Services","Systems with a SR interface will sometimes fail, that is an axiom, which has to do with the nature of SR and the use of voice by the human beings.","What really is of interest when launching a service to the customer is not only the SR quality, it is the whole total solution that is important, that is how the situation is handled when SR fails. People can accept that SR fails some times (also telephone systems like GSM fails, not to mention the Internet). What is of importance is how the solution to handle the failure works. It is important that a backup exists and that the turnover to this feels smooth for the customer.","The use of SR within a VPN or within a Centrex-group increases the hit-rate, as the vocabulary is limited. The number of persons with the same or with similar names are simply less than in the public network. And for combinations of given names and family name it is even more true.","VPN and SR from the User Perspective","Here, it is described how a user in future can be able to use SR for reaching another person within the same company (the same VPN). The idea is that the user initially indicates in some way from his\/her Computer\/Mobile telephone\/fixed phone to a network that speech is to be used. It can be done by a certain telephone number to the","Name Addressing service, which could be inserted as a voice demand inserted in the terminal or as a short code. The network connects the user to the SR-device (the IP , ), which is directly connected to the directory of the company. Then the user gets a response that there is an SR ready to listen to him\/her. The user simply says the name of the one he\/she wants to reach and also indicates the wanted type of communication, like \u201cLars Svensson by phone\u201d or \u201cLars Svensson by mail\u201d. The SR system identifies in the first case the name and looks up the phone number of Lars Svensson in the directory, which shows where he wants to be reached (which terminal) for the moment and connects the user to that telephone number. If the user said \u201cLars Svensson by email\u201d, the email number of Lars Svensson was fetched from the directory and an email is sent.","It is important to smoothly handle situations where more than one person have the same name. The usage must feel natural for the user. For instance, when the system finds that there are two or more persons named \u201cLars Olsson\u201d, it can ask the user:\n\n","What is preferred in all man-machine dialogues is that the response time from the machine never exceeds 2 seconds. There is a huge risk that the user loses his interest in the current dialogue and if this repeats a couple of times the user could easily lose interest in the service or, even worse, the whole SR risks to get a bad reputation.","SR addressing has its clear advantages in some situations when it is difficult to use push buttons, like when driving and walking. Especially in the car, the usage of SR could minimise the risk of accidents. Also when dark, the use of the voice is superior to other ways of handing a terminal.","But there are also situations and places where SR addressing should be avoided. Best example is sending of a mail when being at the theatre.","The embodiments shown in  show that the speech recognition function provided by the invention is just an option. If the user does not wish to use the speech recognition offered by the SRUI SCS  or SR IP , respectively, he can simply make a direct call using the keys of his telecommunication apparatus. It is evident that the application of SRUI SCS  or SR IP  provides a simple solution to existing networks. The existing networks are still allowed to work with VPN-addresses of parties to be called. In the embodiment shown in , SCP  receives the VPN-address of party B and can operate in the same way as it is used to operate without speech recognition. The same is true for the embodiment of . In the embodiment of , it is the application server\/application  which is still able to operate with the VPN-address of party B to be called by party A since it receives the VPN-address from the SRUI SCS  that performs the speech recognition function required.","There are several backup possibilities if the speech recognition to be provided by SRUI SCS  or SR IP  fails. One possible backup option after failure of the speech recognition function is, that the application server\/application  informs the telecommunication apparatus of party A that the speech recognition has failed. This information may be provided either by a simulated voice message or a message in the display of the telecommunication apparatus.","Another backup possibility is that, if the telecommunication apparatus is a GSM or a DTMF fixed telephone, party A is requested to enter the name of party B by using the keys of the GSM or the DTMF fixed telephone to produce DTMF code that can be recognized by the SRUI SCS  or the SR IP , respectively.","Another option is that, if the telecommunication apparatus is a personal computer, party A is requested to simply key in the name of party B by means of keyboard .","A final fall back position is that party A is connected to an operator of the application server\/application  or the SCP , respectively.","Intelligent Peripheral","Both the SRUI SCS  and the SR IP  can be seen as an intelligent peripheral providing the services as defined earlier.  shows that the intelligent peripheral ,  is provided with a processor  and a memory , connected to the processor .","The processor  is arranged with suitable connections to communicate with the other devices shown in the , . This may be done in any way known to persons skilled in the art. The connections may be either fixed or wireless. The memory  may, as the case may be, be provided with one or more of the following memory units: hard disc, ROM (Read Only Memory), RAM (Random Access Memory) and EEPROM (Electrically Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory). Of course, other types of memory units may be provided. The processor  may be implemented as a plurality of processors, as the case may be.","Of course, the SRUI SCS  and SR IP  may be connected to other units (e.g., processors, memories, etc.).","The memory  stores VPN-addresses of a set of persons, personal functions, specific terminals or services. The memory  also stores instructions to provide the processor  with the required SR (and IVR) capacity.","Examples of deployment of (intelligent peripheral based) IVR within IN Services:\n\n","Speech recognition can enhance the effectiveness of call routing in Information and Business services.","Speech recognition technology can be integrated into IVR platforms. E.g. call centre and AST-DR (Announcement Service Terminal, Digital Recording).","Speaker Verification","This future feature, where a person is identified by his\/her voice will, will simplify the authentication process, bringing benefits in user acceptance and satisfaction\u2014\u201ceasy of use\u201d.
