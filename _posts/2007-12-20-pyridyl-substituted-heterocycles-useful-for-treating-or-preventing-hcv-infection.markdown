In particular, the present invention relates to pyridyl substituted heterocycles and corresponding hydro isomers, compositions thereof and the use of such compounds and compositions to inhibit HCV replication and\/or proliferation as a therapeutic approach towards the treatment and\/or prevention of HCV infections in humans and animals.","Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a global human health problem with approximately 150,000 new reported cases each year in the United States alone. HCV is a single stranded RNA virus, which is the etiological agent identified in most cases of non-A, non-B post-transfusion and post-transplant hepatitis and is a common cause of acute sporadic hepatitis (Choo et al., 244:359, 1989; Kuo et al., 244:362, 1989; and Alter et al., in , p. 83, 1989). It is estimated that more than 50% of patients infected with HCV become chronically infected and 20% of those develop cirrhosis of the liver within 20 years (Davis et al., 321:1501, 1989; Alter et al., in , p. 83, 1989; Alter et al, 327:1899, 1992; and Dienstag, 85:430, 1983) Moreover, the only therapy available for treatment of HCV infection is interferon-\u03b1 (INTRON\u00ae A, PEG-INTRON\u00ae A, Schering-Plough; ROFERON-A\u00ae, Roche), Most patients are unresponsive, however, and among the responders, there is a high recurrence rate within 6-12 months after cessation of treatment (Liang et al., 40:69, 1993). Ribavirin, a guanosine analog with broad spectrum activity against many RNA and DNA viruses, has been shown in clinical trials to be effective against chronic HCV infection when used in combination with interferon-\u03b1 (see, e.g., Poynard et al., 352:1426-1432, 1998; Reichard et al., 351:83-87, 1998), and this combination therapy has been recently approved (REBETRON, Schering-Plough). However, the response rate is still well below 50%. Therefore, additional compounds for treatment and prevention of HCV infection are needed.","In one aspect, the present invention provides pyridyl substituted heterocycles which are potent inhibitors of Hepatitis C virus (\u201cHCV\u201d) replication and\/or proliferation In one embodiment, the compounds are pyridyl substituted heterocycles and B-ring hydro isomers thereof according to structural formula (I), having the following \u201ccore\u201d and numbering convention:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0006","num":"0005"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"26.16mm","wi":"42.93mm","file":"US07714137-20100511-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"where the B ring is an aromatic or nonaromatic ring that includes from one to four heteroatoms.

Typically, a protecting group may be selectively removed as desired during the course of a synthesis. Examples of protecting groups can be found in Greene and Wuts, 3Ed., 1999, John Wiley & Sons, N.Y. and Harrison et al., , Vols, 1-8, 1971-1996, John Wiley & Sons, N.Y. Representative amino protecting groups include, but are not limited to, formyl, acetyl, trifluoroacetyl, benzyl, benzyloxycarbonyl (\u201cCBZ\u201d), tert-butoxycarbonyl (\u201cBoc\u201d), trimethylsilyl (\u201cTMS\u201d), 2-trimethylsilyl-ethanesulfonyl (\u201cSES\u201d), trityl and substituted trityl groups, allyloxycarbonyl, 9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (\u201cFMOC\u201d), nitro-veratryloxycarbonyl (\u201cNVOC\u201d) and the like. Representative, hydroxyl protecting groups include, but are not limited to, those where the hydroxyl group is either acylated (e.g., methyl and ethyl esters, acetate or propionate groups or glycol esters) or alkylated such as benzyl and trityl ethers, as well as alkyl ethers, tetrahydropyranyl ethers, trialkylsilyl ethers (e.g., TMS or TIPPS groups) and allyl ethers.","\u201cProdrug\u201d refers to a derivative of an active compound (drug) that undergoes a transformation under the conditions of use, such as within the body, to release an active drug. Prodrugs are frequently, but not necessarily, pharmacologically inactive until converted into the active drug. Prodrugs are typically obtained by masking a functional group in the drug believed to be in part required for activity with a progroup (defined below) to form a promoiety which undergoes a transformation, such as cleavage, under the specified conditions of use to release the functional group, and hence the active drug. The cleavage of the promoiety may proceed spontaneously, such as by way of a hydrolysis reaction, or it may be catalyzed or induced by another agent, such as by an enzyme, by light, by acid, or by a change of or exposure to a physical or environmental parameter, such as a change of temperature. The agent may be endogenous to the conditions of use, such as an enzyme present in the cells to which the prodrug is administered or the acidic conditions of the stomach, or it may be supplied exogenously. In a specific embodiment, the term prodrug includes hydro isomers of the compounds of the invention. Such hydro isomers encompassed by the invention can be oxidized under physiological conditions to the corresponding aromatic ring system.","A wide variety of progroups, as well as the resultant promoieties, suitable for masking functional groups in active compounds to yield prodrugs are well-known in the art. For example, a hydroxyl functional group may be masked as a sulfonate, ester or carbonate promoiety, which may be hydrolyzed in vitro to provide the hydroxyl group. An amino functional group may be masked as an amide, imine, phosphinyl, phosphonyl, phosphoryl or sulfenyl promoiety, which may be hydrolyzed in vitro to provide the amino group. A carboxyl group may be masked as an ester (including silyl esters and thioesters), amide or hydrazide promoiety, which may be hydrolyzed in vivo to provide the carboxyl group. Other specific examples of suitable progroups and their respective promoieties will be apparent to those of skill in the art.","\u201cProgroup\u201d refers to a type of protecting group that, when used to mask a functional group within an active drug to form a promoiety, converts the drug into a prodrug. Progroups are typically attached to the functional group of the drug via bonds that are cleavable under specified conditions of use. Thus, a progroup is that portion of a promoiety that cleaves to release the functional group under the specified conditions of use. As a specific example, an amide promoiety of the formula \u2014NH\u2014C(O)CHcomprises the progroup \u2014C(O)CH.","\u201cSilyl ether\u201d refers to a type of protecting group that, when used to mask a hydroxyl group within an active drug to form a promoiety, converts the drug into a prodrug. Silyl ethers are known in the art and refer to a removable group which will prevent a hydroxy group from participating in a reaction performed on the molecule. Such groups are discussed by T. W. Greene in chapters 2 and 7 of Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, John Wiley and Sons, N.Y., 1981, and by J. W. Barton in chapter 2 of Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry, J. F. W. McOmie, ed., Plenum Press, New York, 1973, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. Silyl ethers include, for example, trimethylsilyl, triethylsilyl, t-butyl dimethyl silyl and methyl-diisopropylsilyl groups.","\u201cSubstituted,\u201d when used to modify a specified group or radical, means that one or more hydrogen atoms of the specified group or radical are each, independently of one another, replaced with the same or different substituent(s).

The formulations of compounds can be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose sealed containers, such as ampules and vials. Injection solutions and suspensions can be prepared from sterile powders, granules, and tablets of the kind previously described.","The pharmaceutical preparation is preferably in unit dosage form. In such form the preparation is subdivided into unit doses containing appropriate quantities of the active component. The unit dosage form can be a packaged preparation, the package containing discrete quantities of preparation, such as packeted tablets, capsules, and powders in vials or ampoules. Also, the unit dosage form can be a capsule, tablet, cachet, or lozenge itself, or it can be the appropriate number of any of these in packaged form. The composition can, if desired, also contain other compatible therapeutic agents.","In therapeutic use for the treatment of HCV infection, the compounds utilized in the pharmaceutical method of the invention are administered to patients diagnosed with HCV infection at dosage levels suitable to achieve therapeutic benefit. By therapeutic benefit is meant that the administration of compound leads to a beneficial effect in the patient over time. For example, therapeutic benefit is achieved when the HCV titer or load in the patient is either reduced or stops increasing. Therapeutic benefit is also achieved if the administration of compound slows or halts altogether the onset of the organ damage or other adverse symptoms that typically accompany HCV infections, regardless of the HCV titer or load in the patient.","The compounds of the invention and\/or compositions thereof may also be administered prophylactically in patients that are at risk of developing HCV infection, or who have been exposed to HCV, to prevent the development of HCV infection. For example, the compounds of the invention and\/or compositions thereof may be administered to hospital workers accidentally stuck with needles while working with HCV patients to lower the risk of, or avoid altogether, developing an HCV infection.","Initial dosages suitable for administration to humans may be determined from in vitro assays or animal models. For example, an initial dosage may be formulated to achieve a serum concentration that includes the ICof the particular compound being administered, as measured in an in vitro assay. Alternatively, an initial dosage for humans may be based upon dosages found to be effective in animal models of HCV infection, as is well-known in the art. Exemplary suitable model systems are described in Muchmore, 2001, Immumol. Rev. 183:86-93 and Lanford & Bigger, 2002, Virology 293(i):1-9 and the references cited therein, the disclosure of which are incorporated herein by reference. As one example, the initial dosage may be in the range of about 0.001 mg\/kg to about 1000 mg\/kg daily. A daily dose range of about 0.01 mg\/kg to about 500 mg\/kg, or about 0.1 mg\/kg to about 200 mg\/kg, or about 1 mg\/kg to about 100 mg\/kg, or about 10 mg\/kg to about 50 mg\/kg, can also be used. The dosages, however, may be varied depending upon the requirements of the patient, the severity of the condition being treated, and the compound being employed. The size of the dose also will be determined by the existence, nature, and extent of any adverse side-effects that accompany the administration of a particular compound in a particular patient Determination of the proper dosage for a particular situation is within the skill of the practitioner. Generally, treatment is initiated with smaller dosages which are less than the optimum dose of the compound. Thereafter, the dosage is increased by small increments until the optimum effect under circumstances is reached For convenience, the total daily dosage may be divided and administered in portions during the day, if desired.","7.4 Combination Therapy","In certain embodiments of the present invention, the compounds of the invention and\/or compositions thereof can be used in combination therapy with at least one other therapeutic agent. A compound of the invention and\/or composition thereof and the therapeutic agent can act additively or, more preferably, synergistically. In a preferred embodiment, a compound of the invention and\/or a composition thereof is administered concurrently with the administration of another therapeutic agent. In another embodiment, a compound of the invention and\/or composition thereof is administered prior or subsequent to administration of another therapeutic agent.","In one embodiment, the compounds of the invention and\/or compositions thereof can be used in combination therapy with other antiviral agents In an embodiment, the compounds of the invention and\/or compositions thereof can be used in combination therapy with interferon-\u03b1. In another embodiment, the compounds of the invention and\/or compositions thereof can be used in combination therapy with ribavarin.

Then, the test compound (in a volume of about 10 \u03bcl) was added at various concentrations to each well and the cells were incubated for an additional 24 hours before luciferase assay. The cells were harvested, and HCV replication or translation was monitored via a reporter assay, e.g., a luciferase reporter assay. The media was aspirated from each cell and Bright-Glo (Pharmacia, Peapack, N.J.) luciferase assay reagents were added to each well according to the manufacturer's instructions. In this assay, the amount of test compound that yielded a 50% reduction in luciferase emission (IC) was determined.","Certain exemplary compounds of the invention were also tested for their ability to inhibit HCV replication using a quantitative Western blot analysis with antibodies specific for certain HCV proteins. In this assay, the amount of test compound that yielded a 50% reduction in the amount of the specified HCV protein as compared to a control sample (IC) was determined.","The results of the Replicon and Western blot assays are provided in TABLE 1, below.

counter screen was used to identify non-specific inhibitors of the reporter gene. In the counter screen, a cell line carrying a construct such as a CMV-driven luciferase gene was used to identify compounds that inhibit the reporter gene, and not HCV. ICvalues were greater than 10 \u03bcM in the counter screen luciferase inhibition assay for many of the compounds. Standard cell proliferation assays were used to determine cytotoxicity of the compounds of the invention. The measured LDs for many of the compounds were greater 10 \u03bcM, which confirmed that the results reflected reduced viral production not cell death.","A TaqMan RT-PCR assay (Roche Molecular Systems, Pleasanton, Calif.) was used to analyze HCV RNA copy numbers, which confirmed that the viral genome of HCV is not being replicated.

Acetylenic Cross-Coupling Reactions","The appropriately substituted o-bromonitrobenzene or substituted o-iodonitrobenzene was dissolved in a suitable solvent such as p-dioxane or THF and then treated with at least five molar equivalents of a suitable amine base, which could be triethylamine, diethylamine or diisopropylethylamine. Alternatively, the amine base alone could be used as the solvent. A stream of argon gas was then bubbled through the solution for several minutes, followed by the addition of dichlorobis(triphenylphosphine) palladium (II) (3-4 mole percent), CuI (6-8 mole percent) and finally trimethylsilylacetylene (1.2-1.5 molar equivalents). The reaction mixture was then heated at 50-80\u00b0 C. until the reaction was complete, as monitored by TLC or LC-MS. When the more reactive substituted o-iodonitrobenzenes were used, the acetylenic cross-coupling reaction could be performed at room temperature. If the reaction appeared sluggish, additional trimethylsilylacetylene was added. This general procedure is known in the literature as the Sonogashira coupling (K. Sonogashira et al., Tetrahedron Lett., 1975, 4467). The reaction mixture was then diluted with ethyl acetate and this solution was washed several times with brine. Alternatively, the crude reaction mixture was filtered over a pad of Celite, then diluted with ethyl acetate and washed with brine. The organic layer so obtained was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated to dryness under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by column chromatography on silica gel, eluting with mixtures of ethyl acetate and hexanes to give the desired substituted o-(trimethylsilylethynyl)nitrobenzenes.","Step 2. Reduction of the Nitro Group to Amines","The substituted o-(trimethylsilylethynyl)nitrobenzene prepared in Step 1 was dissolved in a mixture of 10-15 volume percent of concentrated hydrochloric acid in methanol. Then, iron powder (Aldrich Chemical Co.) (5-10 molar equivalents) was added and the mixture was heated at 70-80\u00b0 C. for 3-4 h. This reaction can be highly exothermic when performed on a large scale. After, cooling to room temperature, the reaction mixture was filtered over Celite and the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was dissolved in ethyl acetate and then carefully washed with either aqueous sodium hydroxide or aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution. The aqueous layer was discarded and the organic layer was washed with brine, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated to dryness under reduced pressure. If necessary the crude product could be purified by column chromatography on silica gel, eluting with mixtures of hexanes and ethyl acetate to give the desired substituted o-(trimethylsilylethynyl)anilines.","Step 3. Removal of the Trimethylsilyl Group from the Acetylenes","The substituted o-(trimethylsilylethynyl)aniline prepared in Step 2 was dissolved in methanol containing 2-5% water. If the solubility of the aniline in methanol was poor, an appropriate amount of tetrahydrofuran (THF) was used as a co-solvent. Then anhydrous potassium carbonate (1 molar equivalent) was added and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1-24 h until the reaction was complete by TLC analysis. The reaction mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure and the residue was dissolved in ethyl acetate and washed with brine. The organic layer was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. The substituted o-aminophenylacetylenes could be purified by column chromatography on silica gel, eluting with hexanes and ethyl acetate, if necessary.","Step 4. Introduction of the Haloacetamide or Dihaloacetamide Side Chains","The substituted o-aminophenylacetylene prepared in Step 3 was dissolved in dichloromethane. Triethylamine (1.3 molar equivalents) was added and the solution was cooled in an ice-bath under nitrogen. Then a solution of haloacetyl chloride or dihaloacetyl chloride (1.0 molar equivalents) in dichloromethane was added dropwise. After the addition was complete, the reaction was allowed to stir 0.5-1 h at 0\u00b0 C. and then allowed to warm to room temperature. After a total of 1-4 h reaction time the reaction mixture was diluted with water. The organic layer was separated and further washed with saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution and brine. The organic layer was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure to give the substituted 2-halo- or 2,2-dihalo-N-(2-ethynylphenyl)acetamide. Alternatively, the substituted o-aminophenylacetylene starting material was dissolved in dichloromethane and treated successively with 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (1 molar equivalent), the halo- or dihaloacetic acid (1 molar equivalent) and finally triethylamine (1 molar equivalent). The reaction mixture was then stirred at room temperature until the substituted o-aminophenylacetylene starting material was consumed as determined by TLC analysis. The mixture was washed with water and the organic layer was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated to dryness under reduced pressure to give either the substituted 2-halo- or 2,2-dihalo-N-(2-ethynylphenyl)acetamides.","Method G (See )","An appropriately substituted o-iodoaniline or o-bromoaniline starting material was coupled with trimethylsilylacetylene as described in Step 1 of Method F. The resulting substituted o-(trimethylsilylethynyl)aniline was then deprotected using the procedure described in Step 3 of Method F to give the substituted o-aminophenylacetylene which was then converted to the desired 2-halo- or 2,2-dihalo-N-(2-ethynylphenyl)acetamide as described in Step 4 of Method F.","Method H (See )","Introduction of the Haloacetamide or Dihaloacetamide Side Chains","The p-aminophenylacetylene, purchased from Aldrich Chemical Co was dissolved in dichloromethane. Triethylamine (b . molar equivalents) was added and the solution was cooled in an ice-bath under nitrogen. Then a solution of haloacetyl chloride or dihaloacetyl chloride (1.0 molar equivalents) in dichloromethane was added dropwise. After the addition was complete, the reaction was allowed to stir 0.5-1 h at 0\u00b0 C. and then allowed to warm to room temperature. After a total of 1-4 h reaction time the reaction mixture was diluted with water The organic layer was separated and further washed with saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution and brine. The organic layer was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure to give the substituted 2-halo- or 2,2-dihalo-N-(4-ethynylphenyl) acetamide. Alternatively, the substituted p-aminophenylacetylene starting material was dissolved in dichloromethane and treated successively with 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (1 molar equivalent), the halo- or dihaloacetic acid (1 molar equivalent) and finally triethylamine (1 molar equivalent). The reaction mixture was then stirred at room temperature until the substituted p-aminophenylacetylene starting material was consumed as determined by TLC analysis. The mixture was washed with water and the organic layer was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated to dryness under reduced pressure to give either the substituted 2-halo- or 2,2-dihalo-N-(4-ethynylphenyl)acetamides.","All publications, patents and patent applications cited in this specification are herein incorporated by reference as if each individual publication, patent or patent application were specifically and individually indicated to be incorporated by reference.","Although the foregoing invention has been described in some detail by way of illustration and example for purposes of clarity of understanding, it will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art in light of the teachings of this invention that certain changes and modifications may be made thereto without departing from the spirit or scope of the appended claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"5.
