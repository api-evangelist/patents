title: Magnetic cutting board
abstract: A cutting board comprising a base and a working board held together by magnets, aligning pins, or fingers on the base gripping the working cutting board. The base has cut-outs so that a plate, tray, or shallow bowl can be slid under the board permitting the cuttings to be slid off the board into the bowl without having to lift the board, likely tilting it and spilling the cuttings and/or juices or dumping separated portions of the cut food.

Field of Invention","Kitchen equipment, food cutting boards","2. Description of Prior Art","The common cutting board used for food preparation is a single flat plate of wood or plastic and is set directly on the kitchen counter top or preparation table, and are prone to sliding during use; picking up contamination from food, water, and cleaning residue on the counter top, or depositing similar onto the counter top; possibly scratching the counter top; rocking if the board or counter top is warped or not flat; difficulty in picking up because of it being directly on the counter top; etc. Moreover, when it is time to move the cuttings to a serving or mixing bowl, the board must be lifted and\/or carried to the receiving vessel. While it is being so moved, there being no retaining lips, spillage is common, especially if the cut-up material is juicy. Care must be taken to ensure that there is no cross contamination of the foods prepared on a board, especially between meat products and vegetables, and between beef and poultry. Health authorities recommend separate boards for each category of foods. Wooden boards are particularly prone to cross contamination as they have a propensity to soak up juices and are difficult to clean thoroughly and deeply. Plastics such as polypropylene, polyethylene, Nylon, Teflon, ABS, and the like are used in the trade. High-density wood fiber laminates have been found to have the desired characteristics. Plastic boards nick and score easily, and when scored, the furrow is edged with a raised burr. Users criticize plastic as tending to dull knives. Both plastic and wood can be resurfaced a few times reasonably well by sanding, filing, scraping or a combination of these simple procedures. Plastic boards, unlike wood, are generally resistant to bleaches and other strong disinfectant chemicals and may be put into the dishwasher for washing.","U.S. Pat. No. 7,125,011, Oct. 24, 2006 by Kevin McLaughlin in one mode is a set of relatively thin and flexible plastic sheets bonded to together by sheet magnets. The sheets are separated for use as individual boards each dedicated to compatible foods. Another mode of cutting board design taught by McLaughlin is a more rigid board with magnets at the corners on one side (4:9-25). McLaughlin teaches only that the magnets are for stacking boards and for adhering to a refrigerator for storage. No base for his cutting board is mentioned. One problem with having a magnetic underside or spot magnets mounted on the underside is that the magnets may pick up ferrous particles. Not common, but may be on the counter top from several sources, in particular, from sharpening steel knives over the counter top. The particles will accumulate on the magnets and surely will mar the counter top as the board slides about in use.","GB2311460, by Nigel Bruce Hinton shows a one-piece board system comprising a cutting surface attached to a base. The board portion is larger than the base and the overhang is used to slide rectangular trays or plates to receive the cuttings from the cutting board. Furthermore, the base portion has at least one arcuate cut-out to receive rounded plates or trays for receiving cuttings.","Joseph-Joseph Ltd. dual magnetic cutting board, Patent application GB 0526482.5 (abandoned) wwwjosephjoseph.com. Anthony Joseph and Richard Joseph The Joseph-Joseph board is a rectangular plastic working plate and a solid rectangular wooden base system. Both have magnets, arranged N-S to attract, embedded flush in the corners of both the base and cutting plate. The cutting board is held securely to the base solely by magnetic attraction.","None of these address all the objections identified above.","To overcome the problems of sliding, off-loading, and cleaning, a board or boards with a base having friction feet and removable working boards is described as the solution to all the identified problems of the usual cutting board operation.","It is an object of the invention is to provide a base with friction feet to inhibit sliding.","Another object of the invention is to provide a base with recesses for sliding a plate, tray, or shallow bowl under the board so that the cuttings may be swept into the bowl.","Another object of the invention is to use a common base adapted to receive any of several interchangeable cutting boards.","Another object of the invention is to permit the cutting boards to be removed and cleaned separately from the base.","Two models are described. Both have a mounting base with non-skid feet and a removable cutting surface of plastic or wood. In use, the cutting board part and the base part form a firm one-piece structure easily separated for cleaning or swapping boards dedicated to different food groups. The base structure is either a wood or plastic plate generally shaped like the cutting board, but having cut-outs to receive a plate or tray under the cutting surface so that the cut-up food may be swept onto the receiving plate without having to lift either the food or the board. An alternative base structure is formed in the general shape of a four legged X, although 3, 5 or more legs may be used. The bottom sides of the legs, like the full size bases, are equipped with feet to prevent sliding on a kitchen counter top.","The cutting board and base are joinable by several methods. The first group is mechanical uses edge capture, pins, bosses, etc. and a second group uses cooperating magnets to provide holding forces. Both groups hold the cutting board and base in fixed relationships and can be disassembled with a minimum of skill and effort.","The mechanically fastened board system uses bosses at the corners of the base to form edges to prevent the cutting board from sliding off the base. The preferred shape of the base is an X shape with the space between the X legs comprising a space for receiving a plate, tray, or shallow bowl waiting for the cuttings to be swept onto the plate or tray the same as for the magnetic version.","The X base may have a square outline as illustrated, for receiving a square or circular cutting board, or the base may be elongated to receive a rectangular, oval, custom, whimsical, or novelty shaped board.","The magnetically fastened board system uses permanent magnets in the base and cutting board to hold the cutting board to the base. As many magnets as needed are used, generally four or six embedded flush in both the cutting board and the base. The magnet positions and polarization's (N-S) are arranged cooperatively. The pattern of the magnets is symmetrical so that for square, rectangular, or round cutting boards, the board may be magnetically attached to the base in any of several equivalent positions.","By having the magnets sized to be flush with both sides of the cutting board, the board may be reversible for use on both sides. Note, however, that the set of magnets has to have the symmetry altered so that the N-S relationships can be maintained in both the regular and inverted position.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"b":"1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"b":"2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"b":"3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"b":"4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"b":"5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"b":"6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"b":"7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"b":"8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"b":"9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"b":"10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"b":"11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"b":"12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"b":"13"},"Referring to , , , and , the base assembly  shown in  shows the application of walls or raised fingers  at the outer edges of the base, where the walls  extend upwardly from the base  and form a cup-like holder for receiving the cutting plate .

Alternatively, two sets of magnets may be installed; one set on each side.","Referring to ,  illustrates a larger fill-size baseboard with magnets for attachment of the cutting board, whereas  and its derivatives show an X configuration The variations in attachment shown in  are usable and applicable to the other shaped base forms like those of .","Cut out  here is shown as arcuate, but any shape will work as long as it admits a food receiving plate under the cutting board itself The boards may be heavy so as many magnets  as needed to hold them securely are installed. The six shown are illustrative. Note that they are in a pattern symmetrical about more than one axis. This permits the boards to be attached in at least two positions. Furthermore, when the board is elongated as shown in , the central magnets are arranged along the longer axis of the board instead of along the shorter axis. It has been found that when central magnets are placed on the shorter axis, they tend to \u201csnag\u201d as the boards are brought together or separated with a sliding motion from the side, which is a common, natural movement.","The magnetic boards are most easily separated by sliding them apart, however, they may be pulled apart \u201cflat-way\u201d. This takes considerable force to initiate separation, but is practical.","The initial \u201cflat-ways\u201d separation can also be accomplished without pulling by using a lever means to initially force the magnets apart. A property of magnets is that the attraction force is greatest when they are very close together or touching, and the force diminishes rapidly with separation. Therefore, a lever device need only separate the plates a few hundredths of an inch to release the firm grip. This movement is easily accomplished with a small lever of the first class or a simple rotating lever system.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0062"},"figref":["FIGS. 1 & 2","FIG. 9"],"b":"10"},"The cutting board and base are brought together with the holding means in cooperative alignment and the cutting surface used conventionally. When finished cutting, a plate or tray is passed into the cut-out under the cutting board and the cut up food is swept off the board into the plate. The base and cutting board are then separated by pulling apart and the cutting board is cleaned and sterilized in the usual manner."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 5"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIG. 9"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":["FIG. 11","FIG. 9"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIG. 12","FIGS. 5 and 6"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
