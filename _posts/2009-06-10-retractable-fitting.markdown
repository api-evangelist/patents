title: Retractable fitting
abstract: A retractable fitting assembly may include a cover that is rotatable around a first axis between closed and open positions, and a fitting that is rotatable around a second axis between closed and open positions. The first and second axes may be spaced apart and generally parallel. The direction of rotation of the fitting from the closed position to the open position may be opposite the direction of rotation of the cover from the closed position to the open position. In the closed position of the cover and the open position of the fitting, at least a portion of the cover abuts the fitting to thereby hinder rotation of the fitting.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for Governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.","The invention relates, in general, to fittings, and, in particular, to retractable fittings.","Known methods for securing pallets and containers for transportation may be time-consuming. Hardware such as straps, chains, stanchions, and lumber for blocking and bracing may be required. Fittings incorporated into decks, floors, walls, bulkheads, trailer beds, railroad cars, pick-up trucks, warehouse floors, cargo areas, and the like are known, but many of these fittings may not be retractable. Retractable fittings may be desirable because, when the fittings are retracted, the fittings may not obstruct the surrounding surface.","The Joint Modular Intermodal Container (JMIC) is known, for example, from U.S. patent application publication 20070215015, published on Sep. 20, 2007, which is hereby expressly incorporated by reference. JMICs may be equipped with interface fittings located at each top corner and receivers located at each bottom corner. When JMICs are stacked on one another, the fittings of the lower JMIC may fit into the receivers of the top JMIC. The JMICs may be locked to each other utilizing a locking feature. The locking capability may be used to lock JMICs to a deck that is equipped with JMIC type interface fittings. JMIC type deck fittings may enable JMICs to be secured in place on any deck surface, whether stationary or moveable. The deck fitting may be required to lock in a vertical position to ensure proper JMIC interface and locking. The deck fitting may allow JMICs to be secured in position easily without tools or hardware, thereby eliminating stanchions, straps, or chains commonly used for securing loads.","Fittings incorporated into decks, platforms, and floors may be required to be retractable or removable so that pallets and containers other than JMICs may be placed without interference. In addition, retractable fittings may allow unobstructed access for forklift and pallet trucks, and may remove potential tripping hazards to personnel. An additional benefit of retractable fittings may be for use as a general tie-down for pallets and containers, other than JMIC. Retractable deck fittings may greatly increase the efficiency of securing cargo, compared to current methods, and may eliminate the need for additional hardware. Retractable fittings may be desirable anywhere an anchor point may be needed, such as, for example, a pick-up truck bed, an industrial plant, a piece of machinery, recreational equipment, and countless other areas.","An aspect of the invention may be a retractable fitting assembly. The retractable fitting assembly may include a cover that is rotatable around a first axis between closed and open positions, and a fitting that is rotatable around a second axis between closed and open positions. The first and second axes may be spaced apart and generally parallel. A direction of rotation of the fitting from the closed position to the open position may be opposite a direction of rotation of the cover from the closed position to the open position. In the closed position of the cover and the open position of the fitting, at least a portion of the cover may abut the fitting.","An underside of the cover may include a cradle. In the closed position of the fitting and the closed position of the cover, a portion of the fitting may rest in the cradle. The fitting may include an eyelet type fitting.","The retractable fitting assembly may further include a first base for the cover. The first base may include a pin that may correspond to the first axis.","The retractable fitting assembly may further include a second base for the fitting, and a clamp fixed to the second base. The clamp and the second base may define an opening in which a portion of the fitting may be disposed. The portion of the fitting disposed in the opening may correspond to the second axis. A plate may include the first base and the second base. A cross-section of the fitting may be substantially circular.","The retractable fitting assembly may further include at least one fastener for fixing the clamp to the second base. An underside of the cover may include at least one recess. In the closed position of the cover, a portion of at least one fastener may be disposed in the recess in the underside of the cover.","The retractable fitting assembly may further include a second cover that is rotatable around a third axis between closed and open positions, and a second fitting that is rotatable around a fourth axis between closed and open positions. The third and fourth axes may be spaced apart from each other and may be generally parallel to the first and second axes. A direction of rotation of the second fitting from the closed position to the open position may be opposite a direction of rotation of the second cover from the closed position to the open position. In a closed position of the second cover and an open position of the second fitting, at least a portion of the second cover may abut the second fitting to thereby hinder rotation of the second fitting. The plate may include additional bases for the second cover and the second fitting.","The clamp and the plate may define a second opening in which a portion of the second fitting may be disposed. The portion of the second fitting disposed in the second opening may correspond to the fourth axis.","Another aspect of the invention may be a method that may include rotating a cover in a first direction around a first axis from a closed position to an open position, and rotating a fitting in a second direction that is opposite the first direction around a second axis from a closed position to an open position. The second axis may be spaced apart from and generally parallel to the first axis. The method may include rotating the cover from the open position to the closed position, and abutting at least a portion of the cover, in the closed position, against the fitting, in the open position, to thereby hinder rotation of the fitting.","The method may further include resting a portion of the fitting in a cradle on an underside of the cover when the fitting is in the closed position and the cover is in the closed position.","The invention will be better understood, and further objects, features, and advantages thereof will become more apparent from the following description of the exemplary embodiments, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["10","10","12","14","14","14","14"]},"Assembly  may include a cover  that may be rotatable around an axis AA between closed and open positions.

The direction of rotation of the fitting  from the open position to the closed position is opposite the direction of rotation of the cover  from the open position to the closed position, and vice versa.","The fitting  may be, for example, an \u201ceyelet\u201d type fitting.

When the fitting  and cover  are both in closed position, a portion  of fitting  may rest in cradle .
