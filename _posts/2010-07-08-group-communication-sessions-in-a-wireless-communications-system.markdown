title: Group communication sessions in a wireless communications system
abstract: In an embodiment, an access terminal (AT), requests a non-exclusive floor (NEF) for a group communication session (GCS) in response to a detection that a user of the AT intends to speak to an associated communication group (CG). In another embodiment, the AT later requests that its NEF for the GCS be revoked in response to a detection that the user of the AT no longer intends to speak to the CG. In another embodiment, another AT holds a NEF for the GCS, and a user of the AT decides to revoke the other AT's NEF such that the AT sends a floor-revocation request to an application server (AS) that is arbitrating the GCS. In another embodiment, the AS grants NEFs to multiple ATs, selectively mixes media received from the ATs for transmission to the CG, and selectively revokes NEFs from one or more of the multiple ATs.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["1. Field of the Invention","Embodiments of the present invention are directed to group communication sessions in a wireless communications session.","2. Description of the Related Art","Wireless communication systems have developed through various generations, including a first-generation analog wireless phone service (1G), a second-generation (2G) digital wireless phone service (including interim 2.5G and 2.75G networks) and a third-generation (3G) high speed data\/Internet-capable wireless service. There are presently many different types of wireless communication systems in use, including Cellular and Personal Communications Service (PCS) systems. Examples of known cellular systems include the cellular Analog Advanced Mobile Phone System (AMPS), and digital cellular systems based on Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA), Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA), the Global System for Mobile access (GSM) variation of TDMA, and newer hybrid digital communication systems using both TDMA and CDMA technologies.","The method for providing CDMA mobile communications was standardized in the United States by the Telecommunications Industry Association\/Electronic Industries Association in TIA\/EIA\/IS-95-A entitled \u201cMobile Station-Base Station Compatibility Standard for Dual-Mode Wideband Spread Spectrum Cellular System,\u201d referred to herein as IS-95. Combined AMPS & CDMA systems are described in TIA\/EIA Standard IS-98. Other communications systems are described in the IMT-2000\/UM, or International Mobile Telecommunications System 2000\/Universal Mobile Telecommunications System, standards covering what are referred to as wideband CDMA (WCDMA), CDMA2000 (such as CDMA2000 1xEV-DO standards, for example) or TD-SCDMA.","In wireless communication systems, mobile stations, handsets, or access terminals (AT) receive signals from fixed position base stations (also referred to as cell sites or cells) that support communication links or service within particular geographic regions adjacent to or surrounding the base stations. Base stations provide entry points to an access network (AN)\/radio access network (RAN), which is generally a packet data network using standard Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) based protocols that support methods for differentiating traffic based on Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. Therefore, the base stations generally interact with ATs through an over the air interface and with the AN through Internet Protocol (IP) network data packets.","In wireless telecommunication systems, Push-to-talk (PTT) capabilities are becoming popular with service sectors and consumers. PTT can support a \u201cdispatch\u201d voice service that operates over standard commercial wireless infrastructures, such as CDMA, FDMA, TDMA, GSM, etc. In a dispatch model, communication between endpoints (ATs) occurs within virtual groups, wherein the voice of one \u201ctalker\u201d is transmitted to one or more \u201clisteners.\u201d A single instance of this type of communication is commonly referred to as a dispatch call, or simply a PTT call. A PTT call is an instantiation of a group, which defines the characteristics of a call. A group in essence is defined by a member list and associated information, such as group name or group identification.","Conventionally, data packets within a wireless communications network have been configured to be sent to a single destination or access terminal. A transmission of data to a single destination is referred to as \u201cunicast\u201d. As mobile communications have increased, the ability to transmit given data concurrently to multiple access terminals has become more important. Accordingly, protocols have been adopted to support concurrent data transmissions of the same packet or message to multiple destinations or target access terminals. A \u201cbroadcast\u201d refers to a transmission of data packets to all destinations or access terminals (e.g., within a given cell, served by a given service provider, etc.), while a \u201cmulticast\u201d refers to a transmission of data packets to a given group of destinations or access terminals. In an example, the given group of destinations or \u201cmulticast group\u201d may include more than one and less than all of possible destinations or access terminals (e.g., within a given group, served by a given service provider, etc.). However, it is at least possible in certain situations that the multicast group comprises only one access terminal, similar to a unicast, or alternatively that the multicast group comprises all access terminals (e.g., within a cell or sector), similar to a broadcast.","Broadcasts and\/or multicasts may be performed within wireless communication systems in a number of ways, such as performing a plurality of sequential unicast operations to accommodate the multicast group, allocating a unique broadcast\/multicast channel (BCH) for handling multiple data transmissions at the same time and the like. A conventional system using a broadcast channel for push-to-talk communications is described in United States Patent Application Publication No. 2007\/0049314 dated Mar. 1, 2007 and entitled \u201cPush-To-Talk Group Call System Using CDMA 1x-EVDO Cellular Network\u201d, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. As described in Publication No. 2007\/0049314, a broadcast channel can be used for push-to-talk calls using conventional signaling techniques. Although the use of a broadcast channel may improve bandwidth requirements over conventional unicast techniques, the conventional signaling of the broadcast channel can still result in additional overhead and\/or delay and may degrade system performance.","The 3rd Generation Partnership Project 2 (\u201c3GPP2\u201d) defines a broadcast-multicast service (BCMCS) specification for supporting multicast communications in CDMA2000 networks. Accordingly, a version of 3GPP2's BCMCS specification, entitled \u201cCDMA2000 High Rate Broadcast-Multicast Packet Data Air Interface Specification\u201d, dated Feb. 14, 2006, Version 1.0 C.S0054-A, is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.","In an embodiment, an access terminal (AT), requests a non-exclusive floor (NEF) for a group communication session (GCS) in response to a detection that a user of the AT intends to speak to an associated communication group (CG). In another embodiment, the AT later requests that its NEF for the GCS be revoked in response to a detection that the user of the AT no longer intends to speak to the CG. In another embodiment, another AT holds a NEF for the GCS, and a user of the AT decides to revoke the other AT's NEF such that the AT sends a floor-revocation request to an application server (AS) that is arbitrating the GCS. In another embodiment, the AS grants NEFs to multiple ATs, selectively mixes media received from the ATs for transmission to the CG, and selectively revokes NEFs from one or more of the multiple ATs.","Aspects of the invention are disclosed in the following description and related drawings directed to specific embodiments of the invention. Alternate embodiments may be devised without departing from the scope of the invention. Additionally, well-known elements of the invention will not be described in detail or will be omitted so as not to obscure the relevant details of the invention.","The words \u201cexemplary\u201d and\/or \u201cexample\u201d are used herein to mean \u201cserving as an example, instance, or illustration.\u201d Any embodiment described herein as \u201cexemplary\u201d and\/or \u201cexample\u201d is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other embodiments. Likewise, the term \u201cembodiments of the invention\u201d does not require that all embodiments of the invention include the discussed feature, advantage or mode of operation.","Further, many embodiments are described in terms of sequences of actions to be performed by, for example, elements of a computing device. It will be recognized that various actions described herein can be performed by specific circuits (e.g., application specific integrated circuits (ASICs)), by program instructions being executed by one or more processors, or by a combination of both. Additionally, these sequence of actions described herein can be considered to be embodied entirely within any form of computer readable storage medium having stored therein a corresponding set of computer instructions that upon execution would cause an associated processor to perform the functionality described herein. Thus, the various aspects of the invention may be embodied in a number of different forms, all of which have been contemplated to be within the scope of the claimed subject matter. In addition, for each of the embodiments described herein, the corresponding form of any such embodiments may be described herein as, for example, \u201clogic configured to\u201d perform the described action.","A High Data-rate (HDR) subscriber station, referred to herein as an access terminal (AT), may be mobile or stationary, and may communicate with one or more HDR base stations, referred to herein as modem pool transceivers (MPTs) or base stations (BS). An access terminal transmits and receives data packets through one or more modem pool transceivers to an HDR base station controller, referred to as a modem pool controller (MPC), base station controller (BSC) and\/or packet control function (PCF). Modem pool transceivers and modem pool controllers are parts of a network called an access network. An access network transports data packets between multiple access terminals.","The access network may be further connected to additional networks outside the access network, such as a corporate intranet or the Internet, and may transport data packets between each access terminal and such outside networks. An access terminal that has established an active traffic channel connection with one or more modem pool transceivers is called an active access terminal, and is said to be in a traffic state. An access terminal that is in the process of establishing an active traffic channel connection with one or more modem pool transceivers is said to be in a connection setup state. An access terminal may be any data device that communicates through a wireless channel or through a wired channel, for example using fiber optic or coaxial cables. An access terminal may further be any of a number of types of devices including but not limited to PC card, compact flash, external or internal modem, or wireless or wireline phone. The communication link through which the access terminal sends signals to the modem pool transceiver is called a reverse link or traffic channel. The communication link through which a modem pool transceiver sends signals to an access terminal is called a forward link or traffic channel. As used herein the term traffic channel can refer to either a forward or reverse traffic channel.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","104","120","102","126","102","108","110","112","102","108","110","112"]},"Referring back to , the components of the wireless network  and interrelation of the elements of the exemplary embodiments of the invention are not limited to the configuration illustrated. System  is merely exemplary and can include any system that allows remote access terminals, such as wireless client computing devices , , ,  to communicate over-the-air between and among each other and\/or between and among components connected via the air interface  and RAN , including, without limitation, carrier network , the Internet, and\/or other remote servers.","The RAN  controls messages (typically sent as data packets) sent to a base station controller\/packet control function (BSC\/PCF) . The BSC\/PCF  is responsible for signaling, establishing, and tearing down bearer channels (i.e., data channels) between a packet data service node  (\u201cPDSN\u201d) and the access terminals \/\/\/. If link layer encryption is enabled, the BSC\/PCF  also encrypts the content before forwarding it over the air interface . The function of the BSC\/PCF  is well-known in the art and will not be discussed further for the sake of brevity. The carrier network  may communicate with the BSC\/PCF  by a network, the Internet and\/or a public switched telephone network (PSTN). Alternatively, the BSC\/PCF  may connect directly to the Internet or external network. Typically, the network or Internet connection between the carrier network  and the BSC\/PCF  transfers data, and the PSTN transfers voice information. The BSC\/PCF  can be connected to multiple base stations (BS) or modem pool transceivers (MPT) . In a similar manner to the carrier network, the BSC\/PCF  is typically connected to the MPT\/BS  by a network, the Internet and\/or PSTN for data transfer and\/or voice information. The MPT\/BS  can broadcast data messages wirelessly to the access terminals, such as cellular telephone . The MPT\/BS , BSC\/PCF  and other components may form the RAN , as is known in the art. However, alternate configurations may also be used and the invention is not limited to the configuration illustrated. For example, in another embodiment the functionality of the BSC\/PCF  and one or more of the MPT\/BS  may be collapsed into a single \u201chybrid\u201d module having the functionality of both the BSC\/PCF  and the MPT\/BS .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 2"],"b":["126","126","160","165","170","175","170","170","172","160","175","170","102","108","110","112","120","160","160","160","120","122"]},"Referring to , the broadcast serving node (BSN)  may be configured to support multicast and broadcast services. The BSN  will be described in greater detail below. The BSN  communicates with the RAN  (e.g., the BSC\/PCF ) via a broadcast (BC) A10 connection, and with the application server  via the Internet . The BCA10 connection is used to transfer multicast and\/or broadcast messaging. Accordingly, the application server  sends unicast messaging to the PDSN  via the Internet , and sends multicast messaging to the BSN  via the Internet .","Generally, as will be described in greater detail below, the RAN  transmits multicast messages, received from the BSN  via the BCA10 connection, over a broadcast channel (BCH) of the air interface  to one or more access terminals .","Referring to , an access terminal , (here a wireless device), such as a cellular telephone, has a platform  that can receive and execute software applications, data and\/or commands transmitted from the RAN  that may ultimately come from the carrier network , the Internet and\/or other remote servers and networks. The platform  can include a transceiver  operably coupled to an application specific integrated circuit (\u201cASIC\u201d ), or other processor, microprocessor, logic circuit, or other data processing device. The ASIC  or other processor executes the application programming interface (\u201cAPI\u201d)  layer that interfaces with any resident programs in the memory  of the wireless device. The memory  can be comprised of read-only or random-access memory (RAM and ROM), EEPROM, flash cards, or any memory common to computer platforms. The platform  also can include a local database  that can hold applications not actively used in memory . The local database  is typically a flash memory cell, but can be any secondary storage device as known in the art, such as magnetic media, EEPROM, optical media, tape, soft or hard disk, or the like. The internal platform  components can also be operably coupled to external devices such as antenna , display , push-to-talk button  and keypad  among other components, as is known in the art.","Accordingly, an embodiment of the invention can include an access terminal including the ability to perform the functions described herein. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the various logic elements can be embodied in discrete elements, software modules executed on a processor or any combination of software and hardware to achieve the functionality disclosed herein. For example, ASIC , memory , API  and local database  may all be used cooperatively to load, store and execute the various functions disclosed herein and thus the logic to perform these functions may be distributed over various elements. Alternatively, the functionality could be incorporated into one discrete component. Therefore, the features of the access terminal in  are to be considered merely illustrative and the invention is not limited to the illustrated features or arrangement.","The wireless communication between the access terminal  and the RAN  can be based on different technologies, such as code division multiple access (CDMA), WCDMA, time division multiple access (TDMA), frequency division multiple access (FDMA), Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM), the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM), or other protocols that may be used in a wireless communications network or a data communications network. The data communication is typically between the client device , MPT\/BS , and BSC\/PCF . The BSC\/PCF  can be connected to multiple data networks such as the carrier network , PSTN, the Internet, a virtual private network, and the like, thus allowing the access terminal  access to a broader communication network. As discussed in the foregoing and known in the art, voice transmission and\/or data can be transmitted to the access terminals from the RAN using a variety of networks and configurations. Accordingly, the illustrations provided herein are not intended to limit the embodiments of the invention and are merely to aid in the description of aspects of embodiments of the invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIG. 4A","FIG. 4A"]},"Referring to , in , a given AT (\u201cAT A\u201d) sends a request to the application server  via the RAN  to initiate a group communication session. For example, the group communication session may correspond to a push-to-talk (PTT) or push-to-transfer (PTX) session, and the transmission of the request in  may be prompted based on a user of AT A pressing a PTT or PTX button on AT A. The application server  receives the group communication session request from AT A, and transmits an announce message in one or more sectors of the wireless communication system , . At least ATs B . . . E receive the announce message, and determine to join the announced group communication session. Accordingly, ATs B . . . E send a call accept message to the application server , and also send a registration message (e.g., BCMCSFlowRegistration message) to the RAN  to register to the group communication session,  and . The call accept message and registration message from each of ATs B . . . E may either be sent within separate messages on a reverse link access channel, or alternatively may be bundled within the same message.","After receiving a call accept message from a first responder to the announce message from among ATs B . . . E, the application server  grants the floor for the group communication session to AT A, . Accordingly, after receiving the floor-grant message, AT A plays a tone to indicate to a user of AT A that the user can begin speaking, and AT A begins transmitting frames on a reverse link channel to the application server , . The series of frame transmissions from  can correspond to data frames that actually include voice data, or alternatively can correspond to silence frames that do not actually include voice data.","Each frame transmission can correspond to a real-time transport protocol (RTP) packet or datagram, or alternatively a RTCP (RTP Control Protocol) packet.

However, certain fields are discussed in more detail with respect to embodiments described in more detail below, and as such will be referred to briefly in this section. For example, the contribution count (CC) field, Sequence Number field, Timestamp field and SSRC number field will now be addressed briefly. The CC field is an optional field that can hold a contributing source (CSRC) count value. Although not shown on the header diagram of Table 1 (above), the 12 octet header of the CC field can optionally be expanded to include more contributing sources. Contributing sources can be added by a mixer at the application server , and are relevant for conferencing applications where elements of the data payload have originated from different computers. For point-to-point communications, CSRCs are not necessarily required. The Sequence Number field holds a unique reference number which increments by one for each RTP packet sent from a particular source, or AT. The Sequence Number field allows the receiver to reconstruct the sender's packet sequence. The Timestamp field corresponds to the time that the RTP packet was transmitted by the AT. The Timestamp field allows the receiving AT(s) to buffer and playout the data in a continuous stream. The SSRC number field corresponds to a number that identifies the source of the RTP packet, which in  identifies AT A. The SSRC number can be provisioned by the application server  at the start of the group communication session.","After the RTP header portion, the RTP packet includes a data payload portion. The data payload portion can include digitized samples of voice and\/or video. The length of the data payload can vary for different RTP packets. For example, in voice RTP packets, the length of the voice sample carried by the data payload may correspond to 20 milliseconds (ms) of sound. Generally, for longer media durations (e.g., higher-rate frames), the data payload either has to be longer as well, or else the quality of the media sample is reduced.","Returning to  of , the frames transmitted from AT A can correspond to full-rate frames (e.g., 8.6 kpbs) that have a large data payload in the RTP packet, half-rate frames (e.g., 4.3 kpbs) that include a \u2018medium\u2019 data payload in the RTP packet, \u215bth rate frames (e.g., 1.0 kpbs) that include a small data payload in the RTP packet, and so on. While references are generally made to EVRC-A, it will be readily apparent how these embodiments can be modified to accommodate other vocoders that include different frame rate options. As will be appreciated, when a user of AT A is speaking, AT A transmits higher-rate frames than when the user of AT A is not speaking and AT A is transmitting silence frames. The application server  includes a media control complex (MCC)  module that handles the receipt of a media stream from floor-holders, and the transcoding of an output stream to one or more \u2018listening\u2019 group members to the group communication session.

However, the inability of ATs to transmit to the group can, at times, be problematic (e.g., if a current floor-holder does not give up the floor and keeps on talking about irrelevant issues). In half-duplex, the current floor-holder would be oblivious to the sentiment of the group because the floor-holder cannot receive feedback from the other group-members until the floor is released.","This problem does not occur in the full-duplex implementation of . However, the bandwidth requirements of a full-duplex implementation are high, because for N group communication session participants, each participant receives an aggregated output stream having N\u22121 combined media flows, which consumes a relatively high amount of bandwidth. Also, aggregating a high number of media frames to form the media frames of the output stream can be processing intensive at the application server .

For example, the \u2018superuser\u2019 authorities can be established as follows, whereby each AT can revoke non-exclusive floors for any AT having a lower priority:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0098","num":"0097"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00007","num":"00007"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 7"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Priority Tables to Evaluate Floor Revocation Requests"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":["Direct Calls",{},"Closed","Closed Chat"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"Prior-","Adhoc Calls","Group Calls","room Calls"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"8"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"8","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["User","ity","User","Priority","User","Priority","User","Priority"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"8","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["A","9","A","9","A","9","A","9"]},{"entry":["B","7","B","7","B","5","B","5"]},{"entry":["C","7","C","7","C","7","C","7"]},{"entry":["D","7","D","7","D","1","D","1"]},{"entry":["E . . .

AT B can revoke the floor for ATs D . . . X if the group communication session is a closed group call or a closed chat room call, and so on. As will be appreciated, this simply represents one manner in which a given group session participant can achieve revocation privileges or revocation authority with respect to one or more other participants of the group communication session.","Turning back to , after C of , at some point during the group communication session while ATs A, B and C are each sending media to the group, assume that AT A determines that its user desires to revoke AT C's floor, B. As will be appreciated, the user of AT A can determine to revoke AT C's floor for any of a number of reasons. For example, the user of AT C may be very loud and distracting to the user of AT A, the user of AT A may have something important to say and does not want to be interrupted by the user of AT C, and so on. While AT A in the embodiment of  is a current holder of a non-exclusive floor to the group communication session, it will be appreciated that other embodiments can be directed to scenarios where a non-floorholder or \u2018listener\u2019 to the session is a superuser. In this case, it will be appreciated that the user that invokes his\/her revocation authority over another user, such that the other user is forced to give up his\/her non-exclusive floor, need not him\/herself currently have a non-exclusive floor to the session. The determination of B can be based on input by the user of AT A into AT A.","Responsive to the determination of B, AT A transmits a request to revoke the non-exclusive floor of AT C to the RAN , which forwards the request to the application server , B. The application server  receives the request to revoke the non-exclusive floor from AT C, and determines whether AT A has sufficient privileges to revoke the floor of AT C, B. In this example, it is assumed that AT A has sufficient revocation privileges to revoke the floor of AT C. As such, the application server  drops AT C's non-exclusive floor and then notifies that AT C that its floor has been revoked, B. AT C acknowledges the floor-revocation message in B. While not shown in , AT C can also optionally notify its user with regard to the floor-revocation (e.g., so that the user of AT C is aware that his\/her speech is no longer being sent to the group).","At this point, the application server  stops mixing media from input stream C into any of the output streams to ATs A . . . X, B. After revoking AT C's non-exclusive floor to the group communication session, it will be appreciated that ATs A and B still hold non-exclusive floors to the hybrid group communication session and continue to send media to the application server , as input streams A and B, respectively, for transmission to the group, B and B. Next, B through B substantially correspond to A through A of , respectively, and as such will not be described further for the sake of brevity",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0103","num":"0102"},"figref":["FIG. 6C","FIG. 6A","FIG. 6B","FIG. 6C","FIGS. 6A and 6B","FIG. 6C","FIG. 6C","FIG. 5C","FIG. 5C"],"b":"170"},"Referring to , after C of , at some point during the group communication session while ATs A, B and C are each sending media to the group, assume that the application server  determines to revoke AT C's floor, C. As will be appreciated, the application server  A can determine to revoke AT C's floor for any of a number of reasons. For example, assume that the threshold or maximum number of non-exclusive floor-holders is three, such that ATs A, B and C are monopolizing the floor-access. Next, a floor-request arrives from a user with a higher-priority than AT C. In this case, the application server  can revoke AT C's floor so that the floor can be allocated to the higher-priority user. In another example, the application server  can track how long the floor has been allocated to AT C and can revoke AT C's floor when the timer expires. It will be appreciated that there are many other reasons that can cause the application server  to reach the decision to revoke AT C's floor in C. Also, the time limit for floor-allocation can be omitted entirely in certain embodiments, such as when the group communication session corresponds to a lecture where the lecturer would be expected to hold the floor for most if not all of the session. In another example, the application server  can detect undesirable audio patterns (e.g., such as white-noise, loud honking horns in a traffic jam, emergency sirens, intentional jamming sound from a malicious user, etc., which is not good for mixed audio), and revoke the floor of ATs originating such audio.","In a further alternative example, instead of simply deciding to revoke the floor of one or more ATs at the application server  and then issuing the revocation-order, the application server  can query or prompt a superuser of the group communication session before taking such action. This alternative example merges  with  in a sense, such that the application server  provides recommendations to a superuser for floor-revocation, but the final authority still resides with the superuser (e.g., AT A, in ).","After determining to revoke AT C's non-exclusive floor in C, the application server  drops AT C's non-exclusive floor and then notifies that AT C that its floor has been revoked, C. AT C acknowledges the floor-revocation message in C. While not shown in , AT C can also optionally notify its user with regard to the floor-revocation (e.g., so that the user of AT C is aware that his\/her speech is no longer being sent to the group).","At this point, the application server  stops mixing media from input stream C into any of the output streams to ATs A . . .

Next, C through C substantially correspond to A through A of , respectively and\/or B through B of , respectively, and as such will not be described further for the sake of brevity","The group communication session described above with respect to  may correspond to a group communication session supported by IP multicasting protocols, or IP unicasting protocols. In IP multicasting, a downlink broadcast channel (BCH) carries a single multicast flow within one or more sectors to reach each \u2018listening\u2019 multicast group member, while a separate scheduling message (e.g., a broadcast overhead message (BOM)) is transmitted on a downlink control channel that indicates how the multicast group members can tune to the downlink BCH. In IP unicasting, each group message is transmitted to each group communication session participant, or multicast group member, as a separate unicast message addressed to each group member individually.","While embodiments have been above-described generally to audio-based group communication sessions, other embodiments can be directed to other types of group communication session, such as video conferences, etc. Also, while embodiments have been directed above to RTP packets, it will be appreciated that other embodiments of the invention can be directed to other types of media packets. For example, in a system operating in accordance with RealNetworks protocols, a RDT packet may be used instead of an RTP packet. In other words, as noted above, while embodiments have generally been directed to an implementation in accordance with EVRC-A protocols, other Vocoders (e.g., AMR, etc.) that have a discrete frame-rate set can be used in other embodiments of the invention.","Those of skill in the art will appreciate that information and signals may be represented using any of a variety of different technologies and techniques.
