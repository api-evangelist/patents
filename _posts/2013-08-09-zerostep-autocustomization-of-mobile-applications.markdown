title: Zero-step auto-customization of mobile applications
abstract: In an embodiment, mobile application downloaded and installed in a mobile device is launched for the first time. The mobile application automatically locates a configuration server and connects automatically to the located configuration server. After connection is established with the configuration server, appropriate configuration parameters set is identified and automatically fetched to the mobile device. The fetched configuration parameters set is automatically applied to the mobile application. After applying the configuration parameters set, automatically authenticate the mobile application to an enterprise server. Thus, when the user of the mobile device launches the installed mobile application for the first time, the zero-step auto-customization noted above takes place without manual intervention. The user is thus able to use the mobile application in a normal manner subject to the configurations applied.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Some enterprises provide mobile devices to employees to stay connected with the business and discharge their responsibilities efficiently, while some enterprises authorize employees to purchase and use a mobile device of their choice to stay connected with the business. Employees often tend to download varied mobile applications from public distribution channels to their mobile devices. Enterprise would like to customize the mobile applications to include branding, provide enterprise connectivity, enforce usage restrictions etc., before the first use of the downloaded mobile applications. But often, employees directly install mobile applications from the public distribution channels and start using them, without giving the administrators an opportunity to customize the mobile applications. Thus it is challenging to customize such downloaded mobile applications before their first use.","Embodiments of techniques for zero-step auto-customization of mobile applications are described herein. In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth to provide a thorough understanding of the embodiments. One skilled in the relevant art will recognize, however, that the embodiments can be practiced without one or more of the specific details, or with other methods, components, materials, etc. In other instances, well-known structures, materials, or operations are not shown or described in detail.","Reference throughout this specification to \u201cone embodiment\u201d, \u201cthis embodiment\u201d and similar phrases, means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one of the one or more embodiments. Thus, the appearances of these phrases in various places throughout this specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment. Furthermore, the particular features, structures, or characteristics may be combined in any suitable manner in one or more embodiments.","Typically, when an enterprise provides mobile devices to employees, enterprise enforces installations and configurations of necessary customizations in the mobile device, to make it compliant with the enterprise standards. In a scenario where enterprise authorizes employees to purchase and use mobile devices of their choice, employees lend to download mobile applications from public distribution channels and install on the mobile devices and use. The enterprise administrators do not get an opportunity to enforce configurations and customizations on the mobile applications, downloaded from the public distribution channels.","Some enterprises request source code from the mobile applications vendors, and develop a customized version for some of the mobile applications, and distribute these customized versions to the employees. But as the number of mobile applications increase drastically, this is not a scalable solution, as it tremendously increases custom development and maintenance effort for any enterprise. Whereas, some enterprises request the mobile applications vendors to develop customized version of mobile applications for their enterprise use, and ship it directly using business-to-business channels of distribution. The challenge here is that, mobile applications vendors may not have the bandwidth to take up customization request from every enterprise using their mobile applications. Further, the mobile applications vendors will be required to develop and maintain versions of the same mobile application for every enterprise in an on-going basis.","Some enterprises mandate installation of mobile device management software agent on mobile devices that allows receiving of configurations for mobile application customizations. Mobile device management (MDM) software monitors, manages, and supports, mobile devices by enabling distribution of one or more applications, data and configurations for mobile devices. MDM agent installations are generally disliked by the employees, because enterprises enforce many other usage restriction and security restriction on the mobile devices. Further, MDM agents are required to be installed and managed in every mobile device. Therefore, employees require an automatic configuration and customization of mobile applications, in zero-step without manual intervention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","110","120","130","140","145","150","155","170","180"]},"Network  provides connectivity between configuration servers A to N and client system . Network  provides connectivity between enterprise server  and client system . Network  and  may be implemented using protocols such as Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and\/or Internet Protocol (IP). In one embodiment network  and network  can be the same network implemented using any of the protocols noted above. The client system  can be a computing device such as a mobile phone or a tablet computer used by end users. Mobile application  is downloaded from a public distribution channel and installed in the client system . When the mobile application  is launched from the client system  for the first time, the mobile application  automatically determines a configuration server A  from among a set of configuration servers, and connects to the configuration server A .","Once connection is established with the configuration server A , appropriate configuration parameters set  is identified, and automatically fetched from the configuration server A  to the client system . Fetching includes sending data implicitly or explicitly in a query, and correspondingly receiving associated information in response to the query. Fetching can be one time receiving or it can be receiving in portions. The fetched configuration parameters set  is automatically applied to the mobile application . After applying the configuration parameters set , the mobile application is automatically authenticated to an enterprise server . Thus, when the user of the client system  launches the installed mobile application  for the first time, the sequence of steps noted above are automatically performed without manual intervention, and the user is able to use the mobile application  in a normal manner subject to the configuration parameters set  applied. The example embodiments illustrated below using  to , describe in detail the zero-step auto-customization of mobile applications as noted above.","In one embodiment, mobile applications are standardized and developed in a way that, after installation of a mobile application in a mobile device, the mobile application automatically locates an appropriate configuration server, and establishes connection to the located configuration server. The mobile application installed in the mobile device can ping a network for locating the configuration servers within the network. Ping is merely exemplary, various types of mechanisms and protocols to locate the configuration server, such as, by defining in web configuration file, using broadcasting or multi-casting solutions such as service location protocol, using service discovery protocols, using neighbor discovery protocol, etc., can be used.  illustrates a registry providing mapping information for mobile applications, according to one embodiment. Every mobile application is developed with a unique identifier referred to as an application identifier. Application identifier enables unique identification of the mobile application.","Registry  is created, with application identifiers  mapped to corresponding non-qualified machine names . In one embodiment, registry can be a public registry, private registry, hosted file, and the like. Non-qualified machine names represent names of the configuration servers as defined by administrators of the enterprise. In registry , an application identifier \u2018COM.DEF.APPS,*\u2019  is mapped to a non-qualified machine name \u2018SAMPLE\u2019 . The non-qualified machine names can be resolved based on geographical location or network of the mobile device, to appropriate machines with the corresponding fully qualified domain name (FQDN). FQDN is a complete domain name for a specific computer\/machine or host on the internet. For example, the non-qualified machine name \u2018XPOL\u2019  can be resolved based on network of the mobile device, to one of the configuration servers with the FQDN as shown in .","For example, \u2018user A\u2019 has installed a mobile application with application identifier \u2018COM.SOMECOMPANY.*\u2019 . Application identifier \u2018COM.SOMECOMPANY.*\u2019  is mapped to non-qualified machine name \u2018XPOL\u2019  in the registry , \u2018User A\u2019 is located in \u2018Waldorf\u2019 network, accordingly the non-qualified machine name \u2018XPOL\u2019  resolves to a FQDN \u2018XPOL.WDF.ABC.COM\u2019 . Similarly for a user located in \u2018Bangalore\u2019 network, the non-qualified machine name \u2018XPOL\u2019  resolves to the FQDN \u2018XPOL.BLR.ABC.COM\u2019  and for a user located in \u2018Vancouver\u2019 network, the non-qualified machine name \u2018XPOL\u2019  resolves to the FQDN \u2018XPOL.VAN.ABC.COM\u2019 . These machines with the FQDN as shown in  become the configuration servers across geography\/network for the enterprise ABC.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["320","310","330","320","335","310","330","335","340","320","310","335","330"]},"For example, for an encrypted device identifier \u2018Z&^F#@LTY\u2019 sent from the mobile device  of \u2018User A\u2019, the encrypted device identifier \u2018Z&^F#@LTY\u2019 is matched to identify the configuration parameters set as \u2018configuration parameters set A\u2019  from among the configuration parameters sets available. The \u2018configuration parameters set A\u2019  includes authentication parameters , configuration parameters , customization parameters  and other parameters as applicable. The number and type of parameters are merely illustrative and may vary for every mobile application. The authentication parameters  include parameters  such as \u2018user id\u2019 mapped with the received device identifier, connectivity details corresponding to the enterprise server, and the like. If the received device identifier has access to the enterprise server, then the \u2018user id\u2019 along with a password provided in the authentication parameters, enables automatic authentication to the enterprise server. If no \u2018user id\u2019 is mapped with the device identifier, \u2018guest id\u2019 can be provided. Access using \u2018guest id\u2019 has limited privileges in comparison to access using \u2018user id\u2019. Connectivity details includes details required to establish connection with the enterprise server such as database connection parameters, host name, port number, server certificate, etc. Based on the received encrypted device identifier, these authentication parameters  are encrypted and sent to the mobile device  as a part of \u2018configuration parameters set A\u2019 .","The configuration parameters  include policies, rules, restriction conditions, settings, etc. Policies can be defined to restrict single sign-on capability for a user of the mobile device , as shown in . Single sign-on capability is a property of access control, in which a user logs in once in a software, and gains access to multiple related independent software. While defining the policy, network identifier can be specified to restrict the single sign-on capability to be within a particular network, virtual private network (VPN) identifier can be specified to restrict the single sign-on capability when connected via a particular virtual private network server, and location can be specified to restrict the single sign-on capability within a particular geographic location or network. For example, whenever \u2018User B\u2019 is connecting from home network, the single sign-on capability for \u2018User B\u2019 can be restricted. Rules can be specified, to determine if a certain criteria is met, and accordingly perform associated actions. For example, a rule can be defined such that, if \u2018User C\u2019 is a contract employee, then \u2018User C\u2019 should not receive emails intended for permanent employees. Rules can also be specified as restriction conditions where the users are restricted from performing a set of defined actions. For example, employees are restricted from accessing social networking sites from within the mobile application.","The customization parameters  include user interface related customizations such as visual presentation, personalization, stylistic compliance, etc., and functionality related customizations such as disabling offline storage on the mobile device, disabling sending of emails from within the mobile application, etc. Typically, enterprises have a standard theme, color, font, size of user interface elements, etc., in their applications. The customization parameters are specified in , for example, brand and logo of an enterprise can be specified in the branding information. Theme, in which the mobile application needs to be displayed, can be specified in the application display theme. Color in which the mobile application needs to be displayed can be specified in the application colors. Certain functionalities in the mobile application are required to be enabled and disabled based on the profile of the employee. Such enabling and disabling of functionalities can be specified in enable and disable application functionality. For example, contract employee \u2018User C\u2019 should not be allowed offline storage on the mobile device and accordingly offline storage option needs to be disabled for \u2018User C\u2019.","The mobile device  may automatically fetch the \u2018configuration parameters set A\u2019  comprising authentication parameters , configuration parameters , and customization parameters , in an encrypted form as \u2018encrypted configuration parameters set A\u2019 . In one embodiment, the \u2018configuration parameters set A\u2019 can be stored in a file external to the software application executing in the configuration server. When the \u2018configuration parameters set A\u2019 is externalized and stored in the file, and not hardcoded in the software application, managing and replacing the file dynamically is easier.","When the mobile application  is launched for the first time, and the \u2018encrypted configuration parameters set A\u2019  is fetched from the configuration server XPOL.WDF.ABC.COM , the \u2018encrypted configuration parameters set A\u2019  is cached in the mobile application . During subsequent connections to the configuration server XPOL,WDF.ABC.COM , the mobile application  looks for changes or modifications from the last cached content. For example, entity tag (Etag) and \u2018if-modified-since\u2019 conditional request-header field can be used to look for modifications from the last cached content. Etag in hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP)\/HTTPS can be used to make conditional request. Independent version of the content is assigned an Etag. These Etags are compared, to determine if two versions of the content are same or not. Based on this comparison, only modified portion is requested from the configuration server. Another example would be to use \u2018if-modified-since\u2019 conditional request-header field in the HTTP request. \u2018If-modified-since\u2019 is specified along with a date on which the content was last fetched. When \u2018if-modified-since\u2019 request-header field is specified in the request, only if the content is modified since the date specified, then the content is fetched from the configuration server. Else, if the content is not modified, no content is fetched from the configuration server.","The fetched \u2018encrypted configuration parameters set A\u2019  is automatically applied to the mobile application . For example, based on the \u2018configuration parameters set A\u2019 , the mobile application can be re-branded with the fetched customization parameters  such as enterprise logo, images, and etc. The mobile application's display theme and color is applied as fetched in the \u2018configuration parameters set A\u2019 . Functionality related customizations such as enabling and disabling are also applied in the mobile application . A connection is established automatically with the enterprise server, based on the connectivity details, \u2018user id\u2019 and password fetched in the authentication parameters  of the \u2018configuration parameters set A\u2019 . This connection established, is a personalized connection for the user of the mobile device . While establishing connection to the configuration server, policies in the configuration parameters  to restrict single sign-on capability for the user of the mobile device are applied.","In one embodiment, initial set of configurations can be fetched from one configuration parameters set, which could lead to additional configurations to be fetched from other configuration parameters sets. For example, initial set of configurations can be fetched from \u2018configuration parameters set A\u2019  to the mobile application, this initial set of configurations could lead to additional configurations to be fetched from \u2018configuration parameters set B\u2019 , \u2018configuration parameters set C\u2019 or \u2018configuration parameters set N\u2019. The initial set of configurations fetched can have a link to the next set of configurations, such as a uniform resource locator (URL), internet protocol address (IP address), and the like.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["410","420","430","440","450","460"]},"In case, one of the network identifier, VPN identifier, or location matches with any of the configuration parameters,  is executed, where the mobile application automatically sends a login request to the enterprise server  with the authentication parameters such as \u2018user id\u2019, password and connectivity details, to establish connectivity with the enterprise server  in a single sign-on mode. In case, either of the network identifier, VPN identifier or location does not match with any of the configuration parameters,  is executed, where the mobile application prompts the user to enter password to continue login to the enterprise server . In one embodiment, authentication parameters can include a certificate instead of \u2018user id\u2019 and password. A certificate contains information about the owner of the certificate, like email address, owner's name, duration of validity, etc. The mobile application can fetch certificate corresponding to the device identifier from the configuration server. This certificate can be used to authenticate the mobile application to the enterprise server .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","510","520","530","540","550"]},"The various embodiments described above have a number of advantages. The development of mobile applications is standardized. With zero-step auto-customization of mobile applications, employees using mobile devices of their choice can download the mobile application and use it in a normal way, subject to the customizations applied. When employees launch the downloaded mobile application for the first time, the mobile application is automatically connected to a configuration server, and the configurations are fetched and installed automatically in the mobile application in zero-steps without manual intervention. Thus employees do not have to manually install any additional configurations or customizations for every mobile application. More often, employees do not realize that configurations and customizations are being applied to the mobile application. Time and effort to auto-customize the mobile applications happens in zero-step and proves very efficient.","Some embodiments may include the above-described methods being written as one or more software components. These components, and the functionality associated with each, may be used by client, server, distributed, or peer computer systems. These components may be written in a computer language corresponding to one or more programming languages such as, functional, declarative, procedural, object-oriented, lower level languages and the like. They may be linked to other components via various application programming interfaces and then compiled into one complete application for a server or a client. Alternatively, the components maybe implemented in server and client applications. Further, these components may be linked together via various distributed programming protocols. Some example embodiments may include remote procedure calls being used to implement one or more of these components across a distributed programming environment. For example, a logic level may reside on a first computer system that is remotely located from a second computer system containing an interface level (e.g., a graphical user interface). These first and second computer systems can be configured in a server-client, peer-to-peer, or some other configuration. The clients can vary in complexity from mobile and handheld devices, to thin clients and on to thick clients or even other servers.","The above-illustrated software components are tangibly stored on a computer readable storage medium as instructions.
