In mammals in particular, it has been shown to regulate early embryonic development. Later in life, cell death is a default mechanism by which potentially dangerous cells (e.g., cells carrying cancerous defects) are removed. Several apoptotic pathways have been uncovered, and one of the most important involves the Bcl-2 family of proteins, which are key regulators of the mitochondrial (also called \u201cintrinsic\u201d) pathway of apoptosis. See, Danial, N. N. and Korsmeyer, S. J. (2004) 116, 205-219. The structural homology domains BH1, BH2, BH3 and BH4 are characteristic of this family of proteins. The Bcl-2 family of proteins can be further classified into three subfamilies depending on how many of the homology domains each protein contains and on its biological activity (i.e., whether it has pro- or anti-apoptotic function).","The first subgroup contains proteins having all 4 homology domains, i.e., BH1, BH2, BH3 and BH4. Their general effect is anti-apoptotic, that is to preserve a cell from starting a cell death process. Proteins such as, for example, Bcl-2, Bcl-w, Bcl-x, Mcl-1 and Bfl-1\/A1 are members of this first subgroup. Proteins belonging to the second subgroup contain the three homology domains BH1, BH2 and BH3, and have a pro-apoptotic effect. The two main representative proteins of this second subgroup are Bax and Bak. Finally, the third subgroup is composed of proteins containing only the BH3 domain and members of this subgroup are usually referred to as \u201cBH3-only proteins.\u201d Their biological effect on the cell is pro-apoptotic. Bim, Bid, Bad, Bik, Noxa, Hrk, Bmf, and Puma are examples of this third subfamily of proteins. The exact mechanism by which the Bcl-2 family proteins regulate cell death is still not entirely known and understanding this mechanism is an active area of research in the science community. In one hypothesis of regulation of cell death by Bcl-2 family proteins, the BH3-only proteins are further categorized as either \u201cactivator\u201d (e.g., Bim and Bid) or \u201csensitizer\u201d (e.g., Bad, Bik, Noxa, Hrk, Bmf, and Puma) proteins depending on their regulatory function.","The key to tissue homeostasis is achieving the delicate balance in the interactions among the three subgroups of protein in cells. Recent studies have tried to elucidate the mechanisms by which pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic subgroups of Bcl-2 family proteins interact to allow a cell to undergo programmed cell death. After receiving intra- or extra-cellular signals in cells, post-translational or transcriptional activation of BH3-only proteins occurs. The BH3-only proteins are the primary inducers of an apoptotic cascade that includes, as one step, the activation of the pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and Bak on the mitochondrial membrane in cells. Upon activation of Bax and\/or Bak that are either already anchored to the mitochondrial membrane or migrate to this membrane, Bax and\/or Bak oligomerize to result in mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP), the release of cytochrome C, and downstream activation of effector caspases, to ultimately result in cell apoptosis. Some researchers hypothesize that certain BH3-only proteins (e.g., Puma, Bim, Bid) are \u201cactivators\u201d in that these proteins directly engage pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and Bak to initiate MOMP, while other BH3-only proteins (e.g., Bad, Bik and Noxa) are \u201csensitizers\u201d and induce Bax and Bak oligomerization indirectly by binding anti-apoptotic proteins (e.g., Bcl-2, Bcl-x, Bcl-w, Mcl-1) and displacing and \u201cfreeing-up\u201d the \u201cactivator\u201d BH3-only proteins, which subsequently bind to and activate pro-apoptotic proteins (e.g., Bax, Bak) to induce cell death. Other researchers suggest that anti-apoptotic proteins engage and seqeuester Bax and Bak directly and all BH3-only proteins regulates this interaction by binding to anti-apoptotic proteins (e.g., Bcl-2, Bcl-x, Bcl-w, Mcl-1) which results in the release Bax and Bak. See, Adams, J. M. and Cory S. (2007) 26, 1324-1337; Willis, S. N. et al. (2007) 315, 856-859. Although, the exact interactions through which the anti- and pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins regulate apoptosis remain under debate, there is a large body of scientific evidence to show that compounds which inhibit the binding of BH3-only proteins to anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins promote apoptosis in cells.","Dysregulated apoptotic pathways have been implicated in the pathology of many significant diseases such as neurodegenerative conditions (up-regulated apoptosis), such as for example, Alzheimer's disease; and proliferative diseases (down-regulated apoptosis) such as for example, cancer, autoimmune diseases and pro-thrombotic conditions.","In one aspect, the implication that down-regulated apoptosis (and more particularly the Bcl-2 family of proteins) is involved in the onset of cancerous malignancy has revealed a novel way of targeting this still elusive disease. Research has shown, for example, the anti-apoptotic proteins, Bcl-2 and Bcl-x, are over-expressed in many cancer cell types. See, Zhang J. Y., , (2002) 1, 101; Kirkin, V. et al. (2004) 1644, 229-249; and Amundson, S. A. et al. (2000) 60, 6101-6110. The effect of this deregulation is the survival of altered cells which would otherwise have undergone apoptosis in normal conditions. The repetition of these defects associated with unregulated proliferation is thought to be the starting point of cancerous evolution. Additionally, research has shown that BH3-only proteins can act as tumor suppressors when expressed in diseased animals.","These findings as well as numerous others have made possible the emergence of new strategies in drug discovery for targeting cancer: If a small molecule that could mimic the effect of BH3-only proteins were able to enter the cell and overcome the anti-apoptotic protein over-expression, then it could be possible to reset the apoptotic process. This strategy can have the advantage that it can alleviate the problem of drug resistance which is usually a consequence of apoptotic deregulation (abnormal survival).","Researchers also have demonstrated that platelets also contain the necessary apoptotic machinery (e.g., Bax, Bak, Bcl-, Bcl-2, cytochrome c, caspase-9, caspase-3 and APAF-1) to execute programmed cell death through the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Although circulating platelet production is a normal physiological process, a number of diseases are caused or exacerbated by excess of, or undesired activation of, platelets. The above suggests that therapeutic agents capable of inhibiting anti-apoptotic proteins in platelets and reducing the number of platelets in mammals maybe useful in treating pro-thrombotic conditions and diseases that are characterized by an excess of, or undesired activation of platelets.","Abbott Laboratories Inc. has developed a class of small molecule BH3-only protein mimetics, i.e., ABT-737 and ABT-263, that bind strongly to a subset of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins including Bcl-2, Bcl-w and Bcl-x, but only weakly to Mcl-1 and A1, and exhibits mechanism-based cytotoxicity. These compounds were tested in animal studies and demonstrated cytotoxic activity in certain xenograft models as single agents, as well as enhanced the effects of a number of chemotherapeutic agents on other xenograft models when used in combination. See, Tse, C. et al. (2008) 68, 3421-3428; and van Delft, M. F. et al. (2006) 10, 389-399. These in vivo studies suggest the potential utility of inhibitors of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins for the treatment of diseases that involve a dysregulated apoptotic pathway.","The natural expression levels of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins members vary in different cell types. For example, in young platelets, Bcl-xprotein is highly expressed and plays an important role in regulating cell death (life span) of platelets. Also, in certain cancer cell types, the cancer cell's survival is attributed to the dysregulation of the apoptotic pathway caused by the over-expression of one or more anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein family members. In view of the important role for Bcl-2 family of proteins in regulating apoptosis in both cancerous and normal (i.e., non-cancerous) cells, and the recognized inter-cell type variability of Bcl-2 family protein expression, it is advantageous, to have a small molecule inhibitor that selectively targets and preferably binds to one type or a subset of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein(s), for example, to an anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member that overexpressed in a certain cancer type. Such a selective compound also may confer certain advantages in the clinical setting, by providing: for example, the flexibility to select a dosing regimen, a reduced on-target toxic effect in normal cells, among others (e.g., lymphopenia has been observed in Bcl-2 deficient mice). See, Nakayama, K. et al. (1994) 91, 3700-3704.","In view of the above, there is a need in the art for small molecules therapeutics that can selectively inhibit the activity of one type or a subset of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins, for example, of a Bcl-xanti-apoptotic protein.

A typical pharmaceutical composition is prepared by mixing a compound of the present invention and a carrier, diluent or excipient. Suitable carriers, diluents and excipients are well known to those skilled in the art and include materials such as carbohydrates, waxes, water soluble and\/or swellable polymers, hydrophilic or hydrophobic materials, gelatin, oils, solvents, water and the like. The particular carrier, diluent or excipient used will depend upon the means and purpose for which a compound of the present invention is being applied. Solvents are generally selected based on solvents recognized by persons skilled in the art as safe (GRAS) to be administered to a mammal. In general, safe solvents are non-toxic aqueous solvents such as water and other non-toxic solvents that are soluble or miscible in water. Suitable aqueous solvents include water, ethanol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycols (e.g., PEG 400, PEG 300, etc.) and mixtures thereof.

For example, the bulk drug substance (i.e., compound of the present invention or stabilized form of the compound (e.g., complex with a cyclodextrin derivative or other known complexation agent)) is dissolved in a suitable solvent in the presence of one or more of the excipients described above. A compound of the present invention is typically formulated into pharmaceutical dosage forms to provide an easily controllable dosage of the drug and to enable patient compliance with the prescribed regimen.","The pharmaceutical composition (or formulation) for application can be packaged in a variety of ways depending upon the method used for administering the drug. Generally, an article for distribution includes a container having deposited therein the pharmaceutical formulation in an appropriate form. Suitable containers are well known to those skilled in the art and include materials such as bottles (plastic and glass), sachets, ampoules, plastic bags, metal cylinders, and the like. The container can also include a tamper-proof assemblage to prevent indiscreet access to the contents of the package. In addition, the container has deposited thereon a label that describes the contents of the container. The label can also include appropriate warnings.","Pharmaceutical compositions of a compound of the present invention can be prepared for various routes and types of administration. For example, a compound of the invention (e.g., a compound of Formula I) having the desired degree of purity can optionally be mixed with pharmaceutically acceptable diluents, carriers, excipients or stabilizers (see, Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy: Remington the Science and Practice of Pharmacy (2005) 21Edition, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia, Pa.), in the form of a lyophilized formulation, milled powder, or an aqueous solution. Compositions can be prepared by mixing at ambient temperature at the appropriate pH, and at the desired degree of purity, with physiologically acceptable carriers, i.e., carriers that are non-toxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed. The pH of the formulation depends mainly on the particular use and the concentration of compound, but can range from about 3 to about 8. Formulation in an acetate buffer at pH 5 is a suitable embodiment.","A compound of this invention (e.g., compound of Formula I) for use herein is preferably sterile. In particular, compositions or formulations to be used for in vivo administration must be sterile. Such sterilization is readily accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration membranes.","A compound of the invention ordinarily can be stored as a solid composition, a lyophilized formulation or as an aqueous solution.","A pharmaceutical composition of the invention will be formulated, dosed and administered in a fashion, i.e., amounts, concentrations, schedules, course, vehicles and route of administration, consistent with good medical practice. Factors for consideration in this context include the particular disorder being treated, the particular mammal being treated, the clinical condition of the individual patient, the cause of the disorder, the site of delivery of the agent, the method of administration, the scheduling of administration, and other factors known to medical practitioners. The \u201ctherapeutically effective amount\u201d of the compound to be administered will be governed by such considerations, and is the minimum amount necessary to prevent, ameliorate, or treat diseases that can by characterized by the expression or over-expression of Bcl-xproteins.

Techniques and formulations generally are found in Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy: Remington the Science and Practice of Pharmacy (2005) 21Edition, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia, Pa. Such methods include the step of bringing into association the active ingredient with the carrier which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. In general the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active ingredient with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product.","Pharmaceutical compositions of a compound of the invention (e.g., compound of Formula I) suitable for oral administration can be prepared as discrete units such as pills, capsules, cachets or tablets each containing a predetermined amount of a compound of the invention.","Compressed tablets can be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active ingredient in a free-flowing form such as a powder or granules, optionally mixed with a binder, lubricant, inert diluent, preservative, surface active or dispersing agent. Molded tablets can be made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered active ingredient moistened with an inert liquid diluent. The tablets can optionally be coated or scored and optionally are formulated so as to provide slow or controlled release of the active ingredient therefrom.","Tablets, troches, lozenges, aqueous or oil suspensions, dispersible powders or granules, emulsions, hard or soft capsules, e.g., gelatin capsules, syrups or elixirs can be prepared for oral use. Formulations of a compound of the invention (e.g., compound of Formula I) intended for oral use can be prepared according to any method known to the art for the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions and such compositions can contain one or more agents including sweetening agents, flavoring agents, coloring agents and preserving agents, in order to provide a palatable preparation. Tablets containing the active ingredient in admixture with non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable excipient, which are suitable for manufacture of tablets, are acceptable. These excipients can be, for example, inert diluents, such as calcium or sodium carbonate, lactose, calcium or sodium phosphate; granulating and disintegrating agents, such as maize starch, or alginic acid; binding agents, such as starch, gelatin or acacia; and lubricating agents, such as magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc. Tablets can be uncoated or can be coated by known techniques including microencapsulation to delay disintegration and adsorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example, a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate alone or with a wax can be employed.","For treatment of the eye or other external tissues, e.g., mouth and skin, the formulations are preferably applied as a topical ointment or cream containing the active ingredient(s) in an amount of, for example, 0.075 to 20% w\/w. When formulated in an ointment, the active ingredient can be employed with either a paraffinic or a water-miscible ointment base. Alternatively, the active ingredients can be formulated in a cream with an oil-in-water cream base.","If desired, the aqueous phase of the cream base can include a polyhydric alcohol, i.e., an alcohol having two or more hydroxyl groups such as propylene glycol, butane 1,3-diol, mannitol, sorbitol, glycerol and polyethylene glycol (including PEG 400) and mixtures thereof. The topical formulations can desirably include a compound which enhances absorption or penetration of the active ingredient through the skin or other affected areas. Examples of such dermal penetration enhancers include dimethyl sulfoxide and related analogs.","The oily phase of the emulsions of this invention can be constituted from known ingredients in a known manner. While the phase can comprise merely an emulsifier, it desirably comprises a mixture of at least one emulsifier with a fat or an oil or with both a fat and an oil. Preferably, a hydrophilic emulsifier is included together with a lipophilic emulsifier which acts as a stabilizer. It is also preferred to include both an oil and a fat. Together, the emulsifier(s) with or without stabilizer(s) make up the so-called emulsifying wax, and the wax together with the oil and fat make up the so-called emulsifying ointment base which forms the oily dispersed phase of the cream formulations. Emulsifiers and emulsion stabilizers suitable for use in the formulation of the invention include TWEEN\u00ae 60, SPAN\u00ae 80, cetostearyl alcohol, benzyl alcohol, myristyl alcohol, glyceryl mono-stearate and sodium lauryl sulfate.","Aqueous suspensions of a compound of the invention (e.g., compound of Formula I) contain the active materials in admixture with excipients suitable for the manufacture of aqueous suspensions. Such excipients include a suspending agent, such as sodium carboxymethylcellulose, croscarmellose, povidone, methylcellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, sodium alginate, polyvinylpyrrolidone, gum tragacanth and gum acacia, and dispersing or wetting agents such as a naturally occurring phosphatide (e.g., lecithin), a condensation product of an alkylene oxide with a fatty acid (e.g., polyoxyethylene stearate), a condensation product of ethylene oxide with a long chain aliphatic alcohol (e.g., heptadecaethyleneoxycetanol), a condensation product of ethylene oxide with a partial ester derived from a fatty acid and a hexitol anhydride (e.g., polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate). The aqueous suspension can also contain one or more preservatives such as ethyl or n-propyl p-hydroxybenzoate, one or more coloring agents, one or more flavoring agents and one or more sweetening agents, such as sucrose or saccharin.","A pharmaceutical composition of a compound of the invention (e.g., compound of Formula I) can be in the form of a sterile injectable preparation, such as a sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspension. This suspension can be formulated according to the known art using those suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents which have been mentioned above. The sterile injectable composition can also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, such as a solution in 1,3-butanediol or prepared as a lyophilized powder. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that can be employed are water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile fixed oils can conventionally be employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil can be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid can likewise be used in the preparation of injectables.","The amount of active ingredient that can be combined with the carrier material to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration. For example, a time-release composition intended for oral administration to humans can contain approximately 1 to 1000 mg of active material compounded with an appropriate and convenient amount of carrier material which can vary from about 5 to about 95% of the total compositions (weight:weight). The pharmaceutical composition can be prepared to provide easily measurable amounts for administration. For example, an aqueous solution intended for intravenous infusion can contain from about 3 to 500 \u03bcg of the active ingredient per milliliter of solution in order that infusion of a suitable volume at a rate of about 30 mL\/hr can occur.","Compositions suitable for parenteral administration include aqueous and non-aqueous sterile injection solutions which can contain anti-oxidants, buffers, bacteriostats and solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient; and aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions which can include suspending agents and thickening agents.","Compositions suitable for topical administration to the eye also include eye drops wherein the active ingredient is dissolved or suspended in a suitable carrier, especially an aqueous solvent for the active ingredient. The active ingredient is preferably present in such formulations in a concentration of about 0.5 to 20% w\/w, for example about 0.5 to 10% w\/w, for example about 1.5% w\/w.","Compositions suitable for topical administration in the mouth include lozenges comprising the active ingredient in a flavored basis, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth; pastilles comprising the active ingredient in an inert basis such as gelatin and glycerin, or sucrose and acacia; and mouthwashes comprising the active ingredient in a suitable liquid carrier.","Compositions for rectal administration can be presented as a suppository with a suitable base comprising for example cocoa butter or a salicylate.","Compositions suitable for intrapulmonary or nasal administration have a particle size for example in the range of 0.1 to 500 microns (including particle sizes in a range between 0.1 and 500 microns in increments microns such as 0.5, 1, 30 microns, 35 microns, etc.), which is administered by rapid inhalation through the nasal passage or by inhalation through the mouth so as to reach the alveolar sacs. Suitable formulations include aqueous or oily solutions of the active ingredient. Formulations suitable for aerosol or dry powder administration can be prepared according to conventional methods and can be delivered with other therapeutic agents such as compounds heretofore used in the treatment or prophylaxis disorders as described below.","Compositions suitable for vaginal administration can be presented as pessaries, tampons, creams, gels, pastes, foams or spray formulations containing in addition to the active ingredient such carriers as are known in the art to be appropriate.","The pharmaceutical compositions can be packaged in unit-dose or multi-dose containers, for example sealed ampoules and vials, and can be stored in a freeze-dried (lyophilized) condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example water, for injection immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions are prepared from sterile powders, granules and tablets of the kind previously described. Preferred unit dosage formulations are those containing a daily dose or unit daily sub-dose, as herein above recited, or an appropriate fraction thereof, of the active ingredient.","The invention further provides veterinary compositions comprising at least one active ingredient (e.g., compound of Formula I) as above defined together with a veterinary carrier therefore.

geometric isomer, tautomer, solvate, metabolite, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt, prodrug thereof, is used as an anticancer agent or as an adjunct agent for the treatment of cancer in a combination therapy. One of ordinary skill in the art is readily able to determine whether or not a candidate compound treats a cancerous condition for any particular cell type, either alone or in combination. Within certain aspects of this embodiment, compounds of the invention are used in adjunct with other therapies, including conventional surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, for the treatment of cancer.","Such therapies can include one or more of the following categories of anti-cancer agents: alkylating agents, angiogenesis inhibitors, antibodies, antimetabolites, antimitotics, antiproliferatives, aurora kinase inhibitors, apoptosis promoters (for example, Bcl-xL, Bcl-w and Bfl-1 inhibitors), activators of death receptor pathway, Bcr-Abl kinase inhibitors, BiTE (Bi-Specific T cell Engager) antibodies, biologic response modifiers, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, cell cycle inhibitors, cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, dual variable domains binding proteins (DVDs), leukemia viral oncogene homolog (ErbB2) receptor inhibitors, growth factor inhibitors, heat shock protein (HSP)-90 inhibitors, histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, hormonal therapies, immunologicals, inhibitors of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) intercalating antibiotics, kinase inhibitors, mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors, microRNA's mitogen-activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase inhibitors, multivalent binding proteins, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), poly ADP (adenosine diphosphate)-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, platinum chemotherapeutics, polo-like kinase (Plk) inhibitors, proteosome inhibitors, purine analogs, pyrimidine analogs, receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors, retinoids\/deltoids plant alkaloids, small inhibitory ribonucleic acids (siRNAs), topoisomerase inhibitors, combinations thereof and the like.","BiTE antibodies are bi-specific antibodies that direct T-cells to attack cancer cells by simultaneously binding the two cells. The T-cell then attacks the target cancer cell. Examples of BiTE antibodies include adecatumumab (Micromet MT201), blinatumomab (Micromet MT103) and the like. Without being limited by theory, one of the mechanisms by which T-cells elicit apoptosis of the target cancer cell is by exocytosis of cytolytic granule components, which include perforin and granzyme B. In this regard, Bcl-2 has been shown to attenuate the induction of apoptosis by both perforin and granzyme B. These data suggest that inhibition of Bcl-2 could enhance the cytotoxic effects elicited by T-cells when targeted to cancer cells (V. R. Sutton, D. L. Vaux and J. A. Trapani (1997) J. of Immunology. 158 (12): 5783).","SiRNAs are molecules having endogenous RNA bases or chemically modified nucleotides. The modifications do not abolish cellular activity, but rather impart increased stability and\/or increased cellular potency. Examples of chemical modifications include phosphorothioate groups, 2\u2032-deoxynucleotide, 2\u2032\u2014OCH-containing ribonucleotides, 2\u2032-F-ribonucleotides, 2\u2032-methoxyethyl ribonucleotides, combinations thereof and the like. The siRNA can have varying lengths (e.g., 10-200 bps) and structures (e.g., hairpins, single\/double strands, bulges, nicks\/gaps, mismatches) and are processed in cells to provide active gene silencing. A double-stranded siRNA (dsRNA) can have the same number of nucleotides on each strand (blunt ends) or asymmetric ends (overhangs). The overhang of 1-2 nucleotides can be present on the sense and\/or the antisense strand, as well as present on the 5\u2032- and\/or the 3\u2032-ends of a given strand. For example, siRNAs targeting Mcl-1 have been shown to enhance the activity of ABT-263, (i.e., N-(4-(4-((2-(4-chlorophenyl)-5,5-dimethyl-1-cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)methyl)piperazin-1-yl)benzoyl)-4-(((1R)-3-(morpholin-4-yl)-1-((phenylsulfanyl)methyl)propyl)amino)-3-((trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl)benzenesulfonamide) or ABT-737 (i.e., N-(4-(4-((4\u2032-chloro(1,1\u2032-biphenyl)-2-yl)methyl)piperazin-1-yl)benzoyl)-4-(((1R)-3-(dimethylamino)-1-((phenylsulfanyl)methyl)propyl)amino)-3-nitrobenzenesulfonamide) in multiple tumor cell lines (Tse et. al (2008) Cancer Research. 68(9): 3421 and references therein).","Multivalent binding proteins are binding proteins comprising two or more antigen binding sites. Multivalent binding proteins are engineered to have the three or more antigen binding sites and are generally not naturally occurring antibodies. The term \u201cmultispecific binding protein\u201d means a binding protein capable of binding two or more related or unrelated targets. Dual variable domain (DVD) binding proteins are tetravalent or multivalent binding proteins binding proteins comprising two or more antigen binding sites. Such DVDs may be monospecific (i.e., capable of binding one antigen) or multispecific (i.e., capable of binding two or more antigens). DVD binding proteins comprising two heavy chain DVD polypeptides and two light chain DVD polypeptides are referred to as DVD Ig's. Each half of a DVD Ig comprises a heavy chain DVD polypeptide, a light chain DVD polypeptide, and two antigen binding sites. Each binding site comprises a heavy chain variable domain and a light chain variable domain with a total of 6 CDRs involved in antigen binding per antigen binding site.","Alkylating agents include

The 384 deep well plates and the Polypropylene 50 \u03bcL, V bottom polypropylene compound plates were purchased from Matrical.","Preparation of Compounds","Compounds of the invention were prepared as 10 mM stocks with 100% DMSO on the day prior to performing the assay. 12 \u03bcL of 100% DMSO and 6 \u03bcL of 10 mM compound (i.e. 3.333 mM, final 100 \u03bcM) was added to columns 1 and 12 in the Polypropylene 50 \u03bcL, V bottom compound plates. To achieve a final compound concentration of 1 \u03bcM, in a separate matrical plate, 28 \u03bcL of 100% DMSO and 2 \u03bcL of 10 mM compound was added to a well, mixed well, 2 \u03bcL of this solution was taken and added to 38 \u03bcL of 100% DMSO. 20 \u03bcL of this solution was added to the test matrical plate. Several control compounds were included in the test plates. For the control wells 15 \u03bcL 100% DMSO only was added to the appropriate wells of each plate. The compound plates were then serially diluted 2 fold using the MiniTrak. Once titrations were complete, the compound plate was immediately covered with a foil seal to prevent evaporation.","Buffer Preparation","The assay and bead buffers were prepared fresh. Each titrated compound plate was assayed in duplicate. The following volumes were sufficient to run 12 Proxiplates (4 assay plates run in duplicate in each of Bclxl, hmMcl and counter

For example, their activity on cell viability can be assessed on a panel of cultured tumorigenic and non-tumorigenic cell lines, as well as primary mouse or human cell populations. In one exemplary set of conditions, 5,000-20,000 cells are cultured at 37\u00b0 C. and 10% COin appropriate growth media (e.g., 100 pt Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, asparaginase, and 2-mercaptoethanol in the case of pre-B E\u03bc-Myc mouse tumors) in 96 well plates. Cell viability and total cell numbers can be monitored after several hours to several days of incubation with 1 nM-100 \u03bcM of the compounds to identify those that kill at EC<10 \u03bcM. Cell viability can be determined by the ability of the cells to exclude propidium iodide (10 \u03bcg\/mL by immunofluorescence analysis of emission wavelengths of 660-675 nm on a flow cytometer (BD FACScan) or by luminescent detection after incubation with CELL TITER-GLOS. Alternatively, a high throughput colorimetric assay such as the CELLTITER\u00ae 96 Aqueous Non-Radioactive Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega) may be used. Cell death by apoptosis is confirmed by pre-incubation of the cells with 50 \u03bcM of a caspase inhibitor such as zVAD-fmk.","a. Cell Viability Assay for Mcl-1 Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts (MEF):","Neutralization of both Bcl-xand Mcl-1 anti-apoptotic proteins in normal cells is required before a cell undergoes apoptosis via the downstream Bax\/Bak pathway See, Chen, L. et al. . (2005) 17, 393-403; Willis, S. N. et al. . (2005) 19, 1294-1305. A compound that only targets Bcl-xshould not affect normal cells, but could kill certain cancer cells if they rely more on Bcl-xand less on other anti-apoptotic proteins, e.g., Mcl-1, for survival. To mirror this, compounds of the invention were tested for its effect on survival of wild type (wt) mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs), Bax\/Bak double knockout (BB DKO) MEFs, MEFs that expressed Noxa, and MEFs that expressed Bad. Noxa specifically neutralizes Mcl-1. Hence, MEFs that express Noxa mirror cancer cell types that are reliant on Bcl-xfor survival and should be much more sensitive to killing by a Bcl-xtargeting compound than MEFs where both Bcl-xand Mcl-1 are protective.","In this assay, Mcl-1cells were used to confirm that cell apoptosis in the presence of BH3 mimetic small molecules was due to predominantly Bcl-xinactivation. This inactivation leaves Bax\/Bak unconstrained and results in apoptosis. The CELLTITER-GLO Luminescent Cell Viability Assay is a homogeneous method of determining the number of viable cells in culture based on quantitation of the ATP present. The amount of ATP correlates with the presence of metabolically active cells such that following cell lysis the amount of ATP present is proportional to the amount of luminescence measured.","Materials","Mcl-1mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) are an adherent cell line prepared in house. MEFs were grown in Iwaki 75 cmtissue culture flasks (cat #3123-075) with FMA media which consists of:\n\n","FMA was stored at 4\u00b0 C. and used at 37\u00b0 C.

The compounds were made up in Matrical 384-well, 25 \u03bcl V-bottomed plates (cat #MP101-2-PP), sealed with aluminium foil from Beckman Coulter (cat #538619) and stored at 12\u00b0 C. overnight. Compound preparation and titrations were performed in AnalaR grade DMSO (Merck cat #1.02952.2500). The cell viability detection assay used was CELLTITRE-GLO\u2122 which is commercially available from Promega (cat #G7572), stored at \u221220\u00b0 C. and used at 37\u00b0 C.","Automated Systems that can be used in this assay include: 1) Multidrop\u2014The MULTIDROP 384 (ThermoLabsystems) dispenser was used to dispense cells aseptically into the assay plates; 2) MiniTrak\u2014The MINITRAK system from Perkin Elmer was used for titration of the compound plates; 3) Zymark\u2014The ZYMARK SCICLONE ALH3000 System with 100 mL pintool head was used for compound addition to the cells; 4) EnVision\u2014The ENVISION plate reader was used to measure the viability via the detection of the luminescence.","Compounds of the invention were prepared as 10 mM solution in 100% DMSO and stored at \u221220\u00b0 C. Compounds were thawed to room temperature and dispensed into a 384 well Matrical plate. Standard control compounds, e.g. 32.3 mM Etoposide, were added to the plate as controls.","The plates can be sealed with foil seals and stored at 12\u00b0 C. overnight. The compound plates were left to thaw at room temperature and the compounds titrated 1:3 in 100% DMSO on the MiniTrak (see methods section below\u2014day 3).","Method","1. Day One\u2014Cell Splitting","The media was aspirated and the Mcl-1cells washed with 10 mls of warmed MT-PBS. MT-PBS was aspirated and 1 ml of trypsin was added. The T75 flasks were incubated at 37\u00b0 C. until the cells became detached. 4 ml of 10% FCS FMA media was added to the trypsinized cells and the entire volume was transferred to a 50 ml centrifuge tube and centrifuged for 3 minutes at 250 g. The supernatant was aspirated and the pellet resuspended in 10 ml of 10% FCS FMA. 3 ml of this cell suspension was added to a clean 75 cmflask containing 17 ml of 10% FCS FMA media, thus performing a 3:10 split. The remaining cell suspension was used to perform a 1:50 split into another 75 cmflask for further culturing.","2. Day Two\u2014Seeding Assay Plates and Setting Up Compound Plates","Cells were harvested as per method step 1 and the pellet resuspended in 3 mls 10% FCS FMA. Cell number was determined by counting in a Neubauer haemocytometer and the dilution calculated to achieve a density of 1\u00d710cells ml(500 cells per well in 50 \u03bcl media). Separate dilutions were prepared in 50 ml 10% FCS FMA and 50 ml 1% FCS FMA solutions respectively.","Four assay plates were set up per compound plate. Two 384 well plates containing Mcl-1cells in 10% FCS FMA and the other two plates containing Mcl-1cells in 1% FCS FMA.","Using the Multidrop, 25 \u03bcl cells were dispensed aseptically into all 384 wells of the assay plates. Plates were left to rest in a non-stacked layer at room temperature for approximately 30 minutes (minimizes edge-effects) and then were placed as a single layer in the 37\u00b0 C. incubator. The plates were left to incubate overnight.","3. Day Three\u2014Titrating Compound Plates and Treating the Cells","The compound plates were titrated by performing a 3-fold 11-point dilution series using 100% DMSO on the MiniTrak. Following titration of the compounds, 100 nl of compounds were added to the cell plates using the Zymark Sciclone Pintool. This was a 1:250 dilution of the compound so the highest final concentration of compound was 40 \u03bcM. The plates were then returned to 37\u00b0 C. incubator and left to incubate overnight.","4. Day Four\u2014Viability Analysis","The CELLTITRE-GLO\u2122 solution was prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions by the reconstitution of CELLTITRE-GLO\u2122 Substrate with CELLTITRE-GLO\u2122 Buffer and stored after use at \u221280\u00b0 C. Plates were removed from incubator and left to equilibrate to room temperature for 15 mins. 25 \u03bcl of diluted CELLTITRE-GLO\u2122 was added to each well of the assay plates using the Multidrop. The plates were mixed on a plate shaker for 15 mins before being read on the Envision using the luminescence protocol.","Data Analysis","The percent inhibition was calculated using the following equation:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0663","num":"0682"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00003","num":"00003"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":["%","Inhibition"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.6em","height":"0.6ex"}}}},{"mn":"100","mo":"*","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mn":"1","mo":"-","mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mfrac":{"mrow":[{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":"x","mo":"-","msup":{"mi":"\u03bc","mo":"-"}}},{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msup":[{"mi":"\u03bc","mo":"+"},{"mi":"\u03bc","mo":"-"}],"mo":"-"}}]}}}}}],"mo":"="}}}},"x=CPS obtained after sample compound treatment","\u03bc=CPS obtained for the negative controls","\u03bc=CPS obtained for the positive controls","ICvalues were obtained by non-linear least squares fitting of the data, of the data using, e.g, the 4-parameter logistic fit (XLFit 4 eqn #205;\n\n(()\/(1+(()^))).\n","The quality of the assay results were monitored by determination of the Z\u2032 factor for each assay plate, where Z\u2032\u22670.5 for the results was considered as robust (Zhang et al, J Biomol Screening, 4:67-73, 1999).","MEF Mcl-1 KO cell viability results (i.e. ECin micromolar and assay performed in the presence of 1% Fetal Bovine Serum) for certain compounds of the invention, i.e., compounds 74, 79, 90 and 92 in Table 1, are 0.06, 0.21, 0.59, 0.15, respectively.","b.
