Such a property would be advantageous in fields as diverse as adhesives, coatings, molding, and heterogeneous encapsulation. By way of illustration, a polyurethane adhesive after thermoset cure would have a beneficial property of being able to reversibly liquefy for the purpose of either adjusting relative orientation of adhesed articles and then rebuilding viscosity and\/or to replace an object adhesed to a substrate without damage to the underlying substrate. Likewise, a marred or otherwise damaged polyurethane or polyurea coating having the attribute of reversibly reducing viscosity and thereafter rebuilding to cure viscosity would be beneficial in healing such defects in a coating. In a molding application, the formation of a \u201clost wax\u201d casting positive is facilitated by the ability to reduce the viscosity of a casting model while also modifying the hydrophilicity of the components from which the model is formed to facilitate mold purge prior to a mold pour. Still further, polyurethane matrices are routinely used to encapsulate heterogeneous particulate in applications such as propellants. While the polyurethane matrix is beneficial in forming shaped propellant charges and extending storage lifetime of propellant components against reaction with oxygen and\/or water, at the time of propellant ignition, the viscosity of a polyurethane matrix results in a deleterious thrust profile relative to homogeneous propellants.","Diels-Alder reactions are known to produce linkages that are thermally reversible. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,489,451 and 6,825,315 are representative of polyacrylates and polyepoxides inclusive of Diels-Alder functionalities. Unfortunately, these chemistries have not been extended to form single Diels-Alder linkages proximal to a conventional crosslinker in a polymer and under conditions of conventional crosslinking.","Thus, there exists a need for a reversible viscosity reducing polymers such as polyurea and polyurethane polymers containing Diels-Alder linkages. There further exists a need for the use of such polymers as adhesives, coatings, moldings, and polymer matrices.","A reversible viscosity reducing polymer is provided that has a crosslinkage between subunits when the crosslinkage is inclusive of a Diels-Alder linkage in thermodynamic equilibrium with a diene and dienophile. The crosslinkage has the form:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"27.52mm","wi":"69.85mm","file":"US07812069-20101012-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"where L is covalently bonded to a first polymer subunit and is independently in each occurrence NHR\u2014, [imidazole-R], HS\u2014, HO\u2014, ROOC\u2014, C(R)\u2550CR, H(R)C\u2550CH\u2014HC\u2550CR, OCN\u2014, XOC\u2014(X\u2550Cl, Br, I), N\u2014; Ris independently in each occurrence hydrogen or C-Calkyl; Ris an electron, hydrogen, C-Calkyl; M is a conventional crosslinking agent moiety known to be reactive with L of isocyanate, \u2014OH, NH, \u2014COOH; Ris in each occurrence independently a nullity or an intermediate linker of C-Calkyl, C-Calkenyl, and C-Caryl; Yis a Diels-Alder reactive moiety of a diene or dienophile; Yis a complementary Diels-Alder reactive moiety relative to Yand is a dienophile when Yis a diene, and vice versa; L\u2032 is independently in each occurrence NHR\u2014, [imidazole-R], HS\u2014, HO\u2014, ROOC\u2014, C(R)\u2550CR\u2014, R\u2550CH\u2014HC\u2550CR, OCN\u2014, XOC\u2014(X\u2550Cl, Br, I), N\u2014; Ris a nullity, C-Calkyl, C-Calkenyl, or C-Caryl; and Z is L- or L\u2032-R\u2014Y\u2014Y\u2014R-M-L- where Z is coupled to a second polymer subunit. Such a reversible viscosity reducing polymer is particularly well suited as a matrix material for a heterogeneous propellant.","A process for forming a reversible viscosity reducing polymer inclusive of a single Diels-Alder linkage within a thermoset crosslinkage occurs through reacting a native crosslinkable moiety with a crosslinker moiety having a Diels-Alder reactive moiety of a diene or dienophile attached thereto to form a Diels-Alder reactive moiety capped polymer subunit. The Diels-Alder reactive moiety capped polymer subunit is then exposed to a Diels-Alder reactant inclusive of a complementary Diels-Alder reactive moiety relative to the Diels-Alder reactive moiety where the Diels-Alder reactant also includes at least one conventional crosslinkable moiety to form a crosslinkable moiety capped polymer subunit containing an intermediate Diels-Alder linkage. Reaction of the crosslinkable moiety capped polymer subunit containing an intermediate Diels-Alder linkage is then reacted with a conventional multifunctional crosslinking agent.","The present invention has utility as a reversible viscosity reducing polymer. The reversible viscosity is achieved through the inclusion of a Diels-Alder bond that is thermodynamically reversible in response to energy input such as mechanical stress or heating. Exemplary uses for an inventive polymer include, but are not limited to, adhesives, coatings, and matrices for heterogeneous propellants.","The ability to selectively reduce polymer viscosity through stimulus input allows one to readily remove or reposition such an adhesive, heal a scratched coating, and improve propellant emission performance, respectively. These desirable attributes are obtained while improving heat flow between high viscosity and low viscosity states of an inventive polymer while maintaining thermal stability and processing conditions of a conventional polymer devoid of Diels-Alder linkages.","According to the present invention, a diene or a dienophile coupled to a moiety capable of reacting with a hydroxyl or amine group of an aliphatic polymer subunit is reacted to obtain a polymer subunit having an exposed diene or dienophile. Subsequent reaction with complementary diene or dienophile necessary to form a Diels-Alder linkage and terminating in a moiety capable of conventional crosslinking incorporates reversible viscosity building characteristics into an inventive polymer.","An attribute of the present invention is the modification of a polymer subunit containing a native crosslinkable moiety first molecule to covalently bond to either a diene or dienophile to render the crosslinkable moiety no longer reactive. The exposed diene or dienophile extending from the polymer subunit is then reacted with a second molecule containing a complementary dienophile or diene, respectively, to form a Diels-Alder linkage. The second molecule carrying the complementary dienophile\/diene also includes a second molecule crosslinkable moiety. The second crosslinkable moiety is induced to crosslink through exposing the polymer unit containing a Diels-Alder linkage to a conventional crosslinking agent under conditions to induce the second molecule crosslinking moiety to react. As a result, a crosslinked thermoset composition is obtained that possesses the processing and performance characteristics similar to a conventional polymer based on the polymer subunit and crosslinking agent that reversibly reduces viscosity through the thermodynamic dissociation and optional reassociation of the Diels-Alder linkages intermediate between the crosslinkages and polymer subunits.","The polymer subunit backbone optionally includes aliphatic branches, pendent nonaliphatic moieties, and backbone aliphatic unsaturations that include carbon-carbon double bonds. The aliphatic polymer subunit also has at least two native crosslinkable moieties, L and is represented by the Formula (I):\n\nBL)\u2003\u2003(I)\n\nwhere B is a polymer subunit such as a polyalkane such as polyethylene or polypropylene, polyalkylene such as polybutadiene, or butadiene-acrylonitrile-acrylic acid, and carboxy terminated polybutadiene; L is independently in each occurrence a native crosslinkable moiety of NHR, [imidazole-R], HS\u2014, HO\u2014, ROOC\u2014, C(R)\u2550CR, H(R)C\u2550CH\u2014HC\u2550CR\u2014, OCN\u2014, XOC\u2014(X\u2550Cl, Br, I), R\u2550C\u2014, N\u2014; Ris independently in each occurrence hydrogen or C-Calkyl; Ris an electron, hydrogen, C-Calkyl; and m is an integer of 2 or more. Preferably, B has a molecular weight of between 500 and 10,000 g\/mol. Preferably, L is the same in every occurrence. It is appreciated that m is an integer, while average m values can include non-integer values. When m is greater than 2 a crosslinked polymer may result including, but not limited to, three-dimensional crosslinked structures.\n","The conventional thermoset polymer precursor of Formula (I) is reacted with a first molecule having the Formula (II):\n\nM-R\u2014Y\u2003\u2003(II)\n\nwhere M is a conventional crosslinking agent moiety known to be reactive with L of Formula (I) and includes isocyanate, epoxy, acid halide, azides, alkynes; Yis a Diels-Alder reactive moiety of a diene or a dienophile; and Ris a nullity, or an intermediate linker of C-Calkyl, C-Calkenyl, or C-Caryl. Representative dienes and dienophiles illustratively include maleimide, acid anhydrides, furans, and alkenes. It is appreciated that Y need not be a terminal moiety and is optionally a pendent moiety extending from R. Specific crosslinking moiety pairs for L-M or M-L illustratively include \u2014OH+\u2014NCO, \u2014NH+NCO, \u2014N\u2261N\u2014+CHCH\u2014, \u2014N+HC\u2261C\u2014, \u2014OH+\u2014CHCHO, \u2014NH+\u2014CHCHO.\n","Subsequent to reaction of a polymer subunit of Formula (I) and a first molecule of Formula (II), a diene or dienophile capped polymer subunit exists. Reaction thereof with a complementary diene or dienophile creates a polymer subunit capped with a second molecule crosslinkable moiety and an intermediate Diels-Alder linkage when the second molecule has the Formula (III):\n\n(L\u2032)-R\u2014Y\u2003\u2003(III)\n\nwhere L\u2032 and Rare each independently selected from those moieties detailed with respect to L of Formula (I) and Y of Formula (II), respectively, and need not be the identical moiety for a given L or R; Yis a complementary Diels-Alder reactive moiety relative to Yof the ligand of Formula (II) and selected from the Y moieties listed such that Yis a dienophile when Yis a diene, and vice versa; and q has a value greater than 2, including non-integer values. It should be noted that the summation of q from formula III and m from formula I must be at least four, while maintaining a minimum functionality of two for either q or m.\n","A generic Diels-Alder reaction is provided in Scheme 1 for a furan and maleimide.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"49.70mm","wi":"75.78mm","file":"US07812069-20101012-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{}},"Diels-Alder chemistry involves an equilibrium between a diene and a dienophile forming a Diels-Alder linkage formed at lower temperature (right side of reaction Scheme 1) and at higher temperature equilibrium favoring dissociation of the Diels-Alder linkage. According to Scheme 1, the furan (diene) is depicted as corresponding to a first molecule of Formula (II) while the maleimide (dienophile) is depicted as being a second molecule of Formula (III).","While Scheme 1 depicts dissociation of the Diels-Alder linkage occurring at about 90\u00b0 Celsius, it is appreciated that the equilibrium kinetics are readily modified through resort to other diene-dienophile pairs. By way of example, dimethyl fulvene-maleimide dissociation occurs at approximately 90\u00b0 Celsius, anthracene-maleimide dissociation occurs at approximately 120\u00b0 Celsius, and anthracene-anthracene Diels-Alder dissociation occurs at approximately 180\u00b0 Celsius. The dissociation of the Diels-Alder linkage is endothermic thereby absorbing energy from the thermoset system. The endothermic nature of Diels-Alder linkage dissociation is particularly advantageous in applications such as heterogeneous propellant matrices. Additionally, it is appreciated that by adjusting the stoichiometry of Diels-Alder linkages present relative to the conventional polymer subunits, more than zero and up to 100% crosslinkable moieties of polymer subunit are modified to include Diels-Alder linkages prior to crosslinking. Curtailing the percent of crosslinkable moieties modified to include Diels-Alder linkages, through selection of the Diels-Alder diene and dienophiles, the heat flow, temperature, and minimal viscosity are readily tailored to a desired specification.","After reaction forming a Diels-Alder linkage (Y\u2014Y), a polymer subunit is formed that again includes crosslinkable exposed moieties L\u2032.

Typical of a traditional crosslinking agent operative herein is a di- or higher functionality isocyanate. Representative of such isocyanates are hexamethylene diisocyanate (\u201cHMDI\u201d), isophorone diisocyanate (\u201cIPDI\u201d), toluene diisocyanate (\u201cTDI\u201d), trimethylxylene diisocyanate (\u201cTMDI\u201d), dimeryl diisocyanate (\u201cDDT\u201d), diphenylmethane diisocyanate (\u201cMDI\u201d), naphthalene diisocyanate (\u201cNDI\u201d), dianisidine diisocyanate (\u201cDADI\u201d), phenylene diisocyanate (\u201cPDI\u201d), xylene diisocyanate (\u201cMXDI\u201d), ethylenediisocyanate (\u201cHDI\u201d), other diisocyanates, triisocyanates, and polyfunctional isocyanates, such as Desmodur N-100 and mixtures thereof.","In contrast to bismaleimide crosslinking agents used conventionally to crosslink epoxides, mono-maleimide or other monofunctional dieneophiles are used in the present invention to form single Diels-Alder linkages intermediate between a native polymer subunit crosslinkable moiety and a conventional multifunctional crosslinking agent to form a crosslinkage of the form:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00003","num":"00003"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00003","he":"27.52mm","wi":"69.85mm","file":"US07812069-20101012-C00003.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sup":["4","4"],"sub":["A","D","D ","A "]},"An exemplary synthetic scheme through reaction with a second molecule of Formula (III) is depicted in Scheme 2 where the conventional aliphatic polymer subunit is hydroxyl terminated polybutadiene, the first molecule is 2-furfuryl isocyanate, and the second molecule is N-(4-hydroxyl-phenyl)-maleimide.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00004","num":"00004"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00004","he":"166.03mm","wi":"157.56mm","file":"US07812069-20101012-C00004.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{}},"It is appreciated that by swapping moieties M and Scheme 2 provides the conditions for equilibrium formation of PBD containing an intermediate Diels-Alder linkage and terminated in hydroxyl groups amenable to crosslinking with a conventional crosslinking agent such as a di- or tri-isocyanate.","The present invention resorts to Diels-Alder chemistry to provide a bond internal to a crosslinked thermoset composition subject to reversible scission in response to an energetic stimulus such as an increase in temperature or mechanical stress.

A particular advantage of the present invention is that system optimization associated with selecting a new base polymer or inclusion of a thermoset polymer matrix additive, both approaches require greater effort to achieve an optimal system as the heat flow characteristics of the present invention inclusive of an intermediate Diels-Alder linkage.","To form a heterogeneous propellant, an inventive prepolymer terminating in crosslinkable moieties L\u2032 and containing intermediate Diels-Alder linkages to a polymer backbone alone or in combination with a conventional polymer backbone terminated in native crosslinkable moieties L are mixed with an oxidizer, such as a NHNO, NHClO, NHClO, NaNOO, NaClO, NaClO, KNO, KClO, KClOand other perchlorates; a particulate fuel, such as metallic particulate; and other optional additives such as a burn rate modifier, bonding agents, plasticizers, antioxidant scavengers and the like. The polymer subunits terminating in crosslinkable moieties L\u2032 and optionally L are crosslinked with conventional crosslinking agent.","With reaction between an isocyanate and a group L or L\u2032, a crosslinkage is formed. By way of example, a reaction of an isocyanate with the following L or L\u2032 moieties forms a crosslinkage as follows: hydroxyl\u2192urethane, amine\u2192urea, carboxyl\u2192carbamate. Crosslinking occurs at 20\u00b0 Celsius, the kinetics of a crosslinking reaction are modified by inclusion of crosslinking catalysts such as an organotin compound, heating, or change in pressure. The kinetics of isocyanate cure are well known to one of skill in the art. Component proportions and process for forming a heterogeneous propellant inclusive of Diels-Alder linkages within the thermoset polymer matrix are detailed in U.S. Pat. No. 7,011,722 where an inventive thermoset polymer is readily substituted for the conventional binder detailed therein.","The present invention is further detailed with respect to the following nonlimiting examples.

Maleic anhydride (40 g, 400 mmol) is dissolved in acetone (300 mL) and added to the Erlenmeyer flask. Addition of the maleic anhydride induces a large exotherm and a color change from brown to bright yellow. The solution becomes homogenous for 3-5 min, followed by rapid precipitation of a yellow solid. The resulting mixture is stirred at room temperature for at least 2 h. The precipitate is isolated via filtration and rinsed with acetone (\u02dc200 mL). The yellow precipitate (\u02dc75 g), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) (50 mL) and a stir bar are loaded into a 300 mL round bottom flask.
