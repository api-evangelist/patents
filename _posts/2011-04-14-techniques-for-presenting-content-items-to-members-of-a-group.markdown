title: Techniques for presenting content items to members of a group
abstract: In a method of ranking or filtering new content items for presentation to members of a group of users of a social-networking service, content items that are candidates for presentation to the members are received. A user of the social-networking service is enabled to serve as a curator of the candidates, with the enabling including enabling the user to scroll through subsets of the candidates in a carousel user interface to indicate an opinion of the user with respect to an importance to the group of each of one or more candidates. One or more of the candidates are presented to the members of the group based on the opinion of the user with respect to the candidates.

On his personal home page or within his profile, a user may specify information about himself. For example, the user may specify information about his relationships with other users of the social-networking site. That is, the user may maintain a list of other users to whom he is connected. In addition, the user may maintain a list of other users that he is following. The user's home page or personal profile information may indicate the other users with whom he is connected, the other users that he is following, and the other users who are following him.","In the context of a social-networking site, a designation of a first user as a \u201cconnection\u201d of a second user may imply that the first user personally knows the second user. A designation of a first user as a \u201cfollower\u201d of a third user may imply that the first user has specified an interest in being notified of the activities of the third user, regardless of whether the first user knows the third user personally. Via the user's home page or personal profile, the user may also specify information about his appearance (e.g., one or more photos of himself), his current status (e.g., what he is currently doing), his current company position or title, his work history or experience, his educational background (e.g., schools he has attended or degrees he has earned), his favorite websites, his contact information (e.g., phone numbers, email addresses, web sites, and so on), his personal interests, and so on. On his personal home page, the user may also share information, including an idea, a link (e.g., Uniform Resource Locator (URL)) to an Internet resource, an article, and so on with the general public or selected people.","In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide an understanding of various embodiments of the inventive subject matter. It will be evident, however, to those skilled in the art that embodiments may be practiced without these specific details. Further, well-known instruction instances, protocols, structures, and techniques have not been shown in detail. As used herein, the term \u201cor\u201d may be construed in an inclusive or exclusive sense, the term \u201cuser\u201d may be construed to include a person or a machine, and the term \u201cinterface\u201d may be construed to include an application programming interface (API) or a user interface.","In a method of ranking or filtering new content items for presentation to members of a group of users of a social-networking service, content items that are candidates for presentation to the members are received. A user of the social-networking service is enabled to serve as a curator of the candidates, the enabling including enabling the user to scroll through subsets of the candidates in a carousel user interface to indicate an opinion of the user with respect to an importance to the group of each of one or more candidates. One or more of the candidate content items are presented to the members of the group based on the opinion of the user with respect to the candidate content items.","This method and the various embodiments disclosed herein may be implemented as a computer system having one or more modules or engines (e.g., hardware engines or software engines, implemented with a processor, or other application specific hardware). This method and the various embodiments disclosed herein may be embodied as instructions stored on a machine-readable medium that, when executed by a processor, cause the processor to perform the method.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","102","104","106","108","110","112","106","108"]},"An API server  and a web server  are coupled to, and provide programmatic and web interfaces respectively to, one or more application servers . The application servers  host one or more social-networking applications . The application servers  are, in turn, shown to be coupled to one or more databases servers  that facilitate access to one or more databases or NoSQL or non-relational data stores .","The social-networking applications  may provide a number of social-networking functions and services to users that access the networked system . While the social-networking applications  are shown in  to form part of the networked system , in alternative embodiments, the social-networking applications  may form part of a service that is separate and distinct from the networked system .","Further, while the system  shown in  employs a client-server architecture, various embodiments are, of course, not limited to such an architecture, and could equally well find application in a distributed, or peer-to-peer, architecture system, for example. The various social-networking applications  could also be implemented as standalone software programs, which do not necessarily have networking capabilities. Additionally, although  depicts machines , , and  as being coupled to a single networked system , it will be readily apparent to one skilled in the art that machines , , and , as well as applications , , and , may be coupled to multiple networked systems. For example, the applications , , and  may be coupled to multiple social networking applications , such as payment applications associated with multiple payment processors (e.g., VISA\u00ae, MASTERCARD\u00ae, and AMERICAN EXPRESS\u00ae).","The web client  accesses the various social-networking applications  via the web interface supported by the web server . Similarly, the programmatic client  accesses the various services and functions provided by the social-networking applications  via the programmatic interface provided by the API server . The programmatic client  may, for example, be a seller application (e.g., the TurboLister application developed by eBay Inc., of San Jose, Calif.) to enable sellers to author and manage listings on the networked system  in an off-line manner, and to perform batch-mode communications between the programmatic client  and the networked system .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["128","130","102","114","128","102","102"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["120","120","202","120"]},"The group engine  includes a source engine  configured to receive content items from content sources associated with the group. The content items may come in various forms, including blog postings, news feed postings, user postings (e.g., via a group sharing module, which is described in more detail below), and so on. The content sources may be associated with the group by an administrator of the group. The content items may be \u201cnew\u201d items with respect to the group in that they may not have been previously presented (e.g., via a presentation engine ) to members of the group.","The group engine  includes a curator engine  configured to enable one or more users of the social-networking applications  to serve as curators of content items that are received (e.g., via the source engine ) as candidate content items to be presented to one or more members of the group.","The group engine  includes a carousel engine  configured to present the received content items in a user interface. The user interface may have a carousel style that enables a curator to step through, filter, navigate, or otherwise easily access the received content items such that the curator may specify his opinion of the importance of each content item to the group (see, e.g., ). The carousel engine  may filter or present the received content items to each curator in a particular order based on information pertaining to the source of the content item (e.g., an importance level of the source to the group, which may be predetermined by an administrator of the group, or how recently the content item was received) or information pertaining to the curator (e.g., the curator's knowledge, interest, or expertise with respect to a subject matter of the content item). Thus, carousel engine  may ensure that the content items are presented to curators for judging based on various factors such as how new or relevant the content items are.","The group engine  includes the presentation engine  configured to present one or more of the received content items to members of the group. The presentation engine  may present a subset of the received content items based on the opinions of the curators of the importance to the group of each of the received content items. The presentation engine  may aggregate the opinions of the curators such that some opinions are weighted more heavily than others. For example, an opinion of a curator having a higher level of influence over members of the group or the social-networking site may be given more weight than an opinion of a curator having a lower level of influence. The curator engine  may determine a level of influence of a curator based on various factors, including the curator's number of connections, amount of time served as a member of the group or a user of the social networking applications , number of postings, title, appointed role, level of expertise, or any other data accessible by the social networking applications  pertaining to the curator's level of influence.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","302","204","120"]},"At operation , the curator engine  presents the candidates to a curator of the group (e.g., via a carousel user interface presented by the carousel engine ). The curator engine  may select the curator from users of the social-networking service or members of the group. The curator engine  receives from the curator an opinion of the importance of one or more of the candidates to the group.","At operation , the presentation engine  presents at least one of the candidates to a member of the group based on the opinion of the curator. The presentation engine  may further filter or rank the content items to be presented to the group member based on various factors, such as information about the interests of the user or the recentness of an original publication of the content item by the source of the content item.

As described above, the aggregating may include a weighting of the opinions of the curators such that some opinions are favored over other opinions (e.g., an opinion of a curator having a good reputation among members of the group or the social-networking site may be favored over an opinion of a curator having a bad reputation). The curator engine  may determine that a discussion of the idea has become the most popular activity (or one of the most popular threads) of the group over a period of time (e.g., days or weeks) as a result of, for example, the other group members commenting on the idea or expressing their liking or disliking of the idea. For example, whenever a group member comments on the idea, all of that group member's followers may be notified of the group member's comment. In turn, the group member's followers may be more likely to participate in the discussion (e.g., decide to bring their expertise to bear on the matter). Upon a posting of one of the followers of the group member, followers of the follower of the group member may be notified of the follower's activity related to the idea, creating a snowball effect of participation in the discussion of the idea.","At operation , the presentation engine  presents the candidate to the members of the group based on the ranking.

The groups may be associated with particular topics that the users may be interested in discussing, organizations that the users may want to join or express an affiliation with, or companies that the users work for. For example, the social-networking site may include groups for fans of the Smash Mouth band, for software engineers interested in discussing Android operating system development, for workers of MICROSOFT\u00ae, and so on. A user may create or join a group. After joining a group, a user may choose to specify his membership in the group on his personal home page. A creator of a group may serve as an administrator of a group or designate another user to serve as the administrator of the group. An administrator may, in turn, designate other users to serve as additional administrators of the group. An administrator of the group may have special privileges that non-administrators do not have. For example, an administrator may be responsible for allowing a user to join the group, deleting posts, moving posts, and so on. Additionally, an administrator may also have further privileges related to controlling the sources of content that may be displayed on the group home page, as described below.","A user that is a member of a group may wish to share information with other members of the group. To simplify this sharing of information, the group engine  may provide a group sharing module (e.g., to be displayed on a group home page for each group).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6","FIG. 5"],"b":["600","600","500","600","500","600"]},"Although the process the user uses to share information with the group may be the same (or, at least, similar to) the process the user uses to share information with his connections or followers (e.g., via the sharing module ), the goals of group sharing may be different from the goals of individual sharing. For example, an idea that the user finds interesting may not be interesting to a majority of the members of the group and vice versa. Furthermore, there may be a different level of demand for information related to the group by members of the group than for information related to the user by the connections or followers of the user.","In addition to an input mechanism like a group sharing module  that allows a member of the group to share information with other members of the group, the group engine  may also provide another input mechanism that allows a user having administrative privileges to the group (e.g., a group creator, administrator, or moderator) to designate one or more additional types or sources of content (e.g., a blog, blog posting service, bulletin board service, newsfeed, etc.) to provide content on the group home page. For example, for a group of fans of a media property (e.g., the Smash Mouth band), the group engine  may enable a moderator to designate a blog for one of the band members or a newsfeed from the band's web site to automatically post content onto the group home page. As another example, for a group focused on the Android mobile operating system development, the group engine  may enable a moderator to select a subset of external content sources to provide content onto the group home page. The group engine  may respond to a command from a moderator to enable the external content sources to post onto the group home page automatically. By enabling postings onto the group home page from external sources, the group engine  may encourage participation in the group (e.g., start a discussion among group members) or provide members of the group with information they would find useful.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["700","120","700","208","208","700","700","208","700","700"]},"The carousel user interface  may include content items provided to the group (e.g., via the source engine ). Such content items may be received from a group member via the group sharing module or from an external source. Although the example carousel user interface  depicted in  contains a single content item (e.g., a news feed posting), the carousel user interface  may include multiple content items. For example, the carousel user interface  may include a subset (e.g., one) of a particular number (e.g., twenty) of the content items that were most recently received. The carousel engine  may ensure that subsets of items in the carousel user interface  are sorted chronologically (e.g., by input date) or by a user-specific priority (e.g., the strength of a relationship between the group member viewing the carousel and each of the group members that provided an item to the carousel). For example, in some embodiments, a certain number of the most recent postings to the group may be selected and then ordered such that the most recent posting that was posted by someone who the viewing user follows is presented first in the carousel user interface .","Regardless of how subsets of items are sorted, the carousel engine  may ensure that the carousel user interface  initially displays a particular item for a first group member based on a calculation of which of the items contained in the carousel user interface  has the highest probability of capturing the interest of the first group member. The carousel engine  may ensure that a number of items in the displayed subset are configurable for all group members by an administrator or configurable by each group member on a group-member basis (e.g., the group member may be able to display all of the items in the carousel by clicking on a \u201cSee all\u201d link.) The number of items in the displayed subset may default to one. The maximum number of items in the carousel may be configurable or based on system capabilities or resources.","The carousel engine  may prioritize or sort items included in the carousel user interface  based on metadata associated with the curator (e.g., a member of the group who is viewing the carousel). For example, the curator may have a stronger relationship with a first group member than the curator has with a second group member (e.g., the curator may be connected to the first group member, whereas the curator may merely be a follower of the second group member, or the curator may be a follower of the first group member but may not have a specified relationship with the second group member). In this case, for the curator, the carousel may initially display an item posted to the group by the first group member instead of displaying an item posted to the group by the second group member. A designation of a connection between the curator and the first group member may cause the carousel engine  to treat the curator as a follower of the first group member and treat the first group member as a follower of the curator. However, the designation of the curator as a follower of the first group member may not cause the carousel engine  to treat the viewing curator as a connection of the first group member or treat the first group member as a follower of the curator.","Thus, the carousel engine  may use strengths of relationships between the curator and other group members (e.g., whether the curator is connected to or follows a first group member or whether another designated relationship exists between the curator and the first group member) to determine which subset of items to first display to the curator in the carousel user interface  and how to order the subsets of items for the curator. The carousel engine  may also prioritize or sort items based on whether they are directly submitted by a real person (e.g., a chief executive officer (CEO) of a company) or received automatically by an external source, such as a data feed.","After a group member posts a content item to the group (e.g., the group member uses the group sharing module to share a link), the carousel engine  may add the content item into the carousel user interface  as a new content item. The new content item may then be seen by group members when they view the group home page. The carousel engine  may cause the carousel user interface  to display a first subset (e.g., one) of the content items in the carousel user interface  for a specific amount of time (e.g., five seconds), then display a second subset of items for a specific amount of time, and so on, rotating through a display of all of the subsets of items to be presented in the carousel user interface . Upon completing the display of a last subset of content items, the carousel engine  may cause the carousel user interface to loop back and display the first subset of items. In addition to enabling a user to automatically scroll through subsets of items and view them, the carousel user interface  may include a user interface element to enable a curator to navigate to a particular subset of items within the carousel user interface . For example, the carousel user interface  may include arrow buttons on the left and right of the carousel to allow the curator to navigate forward or backward through the subsets of items to be presented in the carousel user interface . Navigating forward from the first subset of items may cause the carousel user interface  to display the last subset of items, and navigating backward from the last subset of items may cause the carousel user interface  to display the first subset of items.","The carousel engine  may have a filtering mechanism to prevent \u201cnoise makers,\u201d \u201cself-promoters,\u201d and input from external sources (e.g., really simple syndication (RSS) feeds, web feeds, blogs, etc.) from filling up the carousel user interface . A \u201cnoise maker\u201d may be a group member whose participation in the group has generally not been valuable to other group members. A \u201cself-promoter\u201d may be a group member who participates in the group primarily to bring attention to himself. A determination by the carousel engine  of whether a group member is a noise maker or self-promoter may be based on feedback from group members or a designation by an administrator or moderator of the group. For example, if the source engine  receives multiple items from a single RSS feed, the carousel engine  may display a subset (e.g., one) of the items in the carousel user interface . The subset of the items from the RSS feed may be selected by the carousel engine  based on various factors (e.g., how recently the item was submitted or published). In this way, the carousel engine  may enable posts by a group member to have more visibility to other group members than posts by a non-group member (e.g., an external source) or a group member that may not be providing valuable content (e.g., a noise-maker or self-promoter). Thus, the filtering mechanism may allow group members to focus on activities of people they are following instead of activities of or provided by an external source. For example, a group associated with a company may be configured to automatically receive submissions on a regular basis from various external sources that provide content relevant to the business of the company. More rarely, the group may receive a submission from the company's CEO. As described above, the carousel engine  may filter the items coming from each of the various sources such that only the most recent item from each of the external sources is included in the carousel user interface . Thus, it may be more likely that a curator viewing the carousel user interface  will see the submission from a real person (e.g., the CEO of the company) without being overwhelmed by submissions from external sources.","The carousel user interface  may have or be associated with user interface elements (e.g., buttons, links, and so on) that enable a curator to specify a liking of an item, specify a lack of interest in the item, specify a desire to comment on the item, share the item with another user of the social-networking system, report the item as a job posting, report the item as inappropriate, or reply privately to a submitter of the item. Additionally, the carousel user interface  may include user interface elements that enable an administrator or moderator of the group to delete the item or move the item from the carousel to a separate area of the group (e.g., move a jobs posting from the carousel to a jobs posting area of the group). The carousel may also include a title, such as \u201cWOULD THE GROUP LIKE THIS?\u201d","When a curator engages a user interface element associated with the carousel user interface , thereby performing an action associated with a content item, the carousel engine  may cause the carousel user interface  to interact dynamically with the user in various ways, including ways that encourage further participation of users (e.g., group members) in the group (e.g., encouraging postings of comments related to the item or expressions of liking of an item). For example, when a curator specifies a liking of an item in the carousel user interface  (e.g., when the curator clicks on a \u201cLike\u201d link associated with the item in the carousel user interface ), the carousel engine  may cause the carousel user interface  to indicate a level of interest expressed by other users in the item.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"figref":"FIG. 8A","b":"800"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0062"},"figref":"FIG. 8B","b":["850","850"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0063"},"figref":"FIG. 8B","b":"860"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0064"},"figref":["FIG. 8B","FIG. 17"],"b":["860","860"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0065"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":"900"},"When a user of the social-networking service (e.g., a curator or group member) specifies a desire to comment on a content item (e.g., when the user clicks on a \u201cComment\u201d link associated with the item), the user may be directed to an external site that provides more complete information pertaining to the content item (e.g., when the item is related to or comes from an external source) or to a \u201cdetails\u201d page associated with the content item (e.g., when the content item was provided to the group by a group member via the group sharing module on the group home page). When directing the user to an external source, the carousel engine  may cause the starting of a new instance or open a new tab in a current instance of the user's web browser to display a page at a web site associated the item at the external source. When directing the user to the details page associated with the item, the carousel engine  may not cause the starting of a new instance or open the new tab in the current instance of the user's web browser, instead navigating to the details page from the current instance or tab of the user's web browser.","The details page associated with the content item may display the content item itself, information about a user who submitted the content item (e.g., the user's name, title, company, and so on), and comments posted by other users (e.g., group members) with respect to the content item. The details page may also enable the user who specified a desire to comment on the item to submit a comment or indicate an interest in following email comments made by other users with respect to the content item.","The carousel engine  may support a tagging of items by group members as inappropriate for presentation in the carousel user interface . For example,  depicts an example result of an action by a user to specify that a content item presented in the carousel user interface  is a job posting. In response to the user's action, the carousel engine  may move the content item to a job discussion area associated with the group home page based on a determination that the content item is more appropriate for the job discussion area.","As another example,  depicts an example result of an action by a user to report that a content item is generally inappropriate for the carousel user interface . In response to the user's action, the carousel engine  may classify the content item as spam or prevent the content item from being presented in the carousel user interface  to other users.","When a user tags an item as inappropriate (e.g., when the user clicks on a \u201cReport as Job\u201d or \u201cReport as Inappropriate\u201d link, respectively), the carousel engine  may cause an indication of the success or failure of the reporting (e.g., the carousel engine  may cause a message to be briefly overlaid over the reported-on item, indicating whether the reporting action was successful with respect to the item). Furthermore, when a number of reports of an item being a job or inappropriate transgresses a threshold (e.g., 3 reports), the carousel engine  may automatically delete or move the item. The carousel engine  may restrict actions that may be performed with respect to content items presented in the carousel user interface (e.g., carousel user interface ) based on whether a user performing the action is a group member or administrator of the group. For example, the carousel engine  may prevent users from reporting a content item as a job unless the users are group members.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0072","num":"0071"},"figref":"FIG. 12","b":"1200"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0073","num":"0072"},"figref":"FIG. 13","b":["1300","208","1200","1300","208"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0074","num":"0073"},"figref":"FIG. 14","b":["1400","700","210","208","1400"]},"For example, the presentation of each content item may include a presentation of a one-line headline of the item, a one-line URL associated with the item, an image associated with the item, or a three-line excerpt of text associated with the item. Alternatively, various elements may not be displayed at all or additional elements or portions of elements associated with the item may be displayed (e.g., comments associated with the item or metadata, such as metadata including information on the number of comments associated with the item, when the item was submitted, when the item was published, and so on). The particular elements, the number of lines used to present each element, and other elements, may be configurable by, for example, a group administrator on a group basis or a group member on a group-member basis.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0076","num":"0075"},"figref":"FIG. 15","b":["1500","210","1500","210","1500","210","10","208"]},"The presentation engine  may sort the activities within the \u201cmost popular\u201d user interface element based on various popularity factors, including the number of comments received, the number of expressions of likes, ignores, and passes, or the number of clicks or reads. Thus, after a user makes a submission to the group, the submission may flow into the carousel user interface , which may bring the submission to the attention of other users. The other users may, in turn, perform an action related to the submission that drives up (or down) the popularity of the submission directly (e.g., by commenting on the submission) or indirectly (e.g., by bringing the submission to the attention of a follower, who then comments on the submission). Eventually, the submission may become one of the most popular submissions of the group, and appear in the \u201cmost popular\u201d user interface element , which may, in turn, further drive group participation in activities (e.g. additional comments or submissions) related to the submission.","Like the carousel user interface , the \u201cmost popular\u201d user interface element  may include a title (e.g., \u201cMOST ACTIVE DISCUSSIONS\u201d) and each item presented in the \u201cmost popular\u201d user interface element  may include configurable presentation elements. For example, each item may be associated with one or more images associated with one or more users who provided comments on the content item, and a clicking of one of the images may display a comment provided by the user associated with the image. An excerpt of one or more comments associated with the content item along with metadata about the comment (e.g., elapsed time since a submission or publication of the item) may be included in a display of the content item in the \u201cmost popular\u201d user interface element. The carousel and the \u201cmost popular\u201d user interface element may use the same content item presentation elements or different content item presentation elements (e.g., the carousel user interface  may not display the number of comments associated with an item, whereas the \u201cmost popular\u201d user interface element  may display the number of comments associated with the item). A user may be able to perform the same actions with respect to the \u201cmost popular\u201d user interface element  as the group member can perform with respect to the carousel user interface element  and vice versa.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0079","num":"0078"},"figref":"FIG. 16","b":["1600","210"]},"The group engine  may include an engine (e.g., a de-duplication engine) to minimize the redundancy between content items displayed in the carousel user interface  and the \u201cmost popular\u201d user interface element . The de-duplication engine may ensure that a content item contained in the carousel user interface  does not appear on the first page of the \u201cmost popular\u201d user interface element . However, the de-duplication engine may allow the content item contained in the carousel user interface  to appear on pages other than the first page of the \u201cmost popular\u201d user interface element .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0081","num":"0080"},"figref":"FIG. 17","b":["1700","210","1700","1700","204","1700","204","120"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0082","num":"0081"},"figref":"FIG. 18","b":["1800","210","1800","1800"]},"A social-networking site may also include group home page hubs, which combine various elements of multiple group home pages into a single home page. For example, the various user interface elements (e.g., the carousel, the \u201cmost popular,\u201d and the top influencer user interface elements) of multiple group home pages may be combined into respective user interface elements of a group home page hub. For example, items in a carousel of a first group home page may be combined with items in a carousel of a second group home page into a single carousel of a group home page hub. Thus, a member of a group home page hub may monitor multiple group home pages in a central location, including monitoring the most recent items, the most popular items, the top influencers, and so on, of the multiple associated group home pages.","Engines, Modules, Components and Logic","Certain embodiments are described herein as including logic or a number of components, modules, engines, or mechanisms. Modules or engines may constitute either software modules or engines (e.g., code embodied on a machine-readable medium or in a transmission signal) or hardware modules or engines. A hardware engine is a tangible unit capable of performing certain operations and may be configured or arranged in a certain manner. In example embodiments, one or more computer systems (e.g., a standalone, client or server computer system) or one or more hardware engines of a computer system (e.g., a processor or a group of processors) may be configured by software (e.g., an application or application portion) as a hardware engine that operates to perform certain operations as described herein.","In various embodiments, a hardware engine may be implemented mechanically or electronically. For example, a hardware engine may comprise dedicated circuitry or logic that is permanently configured (e.g., as a special-purpose processor, such as a field programmable gate array (FPGA) or an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC)) to perform certain operations. A hardware engine may also comprise programmable logic or circuitry (e.g., as encompassed within a general-purpose processor or other programmable processor) that is temporarily configured by software to perform certain operations. It will be appreciated that the decision to implement a hardware engine mechanically, in dedicated and permanently configured circuitry, or in temporarily configured circuitry (e.g., configured by software) may be driven by cost and time considerations.","Accordingly, the term \u201chardware engine\u201d should be understood to encompass a tangible entity, be that an entity that is physically constructed, permanently configured (e.g., hardwired) or temporarily configured (e.g., programmed) to operate in a certain manner and\/or to perform certain operations described herein. Considering embodiments in which hardware engines are temporarily configured (e.g., programmed), each of the hardware engines need not be configured or instantiated at any one instance in time. For example, where the hardware engines comprise a general-purpose processor configured using software, the general-purpose processor may be configured as respective different hardware engines at different times. Software may accordingly configure a processor, for example, to constitute a particular hardware engine at one instance of time and to constitute a different hardware engine at a different instance of time.","Hardware engines can provide information to, and receive information from, other hardware engines. Accordingly, the described hardware engines may be regarded as being communicatively coupled. Where multiple of such hardware engines exist contemporaneously, communications may be achieved through signal transmissions (e.g., over appropriate circuits and buses) that connect the hardware engines. In embodiments in which multiple hardware engines are configured or instantiated at different times, communications between such hardware engines may be achieved, for example, through the storage and retrieval of information in memory structures to which the multiple hardware engines have access. For example, one hardware engine may perform an operation and store the output of that operation in a memory device to which it is communicatively coupled. A further hardware engine may then, at a later time, access the memory device to retrieve and process the stored output. Hardware engines may also initiate communications with input or output devices and can operate on a resource (e.g., a collection of information).","The various operations of example methods described herein may be performed, at least partially, by one or more processors that are temporarily configured (e.g., by software) or permanently configured to perform the relevant operations. Whether temporarily or permanently configured, such processors may constitute processor-implemented engines that operate to perform one or more operations or functions. The engines referred to herein may, in some example embodiments, comprise processor-implemented engines.","Similarly, the methods described herein may be at least partially processor-implemented. For example, at least some of the operations of a method may be performed by one or processors or processor-implemented engines. The performance of certain of the operations may be distributed among the one or more processors, not only residing within a single machine, but deployed across a number of machines. In some example embodiments, the processor or processors may be located in a single location (e.g., within a home environment, an office environment or as a server farm), while in other embodiments the processors may be distributed across a number of locations.","The one or more processors may also operate to support performance of the relevant operations in a \u201ccloud computing\u201d environment or as a \u201csoftware as a service\u201d (SaaS). For example, at least some of the operations may be performed by a group of computers (as examples of machines including processors), these operations being accessible via a network (e.g., the Internet) and via one or more appropriate interfaces (e.g., APIs.)","Electronic Apparatus and System","Example embodiments may be implemented in digital electronic circuitry, or in computer hardware, firmware, software, or in combinations of them. Example embodiments may be implemented using a computer program product, e.g., a computer program tangibly embodied in an information carrier, e.g., in a machine-readable medium for execution by, or to control the operation of, data processing apparatus, e.g., a programmable processor, a computer, or multiple computers.","A computer program can be written in any form of programming language, including compiled or interpreted languages, and it can be deployed in any form, including as a stand-alone program or as a engine, subroutine, or other unit suitable for use in a computing environment. A computer program can be deployed to be executed on one computer or on multiple computers at one site or distributed across multiple sites and interconnected by a communication network.","In example embodiments, operations may be performed by one or more programmable processors executing a computer program to perform functions by operating on input data and generating output. Method operations can also be performed by, and apparatus of example embodiments may be implemented as, special purpose logic circuitry (e.g., a FPGA or an ASIC).","The computing system can include clients and servers. A client and server are generally remote from each other and typically interact through a communication network. The relationship of client and server arises by virtue of computer programs running on the respective computers and having a client-server relationship to each other. In embodiments deploying a programmable computing system, it will be appreciated that both hardware and software architectures require consideration. Specifically, it will be appreciated that the choice of whether to implement certain functionality in permanently configured hardware (e.g., an ASIC), in temporarily configured hardware (e.g., a combination of software and a programmable processor), or a combination of permanently and temporarily configured hardware may be a design choice. Below are set out hardware (e.g., machine) and software architectures that may be deployed, in various example embodiments.","Example Machine Architecture and Machine-Readable Medium",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0095","num":"0094"},"figref":"FIG. 19","b":"1900"},"The example computer system  includes a processor  (e.g., a central processing unit (CPU), a graphics processing unit (GPU) or both), a main memory  and a static memory , which communicate with each other via a bus .

The term \u201cmachine-readable medium\u201d shall also be taken to include any tangible medium that is capable of storing, encoding or carrying instructions for execution by the machine and that cause the machine to perform any one or more of the methodologies of the present embodiments, or that is capable of storing, encoding or carrying data structures utilized by or associated with such instructions. The term \u201cmachine-readable medium\u201d shall accordingly be taken to include, but not be limited to, solid-state memories, and optical and magnetic media.

The instructions  may be transmitted using the network interface device  and any one of a number of well-known transfer protocols (e.g., Hyper Text Transfer Protocol or HTTP). Examples of communication networks include a local area network (\u201cLAN\u201d), a wide area network (\u201cWAN\u201d), the Internet, mobile telephone networks, Plain Old Telephone (POTS) networks, and wireless data networks (e.g., WiFi and WiMax networks). The term \u201ctransmission medium\u201d shall be taken to include any intangible medium that is capable of storing, encoding or carrying instructions for execution by the machine, and includes digital or analog communications signals or other intangible media to facilitate communication of such software.","Although an embodiment has been described with reference to specific example embodiments, it will be evident that various modifications and changes may be made to these embodiments without departing from the broader spirit and scope of the invention.
