title: Systems and methods to tune a general-purpose search engine for a search entry point
abstract: The present invention provides systems and methods that employ statistical filtering and ranking techniques to improve content search engine search results by tuning a general-purpose search engine for an entry point for a group of users. The filter can be manually and/or automatically configured via providing training sets of relevant and non-relevant data. For example, a relevant set of data comprising web pages associated with a desired search context for the group utilizing the entry point can be employed. In addition, a non-relevant set of data comprising random and unrelated documents can be employed. The learned filter can then be employed to compare a returned result with the known relevant and the known non-relevant data sets to determine whether the result is relevant to the user for the entry point, and the degree of relevance. The results can then be presented to the user based on the relevance.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["The present invention generally relates to a search engine query, and more particularly to systems and methods that improve content search engine results via tuning a general-purpose search engine for a search entry point.","Periodic incremental improvements in microprocessor based technology such as higher data, address and control transfer rates, larger volume storage devices, minimal power consumption, and reduced package sizes have facilitated the evolution to the electronic, or e-age. For example, recent technological improvements have led to the design and development of low cost, multi-purpose communication devices such as cellular phones that can interface with a computer network, record an image, and playback music, as well as perform conventional telephonic functions. Such a device can provide a user with one device that typically is more compact and less expensive than the devices that it succeeded.","As microprocessor based devices become more robust, economical, and efficient, more consumers are purchasing and employing such devices to replace conventional means of completing daily tasks. For example, conventionally, storage of information such as tax returns, photographs and personal information (e.g., birth certificates and banking transactions) employed non-electronic medium such as paper and\/or variants thereof. In contrast, today a photograph can be digitally recorded and\/or derived from an analog photograph (e.g., via a scanner) to render a virtually permanent, non-degrading image. In another example, conventional learning techniques included attending an instructive session(s), which can be time bounded and expensive, and purchasing paper books, which can be costly. Today, self-sufficient \u201chow to\u201d electronic documents and applications, and e-books are readily available and cost-effective.","The transformation to the e-age has additionally shifted the manner in which consumers obtain and share information. For example, consumers are continually shifting paradigms from conventional techniques employing paper options (e.g., catalogs and letters) and distant resources (e.g., libraries and telephone correspondence) to the essentially boundaryless and globally accessible information available via the Internet. Typically, such information is accessed via a search-engine through a web browser and\/or a web page. For example, a user can deploy a general-purpose search engine and\/or a specialized search engine by entering in a keyword(s) or phrase, and executing the search via a mouse click.","The general-purpose search engine can be an invaluable source to facilitate retrieving information over the Internet. Typically, the general-purpose search engine search attempts to provide an overall \u201cbest\u201d link(s) to a web page(s) for a search query. In order to achieve the overall \u201cbest\u201d search, the general-purpose search engine search exploits the resources available through the Internet to provide the user with general information regarding the search query. In contrast, the specialized search engine typically is limited to a particular knowledge base and is designed for a particular intended subaudience.","A disadvantage of the general-purpose search engine is that the results typically do not provide the \u201cbest\u201d results for a respective query executed by a respective user. For example, if the user queries for the keyword \u201ccell,\u201d the search engine cannot distinguish whether the user desires results associated with a cell phone, a battery cell, a cell of the human body or a cell in a spreadsheet. Instead, results for cell phone, the battery cell, the cell of the human body, the cell in a spreadsheet, and\/or other topics including the term \u201ccell\u201d can be returned, which can provide the user with information unrelated to the desired search. A disadvantage with employing the specialized search engine is that the searchable content generally is selected a priori, and thus the user does not benefit from content outside of the searchable content. In addition, the specialized search engine typically is a rigid approach and cannot easily be adjusted to different user's needs.","The following presents a simplified summary of the invention in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects of the invention. This summary is not an extensive overview of the invention. It is not intended to identify key\/critical elements of the invention or to delineate the scope of the invention. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts of the invention in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.","The present invention provides systems and methods that filter and\/or rank the search results from a general-purpose search engine search in order to exploit the large volume of searchable data available to the general-purpose search engine and mitigate providing the user with unrelated results. Conventionally, the general-purpose search engine searches the information available via the Internet, and provides general results to the user, which can include results unrelated to the context of the search query. The present invention provides a novel approach to tune the general-purpose search engine to an entry point for a group of users to exclude and\/or rank lower information non-relevant to the users' search context.","In general, the filter can be employed in connection with a search executed by a user from a web client (e.g., a computer with access to the Internet). The filter can be configured for the user group associated with the web client by providing a data set associated with a desired search context (e.g., relevant data) and a data set unrelated to the desired search context (e.g., non-relevant data) to the filter. After executing the search query, the filter can be employed to compare a returned result with the known relevant and the known non-relevant data sets to determine whether the result is relevant to the user. In addition, when more that one result is returned or deemed relevant to the user, the results can be sorted (e.g., ranked) to variously display the results to the user based on the relevance, or the similarity between the results and the relevant data.","In one aspect of the present invention, a tuning component can be trained to differentiate between relevant and non-relevant data for respective entry points. The training can include providing the tuning component with sets of relevant data and sets of random, non-relevant data in order for the tuning component to learn the properties associated with relevant data. The tuning component can then be interfaced with a general-purpose search engine. When a user employs a search engine to execute a query, the results can be conveyed to the tuning component, wherein the learned component can separate relevant returned data from non-relevant returned data for the respective entry points, and provide the user with sorted data, based on relevance.","In another aspect of the present invention, a filter component can be automatically trained to differentiate between relevant and non-relevant data for respective entry points. For example, a mechanism (e.g., a storage medium such as a log) can be employed to mirror a user's actions after results are retuned. For example, the sites associated with the links selected by the user can be stored, and then employed as relevant data to train the filter. In addition, a non-selected higher ranked site and\/or a site not selected can be stored and employed as non-relevant data. Then, the sets of relevant data and sets of non-relevant data can be automatically conveyed to the filter component to provide information that can be utilized to train the filter component. Subsequently, when a user executes a query via the search engine, the filter component can mitigate returning non-relevant data. In yet another aspect of the invention, a manual technique can be employed, wherein a user constructs relevant and non-relevant data sets, and manually provides the data sets to the filter component during training.","In still another aspect of the present invention, probability distributions can be generated for relevant data sets, non-relevant data sets, and for a returned result, wherein the probability distribution associated with the returned result can be compared with the relevant and non-relevant data probability distributions to determine whether the returned result is more likely to be relevant or non-relevant data. A ranking mechanism can be employed in connection with returning the results to the user in order to rank results via the degree relevance. Various techniques can be employed in accordance with an aspect of the present invention, for example statistical hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and distributional similarities.","In other aspects of the present invention, methodologies are provided to manually and automatically tune a system to filter non-relevant data returned from an entry point(s), and then rank the filtered data.","To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends, the invention comprises the features hereinafter fully described and particularly pointed out in the claims. The following description and the annexed drawings set forth in detail certain illustrative aspects and implementations of the invention. These are indicative, however, of but a few of the various ways in which the principles of the invention may be employed. Other objects, advantages and novel features of the invention will become apparent from the following detailed description of the invention when considered in conjunction with the drawings.","The present invention relates to systems and methods that tune a general-purpose search engine in order to provide a user with ranked results related to the user's search context. The systems and methods employ a means to filter general-purpose search engine results to separate relevant data (e.g., data related to the search context) from non-relevant data (e.g., data unrelated to the search context) in order to mitigate presenting the user with the unrelated results or to rank unrelated results lower than relevant results. The filter can be manually and\/or automatically be configured via providing training sets of relevant and non-relevant data associated with an entry point to the filter. Additionally, the systems and methods can employ a means to prioritize and rank the filtered results for presentation to the user. Various filtering and\/or ranking techniques (e.g., statistically based) can be utilized in accordance with an aspect of the present invention, as described in detail below.","It is to be appreciated that as utilized herein, the term \u201ccomponent\u201d is intended to refer to a computer-related entity, either hardware, a combination of hardware and software, software, or software in execution. For example, a component can be, but is not limited to being, a process running on a processor, a processor, an object, an executable, a thread of execution, a program, and\/or a computer. As an example, both an application running on a server and the server can be a computer component. One or more components can reside within a process and\/or thread of execution and a component can be localized on one computer and\/or distributed between two or more computers.","The present invention is now described with reference to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It may be evident, however, that the present invention can be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing the present invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","110","120","130"]},"The input component  can interface with the general-purpose search engine (not shown) to receive query results (e.g., one or more links to a document(s) and\/or file(s)) after the user executes a search query via the entry point, or gateway to the general-purpose search engine. Examples of suitable entry points include various web sites, such as: a web site associated with the general-purpose search engine; a user; a corporation; a software application, such as a word processing program; a web page for a specific hobby, sport, age group, etc., a university; a library; and\/or a newspaper. After accepting the results, the input component  can convey the results to the tuning component  for refinement.","The tuning component  can filter the received results, based on a document property(s), a context parameter(s), and\/or a configuration associated with the entry point through which the search engine was accessed. For example, document properties such as a term that appears on a web page, a property of the a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) identifying the web page, a property of URLs and web pages that link to the web page and layout, can be employed to determine what properties of a document, or web page are indicative of the document being relevant to the user executing the search query from the entry point. In another example, the tuning component  can be configured for the entry point to differentiate between a result that is relevant and a result that is non-relevant to the search query context for a group of users. The configuration for the entry point can be based on statistics and can comprise one or more context parameters (e.g., word probabilities and probability distributions).","In one aspect of the present invention, the tuning component  can employ the filter via generating one or more context parameters for a received query result, and then applying the filter context parameter(s) to the generated context parameter(s). If a query result is determined to be relevant to the search query context, then the query result can be provided to the user(s). If a query result is determined not to be relevant, then the query result can be withheld from presentation to the user or provided after higher ranked results, as described below. It is to be appreciated that one or more query results can be deemed relevant, and\/or one or more query results can be deemed non-relevant. In addition, it can be appreciated that all of the results received can be deemed relevant, and therefore all of the result can be provided to the user, or none of the results can be deemed relevant and none of the results provided to the user.","Optionally, the tuning component  can rank the results, based on document property(s), context parameter(s), and\/or configuration. For example, the tuning component  can be employed to determine the degree of relevance of the results, and subsequently rank the results from most relevant to non-relevant, based on a similarity measure and\/or a confidence interval. For example, a technique can be employed to the filtered results in order to display the results to the user in an ascending or descending order, based on the relevance.","The output component  can couple to a user interface such as a web browser (not shown) and provide the filtered and ranked results to the user interface. For example, the output component can interface with the web site, wherein the user executed the search query, and provide the filtered results based on the ranking of the tuning component . The ranked results can be selected by the user to access corresponding documents (e.g., web pages) and\/or files.","The foregoing provides a mechanism to improve general-purpose search engine content search results. As noted above, a conventional general-purpose search engine can return results unrelated to the search context, and customized search engines typically are confined to content selected a priori, such that the user group cannot benefit from content outside of the selected collection. Thus, unlike conventional general-purpose and\/or customized search engines, the present invention provides the benefit of searching the large volume of available information accessible through the Internet, while filtering and ranking the results to provide the user with the most relevant results prior to less relevant and non-relevant results.","It is to be appreciated that more than one entry point can be employed to deploy the general-purpose search engine. In addition, when two or more entry points are employed and associated with similar user group search behavior, the entry points can be clustered together.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","200","210","220"]},"In general, a user logged on to the computer (and network) can deploy a web browser, and access a web site associated with the general-purpose search engine via an entry point. For example, the user can enter an address (e.g., a URL) for the general-purpose search engine's web site into a web browser's address bar and\/or execute a link from within an application (e.g., a hyperlink or other link from within a word processor, a web browser and an email program) to the general-purpose search engine's web site. For example, the user can select the link to the \u201chelp pages\u201d associated with the application from within the application.","After accessing the general-purpose search engine's web site (e.g., an associated home page), the user can provide a query, or search string (e.g., a keyword(s) and phrase) to the general-purpose search engine, and then execute the search query over the searchable data. The results commonly are provided to the general-purpose search engine, and then conveyed to the filtering component . However, it can be appreciated that the results can be provided to the filtering component  without traversing the general-purpose search engine. In addition, information indicative of the entry point can be provided to the filtering component  to identify the entry point such that appropriate configuration, context parameters, and properties for the entry point can be employed.","The filtering component  can then parse the results. For example, the filter component  can be configured to separate non-relevant results (e.g., results not associated with a search context of a group) from relevant results (e.g., results associated with the search context) for the entry point employed. The results and\/or the relevant results can be provided to the ranking component . Optionally, the non-relevant results can be held back. Furthermore, various discriminating techniques can be employed to facilitate separating the results. For example, the filter component  can employ statistics, probabilities, similarities, likelihoods, associations, and correlations to facilitate separating the results.","Prior to providing the results (e.g., links to documents and\/or files) to the user, the ranking component  can rank the results to present the results in a suitable manner to the user, as described in detail below. For example, the ranking component  can sort the filtered results based on degrees of similarity, confidence, and correlation. Subsequently, the filtered and ranked results can be provided to the user.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","300","310","320","300","320"]},"The training component  can accept a set of relevant data (e.g., data associated with a search context for the entry point) and\/or a set of non-relevant data (e.g., random data not associated with the search context for the entry point). For example, a group user can assemble a set of data relevant to the context employed with the entry point and manually provide (e.g., serially and\/or concurrently) the set of data (and optionally information to associate the data with the entry point) to the training component . Likewise, the set of non-relevant data can be provided to the training component . The input component  can then convey the training sets to the filter .","The filter  can employ the training sets to learn the features that differentiate relevant data from non-relevant data. For example, the relevant training set can comprise information associated with an application's domain, and the non-relevant training set can include a collection of random documents from the web that are unrelated to the application's domain. The relevant and non-relevant training data can be employed when a query result from the general-purpose search engine is returned. For example, the query result can be compared to the model sets to determine whether the result is more likely to be associated with relevant data or with non-relevant data, wherein if the result is deemed relevant, then it can be provided to the user. Otherwise, the result can be suppressed or provided after the relevant results. Various techniques can be employed to compare the result with the relevant and non-relevant data sets, as described below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","400","410","420","430","300","400"]},"In one aspect of the present invention, a user can execute a query search via a general-purpose search engine, through an entry point, as described above. The results of the search query can be provided to the user, for example, as a list based on properties associated with the general-purpose search engine. Then, as the user selects a result from the list by clicking (e.g., via a mouse) an associated link, the result can be saved to the log  and identified as relevant to the search context. When a lower-ranked result is selected while selecting a higher-ranked result is note selected the higher-ranked result(s) can be saved to the log  and identified as non-relevant to the search context. A non-selected result, wherein a lower-ranked result is not selected can be deemed and saved as non-relevant or not saved to the log .","The saved results can then be employed to train the filter component  for the entry point, as described above. For example, the saved results identified as relevant can be transmitted to the training component  and subsequently employed by the filter component  as a set of relevant data associated with a search context for the entry point to discern relevant results. The saved results identified as non-relevant can be conveyed to the filter component  via the training component , and employed as a set of non-relevant data to train the filter to discern non-relevant data from a subsequent search query.","In one aspect of the present invention, the saved results can be automatically provided (e.g., serially and\/or concurrently) to the filter component  during training. In another aspect of the present invention, the saved results can be manually provided to the filter component , as described supra. The filter component  can employ the training sets to learn the features that differentiate relevant data from non-relevant data in manner similar to that of the training component .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["210","310","420"]},"Similarly, the automatic technique (e.g., click thru) can provide the filter with a set of documents relevant to a search query and a set of documents non-relevant to the search query. In general, after a user executes a search query via a general-purpose search engine through an entry point, the results of the search query are presented to the user. As the user selects links to documents for viewing, the selected links are automatically stored. In addition, where lower-ranked links are selected and higher ranked links are bypassed, the higher ranked links are automatically stored. After the user concludes selecting links, the stored selected links can be employed as a set relevant to the search query and the stored non-selected, higher-ranked links can be employed as a set non-relevant to the search query. The sets of relevant and non-relevant data can be automatically and\/or manually conveyed to the filter to train (e.g., configure) the filter to learn to discriminate between a relevant and non-relevant query results.","When a query result is received, the filter can be employed to determine whether a query result is relevant or non-relevant and return the result accordingly. For example, a word probability distribution for the results, or documents and\/or sets of documents can be generated, wherein a respective word probability can provide the probability that the respective word appears in a document from the set of documents.","In one aspect of the present invention, a statistical hypothesis can be employed to determine whether a result is relevant or non-relevant. An exemplary test statistic  can be employed, wherein the distributions for the sets of data can be represented as Gaussian, or normal distributions, for example, when the sets of documents include a large number of documents, as define by the central limit theorem. For instance, a first Gaussian distribution  can be generated for the set of relevant documents, and a second Gaussian distribution  can be generated for the set of non-relevant documents. Optionally, a threshold  can be set to facilitate determining whether a word probability is associated with the relevant data distribution  or the non-relevant distribution .","When query result is received, a word probability for the result can be generated and compared with the distributions to determine whether the result is likely to be relevant, or associated with the relevant distribution , as determined by the word probability location with respect to the relevant distribution  and the threshold , if utilized. For example, where the word probability lies between the threshold  and the relevant distribution , the result can be deemed relevant. Otherwise, the result can be deemed non-relevant.","In another example, an exemplary test statistic  can be employed, wherein the distributions  and  can overlap. Likewise, the threshold  can then be defined, and, when a result is received, a word probability can be generated and applied against the threshold  to determine whether the result is likely to be relevant. In one aspect of the invention, the threshold  can be defined as the midpoint between the distributions, wherein a word probability equal to or greater than the threshold  can indicate that the result is likely to be a relevant result. In contrast, a word probability less than the threshold  can indicate that the result is likely to be a non-relevant result. In another aspect of the present invention, the threshold  can be biased to favor the relevant or non-relevant distribution. For example, the threshold  can be biased to mitigate determining a result (e.g., word probability) is non-relevant when the result is relevant (e.g., a type I error). In another example, the threshold  can be biased to mitigate determining a result is relevant when the result is non-relevant (e.g., a type II error).","It is to be appreciated that the foregoing is illustrative and not limitative. For example, other distributions such as a Bernoulli, binomial, Pascal, Poisson, arcsine, beta, Cauchy, chi-square (e.g., with N degrees of freedom), Erlang, uniform, exponential, gamma, Gaussian-univariate, Gaussian-bivariate, Laplace, log-normal, rice, Weibull and Rayleigh distributions can be employed in accordance with an aspect of the present invention. In addition, the means of the distributions can be more or less proximate, with various variances, and the relative position of the distributions can be contrary to the description above. Moreover, a filtering technique utilizing either the relevant distribution  or the non-relevant distribution  can be employed. For example, the threshold  can be employed with the relevant distribution  to determine whether the result is relevant, instead of whether the result is more likely to be associated with the relevant or non-relevant distribution.","It is noted that various other techniques can be employed in accordance with an aspect of the present invention. For instance, machine learning can be utilized to classify a page as relevant or not relevant and\/or to assign a degree of relevance. For example, classification can be based on a plurality features, including word occurrences, distributions, page layout, inlinks, outlinks, and the like.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["610","620"]},"In another aspect of the present invention, a similarity measure can be utilized. For example, similarity measures such as a cosine distance, the Jaccard coefficient, an entropy-based measure, a divergence measure, and\/or a relative separation measure can be employed to generate a similarity measure for the word probability.","The cosine distance, or similarity can be defined via equations 1-2. Equation 1 depicts the cosine of the angle (c(T,T)) between the sets of queries.
