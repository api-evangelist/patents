The dashed lines mark the various regions so as to provide a correspondence from the energy band diagrams to regions , , , , and . The regions and energy bands are not necessarily drawn to scale.","For the part of the energy bands corresponding to infrared absorber region , the absorption of light is pictorially represented by the wavy lines with \u201chv\u201d above them to represent the photon energy, where h is Planck's constant and v is the frequency of the incoming infrared radiation. The absorption of a photon excites an electron from the valence band to the conduction band, which is represented by the vertical arrows pointing from the valence band to the conduction band. The illustrated solid circles near the conduction band represent electrons, and the illustrated hollow circles near the valence band represent holes. An arrow next to an electron or a hole pictorially represents the direction of the electron or hole under a bias voltage applied between contact regions  and , where contact region  is biased positively with respect to contact region .","Electrons are collected at contact region , and holes are collected at contact region . The bias voltage applied to contact regions  and  depends upon the type of material used, and some embodiments may operate at zero bias voltage. For example, with contact region  comprising a p-doped semiconductor and contact region  comprising an n-doped semiconductor, contact region  may be positively biased with respect to contact region  for some embodiments.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["104","106","106","102","102","104","102","102","108","104","110","106"]},"A prior art infrared detector, such as for example an n-\u03c0-p detector, may suffer from generation-recombination (G-R) current due to the Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) process taking place in the space-charge region, where for example in a n-\u03c0-p detector a space-charge region is between the n-doped region and the \u03c0 absorber region. Because wide band gap barriers (regions  and ) in the embodiment of  are adjacent to absorber region , a significant reduction in SHR generated dark current is expected.","The use of wide band gap barriers is expected to help reduce thermally generated minority carriers in the diffusion wings from contributing to the photo current. For example, electron  represents a thermally generated electron, but because of electron barrier region , the probability of electron  tunneling through hole barrier region  to contact region  is very small. Furthermore, photo-generated electrons in absorber region  diffusing in a direction toward contact region  are deflected back by electron barrier region  with very high probability; and photo-generated holes in absorber region  diffusing in a direction toward contact region  are deflected back by hole barrier region  with very high probability.","For some embodiments, contact regions  and  may comprise material so as to have a wider band gap than absorber region , thereby acting as a window to allow longer wavelength radiation to reach absorber region . For some embodiments, contact regions  and  may comprise material so as to have smaller band gaps than hole barrier region  and electron barrier region , so as to facilitate in making ohmic contacts to reduce contact resistance. For some embodiments, both contact regions  and  may be doped as either n-type or p-type. Some embodiments may not include one or both of these contact regions, in which case electrical contact is made directly to one or both of the barrier regions.","For some embodiments, some or all of regions , , and  may be superlattices. For some embodiments, absorber region  may be a superlattice designed for Auger suppression to further reduced dark current. Some or all of these superlattices may be chirped, and some of the regions may be graded by introducing an alloy composition grading. Some embodiments may have band offsets between some of the various regions. For example, one or both of the absorber-barrier interfaces may have staggered band offsets, or the barrier-contact interfaces may have nested band offsets, where the offsets are such that electrons and holes may flow unimpeded by these types of band offsets when contact region  is biased positively with respect to contact region . The doping levels of the barrier regions and absorber region  may be adjusted to control various device properties.","Energy band diagrams, including the Fermi level, for a specific example of an embodiment in which electrical contact is made directly to the hole barrier region are illustrated in . As in , a simplified view of the various regions making up an embodiment are shown with their corresponding energy band levels, but because electrical contact is made directly to hole barrier region , a contact region corresponding to contact region  is not needed.","For the embodiment of , contact region  has a wider band gap than absorber region  and is doped n-type. Electron barrier region  for the embodiment of  is doped p-type. Having an n-type contact region next to electron barrier region  creates a second p-n junction (the first being the one between hole barrier region  and absorber region ) over which an applied voltage bias drop may be developed. This reduces the voltage drop over absorber region , thereby reducing dark current generation in absorber region .","For the embodiment of , absorber region , hole barrier region , and electron barrier region  are superlattice structures. Contact region  for collecting holes comprises InAsSb. These regions are shown in HG.  with their corresponding energy bands, where the y-axis is energy in electron volts (eV), and the x-axis denotes distance in microns, and where the origin of the x-axis is taken at the left hand side of hole barrier region of . Note that the embodiment illustrated in  does not have a contact layer for collecting electrons, but rather an ohmic contact may be made directly to hole barrier region  for collecting electrons. As illustrated in , the layer  could be made of a material such that the conduction band of the layer  overlaps with the valence band of the electron barrier  to facilitate the removal of excess holes from the absorber region .","In the particular embodiment of , absorber region  is a 600 period (44 \u212b, 21 \u212b) InAs\/GaSb superlattice structure. That is, a structure comprising a 44 \u212b thick InAs layer adjacent to a 21 \u212b thick GaSb layer is repeated 600 times along the x-axis. Hole barrier region  is an 80 period (46 \u212b, 12 \u212b) InAs\/AlSb superlattice, and electron barrier region  is a 60 period (22 \u212b, 21 \u212b) InAs\/GaSb superlattice. For the particular embodiment of , hole barrier region  and electron barrier region  are designed to have, respectively, an approximately zero conduction sub-band offset with respect to absorber region  and an approximately zero valence sub-band offset with respect to absorber region . Hole barrier region  is nominally doped at n=1\u00b710cm, absorber region  is nominally doped at p=1\u00b710cm, and electron barrier region  is nominally doped at p=1\u00b710cm. Contact region  is an n=1\u00b710cmdoped InAsSblayer. The particular embodiment illustrated in  was grown on a 50-mm diameter Te-doped GaSb (100) substrate in a molecular beam epitaxial chamber. These parameters are cited merely as an example embodiment.","For some embodiments, contact region  may serve as a bottom contact layer, and hole barrier region  may serve as a top contact layer. For a positive bias applied to hole barrier region  with respect to contact region , the voltage drop is can take place over the junction formed by electron barrier region  and contact region . This junction is away from absorber region , thereby mitigating dark current generation. In general, for a non-negative bias applied to hole barrier region  with respect to contact region , photo generated minority carriers (electrons) in absorber region  diffuse or drift towards hole barrier region  to be collected by a contact applied to hole barrier region . The excess hole population redistributes by dielectric relaxation, and may recombine with electrons injected into absorber region  from contact region .","Various modifications may be made to the disclosed embodiments without departing from the scope of the invention as claimed below."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0005","num":"0004"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0006","num":"0005"},"figref":"FIG. 2"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
