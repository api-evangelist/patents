title: Subscription management system for data communication network
abstract: A network management system allows operators to set up subscriptions to services for network users. The subscriptions each associate a subscriber object and an application object. The subscriber object contains information about the subscriber's network connection. The application object contains information about the application's network connection. The operator does not need to work with low level information such as physical port numbers to create a subscription. The system automatically sets up one or more virtual channel connections as needed to provide the application to the subscriber. The system can be easier to operate accurately than current systems. The system may track and accumulate statistics on a service-by-service basis. The statistics may be used to bill for individual services even if several different virtual channel connections are used to provide each service.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This invention relates to the management of data communication networks. In particular the invention relates to systems and methods for facilitating the creation and maintenance of connections between subscribers and services provided by way of a data communication network.","There is a need for systems which can be used to provide services to users connected to data communication networks. Services may include things such as video-on-demand, audio-on-demand, on-line games and amusements, or Internet access, which are provided by a service provider, to subscribers who are connected to a data communications network.","The currently accepted approach to setting up the network connections needed to provide such services is tedious, requires technically skilled personnel and is susceptible to errors. First, the physical port to which the subscriber is attached to the network must be identified. Next, the service's connection requirements, including bandwidth, must be studied to determine what sort of connection is needed. Appropriate connections from one or more of the service provider's servers to the subscriber's physical port can then be established. The connections must be monitored for billing purposes and billing information must be accumulated and associated with the subscriber.","Existing network management tools such as the MainStreetXpress\u2122 46020\u2122 network manager available from Newbridge Networks Corporation of Kanata, Ontario, Canada provide for the centralized management of network connections but operate at a low level. Such management tools allow an operator to configure network nodes, cards and modules and manage links and paths throughout a network from a single location. The operator must still, however, have reasonably advanced technical knowledge of the network and must manipulate physical port addresses and other similarly low level information to set up a service for a subscriber.","Another problem with existing network management tools is that they track network statistics in a manner which provides the information necessary to make \u201cwholesale\u201d sales of network bandwidth but do not provide sufficient information to conveniently bill on a selective basis for particular services provided over the network. The inability of existing network management systems to collect the information necessary to bill for individual services has provided an obstacle to the deployment of such services by network providers.","This invention provides a management system for a data communication network. The management system allows for the creation of subscriptions which each relate a subscriber to a service. The management system can create communication channels needed to provide the subscription to the subscriber automatically. It is not necessary for a human operator of the management system to provide low level information about the network each time a subscription is created.","In one aspect of the invention, the management system comprises a plurality of application objects each corresponding to an application available on a data communication network and each specifying a network connection point for the corresponding application. The application objects may be stored in a database accessible to the system. The system also comprises a plurality of subscriber objects each corresponding to a subscriber having a connection to the data communication network, each subscriber object specifying a network connection point for the corresponding subscriber. The subscriber objects may also be stored in the database. The system has a user interface which permits a user to create a subscription object associating one of the subscriber objects and one of the application objects. The system includes a network manager which creates in the data communication network a communication channel for each subscription object. The communication channel connects the network connection point for the subscriber of the subscription object and the network connection point for the application of the subscription object. In the case of an ATM network the communication channel is a virtual channel connection (\u201cVCC\u201d). In the case of a frame relay network the communication channel may be a frame relay path (\u201cFRP\u201d).","The operator who creates the subscription object does not need to deal with low level information such as physical port numbers. Thus the invention ameliorates some of the disadvantages of prior art systems which are identified above. The capacity and other quality of service parameters for the virtual channel connection are preferably included in the application object for each application so that the system automatically creates an appropriate communication channel for each subscription.","Preferred embodiments of the system track statistics for each communication channel used in the delivery of a subscribed service to a subscriber. The statistics are associated with subscriptions. The statistics may be used to bill the subscriber for the service even if several different communication channels are used to provide the service. The management system preferably includes a statistics collector. The statistics collector collects statistics regarding those communication channels of the data communication network which correspond to each subscription. The management system comprises means for selecting and aggregating statistics for all of one or more communication channels used in the provision of a service according to a subscription over a selected period.","The invention also provides a method for managing the provision of services to users of a data communications network. The method comprising, in a computer system: storing in a database accessible to the computer system subscriber information identifying a plurality of subscribers and application information identifying one or more applications available to the subscriber; receiving user input identifying one subscriber and one application to be associated as a subscription; retrieving from the database a subscriber network connection point from the subscriber information for the one subscriber and an application network connection point from the application information for the one application; and, creating a virtual channel connection in the data communications network extending between the subscriber network connection point and the application network connection point. The virtual channel connection is created automatically between the correct endpoints without the requirement for an operator to manually specify points of network connection for the user or the application. The method of the invention accordingly provides a simplified procedure for providing services to subscribers on a data communications network. The following specification and claims point out other aspects and benefits of the invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["20","20","20"]},"Network  comprises a number of Asynchronous Transfer Mode (\u201cATM\u201d) switches  connected by communication lines , each capable of carrying digital information. One or more service providers provide servers  connected to network  by way of suitable access devices . A number of users or \u201csubscribers\u201d  are also connected to network  by way of suitable access devices . Access devices  for users  may be, for example, Digital Subscriber Line (\u201cDSL\u201d) modems or wireless access devices.","Servers  can provide one or more services or \u201capplications\u201d to users . For example, a service might be the delivery of an audiovisual work (such as a movie) from server  to a particular user A through network . User A may be termed a subscriber who subscribes to the service provided from server . To enable such a service to be provided it is necessary to configure network  to provide a virtual channel connection (\u201cVCC\u201d) (indicated by dashed line ) from server  to the access device A for subscriber A. In many typical embodiments of the invention, VCC  is a Permanent Virtual Connection (\u201cPVC\u201d).","VCC  must have sufficient bandwidth to provide the desired service. Where the service is delivery of an audiovisual work, VCC  must have sufficient bandwidth to carry the audiovisual work to subscriber A. If a service other than the delivery of an audiovisual work is provided then one or more VCCs each having an appropriate bandwidth and providing an appropriate level of Quality of Service (\u201cQoS\u201d) will need to be set up so that the service can be delivered to subscriber A.","VCC  is created by configuring switches . A network manager , such as the MainStreetXpress\u2122 46020\u2122 network manager, is attached to network . An operator of network manager  could configure switches  to provide VCC . To do this the operator would need to know in advance, or find out, the physical port at which access device A is connected to network  as well as the bandwidth and other QoS requirements for VCC . The operator can enter this information into network manager . Network manager  then sends commands to switches  to cause VCC  to be set up and connected. Looking up and manually entering such information can be tedious and can result in errors which either impair the service or prevent the service from operating at all. The errors may be hard to locate.","This invention provides a network management system  which includes a service subscription manager  which communicates with one or more network managers  through one or more communication links . Communication link  may be provided by network . Service subscription manager  contains one or more databases  which associates each subscriber  as identified by easily ascertainable information, such as name, address, telephone number or the like, with physical information needed to establish a VCC to that subscriber including port number on network .","In the preferred embodiment of the invention, service subscription manager  comprises two databases  and . This provides flexibility in implementation. Database  contains service level information and database  contains technical information regarding the resources of network . Database  may contain, for example, the following information about each subscriber : account name; password; contact information such as telephone number, e-mail address, postal address; personal information; administrative status; a list of services to which the subscriber has subscribed; and an association with technical network access information which is stored in database . Databases  and  are preferably implemented using object oriented database software.","Database  also associates services or \u201capplications\u201d provided by service providers, once again identified by easily ascertainable information such as a trade-mark, logo, provider name, or the like, with information describing the one or more VCCs needed to provide the service to any one of subscribers . Database  may contain, for example, the following information for each application: application provider; name; logo; e-mail contact for trouble reports; e-mail contact for service enquiries; a set of subscribers to the application; and associations to technical information about the class of service used to provide the application, and network access (application delivery point(s)) which are stored in database .","A third database (not shown) is preferably provided to track the rights that various operators of service subscription manager  have. For example, some operators may have rights to modify existing subscriptions but not to create new subscriptions, and so on.","An operator of system  can cause the VCCs necessary to provide a service to a subscriber A to be set up by creating a subscription in service subscription manager . A subscription associates a subscriber A with a service, for example a service provided from server . Particulars of the subscription are then stored in databases  and .","As shown in , service subscription manager  preferably comprises software  running on a suitable network-connected computer . Software  has access to read and write to databases ,  and an interface  to network manager . Service subscription manager  also has a user interface, which is preferably but is not necessarily a graphical user interface (\u201cGUI\u201d) . The interface, for example GUI , may be provided on computer  or on a separate computer connected to computer . When an operator creates a new subscription (which associates a service and a subscriber), software  generates one or more messages which are sent to network manager  via interface . The messages cause network manager  to set up the VCC(s) required by the new service. The messages include information from databases  and  specifying the attributes of the VCC(s) required by the new service.","It is convenient to describe software  using object oriented software engineering terminology. Object oriented software comprises a number of interacting software objects. Each object represents a real or abstract entity. Each object includes data which is encapsulated in the object and software which can manipulate the data and control how the object interacts with other objects.  illustrates relationships between objects of an embodiment of software  in Universal Modelling Language (\u201cUML\u201d).","Using such an object oriented description permits a subscriber  to be represented in software  as a subscriber object . Each subscriber object  contains or is linked to data which includes the name of the subscriber and the physical port through which the subscriber accesses network  (subscriber network access object ). A service, such as the service provided by server  may be represented as a service object . The service object  contains, or is linked to, data which includes the name of the service, the level of QoS required by the service (class of service object ), and the physical port (or ports) through which server  accesses network  (application network access object ).","A subscription object  links a service object  and a subscriber object . The subscription object may contain or link to data, such as statistics on the use of the service which may be used for billing purposes.","The subscription VCC object  links subscription object  to VCC object  which represents the actual VCC  which will be used by the subscription. VCC object  defines a virtual connection between endpoints specified by VCC endpoints object . The VCC endpoints are determined by the network port object  associated with the network access  which is associated with each of the application network access  and the subscriber network access . The application and subscriber network access objects each inherit the attributes of network access object .","A subscription object , together with the service object  and the subscriber object  which it associates, contain all of the information necessary to set up VCC  including the port at which subscriber A connects to network  (from the subscriber network access object ), the port at which server  connects to network  (from the application network access object ), and the bandwidth and any other QoS requirements on VCC  (from the class of service object ). Preferably, various classes of service are predefined. Each class of service specifies QoS parameters such as: service category, peak information rate in each direction, and sustained information rate in each direction. Each application can have its own asymmetrical class of service definition. The various objects used by software  may be stored in databases  and .","Service subscription manager  generates commands which cause network manager  to create VCCs . The commands include the information needed by network manager  to set up VCCs . Network manager  subsequently causes switches  to configure themselves to provide VCCs .","In some cases network manager  will not have control over all of network .  shows a situation where a network has two portions A and B connected at a point of presence POP. Network manager  only has direct control over portion A of the network. A separate network manager B which is not under the direct control of service subscription manager  manages portion B of the network. This situation might exist, for example, where different infrastructure providers maintain portions A and B. If a service provider SP and a subscriber  are both in portion A of the network then network manager  can create the necessary communication channel C directly. On the other had, if the service provider is in a different portion of the network from subscriber  then communication channels must be set up in bother of portions A and B. Service subscription manager  directly commands network manager  to create a communication channel B between subscriber  and point of presence POP. Service subscription manager  also generates a work order message asking that a communication channel A from point of presence POP to service provider SP be created. The work order messages may be sent by calling a remote script from software .","Service subscription manager  preferably includes a facility to enable or disable subscriptions that are set up in service subscription manager  without deleting the subscriptions. This facility might be used, for example, to temporarily suspend a subscription for which a subscriber's payment is overdue. This facility may be provided by including an \u201cenable\u201d attribute in the subscription object . The enable attribute can be set to one state to enable the subscription in question and set to another state to disable the subscription in question. When an operator commands software  to disable a service, software  sets the \u201cenable\u201d attribute for the subscription in question to its disabled state and sends a command to network controller  instructing network controller  to take down the VCCs for the service in question. Preferably, service subscription manager  also permits subscribers to turn on or off subscriptions that have been previously set up.","In order to conserve network resources, VCCs  are preferably connected only when a service is in use. For example, service subscription manager  may cause network manager  to connect the VCCs  for a particular service when a subscriber  who has a valid subscription logs onto network  and is assigned a network access and enables the subscription, or when a subscription is added for a subscriber who already has a network access or when a disabled subscription for a subscriber who already has a network access is enabled. The VCCs may be taken down when a subscriber  who has a valid and enabled subscription logs out from network  (and thereby removes their network access) or when an enabled subscription is cancelled or becomes disabled.","Preferably, service subscription manager causes the VCCs for a subscription to be enabled only when the following conditions all hold:\n\n","Network manager  includes a statistics collector, as is known in the art. The statistics collector may, for example, be the statistics collector function of a Newbridge\u2122 46020 network manager. The statistics collector collects statistics regarding the usage of each VCC provided on network  including the volume of data transferred over the VCC and the length of time that each VCC is connected. The raw information provided by the statistics collector is not directly useful for billing for services because several different VCCs may be used to provide the same service over time.","Service subscription manager  periodically receives statistics from network manager  and collects together the statistics that relate to VCCs used by each subscription. Service subscription manager  does this by identifying the VCCs used by each subscription from the information in databases  and  and by searching the statistics provided by network manager  for statistics on those VCCs. Service subscription manager  then produces concise records which summarize the aggregate usage of network resources by each subscription over a selected period. The records may be used by a billing system to bill subscribers  for usage of network .","Preferably network  is partitioned so that the network access points for subscribers  and the application network access points for server(s)  and all of the PVCs between them are placed into one or more Virtual Switched Networks (\u201cVSNs\u201d).","It is useful to provide subscribers  with a mechanism to select and control their subscriptions. As shown in , The invention provides a Service Selection Agent (\u201cSSA\u201d)  which interfaces with service subscription manager  by way of a suitable Application Programming Interface (\u201cAPI\u201d) . API  is preferably a CORBA based API. SSA  may be maintained and operated by a carrier who may be a different entity than the entity which provides and operates network , network manager  and service subscription manager .","Subscribers  can communicate with SSA  by way of a web based interface indicated by line . Subscribers can use SSA  to dynamically switch between different services. For example, a subscriber  who had subscriptions to both a work-at-home session and a general high-speed Internet access service could use SSA  to dynamically switch between these two services. When a subscriber uses SSA  to enable a service, service subscription manager  commands network manager  to connect the VCC  required by that service. SSA  preferably also permits subscribers to sign up for new subscriptions for themselves.","SSA  obtains information about the services subscribed to by each subscriber through API . Links to each service may be displayed on the web page of SSA .  shows an example web page which could be provided by a suitable server  associated with SSA  to enable a subscriber  to inter alia select between subscribed services, enable or disable subscribed services, or to obtain information about the status of the subscriber's subscriptions. The web page of  would be made available to a subscriber only after the subscriber had entered an account name and a password.","SSA  will typically have a plurality of servers  so that many subscribers can be serviced at the same time. SSA  could, for example, comprise an application running on a Netscape\u2122 Enterprise Server. Servers  may invoke commands on service subscription manager  by way of API  to authenticate the identity of a subscriber  before allowing the subscriber  access to information about subscriptions via SSA . Servers  may obtain information about subscriptions of a subscriber  by causing service subscription manager  to interrogate database  and forward the requested information via API .","One problem that can occur is that one or more of servers  may be over utilized. Subscribers connected to the over utilized servers  will experience slow response times. At the same time, other ones of servers  may be idle or only lightly utilized. Preferred embodiments of the invention provide client-side load balancing to more evenly distribute subscribers among servers .  illustrates apparatus for providing client-side load balancing in the invention.  illustrates a method  of client-side load balancing according to the invention.","As shown in , a user runs user software  to connect to one of service selection servers  of SSA . User software  may be, for example, a JAVA applet running on a subscriber's network connected computer. Software  interrogates a name server  which returns an address for one of service selection servers  as indicated by line  (step ). Software  then connects to the assigned service selection server  as indicated by line  (step ). Name server  is designed to assign service selection servers  to subscribers in such a fashion that a roughly equal number of subscribers are serviced by each service selection server . Suitable hardware and software for implementing name server  is known to those skilled in the art and is available off the shelf from various parties and will therefore not be described herein.","The foregoing scheme does not take into account the fact that some subscribers may place much higher demands on a service selection server  than other subscribers. The invention provides a timer  in user software . A user uses GUI A to enter commands for processing at service selection server , the commands are forwarded to service selection server  by the user's computer under the control of software  (step ). Timer  monitors the time taken by the service selection server , to which the software  is connected, to respond to certain commands (step ). If the response time becomes excessive (i.e. the response time exceeds a threshold time) then user software  sends a request to name server  that it be connected to a different service selection server  (step ). Currently available name servers  support requests from client software to be connected to a different server. The threshold time may be a preset value which is provided in user software  or may be a value which is computed from previous response times experienced by software . Name server  returns the address of a different service selection server  for the user software  to connect to. Name server  may select the different service selection server  randomly from other available service selection servers . User software  then connects to the new service selection server . The result is that the loads on service selection servers  tend to become balanced because user software  which is experiencing unacceptable response times from a service selection server  will switch to a different service selection server .","While the invention has been described above with reference to a network subscription management system, the invention also provides a method  for managing the provision of services to users of a data communications network. The method is performed in a computer system. As shown in , the method begins with storing in database  accessible to computer system  subscriber information identifying a plurality of subscribers and application information identifying one or more applications available to the subscriber (indicated by ). The method continues with receiving user input identifying one subscriber and one application to be associated as a subscription (indicated by ). When the subscription has been made, the method retrieves from database  a subscriber network connection point from the subscriber information for the one subscriber and an application network connection point from the application information for the one application (indicated by ). The method finishes by automatically creating a virtual channel connection (VCC ) in the data communications network . The VCC extends between the subscriber network connection point and the application network connection point.","As will be apparent to those skilled in the art in the light of the foregoing disclosure, many alterations and modifications are possible in the practice of this invention without departing from the spirit or scope thereof. For example, the invention may be used in non-ATM networks. Various specific types of hardware and software may be used in the implementation of the invention. The method for balancing loads on service selection servers , which is described above, may be used to balance loads on other kind of web servers. Accordingly, the scope of the invention is to be construed in accordance with the substance defined by the following claims."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS","p":["In drawings which illustrate non-limiting embodiments of the invention,",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 1A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 6A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 7"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
