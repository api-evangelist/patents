{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The inventions described herein may be manufactured, used and licensed by or for the U.S. Government for U.S. Government purposes.","The invention relates in general to rifle bipods and in particular to adapters for attaching bipods to rifles.","Some bipods, for example, a Harris bipod, may be designed to attach to a sling swivel stud that is fixed to a rifle. Many rifles, however, may not have a swing swivel stud. Some rifles may be equipped with a Picatinny rail. The Picatinny rail is a flattened bar having a major dimension much greater than its minor dimension and having a series of transverse grooves formed across the top of it. It has a cross section in the shape of a wide hexagon. The military standards for Picatinny rails are set forth in Military Standard 1913 entitled \u201cDimensioning of Accessory Mounting Rail for Small Arms Weapons\u201d which is hereby incorporated by reference.","A bipod that is designed to attach to a sling swivel stud of a rifle may be attached to a rifle equipped with a Picatinny rail using a known adapter. However, the known adapter adds weight, cost and complexity to the combination of a bipod and a rifle with a Picatinny rail. In addition, the known adapter may raise the profile of the rifle, which makes the shooter more visible to hostile parties.","A long-felt and unsolved need exists for a lighter, cheaper, less complex, and lower profile apparatus and method for interfacing a bipod and a rifle having a Picatinny rail.","It is an object of the invention to provide an apparatus and method for interfacing a bipod and a rifle having a Picatinny rail.","One aspect of the invention is an adapter for connecting a bipod to a Picatinny rail of a firearm. The adapter may include a base having an upper portion and a lower portion. The upper portion may include a generally planar surface with longitudinal edges. The lower portion may include a cylinder having a through bore. A first support member may be disposed along one of the longitudinal edges of the generally planar surface. The first support member may have an interior surface that defines a female mating configuration of one side of the Picatinny rail.","A second support member may be disposed along an opposite longitudinal edge of the generally planar surface. The second support member may have an interior surface and an exterior surface. A locking bar may be detachably connected to the upper portion of the base. The locking bar may have an interior surface with upper and lower portions. The lower portion of the interior surface of the locking bar may be substantially contiguous with the exterior surface of the second support member. A leaf spring may be fixed to an underside of the upper portion of the base. The upper portion of the interior surface of the locking bar and the interior surface of the second support member may define a female mating configuration of another side of the Picatinny rail.","The leaf spring may include a base portion and two opposing, generally L-shaped portions. The base portion may be fixed to the underside of the upper portion of the base. A rivet may extend through the generally planar surface of the upper portion of the base and the base portion of the leaf spring. Offset from the rivet, a roll pin may be fixed to the upper portion of the base and may extend through the base portion of the leaf spring.","A shaft may extend through the base and the locking bar. A torque nut may threadingly engage the shaft. A torque knob may engage the torque nut. A pair of alignment pins may extend from the base through the locking bar. A fastener may extend through the upper portion of the base and the locking bar.","Another aspect of the invention is an apparatus that may include a bipod having a mounting cylinder with a slot and an adapter for connecting the bipod to a Picatinny rail of a firearm. The mounting cylinder of the bipod may be rotatably disposed in the through bore of the cylinder of the adapter. A second shaft may extend through the mounting cylinder of the bipod. A washer with a slotted opening may be disposed on the second shaft. A pin may extend transversely through one end of the second shaft. The pin may engage the slot of the mounting cylinder. The pin may have a size larger than a size of the slotted opening in the washer. A nut may threadingly engage another end of the second shaft.","A further aspect of the invention is a firearm having a Picatinny rail and a bipod mounted thereon, and an adapter that interfaces between the Picatinny rail and the bipod.","The invention will be better understood, and further objects, features, and advantages thereof will become more apparent from the following description of the preferred embodiments, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 2"],"b":["10","12","14","16","10","16","14","16","12","16","10","16"]},"A commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) bipod may include a sling swivel adapter. The COTS bipod may be, for example, a Harris bipod. Referring to , a sling swivel adapter may be removed from a COTS bipod by loosening nut  and adjust nut  from shaft , removing pin  from shaft , and removing shaft  and washer . Then, the sling swivel adapter (not shown) may slide off of mounting cylinder .","Adapter  may be installed on bipod  by sliding cylinder  having through bore  over mounting cylinder . Cylinder  may be rotatable on mounting cylinder . Washer  having slotted opening  may be placed over mounting cylinder . Pin  may be inserted in shaft  and shaft  may be inserted through washer  and mounting cylinder . Adjust nut  and nut  may be threaded on end  of shaft . Pin  may be larger than slotted opening  in washer  to prevent shaft  from passing completely through slotted opening . Pin  may rest in slot  in mounting cylinder .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIGS. 3 and 4","b":["14","14","40","42","44","42","46","48","50","44","32","34","52","48","46","52","54","56","12"]},"A second support member  may be disposed along opposite longitudinal edge  of generally planar surface . Second support member  may have an interior surface  and an exterior surface . A locking bar  may be detachably connected to second support member . Locking bar  may have an interior surface  with upper and lower portions , . Lower portion  of interior surface  of locking bar  may be substantially contiguous with exterior surface  of second support member  when locking bar  is an the locked position shown in .
