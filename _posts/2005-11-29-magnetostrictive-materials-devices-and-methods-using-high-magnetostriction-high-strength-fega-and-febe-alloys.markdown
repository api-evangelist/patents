Field of the Invention","The present invention relates generally to magnetostrictive alloys, devices and methods and, more specifically, to magnetostrictive materials, devices and methods using rugged magnetostrictive alloys.","2. Description of the Background Art","With the emergence of smart material technology, a need has arisen for rugged, inexpensive, highly magnetostrictive materials that have the ability to transduce large energies under high compressive stresses. Common metals, such as iron, numerous iron-alloys and steels, possess good mechanical properties and the ability to withstand shock environments, but have very low magnetostrictions (\u02dc10to \u02dc10), with many alloys having magnetostrictions near the lower value. Terfenol-D, various high magnetostriction rare earth-Fecompounds, and single crystals of modified cobalt ferrite possess huge magnetostrictions (>10) at room temperature, but are, in general, brittle and unable to withstand appreciable tensile stresses. To fill the gap between these materials, attempts have been made to synthesize magnetostrictive composites using highly magnetostrictive Co ferrite or rare earth-Fewith some type of binder.","Accordingly, it is an object of this invention to provide a highly magnetostrictive material with good physical strength.","It is another object of this invention to provide a shock-resistant, highly magnetostrictive material.","It is a further object of the present invention to provide a highly magnetostrictive material with sufficient strength to be used as a structural member.","These and other objects of the present invention are accomplished by magnetostrictive materials, devices and methods using an Fe-based alloy having of from about 65 at % to about 90 at % Fe, about 5 at % to about 35 at % Ga, and, optionally, one or more additional non-magnetic metals, such as Al and Be, and optionally, one or more additional magnetic metals, such as Co and Ni.","The magnetostrictive alloys used in the magnetostrictive device and method of the presently claimed invention are based upon the body-centered structure and have a room temperature saturation magnetostriction along the [100] axis of at least about 150 ppm, typically about 200 ppm or more, and often about 300 or more. While not intending to be bound by theory, it appears that Ga and some other nonmagnetic metals such as Al substitute for iron in the crystal lattice, distorting the lattice and enhancing the magnetostrictive properties of the material. It appears that the distribution of the added Ga and any other nonmagnetic metal is not completely random, exhibiting some short-range order. Thus, the crystalline structure of the alloys of the present invention may be a hybrid, or perhaps even a multiphase mixture, including the \u03b1-iron phase, the Bphase, the DOphase, and, possibly, the Lphase.","Alloys","FeGa","The Fe-based alloys used in the present invention should include at least about 5 at % Ga in order to assure significant enhancement of magnetostrictive properties. The effects of Ga (or a mixture of Ga and an additional nonmagnetic metal, e.g., Al and\/or Be, and\/or magnetic metal Co and\/or Ni) upon the magnetostrictive performance of the alloys according to the present invention vary closely parabolically depending upon concentration. To achieve maximum magnetostriction, the concentration of Ga should be as high as possible without introducing significant concentrations of secondary phases that lower magnetostriction. The concentration of Ga at which peak magnetostriction occurs varies depending upon how the alloys are formed. When the alloy is formed by furnace cooling a melt of Fe and Ga, a peak magnetostriction occurs at about 15-17 at % Ga. With rapid quenching rather than furnace cooling, the peak magnetostriction moves to about 19 at % Ga. A second magnetostriction peak occurs at about 27 at % Ga for both quenched and slow cooled materials.","FeGaAl","An additional nonmagnetic metal, such as Al, may substitute for some of the Ga in order to reduce cost. An acceptable amount of Al is between 5 and 15 at %.","FeBe","An additional nonmagnetic metal, Be, may increase the magnetostriction of the Fe alloys. R. Gersdorf prepared alloys of FeBe in which the Be concentration was up to 6.8 at %.  shows magnetostrictions of single crystals of Fe, FeAl, FeGa and FeBe in which the atomic percent of the nonmetal, Al, Ga and Be, is between 2.5 at % and 17 at %. Be having an atomic percent of 11.3 and a magnetostriction (3\/2\u03bb\u00d710) of greater than 150 ppm and is most impressive and unexpected.","Impurties","Impurities and additives may also be present in the alloys of the present invention. These impurities and other additional metals may be present as long as they do not significantly lower the magnetostriction of the alloys. Typically, impurities and other additional metals are acceptable in amounts of 2 at % or less, and, more often, in amounts of 1 at % or less.","Devices",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["10","12","14","12","14","14","12","12"]},"Methods","Single Crystal Growth Method","Single crystal iron gallium alloy can be prepared using cleaned 99.99% pure electrolyte iron and gallium. Measured quantities of each metal are melted together several times in an inert, e.g., argon atmosphere. The buttons are re-melted and drop-cast into a Cu chill cast mold in order to obtain compositional homogeneity. The as-cast ingots are degassed in an alumina crucible under vacuum by heating. In an argon atmosphere, the temperature is increased to 1650\u00b0 C. The ingot\/crucible is stabilized for 1 hour at this temperature and then withdrawn at a rate of 2 mm\/hr.-20 mm\/hr. Additionally, oriented single crystals can be prepared through the use of a seed crystal properly oriented to the magnetic easy axis. The seed crystal was carefully packed into the base of the crucible and melting of the charge material was controlled in a manner that preserved the seed crystal. The seed\/ingot\/crucible was stabilized for 1 hour at 1650\u00b0 C. and then withdrawn at a rate of 20 mm\/hr.","Directional Growth Variation of Single Crystal Growth","Several different methods allow one to obtain single crystal-like polycrystalline alloys according to the present invention. For example, directional growth methods (such as the Bridgman method) typically used for single crystal growth may be modified so that crystal growth occurs at rates significantly greater than those typically used for single crystal growth. Such a method typically provides a polycrystalline material with a mixture of [100] crystallites with various orientations, and good magnetostriction.  shows the magnetostriction and magnetic moment of a growth textured rod of FeGa. While this method is generally faster than single crystal growth, it is generally less expensive.","Rolling Method","Preferential alignment of polycrystalline material according to the present invention, which should result in good magnetostrictive properties maybe obtained by using a sequence of hot rolling, warm rolling with intermediate anneals and extended final texture anneal. The above-described methods, single crystal growth, directional growth and hot and warm rolling of producing preferentially [100] aligned FeGa according to the present invention are further described in the EXAMPLES section of this application.","Having described the invention, the following examples are given to illustrate specific applications of the invention including the best mode now known to perform the invention. These specific examples are not intended to limit the scope of the invention described in this application.","Preparation\u2014FeGa, FeAl and FeGaAl","Measured quantities of electrolytic iron (99.99% pure), gallium (99.999% pure), and when used aluminum (99.999% pure) were cleaned and are melted together as FeGa, FeAl or FeGaAl alloys, several times under an argon atmosphere. The resulting buttons of \u02dc40 g were re-melted and the alloy drop-cast into a Cu chill cast mold to obtain compositional homogeneity. Next, the as-cast ingot was inserted into an alumina crucible, heated under vacuum up to 600\u00b0 C. for degassing. The furnace was then backfilled with argon and the temperature increased to 1650\u00b0 C. The ingot\/crucible was stabilized for 1 hour at this temperature and then withdrawn at a rate of 2 mm\/hr.","Following crystal growth, the samples were annealed at 1000\u00b0 C. for 72 hours and furnace cooled. The as-grown crystals were oriented along the [100] direction within 1 degree using back-reflection Laue diffraction and finally cut into thin discs, 3 inch diameter x \u02dc1 inch long rods for magnetostriction, magnetization, and elastic moduli measurements.","Preparation\u2014FeBe","Single crystals of FeBeand FeBewere prepared by Bridgman growth of arc-cast ingots of electrolytic Fe (99.99% pure) and Be (99.9% pure) in alumina crucibles. The ingots were stabilized in the crucible for 1 hr at 1600\u00b0 C. and lowered at a rate of 4 mm\/hr. Following growth, the ingots were heat treated at 1000\u00b0 C. for 168 hr and cooled at a rate of 10\u00b0 C.\/hr. Although the equilibrium condition of these alloys below \u02dc700\u00b0 C. contains the hexagonal FeBeLaves phase, this phase was not present in the x-ray diffraction patterns following heat treatment. While the diffraction patterns confirmed the b.c.c. structures, the local ordering of Be and Fe on the b.c.c. lattice is not known. (100) and (110) oriented single crystal disks (\u22120.3 cm\u00d70.6 cm dia) were cut from the boule by EDM machining for magnetostriction and magnetization measurements.","Magnetostriction Measurements of \u03bband \u03bbwere Obtained from 77 K to Room Temperature Using Non-Magnetoresistive Kyowa KFL-1-120-C1-11 Strain Gages.","Measurements of resistivity were made using an HP3470A in a four-wire mode. Temperature dependences of the magnetizations were obtained by using a Magnetic Instruments 7385 flux meter to measure flux changes with \u02dc20 turn #36 gage wire coils wrapped around the alloys. Magnetostrictions were taken at a field of 15 kOe.","Magnetostriction results in FeBe alloys with Be concentrations up to 6.8% described in R. Gersdorf, Ph.D. Thesis, University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands, 1961, revealed the possibility of magnetostriction constant \u03bbabout 99 for Fe\u2014Be alloys.  compares Be concentration dependences up to 17%. Both Fe\u2014Be and Fe\u2014Ga alloys have comparable increases up to \u02dc11% solute. This is somewhat surprising since Be is a smaller atom than Fe, while Ga atoms are larger than Fe.","Magnetostriction and Magnetization of Fe\u2014Ga and Fe\u2014Ga\u2014Al Single Crystals Under Compressive Stress","A conventional dead-weight apparatus was used to apply compressive loads to the samples indicated in , i.e., FeGa, FeAl and FeGaAl in rod form. Magnetic fields up to 1 kOe were applied to the samples from a solenoid energized by a constant current source. The magnetizations were calculated from the emf generated by a small pick-up coil surrounding the center of the sample. Displacements were determined from the output of three linear variable differential transformers (LVDT's) and two or more strain gages. Typical room temperature magnetostriction and magnetization data under compressive loads are shown in , , and .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"i":["a ","b"],"sub":["87","13 ","85","15","100-x","x "]},"Table I illustrates how the average values of piezomagnetic constant (d) and permeability (\u03bc) for FeGadepend upon compressive stress.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0039"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE I"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"PIEZOMAGNETIC dCONSTANT AND PERMEABILITY OF "},{"entry":"FEGAUNDER COMPRESSIVE STRESS AT ROOM "},{"entry":"TEMPERATURE"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"77pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"70pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"70pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["\u03c3 (MPa)","d(nm\/A)","\u03bc"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"77pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"70pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"70pt","align":"char","char":"."}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["16.0","58","285"]},{"entry":["27.5","34","174"]},{"entry":["39.0","29","133"]},{"entry":["50.5","22","108"]},{"entry":["62.0","20","91"]},{"entry":["73.5","18","78"]},{"entry":["85.0","16","70"]},{"entry":["96.5","15","61"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0040"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIGS. 4","FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"i":["a ","a ","b ","a ","b"],"sub":["79","21 ","87","13 ","100-x","x "],"b":"4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0041"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 4"],"i":["a ","a"],"sub":["87","4","9 "]},"Temperature Dependence of the Saturation Magnetostriction Constants from 180\u00b0 K to Room Temperature","Thin (100) discs of the single crystal samples were cut from larger crystals and mounted in a cryostat for measurements of the saturation magnetostriction constants below room temperature.
