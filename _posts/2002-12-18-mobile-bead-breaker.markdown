{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The U.S. Government has a paid-up license in this invention and the right in limited circumstances to require the patent owner to license others on reasonable terms as provided for by the terms of U.S. Government Contract No. F33657-96-D-2009 awarded by the United States Air Force.","1. Field of the Invention","This invention generally relates to tire changing equipment. In particular, the present invention relates to a mobile bead-breaking machine for separating a tire from its rim. More particularly, the present invention also relates to a mobile bead-breaking machine for separating an aircraft tire from its rim or wheel.","2. Background of the Invention","Tubeless pneumatic tires are mounted on wheels with rims that maintain an airtight seal between the tire and the rim. Bead breakers of various designs are used to break this airtight seal in order to remove or repair the tire. In order to de-mount a tire it must be separated from the tire rim at the seal, known as the bead, on the periphery of the tire and rim before the tire is forced away from the rim. Breaking the tire bead seal from the rim is a difficult task. Typically, the equipment operator is handling a heavy and unwieldy rim and tire.","Various devices have been conceived to break the bead of tires. In most cases, the devices are either large, stationary constructions or small hand held tools. There also exist specialized bead breakers for use with tires from particular modes of transportation. For instance, aircraft tires, which come in a variety of sizes, generally require specialized bead breakers. Military aircraft, particularly fighter aircraft, are frequently deployed to remote sites and there exists a need for a lightweight, easily transportable bead breaker that can operate under field conditions and service a number of different sizes and types of aircraft tires.","It is precisely because one of these devices does not exist that aircraft mechanics often resort to the use of the smaller, easier to handle hand tools that often damage or even destroy the tire in the mechanic's efforts to remove it from its rim. For example, mechanics often utilize a screwdriver and a hammer or even a crowbar in an attempt to break the tire bead. Use of such tools while likely posing the threat of damage to either the tire and\/or the rim also poses dangers to the mechanics.","It is, therefore, desirable to provide a lightweight, easily transportable bead breaking apparatus capable of quickly, effectively and accurately acting upon a tire\/rim assembly. Such apparatus should be able to break the bead of a tire without further damage to either the tire or its rim and should be capable of operating under field conditions and servicing a number of different sizes and types of aircraft tires.","The present invention recognizes and addresses various of the foregoing limitations and drawbacks, and others, concerning a mobile bead breaking machine for separating an aircraft tire from its rim or wheel. Therefore, the present invention is directed to such a device.","It is a principle object of the subject invention to provide a bead breaking apparatus. More particularly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a lightweight and easily transportable bead breaking apparatus. In such context, it is still a more particular object of the present invention to provide such a device specifically designed to handle bead breaking for aircraft tires, in particular fighter aircraft tires.","Still further, it is a principle object of this invention to provide a bead breaking apparatus capable of acting upon a number of different sizes and types of aircraft tires. It is a further object of the present invention to provide a bead breaking apparatus suitable for field deployment without unnecessary support equipment or calibration. In such context, it is an object of the present invention to provide a pneumatic tire bead breaker.","Additional objects and advantages of the invention are set forth in, or will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art, from the detailed description as follows. Also, it should be further appreciated that modifications and variations to the specifically illustrated and discussed features and materials hereof may be practiced in various embodiments and uses of this invention without departing from the spirit and scope thereof, by virtue of present reference thereto. Such variations may include, but are not limited to, substitutions of the equivalent means, features, and materials for those shown or discussed, and the functional or positional reversal of various parts, features, or the like.","Still further, it is to be understood that different embodiments, as well as different presently preferred embodiments, of this invention, may include various combinations or configurations of presently disclosed features, elements, or their equivalents (including combinations of features or configurations thereof not expressly shown in the figures or stated in the detailed description).","These and other features, aspects and advantages of the present invention will become better understood with reference to the following descriptions and appended claims. The accompanying drawings, which are incorporated in and constitute a part of this specification, illustrate an embodiment of the invention and, together with the descriptions, serve to explain the principles of the invention.","In one exemplary embodiment, there may be provided a mobile pneumatic aircraft tire bead breaker. Such bead breaking apparatus may be adjustable to service a wide range of tire sizes. Additionally, it may be self-contained and relatively lightweight with a compact form factor making it particularly suitable for deployment to remote sites. Further, it may primarily comprise simple components that are easily replaceable or repairable thus ensuring its ease of maintenance and reliability.","The bead breaking apparatus may be generally comprised of a pair of conjoined box-like housings resting on a wheeled base. The first box-like housing may harbor the driving mechanisms of the present invention, including a pump, hydraulic ram, tubing and the controls for the apparatus. The second box-like housing may contain a spider assembly, that portion of the apparatus that engages the tire to effect its removal from the rim.","Within the second housing may be located a positioning rod for engagement with a tire and rim assembly requiring repair. Such positioning rod could serve to properly align such a tire and rim assembly with the spider assembly. Still further, it may maintain the assembly vertical against a support wall. The spider assembly, a plurality of legs equally spaced about a central hub, each leg further comprising an engagement member, may be located within the second housing as well.","Such spider assembly may lie generally in plane parallel to such support wall. A hydraulic ram, operating in a plane generally perpendicular to the plane of the spider assembly, may be used to force the spider assembly toward the tire and rim assembly. The spider assembly may engage the tire and rim assembly with its engagement members at a point slightly outside the rim (i.e., at the bead of the tire). The hydraulic force behind the spider assembly may operate to break the airtight seal between the tire and rim to effectively release the tire therefrom. The tire may then be reversed so as to break the tire's bead on the opposing side thereof.","Repeat use of reference characters throughout the present specification and appended drawings is intended to represent the same or analogous features or elements of the invention.","Reference will now be made in detail to present the preferred embodiments of the invention, examples of which are fully represented in the accompanying drawings. Such examples are provided by way of an explanation of the invention, not limitation thereof. In fact, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in the present invention, without departing from the spirit and scope thereof. For instance, features illustrated or described as part of one embodiment can be used on another embodiment to yield a still further embodiment. Still further, variations in selection of materials and\/or characteristics may be practiced, to satisfy particular desired user criteria. Thus, it is intended that the present invention cover such modifications and variations as come within the scope of the present features and their equivalents.","As disclosed above, the present invention is particularly concerned with a mobile bead-breaking machine  for separating an aircraft tire from its rim or wheel. As seen in the various views of , the present invention comprises a pair of conjoined box-like housings  and  atop a wheeled base .","The base  may be provided with a ramp  for use with larger tires to aid in getting them into the apparatus . The ramp  is hinged to an outer edge of the base  but may be stowed entirely within the footprint of the base  during storage or transport of the apparatus . To enhance the portability of the apparatus , the base  has been supplied with channels  for the receipt of the forks on a forklift. Such channels generally run fore to aft on the apparatus to allow for the forklift operator to ensure the device has been properly secured for transport. To enhance the structural stability of the apparatus , a stiffener  may be added between the channels . Finally, the base  may be provided with free rotation casters . The casters  may further be provided with locking means  to hold the apparatus  in place during operation.","The first housing  harbors all of the driving mechanisms and controls for the apparatus . Compressed air from an outside source (not shown) is used to generate hydraulic pressure. The pressure is used to drive a hydraulic ram  including a piston . The hydraulic ram  and thus the piston  may be vertically aligned by way of its connection to a sliding plate , which rides on a threaded rod . A piano screw or the like may be used for the threaded rod . The sliding plate  may serve as the divider between the housings  and . The hydraulic ram  and piston  pass through the sliding plate  by way of an opening  therein.","The second housing  may include the extended piston  of the hydraulic ram . At the end of the piston  is a spider assembly . A positioning rod  for vertical positioning of smaller tire and rim assemblies may also be included therein. Such a positioning rod  would be located in the supporting wall  and would act to secure the tire and rim assembly in position during the bead breaking process. Due to the limited vertical range of motion of the spider assembly , the use of such a positioning rod  is required to enable the apparatus  to properly align with the tire\/rim assembly. Such positioning rod  further enhances the range of tire sizes serviced by the present invention.","As can be seen in  and particularly in , the spider assembly  comprises a plurality of legs  extending outwardly from a central hub  connected to the hydraulic piston . At various predetermined locations along the length of each leg are holes . These holes are for receiving positioning engagement members  (as seen ) located on each leg .","As can best be seen in , the engagement members  may be moved along the legs  to any of the predetermined positions to accommodate a wide variety of tire and rim sizes. Each engagement member  is provided with a securement means for maintaining the member  in place during the operation of the apparatus . Any known securement means sufficient to withstand the forces acting on the engagement members  during the bead breaking process will suffice. For example, such securement means may include, but are not limited to, a ball-lock for engagement with the holes , a securing pin for passage through said holes , a nut and bolt configuration or any combination thereof.","The spider assembly  is removeably attached to the hydraulic piston  via its central hub . As seen in , in a preferred embodiment the central hub  is hexagonally shaped. As such, permanent affixation of the legs  both to the hub and at a desirable angle may be achieved. The central hub  may be threaded for attachment to the piston . It should be noted that while in the preferred embodiment of the present invention the spider assembly  has six legs  and a hexagonal central hub, any number of legs  and any shape of central hub may be included in such assembly .","In use, the present invention provides for a tire and rim assembly to be placed within the second housing  against the supporting wall  in a vertical orientation. For smaller tires and landing gear assemblies, such as nose gear assemblies, a positioning rod  may be used to properly orient the tire vertically. The horizontal positioning of the tire\/rim assembly is a responsibility of the apparatus operator. Such horizontal alignment is generally done by eye. Prior to the positioning of the tire, the spider assembly  is adjusted to properly accord with the type of aircraft tire that is undergoing work. While the present invention is specifically designed to handle landing gear assemblies from the U.S. F-16 and F-22 fighter aircraft, simple modifications may be made to accommodate tires from almost any aircraft.","In setting the spider assembly  the engagement members  are adjusted to contact the tire just beyond the outer edge of the rim. The hydraulic ram  is used to drive the piston  and spider assembly  into the tire bead and break the rim\/bead seal. The tire is then reversed and the process is repeated on the tire's opposing side.","Although a preferred embodiment of the invention has been described using specific terms and devices, such description is for illustrative purposes only. The words used are words of description rather than of limitation. It is to be understood that changes and variations may be made by those of ordinary skill in the art without departing from the spirit or the scope of the present invention, which is set forth in the following claims. In addition, it should be understood that aspects of various other embodiments may be interchanged both in whole or in part. Therefore, the spirit and scope of the appended claims should not be limited to the description of the preferred version contained herein."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["A full and enabling disclosure of the present invention, including the best mode thereof, directed to one of ordinary skill in the art, is set forth in the specification, which makes reference to the appended figures, in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 6"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 8"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
