{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This invention relates generally to processing within a computing environment, and more particularly to geo-positionally based data access security systems.","Controlling access to protected resources is of paramount importance in many computing environments. Inadvertent or unauthorized access to a protected resource can corrupt the resource and have other detrimental effects on the computing environment. In general, access is controlled by limiting for a given resource those processes authorized to access the resource. Data access security is a means of ensuring that data is kept safe from corruption and that access to it is suitably controlled. In contemporary computer systems, access to certain defined information is controlled by software security systems. These systems may use encryption, or access polices to protect access to files. In some cases, government agencies or corporate entities issue directives that certain classes of information be located in a specific geographic location. These organizations may have mandated audit controls to prove compliance with the geographic location requirement.","An exemplary embodiment is a method for implementing geo-positionally based data access security. The method includes receiving a request at a computer to verify a geographic location of a segment of data stored in a storage device. The method further includes receiving, at the computer, an actual geographic location of the storage device from a geographic location device connected to the storage device. The method additionally includes accessing, at the computer, a location tag including an expected geographic location of the segment of data, and comparing, at the computer, the expected geographic location to the actual geographic location. The method also includes returning a value indicating that an error has occurred when the comparing indicates that the expected geographic location does not match the actual geographic location.","Another exemplary embodiment is a system for implementing geo-positionally based data access security. The system includes a computer and a geo-positionally based data access security system executable by the computer, the system capable of performing a method. The method includes receiving a request at a computer to verify a geographic location of a segment of data stored in a storage device. The method further includes receiving, at the computer, an actual geographic location of the storage device from a geographic location device connected to the storage device. The method additionally includes accessing, at the computer, a location tag including an expected geographic location of the segment of data, and comparing, at the computer, the expected geographic location to the actual geographic location. The method also includes returning a value indicating that an error has occurred when the comparing indicates that the expected geographic location does not match the actual geographic location.","A further exemplary embodiment is a computer program product for implementing geo-positionally based data access security. The computer program product includes a tangible storage medium for storing instructions. The tangible storage medium readable by a processing circuit, the processing circuit performing a method. The method includes receiving a request at a computer to verify a geographic location of a segment of data stored in a storage device. The method further includes receiving, at the computer, an actual geographic location of the storage device from a geographic location device connected to the storage device. The method additionally includes accessing, at the computer, a location tag including an expected geographic location of the segment of data, and comparing, at the computer, the expected geographic location to the actual geographic location. The method also includes returning a value indicating that an error has occurred when the comparing indicates that the expected geographic location does not match the actual geographic location.","Other systems, methods, apparatuses, and\/or design structures according to embodiments will be or become apparent to one with skill in the art upon review of the following drawings and detailed description. It is intended that all such additional systems, methods, apparatuses, and\/or design structures be included within this description, be within the scope of the present invention, and be protected by the accompanying claims.","An exemplary embodiment of the present invention provides for geo-positionally based data access security.","Some governmental agencies and corporate entities require protection of data beyond mere encryption. For example, some government agencies may mandate that data be located in a particular geographic location. Current technologies allow for automated encryption of data, however current mechanisms for ensuring data is located in a specific location may require manual audits which can be time consuming, expensive, and do not allow for real time instantaneous verification of the location of the data.","Exemplary embodiments of the geo-positionally based data access security system described herein are directed to storing information that is secured both by encryption and through confirmation of the data's geographic location. The system compares the location of the data with coordinates that are stored with the data to ensure that the data is properly located geographically before allowing access to the data. In this way, the data is ensured to be accessible only when it is in the area in which it is required to be located. An automated mechanism for providing periodic instantaneous audits of the data's current location is also provided.","Turning now to , a system  for implementing geo-positionally based data access security will now be described. In an exemplary embodiment, the system  includes a host system  executing computer instructions for geo-positionally based data access security. The host system  may operate in any type of environment that is capable of executing a software application. The host system  may comprise a high-speed computer processing device, such as a mainframe computer, to manage the volume of operations governed by an entity for which the geo-positionally based data access security is executing. In an exemplary embodiment, the host system  is part of an enterprise (e.g., a commercial business) that implements the geo-positionally based data access security.","In an exemplary embodiment, the system  depicted in  includes one or more client systems  through which users at one or more geographic locations may contact the host system . The host system  contains a defined location data (DLD) interface . The DLD interface  is used in conjunction with the other components of the storage device to access the data stored on a storage device  as will be discussed more fully below. In alternative embodiments, the DLD interface  is located on the storage device  or on one of the client systems . The client systems  are coupled to the host system  via one or more networks . Each client system  may be implemented using a general-purpose computer executing a computer program for carrying out the processes described herein. The client systems  may be personal computers (e.g., a lap top, a personal digital assistant, a mobile device) or host attached terminals. If the client systems  are personal computers, the processing described herein may be shared by a client system  and the host system  (e.g., by providing an applet to the client system ). Client systems  may be operated by authorized users (e.g., system administrators, auditors) of the geo-positionally based data access security described herein.","The networks  may be any type of known network including, but not limited to, a wide area network (WAN), a local area network (LAN), a global network (e.g., Internet), a virtual private network (VPN), and an intranet. The networks  may be implemented using a wireless network or any kind of physical network implementation known in the art. A client system  may be coupled to the host system  through multiple networks (e.g., intranet and Internet) so that not all client systems  are coupled to the host system  through the same network. One or more of the client systems  and the host system  may be connected to the networks  in a wireless fashion. In one embodiment, the networks include an intranet and one or more client systems  execute a user interface application (e.g., a web browser) to contact the host system  through the networks . In another exemplary embodiment, the client system  is connected directly (i.e., not through the networks ) to the host system  and the host system  contains memory for storing data in support of geo-positionally based data access security. Alternatively, a separate storage device (e.g., storage device ) may be implemented for this purpose.","The geo-positionally based data access security storage device  includes a data repository with data relating to geo-positionally based data access security by the system , as well as other data\/information desired by the entity representing the host system  of . The storage device  is logically addressable as a consolidated data source across a distributed environment that includes networks . The storage device  can be configured as a storage area network (SAN) or any other data access and storage device. Information stored in the storage device  may be retrieved and manipulated via the host system  and\/or the client systems . The term \u201cSAN\u201d is used herein as an example of a storage device  that may be implemented by an exemplary embodiment. The storage device  stores one or more databases containing, e.g., geo-positionally based data access security and corresponding configuration parameters, values, methods, and properties, as well as other related information. It will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art that the storage device  may also comprise other structures, such as an XML file on the file system or distributed over a network (e.g., one of networks ), or from a data stream from another server located on a network. In addition, the storage device  may alternatively be located on a client system .","As depicted in , the storage device  contains a geographic location device, shown in  as a global positioning system receiver (GPSR)  positioned in an anti-tamper mounting. Other geographic location devices that may implemented by exemplary embodiments include, but are not limited to the Chinese Compass navigation system, the Russion Federation's GLONASS and European Union's GALILEO global positioning satellite navigation systems. In an exemplary embodiment, the GPSR  is physically connected to the storage device  as a GPSR card. In an alternate exemplary embodiment the GPSR  is connected to the storage device  internally, that is the GPSR  is incorporated in the storage device hardware directly. In an exemplary embodiment, the GPSR  is integrated into the hard disk, or other data storage drive or device circuitry of the storage device  directly. The GPSR  is used to detect the physical location of the storage device  as will be described more fully below. It will be understood by those skilled in the art that the GPSR  can be used in conjunction with an internal or external antenna or other signal booster to increase the detection strength of the GPSR .","In addition, the storage device  depicted in  contains an encryption certificate . The certificate  is used for authentication and encryption. In an exemplary embodiment, the certificate  is an X.509 compliant certificate that contains additional extended attributes such as the unique serial number of the GPSR  as will be described in more detail below. The storage device  also contains data that is to be protected. This data is referred to referred to herein as defined location data (DLD)  and stored as a plurality of segments of data. The DLD  is encrypted and stored on the storage device . The DLD  can be any type of data including, but not limited to: all or a portion of a text file, a multimedia file, a database, and a database table. In alternate embodiments the DLD  is a combination of all of these types of data, and\/or refers to the contents of an entire disk volume. Associated with the DLD  is a specific location position (SLP) tag  (also referred to herein as a location tag\u201d). The SLP tag  contains information relevant to the required geographic location of the data as will be described more fully below.","The host system  depicted in the system of  may be implemented using one or more servers operating in response to a computer program stored in a storage medium accessible by the server. The host system  may operate as a network server (e.g., a web server) to communicate with the client systems . The host system  handles sending and receiving information to and from the client systems  and can perform associated tasks. The host system  may also include a firewall to prevent unauthorized access to the host system  and enforce any limitations on authorized access. For instance, an administrator may have access to the entire system and have authority to modify portions of the system. A firewall may be implemented using conventional hardware and\/or software as is known in the art.","The host system  may also operate as an application server. The host system  executes one or more computer programs to provide geo-positionally based data access security.","As indicated above, processing may be shared by the client systems  and the host system  by providing an application (e.g., java applet) to the client systems . Alternatively, the client system  can include a stand-alone software application for performing a portion of the processing described herein. As previously described, it is understood that separate servers may be utilized to implement the network server functions and the application server functions. Alternatively, the network server, the firewall, and the application server may be implemented by a single server executing computer programs to perform the requisite functions.","It will be understood that the geo-positionally based data access security system described in  may be implemented in hardware, software, or a combination thereof.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["100","110","102","202","110","204","116","116","216"]},"Otherwise, if the data is determined to be DLD data  at block , then block  is performed and the DLD interface  forwards the request to the storage device . The storage device receives the request and the data segment along with instructions indicating the geographic location where the data must be stored based on the certificate  and the GPSR  connected to the storage device . The geographic location can be, for example, global positioning satellite (GPS) coordinates or the location's longitude and latitude, or any other indication of the geographic location known in the art. In an alternative embodiment, the GPS coordinates (an example of a geographic location) are also sent to the storage device  within the request itself.","At block , the storage device  uses the GPS coordinates to create an SLP tag . In an exemplary embodiment, the SLP tag  is a data element that includes the unique serial number of the GPSR , the latitude of the DLD , the longitude of the DLD , the height above sea level of the DLD , and the area value of the DLD . The area value is a set of adjustment factors to the latitude, longitude, and height, which is used to create an area that would cover the area deemed to be the \u201cspecific geographic location.\u201d These adjustment factors allow a plus or minus of the longitude, latitude, and altitude that can be used to specify the bounding area in which the storage device  will be contained in. In an alternative embodiment, more than one adjustment factor is associated to each of the longitude, latitude, and altitude requirements of the DLD  to allow for higher fidelity of adjustment.","At block  in , the SLP tag  is associated with the segment of data (i.e., the DLD ). In an exemplary embodiment, the SLP tag  is associated to the DLD  by embedding it within the DLD , attaching it directly to the front or back of the DLD , or by placing it in a specified location apart from the DLD . At block , the data, and optionally the SLP tag, are encrypted. The encryption can be any form of encryption known in the art. In an exemplary embodiment, the data segment is encrypted using the encryption certificate . Once all of the data has been encrypted, the encrypted data is stored on the storage device  at block .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["100","110","102","302","110","304","110","306","114","114","308","110","306","108","112","118","116","310"]},"At block , the DLD interface  requests the current GPS coordinates from the GPSR . At step , the DLD interface  compares the values of the SLP tag  to the current GPS coordinates of the storage device  and verifies that the storage device  is in the geographic area that is specified in the SLP tag . In exemplary embodiments the DLD interface  verifies the coordinates by comparing the longitude, latitude, and altitude of the SAN to the longitude, latitude, and altitude of the SLP tag  plus or minus the adjustment factors, which may also be contained in the SLP tag . It will be understood that other mechanisms for comparing the geographic location data may also be used.","If the DLD interface  determines that the storage device  is in the geographic location specified in the SLP tag , at block  the DLD interface  decrypts and returns the DLD . In alternative embodiments the DLD  is returned in its encrypted form for decryption at a later time. If at block , the DLD interface  determines that storage device  is not in the location specified in the SLP tag , the DLD interface  may return an error message to the requestor. In alternative embodiments, the DLD interface  exits silently without returning an error.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["100","110","102","402","404","110","406","110","114","114","408","110","114","406","108","112","110","118","116","410","412","110","108","414","110","118","112","112","118","416","110","414"]},"Although the DLD interface  has been described as using the host system  for the processing, it will be understood that all or a portion of the processing could be completed on the client system  or the storage device , or any combination of thereof.
