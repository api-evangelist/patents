title: Providing access to remote networks via external endpoints
abstract: Systems and methods for providing access to a remote network via an external endpoint are provided. A client establishes a secure connection between an external endpoint and a remote network. Transmissions from clients to the external endpoint are supplemented with additional information regarding handling within the remote network, and then transmitted to an internal endpoint within the remote network. The internal endpoint processes the transmission based on the supplemental information and returns a response to the external endpoint. A response is then returned to the client. Access policies may be created by authorized users to establish processing of client transmissions. These policies may be stored and enforced by the internal endpoint or the external endpoint.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Generally described, computing devices utilize a communication network, or a series of communication networks, to exchange data. Companies and organizations operate computer networks that interconnect a number of computing devices to support operations or provide services to third parties. The computing systems can be located in a single geographic location or located in multiple, distinct geographic locations (e.g., interconnected via private or public communication networks). Specifically, data centers or data processing centers, herein generally referred to as a \u201cdata center,\u201d may include a number of interconnected computing systems to provide computing resources to users of the data center.","Data centers may be private data centers operated on behalf of an organization or public data centers operated on behalf, or for the benefit of, the general public. Additionally, some data centers or computing resources within data centers may operate with mixed private and public functionality. For example, a resource within a data center may allow limit public access to the resource, while allowing full access only to entities associated with an organization. In some scenarios, an organization may wish to manage how users access data center resources.","Generally described, aspects of the present disclosure relate to providing access to remote networks. Specifically, systems and methods are disclosed for establishing endpoints at various networks that facilitate access to remote network resources, generally referred to as \u201cexternal endpoints.\u201d In an illustrative embodiment, the external endpoints can be configured to provide supplemental information to requests generated by computing devices in the networks prior to prior to transmitting the requests to the remote network. Systems and methods are disclosed for enforcing access policies within the remote network according to information provided by an external endpoint.","In one aspect, a client authorizes the creation of an endpoint external to that remote network. Illustratively, the external endpoint may be a computing device within a private network of the client that is configured to receive requests transmitted from computing devices associated with the private network. The client may further specify access policies to be enforced on the remote network. For example, the remote network may allow public read access to a resource within the remote network, but may only allow write access to that resource via the external endpoint. As a further example, the remote network may only allow access to a resource within the remote network where a client request has already been authenticated by the external endpoint.","The client may then configure a computing device as the external endpoint, and create a secure connection between the external endpoint and the remote network. The external endpoint can be further configured to provide processing of client requests, which can include the addition of supplemental information to the requests. Specifically, in one aspect, the external endpoint processes these requests by determining supplemental information associated with routing the request within the remote network. Illustratively, supplemental information may be associated with the client computing device that submits a request, such as that computing device's address on a private network, an identifier associated with the private network, and the like. By way of further example, supplemental information may be associated with authentication methods, such as a successful authentication on a private network.","An internal endpoint within the remote network receives the request, and processing the request according to the supplemental information. Illustratively, processing the request may correspond to determining whether the request complies with access policies based on the supplemental information. The processing may further correspond with forwarding the request to a computing device within the remote network, such as a database service. Based on processing the request, the internal endpoint obtains a response, which is transmitted to the external endpoint via the secure network connection. The external endpoint may then transmit the response to the requesting client.","Specific embodiments, example applications, and illustrative interfaces of the present disclosure will now be described with reference to the drawings. One skilled in the art will appreciate that the disclosed embodiments and examples need not be implemented in combination. Additionally, the disclosed embodiments and example applications are intended to illustrate, and not limit, the present disclosure.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","120","114","110","120","102","110","120","120","114"]},"The private client network  includes multiple client computing devices  in communication with an external endpoint . The external endpoint may, for example, be a physical computing device. In some embodiments, the external endpoint  may be a virtual computing device loaded onto a physical computing device. The external endpoint is operable to allow interaction between the client computing devices  and a remote network , with which the external endpoint is in communication. In some embodiments, requests may be directed to the external endpoint in the same manner as a request may otherwise be directed to the remote network . For example, the remote network  may generally provide an application programming interface (API) with which clients may interact with computing devices on the remote network . Where an external endpoint  is configured, the same API calls which would generally be transmitted directly to the remote network  may instead be transmitted to the external endpoint . The external endpoint  may then facilitate processing of the API call on the remote network . In some embodiments, the remote network may be configured to accept requests, such as API calls, only from the external endpoint . In other embodiments, requests to the remote network  may be processed differently based on whether they were passed to an external endpoint .","The external endpoint  is further in communication with the computing devices . Illustratively, computing devices  may be additional client computing devices not directly associated with the private client network . In some embodiments, the external endpoint  may be operable to handle requests from computing devices  differently than requests from client computing devices , to reflect their location outside the private client network .","Illustratively, the external endpoint  and the remote network  are connected via one or more communication protocols. For example, the connection between the external endpoint  and the remote network  may be facilitated via a secure network connection, such as a Virtual Private Network (VPN) connection. This secure network connection may be routed via other private or public networks, such as a LAN, WAN, or global communications network. Communication between the external endpoint  and the remote network  may be encrypted or otherwise protected, such as by use of the Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) suite, or by use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) or Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocols. Additional methods of establishing a secure network connection between two points on distinct networks will be apparent to one skilled in the art.","The remote network  includes multiple computing resources  in communication, directly or indirectly, with an internal endpoint . Illustratively, these computing resources  may correspond to resources available to client computing devices. In some embodiments, these resources may implement service available to client computing devices. These resources may include data storage resources, web servers, or other network accessible resources. In some embodiments, computing resources  may be physical computing devices configured to provide specific functionality or processing to the client computing devices . In other embodiments, each computing resources  may correspond to a virtual computing device, such that multiple virtual computing devices may operate from a shared physical computing device. In still more embodiments, a computing resources  may correspond to a virtual computing device accessing multiple physical computing devices . Similarly, the internal endpoint  may be a physical computing device, such as a router, or a virtual computing devices operating from a physical computing device.","Although the internal endpoint  and computing resources  are illustrated as separate logical devices, in some embodiments, the computing resource  and the internal endpoint  may be implemented in combination. For example, a computing device (either physical computing device or virtual machine instance), may be configured in the remote network  to receive client computing device requests and to provide the requested or appropriate processing responsive to the requested. In this embodiment, the combined internal endpoint  and computing resources  may not route any portion of the client computing device request to other computing resources . Alternatively, the combined internal endpoint  and computing resources  may still route at least some portion of the client computing device request to additional or alternative computing resources .","As described above, the internal endpoint  is in communication with the external endpoint  of the client private network  via a secure network connection. In some embodiments, the internal endpoint  may be in communication with multiple external endpoints . The internal endpoint  is further in communication with a policy storage , which holds access policy information. This access policy information may be used by the internal endpoint to determine how to route a received client request. Illustratively, policy storage  may include information specifying that only requests from client computing devices  within the client private network  should be given access to computing devices  within the remote network. On receipt of a request, the internal endpoint  may use information included in the request and the stored policy information (from policy storage ) to determine how to process the request. Policy storage  may correspond to a hard disk drive, either internal or external to a computing device, to network accessible storage, or to other storage devices accessible by the internal endpoint .","With reference to , an illustrative interaction for creating a new policy for accessing a remote network  will be described. Illustratively, a policy may include information specifying how a client of a remote network  or a computing resource  on the remote network  would like to handle requests directed to the remote network . For example, a client may wish to implement a policy allowing only requests from the external endpoint  to be processed by the remote network . As a further example, a client may wish to specify that requests received at the remote network  from the external endpoint  should be treated differently to similar or identical requests transmitted to the remote network  without use of the external endpoint .","As illustrated in , the client computing device  may transmit a request to add new policy information to the external endpoint . Illustratively, the new policy information may include information specifying how the remote network  should process subsequent incoming requests based on request information. The subsequent request information may, by way of non-limiting example, correspond to a incoming port range of the subsequent request, a protocol of the subsequent request, the source address of a subsequent request, whether the subsequent request is received via an external endpoint, and a destination of the request. One illustrative example for a user interface through which a client computing device may create a request to add a new policy will be discussed with respect to , below. In some embodiments, the request to add a new policy from the client computing device  may be transmitted to the external endpoint  by way of an application programming interface (API). In other embodiments, the request to add a new policy may be transmitted via other mechanisms, such as via GET or POST commands, or other transmission protocols.","In this illustrative example, after receiving the request to add a new policy from the client computing device , the external endpoint  adds supplemental information to the request. As discussed above, the supplemental information may be used by the internal endpoint to determine routing within the remote network . The supplemental information may further be used to determine whether the client computing device  is authorized to create new policies. The supplemental information is not required to alter the policy information in the request. In the current example, the external endpoint  may add supplemental information to the request indicating that it is a request to add a new policy, and should be processed by the internal endpoint and added to the access policy information within policy storage . The external endpoint may further add supplemental information identifying the source of the new policy request (e.g., network address, port, etc). Still further, the external endpoint may add supplemental information specifying whether the external endpoint has authenticated the client computing device , such as by use of federated identity authentication","As described above with respect to , external endpoint  and internal endpoint  are in communication via a secure network connection, such as a VPN connection. After supplementing the new policy request, the new policy is transmitted to the internal endpoint  via this secure connection.","In this illustrative embodiment, subsequent to receiving a request to add a new policy, the internal endpoint  retrieves current policy information from policy storage . In some embodiments, the internal endpoint  may be operable to retrieve current policy information from policy storage  prior to receiving a request to add a new policy. The internal endpoint  can utilize the retrieved current policy information in conjunction with the supplemental information included within the new policy request to determine whether to add the new policy request to the policy storage . For example, the current policy information may specify that only new policy requests which are transmitted via the external endpoint  will be accepted and added to the policy storage . In other embodiments, the current policy information may specify that only new policy requests from client computing device  will be accepted. In still more embodiments, current policy information may specify other metrics for determining whether to accept a request to add a new policy based on supplemental information.","If it is determined that a new policy should be accepted, the internal endpoint  may add the new policy information from the request to the policy storage . In some embodiments, the new policy information may be stored in addition to the previous policy information. In other embodiments, a new policy request may function to replace current policy information. In some embodiments, the internal endpoint  may be operable to return an acknowledgement to the external endpoint  that the new policy has been successfully stored. For example, the internal endpoint  may transmit an identifier of the newly stored policy to the external endpoint . The external endpoint may, in turn, transmit such an acknowledgment to the client computing device . Subsequent to storing the new policy information, the illustrative interaction depicted in  may end.","With reference now to , an illustrative interaction for processing a request to access a computing resource  on a remote network  will be described. As illustrated in , the client computing device  transmits a request to the external endpoint . This request corresponds to a request to interact with the remote network . This request may be similar or identical to a request which could be transmitted directly to the remote network . In some embodiments, the request may initially be addressed directly to the remote network . In these embodiments, the external endpoint  may be operable to intercept requests to the remote network  which originate on the private client network . In this illustrative example, the request is a request to access a remote resource . As described above, the remote resource  may be a database server, a web server, or other computing resource accessible via a remote network. As a further example, the request may be a request to access and alter information from a remote data storage device hosted by computing resource . Though a request from a client computing device  is discussed here for the purposes of example, a request may, in some embodiments, be transmitted from a client computing device outside the client private network , such as from a client computing device .","After receiving the request from the client computing device , the external endpoint  supplements the request with supplemental information. This supplemental information allows the internal endpoint  to properly process the request on the remote network . In some embodiments, the supplemental information may be used to determine whether a request conforms to access policies described in policy storage . For example, the supplemental information may describe characteristics of the request or of the client computing device , such as the port on which the request was received at the external endpoint  or an address of the client computing device . In some embodiments, the supplemental information may describe the endpoint at which the request was received. For example, a particular computing resource  (e.g., a database server) may only be accessible when requests are transmitted via a unique external endpoint. In these examples, the unique external endpoint may then include supplemental information verifying that the request was transmitted by that unique external endpoint.","Subsequent to adding supplemental information to the initial client request, the external endpoint  transmits the supplemented request to the internal endpoint  via a secure connection. In some embodiments, the external endpoint  may be operable to determine whether a secure network connection to the internal endpoint  exists. In these embodiments, where a secure network connection does not exist, the external endpoint  may further be operable to establish a secure network connection to the internal endpoint . As described above, the secure network connection may be any connection capable of securely transmitting the supplemented request to the remote network , such as a VPN connection. The secure network connection may require additional information to be added to a request for the purposes of using the secure network connection. This additional information required by the secure network connection is distinct from the supplemental information added to the initial request by the external endpoint . In some embodiments, the client computing device  may be unaware that the request is transmitted to the remote network . In still more embodiments, the supplemental information may be transmitted separately from the initial client request. For example, the external endpoint  may transmit the initial client request to the internal endpoint  via the secure connection without including the determined supplemental information. The external endpoint  may then transmit the supplemental information separately from the initial client request. Those the initial client request and the supplemental information are described for the purposes of example herein as combined into a supplemented request, one skilled in the art will appreciated that both may be passed to the remote network  individually or in combination.","After receiving a supplemented request from the external endpoint , the internal endpoint  retrieves policy information from policy storage . As described above with respect to , in some embodiments, the internal endpoint may retrieve policy information from policy storage  prior to receiving a supplemented request. As will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, the internal endpoint  may retrieve policy information from policy storage  at any point before further processing the request, as will be described below.","Subsequent to receiving a supplemented request and retrieving policy information, the internal endpoint  processes the request by determining an appropriate destination of the request. An appropriate destination may be a computing resource within the remote network, such as computing resources . In some embodiments, the client computing device  may be unaware of the routing within the remote network . For example, as described above, a remote network  may implement one or more virtual computing devices within the computing resources . These virtual computing devices may, in turn, emulate virtual networking configurations between the virtual computing devices. As such, the apparent emulated destination as seen by the client computing device  may differ from the actual physical destination determined by the internal endpoint . In some embodiments, a request may be processed by transmitting the request to a destination outside of the remote network , such as to an additional resource which resides on another network. The client computing device  may be further unaware of such external transmission.","In order to determine the appropriate destination of a request, the internal endpoint  may use supplemental information included within the request. For example, the supplemental information may include that the request is directed to a database controlled by a user of the client computing device . The supplemental information may include further information identifying or authenticating that user. The internal endpoint  may use this supplemental information to determine a location at the remote network  of the client's database. In some embodiments, determining an appropriate destination of a request may include determining how to process the request on the remote network. For example, determining an appropriate destination may include determining a routing of the request or a priority of the request. In some embodiments, clients of the remote network  may have differing priorities to networking resources or computing resources of the remote network . In these embodiments, the supplemental information included in the request may reflect the priority level associated with the client. The internal endpoint  may use such priority information to determine a routing within the remote network . For example, where the priority of a request is low, a slower or less costly routing within the remote network  may be determined. Where a request has a high priority, a more costly or faster routing may be determined. The priority associated with a client may be reflected of service level agreements between the remote network  and the client. In other embodiments, the priority of a request may be independent of the client. For example, a request may be marked as \u201curgent\u201d by the generating client computing device , and therefore be given a higher priority. In some embodiments, the priority of a request may be a combination of the client's priority and the priority assigned to the request by the generating client computing device .","In some embodiments, the supplemental information may not be necessary to determine an appropriate destination of a request. For example, where an external endpoint  has access to only one computing resource  within the remote network , all requests from that external endpoint  may be determined to be directed to that computing resource . In other embodiments, the supplemental information may include information identifying the source external endpoint , and therefore supplemental information may be used to determine an appropriate destination. In still more embodiments, an internal endpoint may be linked to particular computing resource  within a remote network . As such, all requests to the internal endpoint may be routed to that particular computing resource .","In addition to determining an appropriate destination of a request, the internal endpoint  may further determine whether the request complies with the access policies retrieved from the policy storage . Additionally, as previously described, in some embodiments, the computing device functioning as the internal endpoint  may also function as the computing resource . In these embodiments, the above-described determination of an appropriate destination may be omitted, with the internal endpoint  can determine whether the request complies with the access policies retrieved from the policy storage  responsive to the receipt of the request from the client computing device .","As will be described below with respect to , access policy information may set rules for accessing a computing resource  on the remote network . Access policies or rules may further define who or how access policy information is modified or updated. For example, a particular authentication method may be required to access a computing resource . This authentication method may correspond to use of a user name and password, to use of federated authentication methods, or to other authentication. The internal endpoint  may compare the supplemental information contained in the request to the authentication required by the access policies to determine whether the request may be processed. If the supplemental information contains the required authentication, the request would then be processed. Otherwise, the request would be denied. In some embodiments, denial of a request may further include returning a response indicating an error to either the external endpoint  or the client computing device  which generated the request. As will be discussed below with respect to , in some embodiments, the external endpoint  may also be operable to determine whether a request complies with access policies.","Though described above individually, in some embodiments, determining an appropriate destination of a request may be accomplished simultaneously to determining whether the request conforms to access policies stored within the policy storage . For example, access policies, in some embodiments, may include information on how to route a request to an appropriate destination based on supplemental information in the request. In other embodiments, determination of an appropriate destination may be distinct from determining whether a request conforms to the stored access policies.","Subsequent to determining an appropriate destination of a request and whether the request conforms to stored access policies, the internal endpoint  processes the request within the remote network . Where the appropriate destination is distinct from the internal endpoint , processing the request may include transmitting the request to a distinct computing device within the remote network, such as a computing resource . As previously discussed, in other examples, the request may be processed by the internal endpoint . For example, as shown in , a request to alter an access policy may not request transmission of the request to a distinct computing device. In addition, processing the request may require additional processing based on the nature of the request. For example, where a client request is a request to alter a database hosted by a computing resource , processing may require transmission to that computing resource . In addition, processing may require the computing resource  to modify the appropriate database or otherwise process information included in the request.","As described above, in some embodiments, computing resource  and internal endpoint  may be implemented by the same device. In some such embodiments, internal endpoint  may be configured to process requests directed to the computing resource  which is implemented on the same device as internal endpoint . In these embodiments, internal endpoint  may also process requests to alter or access policy information. In some such embodiments, an external endpoint  may also be configured to access a single internal endpoint . In this way, an external endpoint  may be limited to accessing a single computing resource  on the remote network . Such implementations may simplify configuration and reduce the need for routing within the remote network .","For the purposes of illustration, it is assumed in this example that processing the request on the remote network  generates a response to the request by the appropriate computing resource . In other embodiments, the request may generate no response by the remote network . In these embodiments, the illustrative interaction demonstrated by  may then end.","In embodiments where a response to the initial client request is generated, the response is obtained by the internal endpoint . In the example depicted by , this response is generated by a computing resource  and transmitted to the internal endpoint . In other embodiments, the internal endpoint  may generate the appropriate response.","After obtaining the response, the internal endpoint  returns the response to the external endpoint  via the secure network connection. In some embodiments, the internal endpoint  may be operable to confirm that the secure network connection with the external endpoint  has been maintained. Where a secure network connection no longer exists to the external endpoint , the internal endpoint may be operable to establish such a secure network connection.","After receiving the response via the secure connection, the external endpoint  transmits the response to the initial client request to the client computing device . The illustrative interaction depicted in  may then end.","With reference to , one example of a user interface for authorization of an external endpoint or addition of an access policy will be discussed. Illustratively, this user interface could be presented to any client computing device, such as client computing devices  or  of . As shown in , interface window  allows a user to input both information corresponding to the creation of an authorized external endpoint or information corresponding to access policies which should be enforced by the remote network. Input fields - correspond with information authorizing a new external endpoint. Illustratively, this information may specify a specific network address on which the external endpoint must exist. This address may, for example, be an Internet Protocol (IP) address which is accessible on a global communications network. The information may further specify the connection type which must be established between the remote network and the authorized external endpoint. For example, an external endpoint may be required to use a VPN connection to communicate with the remote network. Additionally, an endpoint identifier may be specified, such that the authorized endpoint's identifier may be used to subsequently craft access policies for accessing the remote network over the external endpoint. Additional information may be specified in order to authorize an external endpoint. For example, further information may be specified for use in establishing a secure network connection, such as a username and password used to establish the connection. A client computing device may submit the entered information to the remote network by selecting submit button . A client computing device identified by the submitted information may then establish itself to the remote network as an external endpoint. In some embodiments, additional measures may be required to establish a computing device as an external endpoint. For example, the remote network may provide software which must be loaded on to the client computing device before the computing device can function as an external endpoint. A request to create an authorized external endpoint may be received on the remote network  via a previously authorized external endpoint, or directly to the remote network . In some embodiments, a request to create an external endpoint must be authenticated before being accepted by the remote network .","In addition to authorizing a computing device to function as an external endpoint, interface window  may also allow addition of access policies to be enforced by the remote network. Information fields - illustrate information which may be utilized in order to create such an access policy. Information field  allows the input of a name for a newly created access policy. Such a policy name may assist a client in identifying the access policy in the future. For example, an interface may be providing to the client which allows the selective editing of access policies based on a selected policy name. Information field  allows the specification of a port range to which a request is directed. Illustratively, this port range may be associated with ports specified by the Internet Protocol Suite, such as Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or User Datagram Protocol (UDP) port ranges. In some embodiments, a source port range may be specified. Information field  may specify a protocol of an incoming request. Illustratively, such a protocol may be TCP, UDP, or other transport protocols. In some embodiments, additional protocols may be specified, including but not limited to Secure Shell (SSH), TLS\/SSL, or Stream Control Transmission Protocol (STCP). Information field  may specify a source address from which a request originates. Illustratively, this may be an IP address which is local to a private computing network. In other embodiments, a source address may be an IP address of a global communications network. In still more embodiments, the source address may consist of other identifying information, such as a Media Access Control (MAC) address of a source or a hostname of a source. Information field  may allow the specification of an endpoint thru which the request will pass. For example, a created access policy may apply only to requests which pass through an identified external endpoint. In other examples, a created access policy may apply to requests which pass through endpoints internal to the remote network, such as a publicly accessible endpoint. Information field  allows an action to be associated with a request which conforms to the previously discussed information fields. For example, any request which complies to the previously specified information fields may be allowed by the remote network (i.e., processed in accordance with the request). In other examples, requests which comply with specified information fields may be denied access to the remote network. In some embodiments, denied requests may be processed by returning an error message to the source of the request. A client may submit the information contained within information fields - to the remote network by selecting the submit button .","In some embodiments, a remote network may implement default access policies in response to requests which do not meet any client specified access policies. For example, in some embodiments, all requests which do not comply with a client specified access policy may be denied. In other examples, default access policies may differ based on the nature of the request. For example, all requests to read resources on the remote network may be allowed (in the absence of applicable client specified access policies), while all requests to modify resources may be denied. Though the above information is discussed for the purposes of example, one or more information fields - may be omitted during the creation of an access policy. In addition, further information fields not discussed above may be included in a created access policy. By way of non-limiting example, such information may include a username of the submitting entity, the time of day information is submitted, the API call used by the future access request, the authentication method used to submit the request to add access policy information, and the encryption used to add the access policy.","With reference now to , one embodiment of a routine  implemented by an external endpoint  for processing a request from a client computing device to a remote network  will be described. At block , the external endpoint  receives a request to interact with the remote network  from a client computing device . As described above, this request could correspond to any request to interact with the remote network . By way of non-limiting example, the request may be a request to add, modify, or delete an access policy on the remote network  or a request to read to or write to a computing resource  on the remote network . Such a write request may include a request to create, update, or delete information within a computing resource . The request may further be a request to modify the configuration of the remote network , such as by creating a new computing resource  or modifying processing of further requests within the remote network .","At block , the external endpoint  may optionally determine whether the request conforms to the access policies of the remote network . This may, for example, require the external endpoint  have access to policy storage. This policy storage may be the policy storage  within the remote network , or may be policy storage within the client private network . In some embodiments, the external endpoint  may be operable to maintain synchronized access policies on both the client private network  and the remote network . In other embodiments, the access policies enforced by the external endpoint  may be supplemental to or distinct from the access policies enforced by the remote network . For example, the remote network  may include an access policy which allows all requests from the external endpoint . The external endpoint  may, in turn, include access policies only allowing requests from client computing devices  which authenticate with the external endpoint . In other embodiments, all access policies may be enforced by the remote network , such that the external endpoint  is not required to determine whether a request complies with any access policies. In these embodiments, routine  may omit block . In some embodiments, external endpoint  may be operable to log whether a request complies with policy information.","At block , if the external endpoint  has determined that the request does not comply with access policies, the external endpoint  may optionally return an error to the client computing device . In some embodiments, the external endpoint  may not return an error, but simply ignore the request. Where a request does not comply with access policies, the routine  will end.","If the request does comply with access policies, or if the external endpoint  does not test whether access policies are complied with, the routine  proceeds to block . At block , the external endpoint  verifies that a secure network connection exists between the external endpoint  and an internal endpoint  within the remote network . As discussed above, the secure network connection allows secure communication across a network between the external endpoint  and the internal endpoint . For example, the secure network connection may utilize a WAN or global communications network. In these examples, a method of securing a network connection is required to ensure that information within requests is not disclosed or modified. For the purposes of the present example, a VPN connection between endpoints will be assumed. As described above, other mechanisms for creating a secure network connection between endpoints may be utilized without departing from the scope of the present disclosure.","Where the external endpoint  determines that a secure network connection does not exist, the external endpoint  may, at block , create such a secure network connection with the remote network . For the purposes of the current example, creation of a secure network connection may include transmitting a request to create a VPN connection, along with additional information necessary for creating the connection, such as authentication information. In some embodiments, creation of a secure network connection may include prompting a client computing device  to input information necessary to create the secure network connection. Where a secure network connection cannot be established, the external endpoint  may return an error to the client computing device .","After a secure network connection is verified or established, the routine  may proceed to block . At block , supplemental information is determined and added to the initial client request. As describe above, the supplemental information may be used by the internal endpoint to determine routing within the remote network , or to determine whether a request complies with access policies of the remote network . For example, the supplemental information may describe characteristics of the request or of the client computing device , such as the port on which the request was received at the external endpoint  or an address of the client computing device . In some embodiments, the supplemental information may describe the external endpoint  at which the request was received.","After adding the supplemental information to the initial client request, at block , the external endpoint  transmits the supplemented request to the internal endpoint  within the remote network  via the secure network connection. Transmission of the supplemented request then allows the remote network  to process the request and generate a response, a routine which will be described in more detail below with respect to .","At block , after the remote network  generates a response to the request, the external endpoint  receives a response via the secure network connection. The external endpoint  may then generate a response for the client computing device . In some embodiments, the response for the client computing device  may be identical to the response received from the remote network . In other embodiments, the external endpoint  may modify the received response before transmitting a response to the client computing device . Modification of a response may occur, for example, where a client computing device  is unaware that the request was routed outside of the private client network , or where the response must be modified in order to be routed within the private client network .","After generating a response, at block , the response is transmitted to the client computing device  which generated the initial client request. The routine  may then end.","With reference now to , one embodiment of a routine  implemented by an internal endpoint  for processing a request from a client computing device to a remote network  will be described. At block , the internal endpoint  receives access policies related to processing requests on the remote network  from client computing devices . In some embodiments, access policies may be received from a client computing device , such as during the interaction illustrated above with respect to . In other embodiments, default access policies may be provided to an internal endpoint . In still more embodiments, access policies may be retrieved from a policy storage, such as the policy storage . Further, access policies may be received by other mechanisms, such as by client computing devices  which are not within the private client network . These client computing devices  may be operable to create access policies for the remote network , for example, where they are authenticated as being operated by the user or administrator of the remote network . Access polices are described in more detail with respect to , above.","At block , the internal endpoint  receives a supplemented request from the external endpoint  via a secure network connection. At block , the supplemental information included within the request is determined. As described above with respect to , supplemental information can be added by the external endpoint  in order to assist routing within the remote network , or in order to determine compliance with the retrieved access policies.","At block , the internal endpoint  determines the appropriate destination of the request. In some embodiments, determining an appropriate destination may include processing the supplemental information with the retrieved access policies. For example, access policies may determine that all requests coming from a certain external endpoint are transmitted to a specific computing resource  within the remote network . In other embodiments, the access policies may not be required in order to determine the appropriate destination of the request. For example, the supplemental information may indicate a certain user account to which the request is directed (e.g., by identifying the source external endpoint , the source client computing device , or included authentication). The internal endpoint  may then determine a destination computing resource  within the remote network  as a function of that user account. Illustratively, a request from \u201cClient 1\u201d may be directed to \u201cMy Database Server.\u201d The internal endpoint  may determine, based on information of the remote network , that the \u201cMy Database Server\u201d of \u201cClient 1\u201d is hosted by a specific computing resource  of the remote network . Further, routing may be based in part on the physical or logical design of the remote network . Illustratively, routing metrics may be used to determine a less congested routing path to the end destination. In some embodiments, a routing path may further be based on preferences associated with a certain user of the remote network . For example, a user which has a higher priority for use of the remote network  may receive a faster routing path to the appropriate destination.","In some embodiments, the international destination of the request may be the internal endpoint . This may occur, for example, where the request is a request to modify access policy information, as illustrated above with respect to . In another example, the internal endpoint  may be configured to provide data processing functionality as a computing resource . In these embodiments, the determination of a destination at block  can include an identification of the internal endpoint  as the appropriate recipient of the request. Alternatively, the determination of a destination at block  may be omitted. Additionally, in some embodiments, the remote network  may be in communication with other computing devices outside of the remote network . In these embodiments, the appropriate destination of a request may be those computing resources outside of the remote network .","At block , the internal endpoint  determines whether the request complies with the retrieved access policies. Though described herein as subsequent to the determination of an appropriate destination, in some embodiments, compliance with access policies may be tested prior to determining an appropriate destination. As described above with respect to , the internal endpoint  may use supplemental information included within the request to determine the requests compliance with access policies. For example, the supplemental information may describe the source or authentication method of the request. By processing that supplemental information with the retrieved access policies, it may be determined whether to allow the request. In some embodiments, supplemental information within the request may specify whether the request has been determined to comply with access policies by an external endpoint. In some such embodiments, the internal endpoint  may trust such information to determine whether the request complies with access policies. In still more embodiments, the internal endpoint  may be operable to log whether requests comply with access policies.","If the request does not comply with the retrieved access policies, the internal endpoint  may optionally return an error message at block . For example, an error message may indicate that the user does not have the authority to complete the requested action. In other embodiments, the internal endpoint  may ignore requests that do not comply with access policies. Where a request does not comply with access policies, the routine  then ends.","If a request does comply with access policies, the routine  proceeds to block . At block , the request is transmitted to the determined appropriate destination. Transmitting the request to an appropriate destination may include routing the request through additional network components. As described above, in some embodiments, the appropriate destination may be the internal endpoint . In these embodiments, the internal endpoint  processes the request locally, and may not be required to further transmit the request.","At block , a response to the request is received at the internal endpoint . Illustratively, this response could indicate that the request has been processed successfully. In other embodiments, a response could indicate that the request could not be processed, or indicate reasons for the failure to process the response. In some embodiments, requests may not require or invite a response. In these embodiments, the routine  may then end.","Where a response is received, the internal endpoint , at block , transmits the response to the external endpoint . As described with respect to , the response may then be returned to the client computing device  which generated the initial client request. The routine  may then end.","It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art and others that all of the functions described in this disclosure may be embodied in software executed by one or more processors of the disclosed components and mobile communication devices.
