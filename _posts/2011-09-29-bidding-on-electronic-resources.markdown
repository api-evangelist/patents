title: Bidding on electronic resources
abstract: Systems and methods involve managing exhaustible electronic resources, such as IPv4 addresses. A spot market for the electronic resources is operated to enable users to obtain units of the electronic resources. Potential users may provide pricing criteria. When a spot price for units of the electronic resources satisfies the pricing criteria for a potential user, the potential user may be given access to a requested number of units of the electronic resources.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["As the number of devices associated with one or more unique identifiers, such as Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, that communicate with other devices in a network increases, the demand for unique identifiers increases as well. The maximum number of unique identifiers for one or more networks, however, may be limited for various reasons. Thus, the maximum number of unique identifiers may not change even as demand for the unique identifiers increases. In addition, at least a portion of the maximum number of unique identifiers may be unavailable because another party owns or has the right to use the portion of unique identifiers. In some cases, a party may own or have the right to use more unique identifiers than are currently needed.","For example, there are a predetermined number of Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) addresses. As the number of Internet users and the number of devices that need to be associated with one or more IPv4 addresses has increased, the number of available IPv4 addresses has decreased. Furthermore, as the number of unallocated IPv4 addresses has decreased, the demand for unallocated IPv4 addresses has increased.","In the following description, various embodiments will be described. For purposes of explanation, specific configurations and details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the embodiments. However, it will also be apparent to one skilled in the art that the embodiments may be practiced without the specific details. Furthermore, well-known features may be omitted or simplified in order not to obscure the embodiments being described.","Systems and methods that efficiently facilitate transactions of exhaustible electronic resources are described herein. Embodiments of the present disclosure include systems and methods of managing a spot market for unique identifiers. In a particular illustrative embodiment, an organization manages units of an electronic resource. The electronic resource may be exhaustible, thereby preventing the creation of additional units of the resource. In an embodiment, the electronic resource is an exhaustible shared electronic public resource, a portion of which is under the control of the organization. Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) addresses, Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) addresses, ten digit telephone numbers, and other address identifiers, which may be unique identifiers, are examples of exhaustible shared electronic public resources.","In an embodiment, an organization utilizes a market to allocate units of the exhaustible electronic public resource to other organizations. For example, the organization may allocate a unit of the exhaustible electronic public resource based at least in part on pricing criteria, such as maximum prices and\/or other criteria, received from bidders. The organization may assign an arbitrary initial price for units of the resource and may manage units of the resource based on the initial price and the received pricing criteria. For example, if the pricing criteria received from a bidder is greater than the initial price for the units, then one or more units of the resource may be allocated to the bidder. The organization can use the received pricing criteria to calculate a spot price for the units of the resource and may manage units of the resource such that bidders whose pricing criteria are satisfied by the spot price are allocated units of the resource. For example, the organization may determine the spot price as the maximum price that will result in a maximum number of a supply of units of the resource being leased. Bidders to whom leases are granted may then pay the determined spot price or another price, such as their maximum bid price, for a number of units of the resource.","When a bidder's pricing criteria is satisfied by the spot price, the bidder (or an organization associated with the bidder) may be allocated a number of units (or other such measure) of the resource. Allocating the units may be performed in various ways, depending on the type of resource. In an embodiment where the units of the resources are IP addresses, allocating the units may include updating one or more records on a WHOIS server. For example, in one embodiment records are updated on a WHOIS server associated with an organization managing the allocation of units of the exhaustible electronic resource. In another embodiment, records may be updated on a WHOIS server associated with an organization that owns units of the exhaustible electronic resource. Updated records on the WHOIS server may indicate that the bidder has been allocated a number of the units of the resource. Allocating units of the resource may include utilizing a connection, such as a virtual private network (VPN) connection, between a network associated with an organization managing units of the resource and a network associated with a bidder. Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) may be used to cause routers to re-route traffic to the IP addresses and, in particular, to re-route network traffic according to instructions from the bidder. As an example, the organization or an internet service provider (ISP) may advertise BGP routes for the IP addresses that cause network traffic to the IP addresses to be routed to network destinations specified by the bidder or the organization. Other actions may also be taken to avoid problems that may arise when IP addresses are allocated. For example, allocation information may be published to enable various services that track IP addresses to receive updates. As a specific example, a service that identifies the location of an IP address may receive published information to continue providing the service accurately.","In an embodiment, units of the resource are managed by the organization by allocating units of the resource in a manner that is revocable. In this manner, as the spot price changes over time, bidders may maintain control over units of the resource as long as their pricing criteria are satisfied by the spot price. For example, if the spot price exceeds a maximum bid price of a bidder, units allocated to the bidder may be revoked. For instance, with IP addresses, if a lessee's maximum bid price is exceeded by the spot price, then one or more IP addresses may be deallocated from the lessee. As another example, a connection, such as a VPN connection, may be shut down or otherwise disconnected so that the bidder no longer has access to units of the exhaustible resource. In one embodiment, records on a WHOIS server are updated to reflect that units of the exhaustible resource are no longer allocated to the bidder. Control of the revoked IP addresses (or other resource units) may be provided to another bidder. In addition, revoked IP addresses (or other resource units) may be left unallocated for a period of time to allow for a smooth transition to a new lessee, for instance, to avoid network traffic intended for a former lessee from being sent to a new lessee, thereby taxing resources of the new lessee.","Variations are considered as being within the scope of the present disclosure. In an embodiment, spot market prices may be determined for indefinite time periods. For example, in an embodiment, a bidder retains control over a set of IP addresses (or other units of resource) while the bidder's pricing criteria is satisfied by the spot price. The bidder may lose control over the set of IP addresses if the spot price changes so as to not satisfy the pricing criteria, if the bidder withdraws a bid, or if the bidder changes the pricing criteria specifically to not be satisfied by the spot price. In this manner, the bidder may retain control for a time period that is not pre-determined, but that is subject to spot price changes and\/or actions by the bidder. The bidder may pay per time period for control of the IP addresses, although the price may change with the spot price. For example, the price paid may be the spot price. Spot prices may also be determined for different aspects of the same resource. As an example, spot market prices may be determined for IP addresses for different lease terms. Thus, the spot market price for an IP address for one month may be different than the spot market price for an IP address for a year. When a lease term nears an end, the lessee may, in some embodiments, renew a lease by paying the current spot price for the same or a different lease term. As another example where spot prices may be determined for various aspects of a resource, spot prices may be determined for contiguous blocks of IP space and\/or for different size blocks of IP space. For example, classless inter-domain routing (CIDR) \/24 contiguous blocks may have one spot price, while \/22 blocks may have another spot price. Non-contiguous blocks of the same size may have their own spot price and the spot prices may be for various time periods or for indefinite time periods.","As another example of a variation considered as being within the scope of the present disclosure, an organization may operate a spot market where units of a resource are provided from various owners. For example, owners of IP addresses may utilize a spot market operated by an organization. Bidders may purchase IP address leases on the spot market and the owners may, in response to transactions, cause IP address routing to be changed accordingly. The operator of the spot market may also bid on IP addresses in the market of its own use, such as to manage computing resources as a service to others. Other variations are also considered as being within the scope of the present disclosure, including additional variations discussed below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","110","120","140","170","120","110","140","170","120","140","130","120","140","155","165","155","120","140","150","165","120","140","160","155","165","120","140","155","120","140","165","110","170","120","130","140"]},"In embodiments, the user network  shown in  facilitates communications between various devices connected with the user network  and the private network .

For example, in an embodiment, a request is received indicating that a party wishes to use one IPv4 address for a period of time, which may be specified or indefinite, where the IPv4 address has a location corresponding to the United States. In another embodiment, a request may be received specifying that an organization wishes to have IPv4 addresses allocated to the organization for a period of time, such as one year.","Once a request has been received , the method  proceeds to block . In block , a determination is made as to whether one or more unique identifiers are available. The determination may be made based at least in part on the criteria provided in the request. For example, if a request indicates that a bidder wants an IPv4 address with a location corresponding to the United States, a data store comprising information for available IPv4 addresses such as a location for the IPv4 addresses may be searched to determine whether at least one IPv4 address having a location corresponding to the United States is available . In another embodiment, a request may be received  that indicates that a bidder wants an IPv4 address for two years. In this embodiment, a data store comprising information associated with a plurality of unique identifiers may be queried to determine whether at least one IPv4 address is available for at least two years. For example, referring to , server  may receive a request from a bidder associated with user network  where the request indicates that the bidders wants to use an IPv6 address. In response to receiving the request, server  may query data store  to determine whether an IPv6 address is available. If at least one IPv4 address meeting the criteria specified in the request is available, then the method  proceeds to block .","In block , a spot price is determined. The spot price may be determined in any suitable manner, such as by accessing a pre-calculated spot price from a data store or by calculating a spot price. The spot price may be calculated using any of a variety of factors. For example, in an embodiment, the spot price is based at least in part on current bids for the unique identifiers. One example of calculating a spot price in such an embodiment is discussed below in connection with . The spot price may be determined based at least in part on criteria provided in the request. For example, in an embodiment, a spot price for IPv4 addresses may be determined based on a length of time specified in the request. In another embodiment, a spot price may be based on the quantity of IPv4 addresses requested. In one embodiment, a spot price may be based on a length of time, a quantity, and\/or other factors specified in a request.","In an embodiment, the spot price can be based on whether there is contention for the electronic resources. For example, in one embodiment, as long as IPv4 addresses are available, then bidders may be allocated a requested number of IPv4 addresses for a bid price specified in a bid request. If, however, the requested number of IPv4 addresses are not available then a contention-based pricing scheme may be used to determine whether the current bidder should be allocated the requested number of IPv4 addresses. If a determination is made that the current bidder should be allocated one or more IPv4 addresses, then the current bidder may be allocated the one or more IPv4 addresses. In doing so, the one or more IPv4 addresses may be deallocated from another user to which the one or more IPv4 addresses had previously been allocated. One example of a contention-based pricing scheme is described in connection with . Other variations are within the scope of this disclosure.","After a spot price is determined , in an embodiment, the method  proceeds to block . In block , one or more unique identifiers are selected. A selected unique identifier may be based at least in part on criteria provided in the request. A selected unique identifier may also be based at least in part on other criteria not provided in the request. For example, in an embodiment involving a request for one IPv4 address having a location corresponding with the United States and being available for two years, the IPv4 address may be selected from five IPv4 addresses meeting the request criteria. In this embodiment, the IPv4 address may be selected from the five IPv4 addresses based on the length of time since the IPv4 addresses were last used. For example, the selected IPv4 address may have been available for the longest period of time since last being used. Such an embodiment may be beneficial for transitioning the allocation of electronic resources from one party to another party because it may allow network traffic intended for the first party to subside before an electronic resource is allocated to the other party.","Once at least one unique identifier has been selected , in an embodiment, the method  proceeds to block . In block , the selected unique identifier or unique identifiers can be allocated. For example, in an embodiment discussed above, access to the selected IPv4 address is provided to the lessee for two years. In an embodiment, at the end of the two years the selected IPv4 address is automatically deallocated. In another embodiment, the selected IPv4 address remains allocated for one or more periods of time after the two year expiration based at least in part on a current spot price. In an embodiment, the selected IPv4 address remains allocated for one or more periods of time after the two year expiration based at least in part on the previously determined spot price. In some embodiments, access to the selected IPv4 address continues to be granted after the two years for a determined period of time and a new spot price is determined for the IPv4 address.","Referring now to , a flowchart is illustrated that is directed to a method  of managing a spot market for unique identifiers according to an embodiment. The description of the method  shown in  will be made with respect to  and  which illustrate aspects of example environments for implementing aspects in accordance with various embodiments. It should be noted, however, that the scope of the present disclosure is not limited to the explicit environment illustrated in  or in , but in other environments, including variations of  or  not explicitly illustrated or described.","The method  shown in , in an embodiment, begins when a request for a unique identifier is received . A request can be received by any number of electronic devices in communication with a sending device. For example, in  the web server  may receive a request from the client device  through the network . In another embodiment, the application server  may receive a request from the client device  through the network . For example, the application server  may receive a request from the client device  and the request may indicate that the requestor wants to lease ten IPv4 addresses for one week.","A request may comprise any number or selection of criteria. In an embodiment, a request includes identification information that identifies the electronic device making the request. For example, the identification information can include any information that enables the receiving device to determine the identity of the sending device or allows the receiving device to communicate with the sending device. For example, in the embodiment shown in , a request sent from the client device  and received by the web server  may include information\u2014such as the IP address of the client device \u2014that allows the web server  to communicate with the client device .","In an embodiment, a request includes an identification of the party making a request (i.e., a requestor). For example, a request may contain a requestor's name, an associated company, a billing address, a mailing address, one or more phone numbers, an account number, other contact information, or a combination thereof. In embodiments, authentication information, such as a username and a password, may be included in a request. A request may contain a unique identification number that can be used to authenticate the party making a request. For example, in an embodiment, before making a request a party creates an account and receives a unique identification number that the party can submit with a request to verify the identity of the party.","In an embodiment, a request contains payment information. For example, a request may contain a credit card number and expiration date that can be used by the receiving device to process any payments related to the request. A request may include a bank account number and a routing number that can be used to electronically deduct any payments related to the request. In an embodiment, the request includes information indicating that any payments related to the request should be taken from a pre-funded balance. In another embodiment, the request comprises information including that payments related to the request should be billed to the party making the request or to an approved third-party.","A request may refer to an internal reference that can be used to determine a payment method for any payments related to the request. For example, in an embodiment, prior to sending a request a requestor may have previously provided a payment method such as a credit card type, a credit card number, and an expiration date. In such an embodiment, the payment method may be assigned an internal reference number that can be included in a request associated with the requestor to indicate that the payment method should be used for any payments related to the request. In an embodiment, multiple payment methods are included in a request.","In some embodiments, a request is intended to include pricing information. For example, a request may contain a maximum price that the requestor is willing to pay for one or more unique identifiers according to criteria specified in the request. In an embodiment, a maximum price comprises a total price that a requestor is willing to pay for a total number of unique identifiers meeting the criteria specified in a request. For example, a request may include a maximum price of $100 for six unique identifiers. Thus, in this embodiment, if six unique identifiers are available, then a maximum price of $100 will be paid by the requestor (i.e. the total bill will be $100 or less). In another embodiment, a maximum price comprises the highest price that a requestor is willing to pay for each unique identifier that meets the criteria specified in a request. For example, a request may include a maximum price of $25 for each of ten unique identifiers. Thus, in this embodiment, if ten unique identifiers are available then a maximum bill of $250 will be paid by the requestor.","In some embodiments, a request contains a number of unique identifiers that are wanted by the requestor or a third-party for which the requestor is making a request. For example, a request may provide that a requestor wants a single unique identifier. A request may provide that a requestor wants a specified quantity of unique identifiers, such as 5, 10, or 20 unique identifiers. In embodiments, a request may include information indicating that the requestor wants a block of unique identifiers. For example, a request may provide that a requestor wants a block of twenty-four IPv4 addresses.","In an embodiment, a request includes a type of unique identifier that is being requested. For example, the type of unique identifier may be an IPv4 address, an IPv6 address, or a telephone number. In embodiments, a type of unique identifier may be any type of unique identifier that comprises a finite number of unique identifiers. A request may include multiple types of unique identifiers according to an embodiment. For example, in an embodiment, a request contains information indicating that a requestor wants two IPv4 addresses and six IPv6 addresses. In another embodiment, a request provides that a requestor wants a block of IPv4 addresses and two telephone numbers.","A request may indicate whether a portion of at least two unique identifiers must be contiguous. In an embodiment, the trailing letters or digits of two or more unique identifiers must be contiguous according to a request. For example, in an embodiment a request provides that five unique identifiers each of the trailing digits of the unique identifiers being contiguous are needed. In this embodiment, the contiguous criteria may be met if the trailing digits of the unique identifiers are adjacent. Thus, according to this embodiment, if the last two digits of the unique identifiers were \u201c11\u201d, \u201c12\u201d, \u201c13\u201d, \u201c14\u201d, and \u201c15,\u201d then the condition was met. In an embodiment a request may provide that a block of contiguous IP addresses are needed. For example, a request may provide that an CIDR \/27 block of IPv4 addresses (32 contiguous IPv4 addresses) may be needed. A contiguous block of IP addresses may be beneficial at least because less configuration may be required for various devices when the block of IP addresses are contiguous. For example, if a large block of IP addresses is non-contiguous, a gateway or a router providing routing information for the IP addresses may not have sufficient capacity (i.e. sufficient memory) to route each individual IP address. However, if the large block of IP addresses is contiguous, then a gateway or router providing routing information may reference a range of the IP addresses rather than each individual IP address and, thereby, have sufficient capacity. In embodiments, the leading letters of digits of two or more unique identifiers must be contiguous according to a request. Also, any number of letters or digits contained in two or more unique identifiers may be required to be contiguous according to a request.","In an embodiment, a request indicates that a portion of at least one unique identifier must have a certain value. In an embodiment, the leading letters or digits of one or more unique identifiers may need to be the same according to a request. For example, in an embodiment a request provides that a telephone number needs to have an area code of \u201c202\u201d. In another embodiment, the trailing letters or digits of one or more unique identifiers may need to be the same according to a request. For example, a request may indicate that four telephone numbers are needed and each of the four telephone numbers must end with \u201c5000\u201d. In other embodiments, any number of letters or digits contained in one or more unique identifiers must be the same according to a request. For example, a request may provide that a telephone number having a prefix \u201c949\u201d is requested. In this embodiment, a phone number having an area code of \u201c202\u201d and a prefix of \u201c949\u201d would satisfy this requirement.","In an embodiment, a request indicates whether a requestor wishes to lease or purchase one or more unique identifiers. For example, a request may indicate that three unique identifiers are needed and that the requestor wishes to purchase the three unique identifiers. In another embodiment, a request indicates that two blocks of IPv4 addresses are needed and that the requestor wishes to lease the two blocks of IPv4 addresses. A request may indicate that a requestor wants to purchase or lease one or more unique identifiers, or both. For example, in an embodiment a request indicates that five IPv4 addresses are needed and that the requestor wishes to purchase three of the IPv4 addresses and lease two IPv4 addresses. In another embodiment, a request indicates that two blocks of IPv4 addresses are wanted and that the requestor prefers to lease one block of IPv4 addresses and purchase the other block of IPv4 addresses, but that the requestor is willing to purchase both blocks of IPv4 addresses for a specified maximum price.","According to an embodiment, a request indicates a time frame that one or more unique identifiers need to be leased. For example, in an embodiment, a request provides that a number of unique identifiers are needed immediately for one year. In another embodiment, a request indicates that a number of unique identifiers are needed in two days beginning at 1:00 PM EST and lasting for five years. In various embodiments, a request can include any number of minutes, hours, days, months, years, or some combination thereof. Furthermore, a request may provide a repetitive time frame for which one or more unique identifiers are needed. For example, in an embodiment, a request includes information indicating that four blocks of IPv4 addresses are needed every first week of a month. In another embodiment, a request provides that fifty-four IPv6 addresses are needed from June thru July every year.","In an embodiment, a request indicates that the request should remain valid until one or more specified criteria are met. A request may provide that a number of unique identifiers are needed until the request is cancelled or until the yearly rate for each of the number of unique identifiers is exceeded. For example, in an embodiment, a request provides that a block of twenty-four IPv4 addresses are wanted on a monthly basis for as long as the total monthly cost does not exceed $150. In this way, a request may continue indefinitely until one or more criteria are met. In some embodiments, a request may continue even after one or more criteria have not been met. For example, in an embodiment, a request indicates that ten IPv4 addresses are wanted on a daily basis whenever the total daily price is less than $10. In this embodiment, on days where the spot price for the ten IPv4 addresses are less than $10 then the requestor may receive access to the ten IPv4 addresses and is charged the spot price for the ten IPv4 addresses. Likewise, in this embodiment, on days when the spot price for the ten IPv4 addresses is $10 or greater, the requestor may not get access to the IPv4 addresses and is not charged.","In an embodiment, a request indicates whether or not the request should automatically renew. A request, for instance, may specify that a request should automatically renew if the spot price at the time of renewal is below a maximum price specified in the request. For example, a request may provide that four telephone numbers are wanted for a one year term with a maximum price of $200. The request may further indicate that the four telephone numbers should automatically be renewed for another year if the spot price at the time of renewal is $200 or less. A request may provide that the request should automatically renew at the current spot price at the time of renewal. For example, in the embodiment discussed above, the request may indicate that the four telephone numbers should automatically renew at the prevailing spot price at the time of renewal.","As another example, a request may indicate that the request should automatically renew if the current spot price is below a maximum renewal price at the time of renewal. In an embodiment, a maximum renewal price is a specified dollar amount. In another embodiment, a maximum renewal price is a percentage of another price, such as a maximum price, provided in the request. For example, in an embodiment, a request provides a maximum price of $150 for a number of unique identifiers for a specified period of time and further provides that if the spot price is within 125% of the maximum price specified in the request at the time of renewal then the request should automatically renew. A request may indicate an initial period of time and provide that a renewal time period should be a different period of time. For example, in an embodiment, a request provides that an IPv6 address is wanted for one year and, at the end of that year, should automatically renew at the current spot price for the request but in monthly increments.","In an embodiment, a request may indicate a garbage traffic threshold for one or more unique identifiers. A garbage traffic threshold can include any number of factors or any combination of factors. For example, in an embodiment a garbage traffic threshold is based at least in part on the last time the unique identifier was used. Thus, in an embodiment, the longer a unique identifier has not been used, the lower the unique identifier's garbage traffic value. In another embodiment, a garbage traffic threshold may be based at least in part on the amount of traffic that the unique identifier receives when not assigned to a particular requestor. For example, a telephone number that receives an average of ten calls each day when not assigned to a requestor may have a higher garbage traffic value than a telephone number that receives an average of three calls each day when not assigned to a particular value.","A unique identifier's garbage traffic value may change over time as factors related to the garbage value changes. For example, if a telephone number initially has a garbage traffic value based on an average of ten calls per day when not assigned to a requestor, the garbage traffic value may be reduced if the average number of calls per day reduces to five calls per day. Thus, in embodiments, a garbage traffic value may be based on the number of hits, calls, or otherwise that a unique identifier receives when not assigned to a requestor.","In an embodiment, a garbage traffic value may be based on a historical number of accesses. For example, a garbage traffic value may be based on how many times traffic was sent to the unique identifier over a given time period. In another embodiment, a garbage traffic value may be based on the amount of data that has been sent to the unique identifier in a period of time. In embodiments, a garbage traffic value may be based on a combination of factors described herein or other factors, or both.","In embodiments, fewer or additional criteria may be included in a request. A request may include any combination of factors described herein or any combination of additional factors, or both. In embodiments, the complexity of a request may vary. For example, in an embodiment, a request provides that one IPv4 address is wanted. In another embodiment, a request states that three blocks of IPv4 addresses, each block having 24 IPv4 addresses, is wanted. Furthermore, this request provides that the requestor wants to lease the three blocks of IPv4 addresses and pay a total maximum price of $200 for a six-month term. In addition, the request provides that the request should automatically renew for one-month periods as long as the monthly price is less than $50. One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that there are numerous combinations of criteria that can be included in a request and that the complexity of a request may vary significantly.","In embodiments, a request can be in any number of formats or written in any number of languages. A request may be written in a declarative language such as a tag-based language. A request may be written in a procedural language. A request can be written in a combination of declarative languages, procedural languages, or both. In various embodiments, a request may be in one or more of the following languages, including but not limited to: ActionScript\u00ae, ASP, C, C++, HTML, JAVA, JavaScript, JSP, JSON, MXML, PHP, SOAP, XML, or XSLT. Furthermore, a request may be stored in one or more text files. In embodiments, a request may be made through one or more application programming interfaces (APIs). In embodiments, a request may be stored in one or more data stores. A request may be in an archive or compressed format, or both, such as JAR, ZIP, RAR, ISO, or TAR. A combination of languages, formats, and\/or data stores may be used to define a request according to various embodiments.","Referring back to , after receiving a request , the method  proceeds to block . In block  a determination is made as to whether additional information is needed from the requesting device. If it is determined that additional information is needed, then the method  proceeds to block . Otherwise, the method  proceeds to block .","For example, as discussed above, in an embodiment the application server  receives a request from the client device  and the request indicates that the requestor wants to lease ten IPv4 addresses for one week. In an embodiment, the request may be sent from the client device  to the application server  via an application programming interface (API) call. A determination may then be made as to whether additional information is needed. In an embodiment, if the API call does not contain the necessary parameters or otherwise is incorrect, then the request fails. In one embodiment, if a request fails a notification indicating that the request is incomplete or inaccurate is provided to the device sending the request. In an embodiment, the application server  may determine that additional information is needed because the request did not provide a username and password. Thus, according to the method  shown in , the method  proceeds to block .","A determination as to whether additional information is needed can be based on any number of factors. A determination as to whether additional information is needed may be based at least in part on the information received in the request. For example, a request may be based on an identification of the electronic device making the request. In an embodiment, additional information may be required if the electronic device has been placed on a watch list. In such an embodiment, the receiving device may want additional information further proving the identity of the device or the requestor.","In an embodiment, a determination as to whether additional information is needed may be based at least in part on an identification of the party making a request (i.e. the requestor). For example, if a request does not contain a requestor's name, then it may be determined that additional information is needed. In an embodiment, if a request includes a payment method that has a billing address that does not correspond with the billing address provided in the request, it may be determined that additional information is needed. Likewise, if an account number provided in a request does not exist or if the account number does not match with the requestor's name, then it may be determined that additional information is needed. In embodiments, authentication information, such as a username and a password, must be included in a request and must be correct; otherwise, it may be determined that additional information is needed. In an embodiment, a unique identification number that identifies the party making a request must be provided or it may be determined that additional information is needed.","In an embodiment, it may be determined that additional information is needed if a request does not provide sufficient payment information or if a request provides incorrect payment information. The payment information may be verified to confirm that the payment information provided in the request is valid. In an embodiment, one or more payment methods may be preauthorized. If one or more payment methods are unable to be preauthorized or if a payment method is invalid, then it may be determined that additional information is needed. Additional information may also be needed if a pre-funded balance is below a threshold value. Furthermore, in an embodiment, additional information may be needed if a request indicates that payments should be billed but the account has not been authorized for billing.","In embodiments, it may be determined that additional information is needed if a request fails to provide sufficient pricing information. For example, in an embodiment, additional information may be needed if a maximum price is not specified in a request. In another embodiment, additional information may be needed if a price per unique identifier is not provided in a request.","In an embodiment, it may be determined that additional information is needed if a request fails to provide a number of unique identifiers that is wanted by the requestor or a third-party for which the requestor is making a request. In another embodiment, it may be determined that additional information is needed if a type of unique identifier is not specified in a request. Furthermore, in embodiments, it may be determined that additional information is needed if a request does not indicate whether a requestor wishes to lease or purchase one or more unique identifiers.","In some embodiments, it may be determined that additional information is needed if a request does not indicate a time frame that one or more unique identifiers needs to be leased. In another embodiment, it may be determined that additional information is needed if a request does not specify whether a request should automatically renew. In an embodiment, it may be determined that additional information is needed if a garbage traffic threshold for one or more unique identifiers indicates is not indicated in a request.","In embodiments, a determination as to whether additional information is needed may be based on fewer or additional criteria that can be included in a request. A determination as to whether additional information is needed may be based on any combination of factors described herein or any combination of additional factors, or both.","One or more default values may be assigned to criteria according to various embodiments and used in determining whether additional information is needed. If a request does not contain a needed parameter, then a default value may be assigned for this parameter.","For example, in an embodiment a request does not contain a quantity of unique identifiers that the requestor wishes to lease; thus, a default value of one is assigned to the quantity parameter. A default value can be assigned to one or more of the criteria discussed above or additional criteria. For example, in an embodiment, a request contains a username, a password, and a maximum price. In such an embodiment, a default value of one block of twenty-four may be assigned to the quantity parameter, a default value of IPv4 addresses may be assigned to the type of unique identifiers parameter, a default value of lease may be assigned to a purchase or lease parameter, and a default value of one day may be assigned to a timing parameter.","In embodiments, one or more default values may be based at least in part on historical information and used in determining whether additional information is needed. A default value may be based at least in part on previous requests associated with a plurality of accounts. For example, in an embodiment, a default quantity value may be determined based on the average quantity specified in previous requests from any number of accounts. A default value may be determined based at least in part on previous requests associated with a particular account. For example, a default quantity value may be determined based on the quantities historically requested in previous requests associated with an account. A default value may be based on one or more default settings previously provided by a requestor. For example, in an embodiment, a requestor can specify a default quantity that should be included in a request that does not contain a quantity.","Multiple default values may be determined for a request according to various embodiments. For example, in an embodiment, a requestor previously determined that a default quantity should be ten unique identifiers and that a default type should be IPv4 addresses. Thus, in this embodiment, if a request is received from this requestor that includes a maximum price but does specify a quantity or type of unique identifier, then the request may be processed based at least in part on the maximum price specified in the request and the default values for ten IPv4 addresses. Therefore, in an embodiment that requires a request to have a maximum price and a quantity, additional information may not be needed because the default values provide information regarding the quantity.","Referring back to , after making a determination as to whether additional information is needed from the requesting device , the method  proceeds to either block  or block . If it is determined that additional information is needed, then the method  proceeds to block ; otherwise, the method  proceeds to block .","In block , a request for additional information is sent to the requesting device. For example, in the embodiment discussed above regarding the request to lease ten IPv4 addresses for one week, it was determined that additional information was required because the request did not provide a username and password. Thus, in this embodiment, the application server  requests additional information from the client device .","Once a request for additional information has been sent , the electronic device sending the request for additional information waits for a response . For example, in the environment previously discussed above in connection with , the application server  waits for a response from the client device .","Returning to , once a response is received , the method proceeds to block  where a determination is again made as to whether additional information is needed. If it is determined that additional information is needed, then the method  proceeds to block ; otherwise, the method  proceeds to block . For example, in the embodiment discussed above, the application server  received a username and password (additional information)  in response to the request for additional information . In this embodiment, the provided username and password may need to be verified in order to determine whether additional information is needed . For example, in an embodiment, it may be determined that the username and password is a valid username and password associated with an active account; thus, the method proceeds to block .","In block , a determination is made as to whether unique identifiers are available or whether other offers are available, or both. In embodiments, if it is determined that unique identifiers are available, then the method  proceeds to block . In other embodiments, if it is determined that unique identifiers are available and another offer is also available, then the method  proceeds to block . In an embodiment, if a unique identifier is not available then the method  proceeds to block . Thus, in various embodiments, the method  may proceed to either block  or block  based at least in part on what is determined in block .","For example, as discussed above, in an embodiment the application server  receives a request from the client device  to lease ten IPv4 addresses for one week. In this embodiment, once a determination is made that additional information is not needed , the application server  determines whether unique identifiers having the criteria specified in the request are available . For example, the application server  may query data store  to determine whether ten IPv4 addresses are available to be leased for the next week. If at least ten IPv4 addresses are available, then a spot price is determined . If at least ten IPv4 addresses are not available, then alternative offers that are available are provided . In an embodiment, if one or more offers are available, then one or more of these offers may be provided .","In another embodiment, the application server  may query data store  to determine whether an offer should be presented to the requestor. For example, in an embodiment, the application server  may query data store  to determine that twenty IPv4 addresses are available to be leased for the next week. In another embodiment, the application server  may query data store  to determine that a promotional price can be offered on ten IPv4 addresses that are leased for at least a month. If it is determined that one or more offers are available, then at least one of the offers may be provided to the requestor .","An offer may be presented to an organization that manages units of an electronic resource, such as a resource provider. For example, an offer can include a presentation to a resource provider from the bidder that the resource provider can accept or reject. The offer may be related to a request from a bidder. In one embodiment, an offer includes electronic resources that is similar to the requested electronic resources but one or more of the criteria specified in the request varies. For example, if a request indicates that a bidder wants an IP address for a month, then the bidder may make an offer to the resource provider for a year-long agreement. An offer may be associated with a lower price per term than specified in a request. For example, if a request indicates that a bidder is willing to pay $10 for a one month allocation of an electronic resource, then the bidder may make an offer to the resource provider for a three month allocation of the electronic resource for a total price of $20 which is less than $10 per month. An offer may be based on electronic resources that are available. For example, if a request indicates that a bidder wants a contiguous block of 256 IPv4 addresses and a contiguous block of 256 IPv4 addresses is not available, then the bidder may make an offer to the resource provider for two contiguous blocks of 128 IPv4 addresses that are available. Other variations are within the scope of this disclosure.","Any number of factors may be used to determine whether unique identifiers are available or whether additional offers should be presented. One or more factors may be based at least in part on information received in the request. For example, if a maximum price per unique identifier and a quantity of unique identifiers were specified in a request, then the detei inination as to whether unique identifiers are available may include determining whether at least the specifiedquantity of unique identifiers are available for price less than or equal to the maximum price. In another embodiment, if a type of unique identifier and a quantity of unique identifiers were specified in a request, then the determination as to whether unique identifiers are available includes determining whether at least the specified quantity of that type of unique identifier are available. For example, if a request provides that four IPv4 addresses are needed, then the determination may include determining whether at least four IPv4 addresses are available.","In embodiments where a request or default value specifies that at least two unique identifiers should be contiguous, a determination as to whether unique identifiers are available may include determining whether at least two unique identifiers that are contiguous are available. For example, in an embodiment, a request provides that three telephone numbers are wanted and that the telephone numbers need to end in contiguous digits. In this embodiment, if the only telephone numbers available ended in \u201c15\u201d, \u201c16\u201d, and \u201c18\u201d, then it may be determined that the unique identifiers are not available. If, on the other hand, telephone numbers having digits ending in \u201c14\u201d, \u201c15\u201d, and \u201c16\u201d are available, then it may be determined that the unique identifiers are available.","In an embodiment where a request or default value provides that a portion of at least one unique identifier should have a certain value, a determination as to whether unique identifiers are available may include determining whether at least one unique identifier has the portion of the identifier that corresponds with the request. For example, in an embodiment where a request provides that a telephone number needs to have an area code of \u201c202\u201d, a determination as to whether unique identifiers are available can include querying one or more databases to determine whether a telephone number having a \u201c202\u201d area code is available.","If a request or default value indicates that a requestor wishes to purchase one or more unique identifiers, then a determination as to whether unique identifiers are available may include determining whether one or more unique identifiers are available for purchase. In an embodiment, if a request or default value provides that a requestor wishes to lease one or more unique identifiers, then a determination as to whether unique identifiers are available may include determining whether one or more unique identifiers are offered for lease during a time frame specified in the request or in a default value.","In an embodiment, a garbage traffic threshold, such as described above, may be specified in a request. In such an embodiment, a determination as to whether unique identifiers are available may include determining whether one or more unique identifiers are available that have a garbage traffic value below the threshold specified in the request. For example, in an embodiment, a request provides that a unique identifier needs to have an average of less than fifty requests per day since becoming available and further provides that the unique identifier should not have been previously assigned in the last sixty days. In such an embodiment, any unique identifiers that have received, on average, fifty or more requests since becoming available may be considered unavailable according to the criteria specified in the search request. Similarly, any unique identifiers that are currently available but have previously been assigned in the past sixty days may be considered unavailable according to the criteria specified in the search request. Thus, such an embodiment, determining whether a unique identifier is available comprises querying one or more data stores to determine if a unique identifier is available that has not been previously assigned in the past sixty days and has not received, on average, fifty or more requests since becoming available.","In various embodiments, a determination as to whether unique identifiers are available may be based at least in part on one or more internal constraints. For example, in an embodiment, an internal constraint may be used to filter any unique identifiers that are currently available but have become available in the last thirty days. Such internal constraints may be useful for, among other things, providing a better customer experience because less unwanted traffic may be sent to a unique identifier that has not been used for a specified period of time. Thus, in an embodiment, an internal constraint may add additional criteria to a request that needs to be met in order for a unique identifier to be considered available.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0098","num":"0097"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["500","500","510","510"]},"As shown in , in an embodiment, one or more unique identifiers may be reserved for another's use . The owner of the IPv4 addresses may, for example, provide computing resources as a service to third parties, such as by allowing third parties to set up computer networks in data centers of the owner. IPv4 addresses may, therefore, be reserved for such third party use. Unique identifiers in this category  may also be considered unavailable for at least a period of time because they are reserved for another's use. For example, of the CIDR \/8 block, two million may be reserved for third-party use even though, at a given time only one million may be actually used by third parties.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0100","num":"0099"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["500","510","520","530"]},"As demonstrated by the various arrows in , the number of unique identifiers in one or more categories of unique identifiers may vary over time. For example, the number of unique identifiers reserved for an owner's use  may increase or decrease based on the demands of the owner. The owner may, for instance, use more and more IPv4 addresses as its operational systems grow in size and complexity. In this embodiment, as demand increases for an owner, unique identifiers reserved for other's use  or unique identifiers considered to be available , or both, may be moved into category . Similarly, as demand decreases for an owner, one or more unique identifiers in category  may be placed into category  or category , or both. In another embodiment, the number of unique identifiers reserved for other's use  may be increased or decreased for any number of reasons and, in response, one or more unique identifiers may be added to or removed from category  or category , or both. Thus, in embodiments, the proportionality of the number of unique identifiers considered available as compared to the total number of unique identifiers that a party owns or has access to may vary according to one or more internal constraints.","In one embodiment, the available unique identifiers  may be further divided into one or more subcategories. The available unique identifiers  may be divided into subcategories based on time. For example, in an embodiment, one subcategory may contain unique identifiers that are available for one month and another subcategory may contain unique identifiers that are available for one year. In another embodiment, one subcategory of available unique identifiers  may comprise CIDR \/24 blocks of IPv4 addresses, a second subcategory may contain CIDR \/27 blocks of IPv4 addresses, and a third subcategory may contain CIDR \/30 blocks of IPv4 addresses. In embodiments, the available unique identifiers  may be subdivided into additional categories based on any factor or set of factors disclosed herein. In an embodiment, multiple spot markets may exist for the available unique identifiers . For example, in embodiments, a spot market can exist for each subcategory of available unique identifiers.","As illustrated by the arrow intersecting the circumference of the circle enclosing the pie chart, the total number of unique identifiers may vary over time. For example, if a unique identifier is purchased by a third party, then the available number of unique identifiers in category  may be reduced. In an embodiment, an owner may acquire additional unique identifiers from a third party and, thus, the total number of unique identifiers shown in the pie chart  may change over time. In this embodiment, acquired unique identifiers may be placed in one or more categories.","In another embodiment, an internal constraint may override one or more criteria specified in a request. In other embodiments, a request may override one or more internal constraints. For example, an internal constraint may provide that a unique identifier needs to receive less than two hundred access attempts for the past seven days. In this embodiment, a request may include criteria specifying that a unique identifier needs to receive less than five hundred access attempts for the past seven days. According to an embodiment, this criteria specified in the request may be overridden by the internal constraint such that only unique identifiers having less than two hundred access attempts for the past seven days are considered available. In another embodiment, the criteria in the request may override the internal constraint such that unique identifiers having less than five hundred access attempts for the past seven days are considered available even though the internal constraint provides that only unique identifiers having less than two hundred access attempts for the past seven days should be considered available. Other internal constraints may include, but are not limited to, a number of calls or hits a unique identifier receives within a period of time, or an amount of data that has been sent to a unique identifier over a period of time. Numerous potential internal constraints are disclosed herein or will be apparent to one of skill in the art.","Referring back to , after a determination is made as to whether a unique identifier is available or whether additional offers are available, or both, the method  proceeds to either block  or block . In embodiments, if it is determined that unique identifiers are available, then the method  proceeds to block . In other embodiments, if it is determined that unique identifiers are available and another offer is also available, then the method  proceeds to block . In an embodiment, if a unique identifier is not available then the method  proceeds to block . Thus, in various embodiments, the method  may proceed to either block  or block  based at least in part on what is determined in block , as illustrated in the Figure.","In block , one or more alternative offers are presented. In an embodiment, one or more unique identifiers may be offered. For example, in the embodiment discussed above regarding the request to lease ten IPv4 addresses for one week, it may be determined that only seven of the ten requested IPv4 addresses are available. In an embodiment, the seven available IPv4 addresses are offered to the party making the initial request. Thus, in this embodiment, the application server  may send one or more alternative offers for the seven IPv4 addresses to the client device .","Any number of factors may be used to determine one or more alternative offers. One or more factors may be based at least in part on information received in the request. In some embodiments, an alternative offer may comprise all of the criteria specified in an initial request except for one criteria. For example, if a maximum price per unique identifier and a quantity of unique identifiers are specified in a request and the unique identifiers are unavailable, then an alternative offer for the quantity of unique identifiers at an increased maximum price per unique identifier may be offered. In an embodiment, if a maximum price per unique identifier and a quantity of unique identifiers are specified in a request and the unique identifiers are unavailable, then an alternative offer for a portion of the quantity of unique identifiers requested may be offered at the maximum price specified in the request. In other embodiments, an alternative offer may comprise one or more of the criteria specified in a request or in a default value.","In embodiments where a request or default value specifies that at least two unique identifiers should be contiguous and the unique identifiers are not available, an alternative offer may include a portion of the unique identifiers that are contiguous. For example, in an embodiment, a request provides that five telephone numbers are wanted and that the telephone numbers need to end with contiguous digits. In this embodiment, five telephone numbers meeting the criteria specified in the request may be unavailable. However, three telephone numbers that end with contiguous digits may be available and, in addition, two other telephone numbers may be available that are contiguous. In an embodiment, an alternative offer may be provided for the three telephone numbers that end with contiguous digits. In another embodiment, an alternative offer may be provided for the two telephone numbers that end with contiguous digits. In yet another embodiment, an alternative embodiment may be provided for both the three telephone numbers that end with contiguous digits and the two telephone numbers that end with contiguous digits. Likewise, where a request or default value provides that a portion of at least one unique identifier should have a certain value and a unique identifier is not available, an alternative offer may include an available unique identifier that has a portion of the unique identifier that is similar to the requested portion.","In an embodiment where a request or default value specifies that a requestor wishes to purchase one or more unique identifiers that are not available, an alternative offer may be provided. For example, in an embodiment, an alternative offer is provided with similar criteria that was initially requested but is available. In another embodiment, an alternative offer may be provided that offers the requested unique identifiers on one or more lease terms as opposed to the initial purchasing request. Similarly, in an embodiment where a requestor wishes to lease one or more unique identifiers that are not available, an alternative offer to purchase a unique identifier with similar characteristics may be offered.","In embodiments, a garbage traffic threshold may be specified in a request or by a default value and a unique identifier meeting the garbage traffic threshold may not be available.","In such an embodiment, an alternative offer may be provided for one or more unique identifiers that are available but have a different garbage traffic threshold. Numerous additional embodiments are disclosed here or will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art and, therefore, are within the scope of the present disclosure.","Referring back to , after a determination is made as to whether unique identifiers are available  or whether additional offers are available  or if one or more alternative offers are presented , or some combination thereof, the method  proceeds to block . In block  a spot price is determined.","For example, if a request includes a maximum price per unique identifier, then the spot price may necessarily be the same or lower than the maximum price per unique identifier specified in the request. Likewise, if a request includes a total maximum price, then the spot price may be the same or lower than the total maximum price specified in the request. For example, in the embodiment discussed above regarding the request to lease ten IPv4 addresses for one week, it was determined that only seven of the ten requested IPv4 addresses are available and an additional offer for the seven IPv4 addresses were presented to the requestor. In this embodiment, the requestor may want to lease the seven available IPv4 addresses and, thus, a spot price is determined . In this embodiment, the spot price is based on the length of time for the lease (one week) and the type of unique identifier (IPv4).","A spot price may be determined based at least in part on any number of criteria. In an embodiment, a spot price is based at least in part on the received request. For example, a spot price may be determined based on one or more of the following criteria received in a request or determined by a default value, including but not limited to: quantity of unique identifiers, type of unique identifiers, whether a portion of at least two unique identifiers should be contiguous, whether a portion of at least one unique identifier should have a certain value, whether a request is to lease or purchase a unique identifier, a time frame, whether or not a request should auto-renew, or a garbage traffic threshold. In embodiment, a spot price may be based at least in part on one or more internal or external market factors.","For example, in an embodiment, a spot price per unique identifier may decrease as the quantity of unique identifiers requested increase. In another embodiment, a spot price per unique identifier may increase as the quantity of unique identifiers increase. For example, if a request provides that twenty-four contiguous IPv4 addresses are needed the spot price per IPv4 address for twenty-four IPv4 addresses that are contiguous may be higher than a single IPv4 address. In another embodiment, a spot price for a request specifying a higher garbage traffic threshold may be lower than a spot price for a request specifying a lower garbage traffic threshold. For example, a request specifying that an IPv4 address that has not previously been used in the last thirty days is needed may have a lower spot price than a request specifying that an IPv4 address that has not previously been used in the last year is needed.","In embodiments, a spot price may be based at least in part on the number of available unique identifiers meeting criteria specified in a request or an alternative offer, or both. For example, if a request specifies that five unique identifiers are needed and it is determined that one thousand unique identifiers satisfying the criteria in the request are available, the spot price may be lower for this request than if a request specifies that five unique identifiers are needed and it is determined that twenty unique identifiers satisfying the criteria in the request are available. In another embodiment, a spot price may be based at least in part on the total number of unique identifiers that are currently being used and the maximum number of unique identifiers.","In other embodiments, a spot price may be based at least in part on historical information for other transactions. For example, if an IPv4 address was previously leased for one month for $25, then this information may be used, at least in part, to determine a price for the same or a similar request.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0118","num":"0117"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6"],"b":["600","600","610","610","620"]},"For example, a first bid may have a price for $5, a second bid may have a price of $8, and a third bid may have a price of $7 dollars. In this example, the second bid may be the determined highest bidder. After determining the highest bidder , the number of unique identifiers requested in the bid is determined . For example, in the embodiment discussed above, the first bid may be for two unique identifiers, the second bid may be for three unique identifiers and the third bid may be for four unique identifiers. In this embodiment, the determined number of unique identifiers may be three because the second bid was the highest bid and the bid requests three unique identifiers.","In embodiments, the highest bidder  may be determined based on any number of factors. In some embodiments discussed above, the highest bidder  is based on the highest bid price. A highest bidder  may be determined based on a number of unique identifiers. For example, in an embodiment, the highest bidder  may be the bidder requesting the largest number of IPv4 addresses. In another embodiment, the highest bidder  may be a bidder that best aligns with the available unique identifiers. For example, if a CIDR \/24 block of IPv4 addresses is available, then a bidder requesting a CIDR \/24 block may be considered a higher bidder than a bidder requesting a CIDR \/25 block because the bidder requesting the CIDR \/ aligns better with the available IPv4 addresses. In embodiments, the highest bidder  may be based on any number of factors disclosed herein relating to requests or determining whether unique identifiers are available, or both.","After determining the number of unique identifiers requested by the highest bidder , the determined number of unique identifiers  are subtracted from a pool of unique identifiers. The pool of unique identifiers may or may not be related to a plurality of unique identifiers considered available as discussed with respect to method . For example, referring now to , in an embodiment the pool of unique identifiers is selected from one or more unique identifiers reserved for other's use . Thus, in this embodiment, the number of available unique identifiers considered to be available  in method  based on one or more internal constraints may not be affected by the method  used to determine a spot price. In other embodiments, one or more of the unique identifiers in the pool of unique identifiers may also be considered available in method  until the unique identifier is subtracted from the pool of unique identifiers. With respect to the embodiment discussed above, the pool of unique identifiers may initially contain eight unique identifiers. In this embodiment, the three unique identifiers from the second bid may be subtracted to from the pool of unique identifiers at block .","After subtracting the unique identifiers at block , in an embodiment, the method  proceeds to determine whether there are any more unique identifiers available in the pool of unique identifiers and whether there are additional bids remaining . If there are unique identifiers available and additional bids, then the method  returns to block ; otherwise the method proceeds to block . The cycle between block  and block  can be repeated until either no bidders remain or no unique identifiers remain in the pool.","For example, in the embodiment discussed above, three unique identifiers may be subtracted from the initial pool of eight unique identifiers. Thus, five unique identifiers may remain in the pool of unique identifiers. In addition, in this embodiment, the first bid and the second bid still remain and so the method  returns to block . Then, it may be determined that the third bid is the next highest bid and that the third bid requests four unique identifiers. These four unique identifiers are then subtracted from the remaining pool of five unique identifiers.","In this embodiment, because at least one bid and unique identifier in the pool still exists, the method  returns to block . Here, it may be determined that the first bid is the highest bid ($5) remaining and that the first bid requests two unique identifiers. In block , however, only one unique identifier remains in the pool. Thus, the first bidder only receives one of the two requested unique identifiers. In this embodiment, the method  then proceeds to block .","In block , a spot price is determined. The spot price determined in block  may be based on any number of factors. In an embodiment, the spot price is equal to the maximum bid price of the last determined highest bidder in block . For example, in the embodiment, discussed above, the determined bid price  may be $5 per unique identifier. The determined spot price  may be a function of two or more bid prices. In an embodiment, the determined bid price is an average of the last highest determined bid price  and the next highest bid price that did not receive a unique identifier from the pool of unique identifiers. For example, in the embodiment discussed above, there may have been a fourth bid having a bid price of $4. In this embodiment, the spot price may be a function of the last determined bid price ($5) and the next highest bid price ($4). Thus, the spot price may be determined to be $4.50 per unique identifier. In other embodiments, the spot price may be based on any number of bid prices received in block . For example, in an embodiment, an average bid price of the bids obtained in block  may be used to determine a spot price. Additional embodiments or factors will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art.","Referring back to , after determining a spot price , the method proceeds to block . In block , one or more unique identifiers are managed. In an embodiment, access to the unique identifier is granted. For example, if a request is for a telephone number, then the requestor may be given access to the telephone number such that the requestor can make calls from the telephone number and receive calls to the telephone number.","In an embodiment, an address related to one or more unique identifiers may be updated on one or more electronic devices. For example,  illustrates a method  of managing unique identifiers according to an embodiment. The description of the method  shown in  will be made with respect to  which illustrate aspects of an example environment for implementing aspects in accordance with various embodiments. It should be noted, however, that the scope of the present disclosure is not limited to the explicit environment illustrated in  but in other environments, including variations of  not explicitly illustrated or described.","In , the method  begins by accessing a routing table at block . A routing table may be accessed in any number of ways. For example, in an embodiment, at least a portion of a routing table is obtained from a border gateway protocol (BGP) router or gateway such as gateway  shown in . A routing table or routing information related to a routing table may be accessed by querying one or more data stores. For example, referring to , data store  may contain routing information related to a routing table that can be accessed by the server  or the private gateway  among other devices. In one embodiment, routing information may be obtained from private gateway . In another embodiment, routing information may be obtained from the user gateway  such as through tunnel connection  or . In some embodiments, routing information may be obtained from a device associated with network . For example, routing information may be obtained from a BGP-supported router for the ISP  through network .","After accessing the routing table , routing information is updated . In an embodiment, updating routing information  can include updating an address associated with one or more unique identifiers. In another embodiment, updating routing information  may include simultaneously updating a block of addresses associated with unique identifiers. For example, in an embodiment, updating routing information  includes updating one or more routes for a block of IPv4 addresses. In some embodiments, each unique identifier in a block of unique identifiers may be updated. In other embodiments, only unique identifiers in a block of unique identifiers that are a value that needs to be changed are updated. In an embodiment, updating routing information  may include updating information stored in one or more data stores. For example, referring to , routing information may be updated in data store . In another embodiment, WHOIS or DNS information may be updated on server .","After updating the routing information , the updated routing information is broadcast . In an embodiment, broadcasting updating routing information includes pushing a preferred route for block of unique identifiers onto one or more routing tables. For example, a block of IPv4 addresses may be pushed onto one or more Internet routing tables maintained by an Internet routing device. Such Internet routing devices may be used to identify network destinations for other devices involved in routing network traffic. For example, in an embodiment, such an Internet routing device may be a BGP router that advertises BGP routes for IPv4 addresses to other BGP routers. In some embodiments, updated routing information may be broadcast or otherwise sent to routing tables maintained by one or more third parties. In an embodiment, at least a portion of a routing table broadcast to a BGP-enabled router or a gateway such as gateway  shown in .

One or more unique identifiers may be determined in any number of ways as disclosed herein.  disclose various embodiments in which one or more unique identifiers can be determined for a customer. Other variations are within the scope of this disclosure. For example, referring to , a customer associated with user network  may submit a request for a CIDR \/24 block of IPv4 addresses.","In this embodiment, a determination may be made that the customer should receive an available CIDR \/24 block of IPv4 addresses.","Once one or more unique identifiers have been determined , the method  proceeds to block . In block , one or more unique identifiers are allocated to the customer. Allocating one or more unique identifiers may be performed in any number of ways.","In an embodiment, a data store is updated to reflect that the one or more unique identifiers have been allocated to the customer. For example, referring to , the data store  may be updated to reflect that the customer has access to the unique identifiers. In another embodiment, the unique identifiers are IP addresses and server  comprises a WHOIS server or a DNS server. In this embodiment, WHOIS records, DNS information, or other information may be updated in the data store  and\/or on server  to reflect that the customer is associated with the IP addresses.","In one embodiment, a block of unique identifiers, such as a block of IPv4 addresses may be allocated to a customer. In this embodiment, another block of IPv4 addresses at least as large as and including the block of IPv4 addresses to be allocated to the customer may be determined. For example, a CIDR \/24 block of IPv4 addresses may be requested by a customer and a CIDR \/24 block of IPv4 addresses may be determined to be allocated to the customer. In this example, a CIDR \/16 block of IPv4 addresses that includes the CIDR \/24 block of IPv4 addresses may be determined. The CIDR \/24 block of IPv4 addresses may be owned or managed by an organization. The organization may send a request to a regional internet registry (RIR), such as the American Registry for Internet Number (ARIN), for the CIDR \/16 block of IPv4 addresses to be assigned to a WHOIS server associated with the organization. In an embodiment, such a request may allow the organization to update records related to the CIDR\/16 block of IPv4 without further involving the RIR. For example, the organization may be able to update records for the CIDR \/16 block of IPv4 internally such as through a WHOIS server and\/or a data store. Thus, referring to , server  may comprise a WHOIS server that contains information related to the CIDR \/16 block. Data store  may contain information related to the CIDR \/16 block. In an embodiment, records related to the CIDR \/16 block may be updated on the server  and\/or data store . For example, records related to the CIDR \/24 block of IPv4 addresses may be updated to reflect that the addresses have been allocated to the customer.","In one embodiment, a block of unique identifiers, such as a block of IPv4 addresses, that is at least as large as a block of unique identifiers to be allocated to a customer may have previously been delegated to a WHOIS server of an organization associated with the blocks of IPv4 addresses. In this embodiment, the organization may be able to update records related to the blocks of IPv4 addresses without sending a request to an RIR. For example, a CIDR \/24 block of IPv4 addresses may need to be allocated to a customer and a CIDR \/16 block of IPv4 addresses that includes the CIDR \/24 block of IPv4 addresses may already be delegated to a WHOIS server of the organization. In this embodiment, the organization can update records for the CIDR \/16 block without sending a request to the RIR. For example, referring to , server  may comprise a WHOIS server to which the CIDR \/16 block of IPv4 addresses have been delegated. In this embodiment, records stored on the WHOIS server  and\/or in the data store  may be updated to reflect that the customer has been allocated the CIDR \/24 block of IP addresses.","In an embodiment, allocating one or more unique identifiers to a customer , can include granting the customer permission to use the one or more unique identifiers. For example, in an embodiment, a data store may contain various permissions that customers have been granted for unique identifiers. For example, referring to , data store  may contain the unique identifiers for which a customer has been granted permission. In this embodiment, a customer may be able to send a request to server  and in response may receive a list of unique identifiers that the customer has permission to use. In another embodiment, the customer may be granted a document, paper or digital certificate, or other notification that provides proof or otherwise indicates that the customer has been granted permission to use one or more unique identifiers.","In embodiments, the organization or the customer, or both, may contact a third-party that announces information related to the one or more unique identifiers allocated to a customer. For example, in one embodiment, a customer may be allocated a CIDR \/16 block of IPv4 addresses. In this embodiment, the organization allocating the block to the customer or the customer may contact an ISP associated with the customer to announce information related to the block of addresses. The ISP may be requested by the organization or the customer to announce the CIDR \/16 block of IPv4 addresses using an ASN associated with the ISP. For example, the ISP may announce the CIDR \/16 block of IPv4 addresses allocated to the customer by the organization from a BGP-enabled router using an ASN associated with the ISP. In embodiments, the ISP may be requested to stop announcing one or more unique identifiers when an organization determines that one or more unique identifiers should be deallocated from the customer. For example, in the embodiment discussed above, the organization may determine that a CIDR \/8 block of IPv4 addressees from the CIDR \/16 block of IPv4 addresses should be deallocated from the customer. In this embodiment, the organization or the customer may contact the ISP and request that the ISP stop announcing the CIDR \/8 block of IPv4 addresses that the organization determined should be deallocated from the customer.","Once one or more unique identifiers have been allocated to the customer , in embodiments, the method  proceeds to block . In block , access to at least one connection may be provided to the customer. In one embodiment, the at least one connection may be a VPN connection. For example, referring to , access may be provided to the customer for a VPN connection that comprises two tunnel connections , . Providing access to at least one connection may include providing the customer with information, such as a username and password, needed to complete a connection. In an embodiment, data store  may be updated to provide the customer access to one or more connections. In one embodiment, providing access to at least one connection can include configuring private gateway  to accept a connection from user gateway . In another embodiment, providing access to at least one connection includes providing information needed for the customer to configure user gateway  so that tunnel connection  and\/or tunnel connection  can be established. In embodiments, when the organization determines that one or more unique identifiers should be deallocated from the customer access to one or more connections may be revoked, terminated, or otherwise disconnected. For example, in an embodiment, tunnel connection  and tunnel connection  may be disconnected and private gateway  may be configured so that user gateway  cannot establish a connection to the private gateway  at least for the deallocated unique identifiers. In another embodiment, access to a connection may be revoked by updating data store  to reflect that the customer no longer has access to a connection related to the deallocated unique identifiers.","In embodiments, once access to at least one connection has been provided to the customer , the method  proceeds to block . In block , a request can be received from a device that is directed to a unique identifier allocated to the customer. For example, referring to , client device  may send a request, such as a hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) request, to an IP address allocated to a customer. In this embodiment, server  may receive the request through network .","Once a request has been received , the method  proceeds to block . In block , the request can be routed through the connection. For example, in the embodiment discussed above, the server  may receive the request. In one embodiment, the server  may determine that the request needs to be routed through a tunnel of a VPN connection such as tunnel connection  or tunnel connection . In another embodiment, the server  may query data store  to determine that the request needs to be routed through tunnel connection  or tunnel connection . In embodiments, the server  sends the request to the private gateway  which sends the request to the user gateway .","Once the request is routed through the connection , the method  proceeds to block . In block , a response may be received through the connection. For example, referring to , a device, such as another server or another desktop, in communication with user network  may determine that a response needs to be sent for the request. In this embodiment, the device may send the response to user gateway  which sends the response to private gateway . Private gateway , in turn, may send the response to server .","Once a response is received through the connection , the method  proceeds to block . In block , the response is routed to the device initially making the request. For example, if client device  initially sent an HTTP request to an IP address allocated to a customer by an organization, then server  may send the response received from the user network  to client device .","Referring back to , in various embodiments, one or more unique identifiers may be managed by charging the requestor the determined spot price for a number of the unique identifiers. In some embodiments, one or more unique identifiers may be managed by monitoring the current spot price for a request or an offer. For example, a request may specify that two IPv4 addresses are wanted each week and that the price of each IPv4 address is below a maximum price. In this embodiment, the request may be monitored and each week that the spot price for the request is below the maximum price, the requestor may be given access to the IPv4 address. Likewise, each week that the spot price for the request is at or above the maximum price, the requestor may no longer be given access to the IPv4 address. In addition, the IPv4 address may be determined to be available for another requestor to lease for a given period of time.","In embodiments, managing one or more unique identifiers may be performed automatically. For example, in the embodiment discussed above, access may be granted or removed at various times to one or more unique identifiers automatically.

For example,  is a flowchart directed to a method of managing a spot market for unique identifiers according to an embodiment. In the embodiment shown in , if a received request  contains sufficient information to determine a spot price , then the method  proceeds to block . However, in this embodiment, requests  that do not contain sufficient information to determine a spot price  may not be completely processed. For example, in an embodiment, if a request  does not contain sufficient information to determine a spot price , then a response may be sent to a user associated with the request indicating that the request is deficient. Furthermore, as shown in the method  in , a spot price  is determined and then a determination is made as to whether one or more unique identifiers are available  that meet the criteria specified in the request.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0148","num":"0147"},"figref":"FIG. 10","b":["1000","1002","1004","1006"]},"The illustrative environment includes at least one application server  and a data store .
