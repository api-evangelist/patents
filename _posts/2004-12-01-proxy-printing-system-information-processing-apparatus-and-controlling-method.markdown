title: Proxy printing system, information processing apparatus, and controlling method
abstract: In a proxy printing system, one print job is transmitted to a first one of printers connected over a network, and when a print failure occurs in the first printer, a second networked printer processes the print job to perform proxy printing. The system detects a failure of the first printer attempting to process the print job and issues a notification. In accordance with managed history information for the first printer, the proxy printing system detects whether a printer that has previously processed a print job as a proxy for the first printer exists out of the networked printers. The system issues a notification indicating at least one detected printer as a proxy destination candidate. The system performs control so that the printer is used to execute proxy print processing, and updates the history management table after the execution of the proxy print processing.

Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to display technology for a networked personal computer during manual proxying for proxy printing, when a print failure occurs in a printer device that has received a print instruction from a data supply source such as the computer.","2. Description of the Related Art","In recent years, typically, printer devices connected to a network are commonplace and many printer devices can be networked for use. In such an environment, when a print failure occurs in a printer device to which a print instruction is issued, the printer user typically wishes to use the print information as soon as possible, rather than removing the print failure at that point. In order to meet the demand, a \u201cproxy printing function\u201d has been achieved which outputs print job information left unprinted to another printer device.","For example, Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2003-271354 discloses a print processing apparatus that determines whether or not automatic proxy printing is designated and switches between automatic proxy printing and manual proxy printing. When it is determined that automatic proxy printing is designated, the print processing apparatus executes automatic proxy printing, and, otherwise, performs manual proxy printing.","With the \u201cproxy printing function\u201d described above, however, when a print failure occurs in a printer device to which a print instruction has been given, during selection of a printer device as a proxy print destination for manual proxy printing, all printer devices that are currently registered are displayed as candidates. Thus, there is a problem in that the user has to select the proxy print destination for each proxy printing operation. This is also true for the print processing apparatus disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2003-271354.","The present invention has been made to overcome the above problem, and provides a proxy printing system that can eliminate complicated user operations at a personal computer when a print failure occurs in a printer device at a proxy print destination.","A proxy printing system is provided that allows a personal computer to exclude the designation of a printer device that is determined as a proxy print destination but is unable to perform printing.","According to an aspect of the present invention, a proxy printing system that performs processing for, when a print job is transmitted to a first one of printers connected over a network and a print failure occurs in the first printer, causing a second one of the printers connected over the network to perform proxy printing on the print job. The proxy printing system includes: a failure detecting unit for detecting the failure of the first printer attempting to process the print job; a failure notifying unit for notifying of the failure of the first printer; a history managing unit for managing history of the first printer; and a proxy history detecting unit for detecting, out of the printers, a presence of at least one printer that has previously proxied the first printer to process a print job based on the history of the first printer managed by the history managing unit. The proxy printing system further includes: a proxy destination candidate notifying unit for issuing a notification indicating at least one of the printers detected by the proxy history detecting unit, as a proxy destination candidate; a proxy print processing controlling unit for performing control to execute proxy print processing using the printer detected by the proxy destination candidate notifying unit; and a history updating unit for updating the history managing unit after the proxy print processing is executed.","Other features and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the following description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which like reference characters designate the same or similar parts throughout the figures thereof.","A proxy printing system according to embodiments of the present invention is described below with reference to the attached drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"Referring to , personal computers (PCs)  and  and first, second, and third network printers , , and  are connected to a local area network (LAN) .","In the present embodiment, each of the PCs  and  functions as an output control apparatus and each of the network printers , , and  functions as a printer device. They are interconnected through the LAN . While only two PCs  and  are illustrated in , the printing system may include a plurality of PCs used for executing a procedure in the present embodiment by sharing or in combination.","While the present embodiment is described in conjunction with the example of the network printers , , and , a system for changing an output destination is not limited to what is described in the present embodiment. Thus, the system may be selected independently of a scheme for connecting the printer devices (e.g., network printers) and a host computer.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 2"],"b":["102","103","201","202","203","204","205","206","208","209","206","210","211","212","207"]},"With this configuration, when the apparatus is powered on, the CPU  initializes the apparatus in accordance with a boot program stored in the ROM  to load an OS (operating system) from the HDD . Thereafter, the CPU  can run various types of application programs and so on. Since the apparatus of the present embodiment is based on a general-purpose information processing apparatus (e.g., personal computer or the like), the programs are typically stored on the hard disk or the like. The programs may also be stored in the ROM . That is, the present invention does not restrict the storage medium for storing the programs.","Processing for Print Job",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"]},"Referring to , a client machine  (corresponding to the personal computer (PC) ) is a client machine on which a module for a print job control system runs.","Typically, in response to a print instruction, an application program  uses a graphics function of the OS to generate a series of drawing commands and passes the commands to a Windows\u00ae spooler  via a printer driver. The Windows\u00ae spooler  then takes a step for passing print job data to a port monitor selected by the user, so that the print job data is transmitted to a printer device.","In the present embodiment, the user pre-specifies a port monitor (hereinafter referred to as a \u201cjob control port monitor\u201d)  for the print job control system to give a print instruction. The application program  generates the series of drawing commands via the OS.","A PDL (page description language) printer driver  receives the drawing commands, generates print job data, and sends the print job data to the job control port monitor , rather than to a port monitor, via which print job data is transmitted to a printer device. The job control port monitor  transmits the print job data to a print service  (hereinafter referred to as a \u201cjob control print service\u201d) for the print job control system, rather than to the printer device . The job control print service  (which functions as a failure detecting unit in the present invention) has a function for managing a job\/device state.","Further, when the device and the client PC operate mutually in a peer-to-peer connection environment, the job control print service  manages information, such as a device state and a job state that is sent from the device. The job control print service  also has a function for issuing a predetermined command. This corresponds to a function for managing device information and job information for the printer devices .","A print manager (hereinafter referred to as a \u201cjob control print manager\u201d)  for the print job control system functions as a failure recognizing unit in the present invention and is implemented by a program that provides a user interface (UI). With the job control print manager , the user can check the state of a print job in the job control print service  and\/or can operate the print job.","The job control print manager  sends\/receives information to\/from the job control print service  via a software interface (API: application programming interface) of the job control print service . The job control print manager  also has a function for obtaining, as an event, state information of the external printer devices  managed by the job control print service . Types of event notifications may be, for example, a warning for low toner; error\/warning information notifications for a communication failure between the client and the device, memory shortage, and a full output tray; and a notification for normal mode information when returning from an error state to a normal state.","The job control print service  has a function for monitoring statuses, such as a power control state and failure information (paper jamming) state, while each device (i.e., each printer device) that is capable of communication via the network  executes printing.","A management console  (hereinafter referred to as a job control management console) for the print job control system can monitor the entire print job control system by exchanging information\/instructions with the job control print service  via a Job Control Server  using an API that allows access of software included in the job control print service .","Using a device information control module , the job control print service  communicates with each printer device , via Job Control Server  to obtain information regarding a print job in each printer device  and the operation state thereof and to operate each printer device .","Print Operation from Print Application ","Next, printing from the print application program  in the present embodiment is described.","The PDL printer driver  converts a series of drawing commands generated by the application program  into a PDL file that can be interpreted by each printer device .","As described above, the PDL file is transferred to the job control port monitor  via the Windows\u00ae spooler  (as indicated by arrow a in ) and is further transferred to the job control print service  (as indicated by arrow b in )","In accordance with the type of job control to be performed on the print job, the job control job control print service  controls an operation for the print job.","In the configuration shown in , when the job control print service  performs load distributed printing controls, the print job is transmitted to one of the printer devices  which becomes ready to receive it earlier than the others. Arrows c, d, e, and f indicate an example of how multiple print jobs are transmitted to the multiple printer devices  that can receive print jobs. Such load distributed printing control can be executed when the user specifies the job control port monitor  and a group printer driver  or the PDL printer driver  is used. The group printer driver  is provided by a group of PDL drivers . The group printer driver , however, is not directly relevant to the present invention, and thus details thereof are not described.","In a typical Windows\u00ae printing system, the PDL printer driver  converts a series of drawing commands generated by the application program  into a PDL file that can be interpreted by each printer device . As described above, the PDL file is transferred to a Windows\u00ae job control port monitor  via the Windows\u00ae spooler  (as indicated by arrow j in ) and is further transferred to the printer device . This processing is executed when the user specifies the job control port monitor , corresponding to the printer device , to give a print instruction, rather than specifying the job control port monitor .","Relationship Between Windows\u00ae Printing System and Print Job","Next, the relationship between a Windows\u00ae-based printing system and a print job in the print job control system is described, in conjunction with corresponding processing, in further detail with reference to .","The job control print service  in  corresponds to the print job control system in which a control program for the client machine  runs.","In the present embodiment, the job control print service  temporarily holds print job data and transmits the print job data to the printer device  corresponding to the PDL driver  selected by the application program .","Processing performed when the job control print service  performs load distributed printing, which is an added feature, is described next.","When the job control print service  performs load distributed printing, the user or the application program  issues a print job to a printer that has a load distributed printing feature, as described above.","The job control print service  receives, as a PDL file, the job data processed by the PDL driver  via the job control port monitor . Upon receiving the job data, the job control print service  temporarily holds the job data in its own printer queue . The job control print service  then forwards the job data to the printer device  corresponding to the printer queue  via a corresponding output port , or sorts the print data into a backup printer queue A or B and then forwards the job data to the corresponding printer device  via output port .","In such a printing system, the present invention is adapted to perform proxy processing when a print failure (i.e., error) occurs in a printer device to which a print job is issued. In particular, the present invention is directed to a printing system for performing control so as to perform manual proxying for predetermined errors (e.g., paper jamming and paper out). Thus, during the manual proxying, candidate printers that can perform proxy printing are displayed and the user selects a proxy destination therefrom. Individual embodiments hereinafter are based on this premise.","A first embodiment of the proxy printing system is described next. In the first embodiment, when a print failure occurs in a printer device to which a print job is transmitted, a printer device that was selected for the previous proxy printing is displayed during the selection of a proxy print destination.","First, an example of a screen for selection and confirmation of a proxy printer device during manual proxying is described with reference to . When a failure occurs in a printer device to which a print job is issued, a corresponding PC receives a failure notification from the printer device and displays the exemplary screen shown in . The exemplary display shown in  includes an indication of a printer driver  that has output a print job to a printer device encountering a print failure. In this case, \u201ciR C3200 186\u201d is displayed as the printer driver . A control field  indicates a printer driver that was designated as the previous proxy print destination.","The control field  also indicates a printer device (or a printer driver that outputs a print job thereto) in accordance with a determination rule of a proxy print destination. A proxy change button  is used to change a proxy printer device displayed in accordance with a determination rule. Pressing the proxy change button  causes a proxy printer device to be displayed out of all printer devices, so that the user can change the proxy printer device. The present invention does not particularly restrict the display method and the selection method for such processing and known schemes may be used.","A proxy print button  is used to give an instruction for proxy printing to the printer device displayed in the control field . Pressing the proxy print button  causes actual proxy print processing to be started. The illustrated screen, however, is merely an example, and thus the present invention is not particularly limited thereto. For example, the control field  may take a form that displays a proxy printer device determined according a rule, in a selected state, while all printer devices are displayed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 5","FIG. 6"],"b":"503"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},"This flow chart shows the logic of sequential processing involving a process in which a print failure occurs in a printer device to which a job is issued from a PC, a process in which a printer device used as the previous proxy print destination is displayed as a proxy destination when the PC recognizes the failure, and a process in which proxy print destination history information is stored when a user gives a print instruction. In practice, this processing is followed by proxy print processing. Failure notification obtaining processing, which is initial processing in the flow, and the proxy print processing, which follows the flow, are not directly relevant to the present invention, and thus descriptions thereof are not particularly given. Also, the present invention does not particularly restrict the failure notification obtaining processing and the proxy print processing and thus known processing may be used therefor.","Referring to , first, in step S, proxy print history for previous proxy printing exists for a printer device encountering a print failure. When the proxy print history exists, the process proceeds to step S. On the other hand, when no proxy print history exists, the process proceeds to step S, in which it is determined that no proxy printing has previously been performed. Whether a proxy printer has previously been designated is determined using, for example, a history information management table, such as the one shown in . The use of the history table shown in  allows determination as to whether or not a printer that has previously been designated as a proxy destination exists for a target printer. Alternatively, a table, such as the one shown in  may be used.","Since it is determined that no printer device is recommended as the current proxy print destination for this time, in step S, a printer device set by default is displayed as a candidate for the proxy printer device. As a screen for displaying the candidate, for example, the screen shown in  is used.","When the process proceeds from step S to step S, this means that it has been determined that proxy print history exists. Thus, in accordance with a proxy print destination determination rule of the present embodiment, the latest history (i.e., the previous value) of a print destination that has performed proxy printing for the printer device encountering a failure is determined as a printer device for proxy printing for this time.","Next, in step S, the proxy printer device determined in step S is displayed on the manual proxy instruction screen shown in .","In step S, a determination is made as to whether or not an \u201cinstruction for changing the proxy print destination\u201d is given with respect to the printer device displayed (in step S) as the proxy print destination in accordance with the determination rule of the present embodiment. When it is determined in step S that the instruction is given, processing for changing the proxy print destination is performed, and the process returns to step S, in which a printer device selected as the proxy print destination after the change is displayed. In this case, the manual proxy user interface shown in  is displayed. When the user selects a proxy printer, the process proceeds from step S to step S. In step S, proxy print processing is executed. The process in step S in the present invention is merely intended to display a proxy printer device. Thus, for some reason, when the user wishes to change what is displayed, an arbitrary change can be made thereto.","Referring to , a job waiting to be processed field  indicates the state of each job waiting to be processed. A list of proxy destination printers  indicates printers that are selectable as a proxy destination. A printer feature field  indicates features of a printer selected. An update button  is used to obtain the latest information about a printer that can act as a proxy destination. A proxy print button  is used to give an instruction for proxy printing. A continue button  is used to give an instruction for causing the current printer to continue processing for the job waiting to be processed. A stop button  is used to stop printing. With a printer, e.g. Printer A , in the field  being selected as a proxy destination, when the proxy print instruction button  is pressed, the selected printer performs processing for the proxy printing. When the continue button  is pressed, the printer that has attempted to process the print job and has encountered a failure continues the processing. In the latter case, for example, when the user clears the failure of the failed printer (e.g., by removing jammed paper and loading paper in the case of paper out), that printer can continue the print processing.","On the other hand, when it is determined in step S that no \u201cinstruction for changing the proxy print destination\u201d is given, i.e., \u201cproxy printing\u201d is to be performed, the process proceeds to step S. In step S, proxy print processing is performed. The proxy destination is, for example, the printer displayed in the field  shown in . Displayed in the field  is an example of a candidate default for the proxy print destination printer.","Subsequently, the process proceeds to step S. In step S, in response to the series of proxy print instructions and processing, proxy print information is stored as history. The proxy print information includes, at least, the printer device that failed, the printer device designated as the proxy print destination, and the date and time of processing. The proxy print information may include any other information, which is not limiting. Those pieces of information are stored as information for the determination (performed in step S) in subsequent proxy print processing.","The proxy print history can be expressed by a table as shown in . In , the \u201ctarget printer\u201d refers to a printer to which a job was issued and to which a failure occurred, and the \u201cprevious proxy destination printer\u201d refers to a printer that was designated as a proxy destination and that executed proxy processing when the previous error occurred. As shown, the history information in  is managed for each user. Although the proxy destinations in the previous case are managed in , the present invention is not limited thereto and thus proxy history that is earlier than the previous case can be stored.","In accordance with the processing described above, a proxy print destination in the first embodiment of the proxy printing system is automatically displayed using the previous value, during occurrence of a print failure.","As described above, according to the first embodiment, for proxy printing when a print failure occurs in a printer device to which a print job is issued, a printer device that was used for the previous proxy printing can be automatically displayed. This can eliminate complicated processing, e.g., user designation of a proxy destination.","A second embodiment of the proxy printing system of the present invention is described next. In the second embodiment, when a print failure occurs in a printer device to which a print job is issued, a printer device is selected according to a determination rule, using the frequency of designation, from previous proxy print destinations of a printer device encountering a print failure and is displayed as a proxy printer device during the designation of a proxy print destination.","When a printer device that is different from an ordinary one is designated so as to perform proxy printing on an ad hoc basis in the first embodiment, the arrangement in the second embodiment can prevent the printer device that was changed and used on the ad hoc basis from being designated in next proxy printing.","The present embodiment, however, does not particularly restrict a coefficient or the like for the frequency of designation. Further, the history may include any number of pieces of data, such as the latest 100 pieces of data. In this case, what is important is a determination rule using the frequency of designation.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0075","num":"0074"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},"The operation shown in  is initiated when an output end printer device fails to execute a print job.","Referring to , step S and steps S to S are analogous to those illustrated in , and thus the descriptions thereof are not given below. Step S shown in  is replaced with step S.","In step S, the proxy print history for the printer device that is currently encountering a failure is obtained, and a coefficient for the frequency of designation is used to determine, as the proxy printer device for this case, a printer device having the highest frequency of proxy printer device designation out of the obtained proxy print history. Thereafter, in step S, information about the determined proxy printer device is displayed.","In the second embodiment, as the history information management table, a table as shown in  may be used. In , for each user, proxy destination printers up to the third in decreasing order of the frequencies used as a proxy destination is shown with respect to each target printer. With regard to the frequency, the number of selections as a proxy is counted and is managed. In the second embodiment, the history table shown in  can also be used.","In accordance with the steps described above, a proxy printer device is determined through the use of the respective frequencies at which printers in the first embodiment of the proxy printing system are designated as a proxy print destination during occurrence of print failure, and automatic display processing is executed. As described above, according the second embodiment, when a printer device that is different from an ordinary one is designated so as to perform proxy printing on an ad hoc basis, it is possible to prevent the printer device that was changed and used on the ad hoc basis from being designated in next proxy printing, unlike a case in which the same proxy printer device designated last time is used. Thus, a printer device that issued a job can eliminate complicated processing, e.g., user designation, when performing proxy printing during the occurrence of a print failure.","A third embodiment of the proxy printing system is described next. In this embodiment, when a proxy printer device determined in accordance with each determination rule based on the proxy print history illustrated in the first and second embodiments cannot be used due to an error or the like or is already eliminated, the proxy printer device is excluded and a proxy printer device is determined again according to each determination rule. The error may be, for example, \u201cpaper out\u201d, \u201ctoner out\u201d, and \u201cpaper jam\u201d, and may be any event that results in a determination that the proxy print processing cannot be performed. The arrangement may be such that those types of errors can be pre-set. The arrangement may also be such that not just an error but also another cause can be used to determine that printing cannot be performed. Examples of such a cause include a case in which a printer device is operable but cannot perform printing immediately because of the high number of jobs, e.g., more than 100 jobs, that are stacked in the queue.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0082","num":"0081"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 9"]},"The operation shown in  is initiated when a failure occurs in an output end printer device during the execution of a printer job.","Since the processing in steps S and S to S (i.e., other than step S) shown in  are analogous to those in , descriptions thereof are not given below.","Thus, when a printer device that encounters a print failure has proxy print history in S, processing in step S is performed. In step S, processing for listing printer devices stored in the proxy print history is performed. When the process returns from step S described below, the candidate excluded this time is not used to update the list.","Next, in step S, a determination is made as to whether or not the number of candidates updated in step S is zero. Although at least one candidate exists initially, this determination is made based on the consideration that the number of candidates eventually becomes zero due to looping back via step S. If no candidate exists, the process proceeds to step S, in which it is determined that no candidate based on the proxy print destination determination rule is displayed this time.","On the other hand, when at least one candidate exits in step S, the process proceeds to step S. In step S, a proxy printer device is determined according to the determination rule described in the first or second embodiment.","Next, in step S, the current state of the printer device determined in step S is obtained and a determination is made as to whether or not the printer device is currently available. When it is determined that the printer device is available in step S, the process proceeds to processing for displaying the printer device determined in step S (the description of the subsequent processing is omitted).","On the other hand, when it is determined in step S that that printer device is not available, the process proceeds to step S.","In step S, processing for excluding the printer device is performed for the current proxy print processing, since the proxy printer device determined in step S was determined to be unavailable. Subsequently, the process returns to step S.","Steps S to S described above are repeated. When it is determined in step S that no candidate exists or it is determined in step S that the proxy printer device determined in step S is available, the process proceeds to the exit of the loop.","In accordance with the steps described above, the processing for creating and displaying the list of proxy print destination candidates is performed in the third embodiment of the proxy printing system.","As the history table for the history information management, either of the tables shown in  may be used.","As described above, according to the third embodiment, when proxy printing is performed during the occurrence of a print failure, a printer device that has issued a job can reliably use a printer device that is determined as a proxy printer device, in addition to the processing described in the first and second embodiments. This can achieve a desired manual proxy print processing without the user having to intentionally check the state of the printer device.","During proxy print processing performed when a print failure occurs in a printer device connected over a network, the proxy printing system having the above-described configuration according to the present invention can operate efficiently. That is, when a proxy destination printer device is designated thorough manual proxying, a proxy printer device can be presumed based on the user's operation history to allow a desired printer device to be displayed.","In addition, the current state information of each printer device may be included in the proxy printer device determination rule using the history. Such an arrangement can provide a proxy printing system that can display a proxy print destination printer device without the user having to recognize (determine) not only the frequency of use but also the availability of the displayed printer device.","The processing in each embodiment can be achieved by supplying a storage medium storing software program code for accomplishing each feature to the system or apparatus so that the computer (or the central processing unit (CPU) or a micro-processing unit (MPU)) of the system or apparatus reads and executes the program code. In such a case, the program code that is read from the storage medium achieves the features of the embodiments and the storage medium in which the program code is stored is also encompassed by the present invention. Examples of available recording media for supplying the program code include a floppy disk, hard disk, optical disk, magnetic optical disk, ROM (read only memory), CD-ROM (compact disk ROM), CD-R (compact disk-recordable), DVD-ROM (digital versatile disk ROM), magnetic tape, and nonvolatile memory card.","Further, not only is the program code that is read from the computer executed to achieve the features of each embodiment, but also an OS (operating system) or the like that is running on the computer may perform part or all of the actual processing in accordance with instructions of the program code to achieve the features of the embodiment.","Additionally, after the program code read from the recording medium is stored in a memory that is provided in a plug-in board inserted to the computer or an expansion unit connected to the computer, a CPU or the like that is provided in the plug-in board or the expansion unit may perform part or all of the actual processing in accordance with an instruction of the program code to achieve the features of each embodiment. Such an arrangement is also encompassed by the present invention.","The proxy printing system having the above-described configuration according to the present invention uses proxy print processing history to perform proxy print processing when a print failure occurs in a printer device connected over a network. This arrangement can automatically display a proxy print destination desired by the user during manual proxy designation. This arrangement, therefore, can provide a proxy printing system that can eliminate complicated processing, e.g., the user having to designate a proxy print destination every time.","As many apparently widely different embodiments of the present invention can be made without departing from the spirit and scope thereof, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the specific embodiments thereof except as defined in the appended claims.","This application claims priority from Japanese Patent Application No. 2003-405030 filed Dec. 3, 2003, which is hereby incorporated by reference herein."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 5"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 11"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
