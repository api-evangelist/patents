Clinical data and molecular biologic studies indicate that cancer is a multistep process that begins with minor preneoplastic changes, which may under certain conditions progress to neoplasia. The neoplastic lesion may evolve clonally and develop an increasing capacity for invasion, growth, metastasis, and heterogeneity, especially under conditions in which the neoplastic cells escape the host's immune surveillance. Roitt, I., Brostoff, J and Kale, D., 17.1-17.12 (3rd ed., Mosby, St. Louis, Mo., 1993).","Many types of cancers are associated with new blood vessel formation, a process known as angiogenesis. Several of the mechanisms involved in tumor-induced angiogenesis have been elucidated. The most direct of these mechanisms is the secretion by the tumor cells of cytokines with angiogenic properties, including tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1).","A variety of other diseases and disorders are also associated with, or characterized by, undesired angiogenesis. For example, enhanced or unregulated angiogenesis has been implicated in a number of diseases and medical conditions including, but not limited to, ocular neovascular diseases, choroidal neovascular diseases, retina neovascular diseases, rubeosis (neovascularization of the angle), viral diseases, genetic diseases, inflammatory diseases, allergic diseases, and autoimmune diseases. Examples of such diseases and conditions include, but are not limited to: diabetic retinopathy; retinopathy of prematurity; corneal graft rejection; neovascular glaucoma; retrolental fibroplasia; arthritis; and proliferative vitreoretinopathy.","Accordingly, compounds that can control angiogenesis or inhibit the production of certain cytokines, including TNF-\u03b1, may be useful in the treatment and prevention of various diseases and conditions.","(b) Methods of Treating Cancer","Current cancer therapy may involve surgery, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy and\/or radiation treatment to eradicate neoplastic cells in a patient (see, e.g., Stockdale, 1998, , vol. 3, Rubenstein and Federman, eds., Chapter 12, Section IV). Recently, cancer therapy could also involve biological therapy or immunotherapy. All of these approaches pose significant drawbacks for the patient. Surgery, for example, may be contraindicated due to the health or age of a patient or may be unacceptable to the patient.","Additionally, surgery may not completely remove neoplastic tissue. Radiation therapy is only effective when the neoplastic tissue exhibits a higher sensitivity to radiation than normal tissue. Radiation therapy can also often elicit serious side effects. Hormonal therapy is rarely given as a single agent. Although hormonal therapy can be effective, it is often used to prevent or delay recurrence of cancer after other treatments have removed the majority of cancer cells. Biological therapies and immunotherapies are limited in number and may produce side effects such as rashes or swellings, flu-like symptoms, including fever, chills and fatigue, digestive tract problems or allergic reactions.","With respect to chemotherapy, there are a variety of chemotherapeutic agents available for treatment of cancer. A majority of cancer chemotherapeutics act by inhibiting DNA synthesis, either directly, or indirectly by inhibiting the biosynthesis of deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate precursors, to prevent DNA replication and concomitant cell division. Gilman et al., Goodman and Gilman's: , Tenth Ed. (McGraw Hill, New York).","Despite availability of a variety of chemotherapeutic agents, chemotherapy has many drawbacks. Stockdale, , vol. 3, Rubenstein and Federman, eds., ch. 12, sect. 10, 1998. Almost all chemotherapeutic agents are toxic, and chemotherapy causes significant, and often dangerous side effects including severe nausea, bone marrow depression, and immunosuppression. Additionally, even with administration of combinations of chemotherapeutic agents, many tumor cells are resistant or develop resistance to the chemotherapeutic agents. In fact, those cells resistant to the particular chemotherapeutic agents used in the treatment protocol often prove to be resistant to other drugs, even if those agents act by different mechanism from those of the drugs used in the specific treatment. This phenomenon is referred to as pleiotropic drug or multidrug resistance. Because of the drug resistance, many cancers prove or become refractory to standard chemotherapeutic treatment protocols.","Other diseases or conditions associated with, or characterized by, undesired angiogenesis are also difficult to treat. However, some compounds such as protamine, hepain and steroids have been proposed to be useful in the treatment of certain specific diseases. Taylor et al., 297:307 (1982); Folkman et al., 221:719 (1983); and U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,001,116 and 4,994,443.","Still, there is a significant need for safe and effective methods of treating, preventing and managing cancer and other diseases and conditions, including for diseases that are refractory to standard treatments, such as surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy and hormonal therapy, while reducing or avoiding the toxicities and\/or side effects associated with the conventional therapies.","(c) Salts and Solid Forms","Compounds having a basic moiety can form various salts with acids. Different salts of a given compound may have different properties that affect the compound's stability, processability, in vivo performance as a pharmaceutical. The physical properties of certain salts of a given compound may also allow for or facilitate the isolation of optically or stereomerically pure forms of the compound.","Compounds may also exist in different solid forms. The selection of a solid form of a pharmaceutical compound may affect a variety of physical and chemical properties, which may provide benefits or drawbacks in processing, formulation, stability and bioavailability, among other important pharmaceutical characteristics. Potential pharmaceutical solids include crystalline solids and amorphous solids. Amorphous solids are characterized by a lack of long-range structural order, whereas crystalline solids are characterized by structural periodicity. The desired class of pharmaceutical solid depends upon the specific application; amorphous solids are sometimes selected on the basis of, e.g., an enhanced dissolution profile, while crystalline solids may be desirable for properties such as, e.g., physical or chemical stability (see, e.g., S. R. Vippagunta et al., ., (2001) 48:3-26; L. Yu, ., (2001) 48:27-42).","Whether crystalline or amorphous, potential solid forms of a pharmaceutical compound may include single-component and multiple-component solids. Single-component solids consist essentially of the pharmaceutical compound in the absence of other compounds. Variety among single-component crystalline materials may potentially arise from the phenomenon of polymorphism, wherein multiple three-dimensional arrangements exist for a particular pharmaceutical compound (see, e.g., S. R. Byrn et al., , (1999) SSCI, West Lafayette).","Additional diversity among the potential solid forms of a pharmaceutical compound may arise from the possibility of multiple-component solids. Crystalline solids comprising two or more ionic species are termed salts (see, e.g., , P. H. Stahl and C. G. Wermuth, Eds., (2002), Wiley, Weinheim). Additional types of multiple-component solids that may potentially offer other property improvements for a pharmaceutical compound or salt thereof include, e.g., hydrates, solvates, co-crystals and clathrates, among others (see, e.g., S. R. Byrn et al., , (1999) SSCI, West Lafayette). Moreover, multiple-component crystal forms may potentially be susceptible to polymorphism, wherein a given multiple-component composition may exist in more than one three-dimensional crystalline arrangement. The discovery of solid forms is of great importance in the development of a safe, effective, stable and marketable pharmaceutical compound.","Provided herein are salts and solid forms of the compound of formula (I) or a stereoisomer thereof, solid forms of the salts, and methods of synthesizing the salts and solid forms.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"61.64mm","wi":"68.41mm","file":"US09221788-20151229-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"In one embodiment, provided herein are salts and solid forms of the racemic compound of formula (I), solid forms of the salts, and methods of synthesizing the salts and solid forms.

In some embodiments, the solid form is an anhydrate, hydrate, or solvate. In some embodiments, the solvate is a tetrahydrofuran or dimethyl sulfoxide solvate.","As used herein and unless otherwise specified, the terms \u201csolid form\u201d and related terms refer to a physical form which is not predominantly in a liquid or a gaseous state. Solid forms may be crystalline, amorphous or mixtures thereof. In particular embodiments, solid forms may be liquid crystals.","In some embodiments, Compound (I-S) is a single component or multiple component solid form.

See, e.g., 21edition, Lippincott, Williams and Wilkins, Baltimore, Md. (2005); 23edition, 1843-1844 (1995).","As used herein and unless otherwise specified, the term \u201ccrystal forms\u201d and related terms herein refer to solid forms that are crystalline. Crystal forms include single-component crystal forms and multiple-component crystal forms, and include, but are not limited to, polymorphs, solvates, hydrates, and other molecular complexes, as well as salts, solvates of salts, hydrates of salts, other molecular complexes of salts, and polymorphs thereof. In certain embodiments, a crystal form of a substance may be substantially free of amorphous forms and\/or other crystal forms. In certain embodiments, a crystal form of a substance may contain less than about 1%, 2%, 3%, 4%, 5%, 6%, 7%, 8%, 9%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45% or 50% of one or more amorphous forms and\/or other crystal forms on a weight basis.

As used herein and unless otherwise specified, the terms \u201cpolymorphs,\u201d \u201cpolymorphic forms\u201d and related terms herein, refer to two or more crystal forms that consist essentially of the same molecule, molecules or ions. Like different crystal forms, different polymorphs may have different physical properties such as, for example, melting temperatures, heats of fusion, solubilities, dissolution rates and\/or vibrational spectra, as a result of the arrangement or conformation of the molecules and\/or ions in the crystal lattice. The differences in physical properties may affect pharmaceutical parameters such as storage stability, compressibility and density (important in formulation and product manufacturing), and dissolution rate (an important factor in bioavailability). Differences in stability can result from changes in chemical reactivity (e.g., differential oxidation, such that a dosage form discolors more rapidly when comprised of one polymorph than when comprised of another polymorph) or mechanical changes (e.g., tablets crumble on storage as a kinetically favored polymorph converts to a thermodynamically more stable polymorph) or both (e.g., tablets of one polymorph are more susceptible to breakdown at high humidity). As a result of solubility\/dissolution differences, in the extreme case, some solid-state transitions may result in lack of potency or, at the other extreme, toxicity. In addition, the physical properties may be important in processing (for example, one polymorph might be more likely to form solvates or might be difficult to filter and wash free of impurities, and particle shape and size distribution might be different between polymorphs).","As used herein and unless otherwise specified, the term \u201csolvate\u201d and \u201csolvated,\u201d refer to a crystal form of a substance which contains solvent. The term \u201chydrate\u201d and \u201chydrated\u201d refer to a solvate wherein the solvent comprises water. \u201cPolymorphs of solvates\u201d refers to the existence of more than one crystal form for a particular solvate composition. Similarly, \u201cpolymorphs of hydrates\u201d refers to the existence of more than one crystal form for a particular hydrate composition. The term \u201cdesolvated solvate,\u201d as used herein, refers to a crystal form of a substance which may be prepared by removing the solvent from a solvate.","As used herein and unless otherwise specified, the term \u201camorphous,\u201d \u201camorphous form,\u201d and related terms used herein, mean that the substance, component or product in question is not substantially crystalline as determined by X-ray diffraction. In particular, the term \u201camorphous form\u201d describes a disordered solid form, i.e., a solid form lacking long range crystalline order. In certain embodiments, an amorphous form of a substance may be substantially free of other amorphous forms and\/or crystal forms. In other embodiments, an amorphous form of a substance may contain less than about 1%, 2%, 3%, 4%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45% or 50% of one or more other amorphous forms and\/or crystal forms on a weight basis.

In certain embodiments, an amorphous form of a substance may be about 99%, 98%, 97%, 96%, 95%, 94%, 93%, 92%, 91% or 90% physically and\/or chemically pure.","Techniques for characterizing crystal forms and amorphous forms include, but are not limited to, thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X-ray powder diffractometry (XRPD), single-crystal X-ray diffractometry, vibrational spectroscopy, e.g., infrared (IR) and Raman spectroscopy, solid-state and solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, optical microscopy, hot stage optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), electron crystallography and quantitative analysis, particle size analysis (PSA), surface area analysis, solubility measurements, dissolution measurements, elemental analysis and Karl Fischer analysis. Characteristic unit cell parameters may be determined using one or more techniques such as, but not limited to, X-ray diffraction and neutron diffraction, including single-crystal diffraction and powder diffraction. Techniques useful for analyzing powder diffraction data include profile refinement, such as Rietveld refinement, which may be used, e.g., to analyze diffraction peaks associated with a single phase in a sample comprising more than one solid phase. Other methods useful for analyzing powder diffraction data include unit cell indexing, which allows one of skill in the art to determine unit cell parameters from a sample comprising crystalline powder.","As used herein and unless otherwise specified, the terms \u201cabout\u201d and \u201capproximately,\u201d when used in connection with a numeric value or a range of values which is provided to characterize a particular solid form, e.g., a specific temperature or temperature range, such as, for example, that describing a melting, dehydration, desolvation or glass transition temperature; a mass change, such as, for example, a mass change as a function of temperature or humidity; a solvent or water content, in terms of, for example, mass or a percentage; or a peak position, such as, for example, in analysis by IR or Raman spectroscopy or XRPD; indicate that the value or range of values may deviate to an extent deemed reasonable to one of ordinary skill in the art while still describing the particular solid form. For example, in particular embodiments, the terms \u201cabout\u201d and \u201capproximately,\u201d when used in this context, indicate that the numeric value or range of values may vary within 25%, 20%, 15%, 10%, 9%, 8%, 7%, 6%, 5%, 4%, 3%, 2%, 1.5%, 1%, 0.5%, or 0.25% of the recited value or range of values.

The compound can be administered repeatedly if necessary, for example, until the patient experiences stable disease or regression, or until the patient experiences disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. For example, stable disease for solid tumors generally means that the perpendicular diameter of measurable lesions has not increased by 25% or more from the last measurement. Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Guidelines, 92(3): 205-216 (2000).

Overall survival should be evaluated in randomized controlled studies. Demonstration of a statistically significant improvement in overall survival can be considered to be clinically significant if the toxicity profile is acceptable, and has often supported new drug approval.","Several endpoints are based on tumor assessments. These endpoints include disease free survival (DFS), objective response rate (ORR), time to progression (TTP), progression-free survival (PFS), and time-to-treatment failure (TTF). The collection and analysis of data on these time-dependent endpoints are based on indirect assessments, calculations, and estimates (e.g., tumor measurements).","Generally, \u201cdisease free survival\u201d (DFS) is defined as the time from randomization until recurrence of tumor or death from any cause. Although overall survival is a conventional endpoint for most adjuvant settings, DFS can be an important endpoint in situations where survival may be prolonged, making a survival endpoint impractical. DFS can be a surrogate for clinical benefit or it can provide direct evidence of clinical benefit. This determination is based on the magnitude of the effect, its risk-benefit relationship, and the disease setting. The definition of DFS can be complicated, particularly when deaths are noted without prior tumor progression documentation. These events can be scored either as disease recurrences or as censored events. Although all methods for statistical analysis of deaths have some limitations, considering all deaths (deaths from all causes) as recurrences can minimize bias. DFS can be overestimated using this definition, especially in patients who die after a long period without observation. Bias can be introduced if the frequency of long-term follow-up visits is dissimilar between the study arms or if dropouts are not random because of toxicity.","\u201cObjective response rate\u201d (ORR) is defined as the proportion of patients with tumor size reduction of a predefined amount and for a minimum time period. Response duration usually is measured from the time of initial response until documented tumor progression. Generally, the FDA has defined ORR as the sum of partial responses plus complete responses. When defined in this manner, ORR is a direct measure of drug antitumor activity, which can be evaluated in a single-arm study. If available, standardized criteria should be used to ascertain response. A variety of response criteria have been considered appropriate (e.g., RECIST criteria) (Therasse et al., (2000) 92: 205-16). The significance of ORR is assessed by its magnitude and duration, and the percentage of complete responses (no detectable evidence of tumor).","\u201cTime to progression\u201d (TTP) and \u201cprogression-free survival\u201d (PFS) have served as primary endpoints for drug approval. TTP is defined as the time from randomization until objective tumor progression; TTP does not include deaths. PFS is defined as the time from randomization until objective tumor progression or death. Compared with TTP, PFS is the preferred regulatory endpoint. PFS includes deaths and thus can be a better correlate to overall survival. PFS assumes patient deaths are randomly related to tumor progression. However, in situations where the majority of deaths are unrelated to cancer, TTP can be an acceptable endpoint.","As an endpoint to support drug approval, PFS can reflect tumor growth and be assessed before the determination of a survival benefit. Its determination is not confounded by subsequent therapy. For a given sample size, the magnitude of effect on PFS can be larger than the effect on overall survival. However, the formal validation of PFS as a surrogate for survival for the many different malignancies that exist can be difficult. Data are sometimes insufficient to allow a robust evaluation of the correlation between effects on survival and PFS. Cancer trials are often small, and proven survival benefits of existing drugs are generally modest. The role of PFS as an endpoint to support licensing approval varies in different cancer settings. Whether an improvement in PFS represents a direct clinical benefit or a surrogate for clinical benefit depends on the magnitude of the effect and the risk-benefit of the new treatment compared to available therapies.","\u201cTime-to-treatment failure\u201d (TTF) is defined as a composite endpoint measuring time from randomization to discontinuation of treatment for any reason, including disease progression, treatment toxicity, and death. TTF is not recommended as a regulatory endpoint for drug approval. TTF does not adequately distinguish efficacy from these additional variables. A regulatory endpoint should clearly distinguish the efficacy of the drug from toxicity, patient or physician withdrawal, or patient intolerance.","5.6 Second Active Agents","A salt or solid form provided herein can be combined with other pharmacologically active compounds (\u201csecond active agents\u201d) in methods and compositions provided herein.

The suitability of a particular route of administration employed for a particular active agent will depend on the active agent itself (e.g., whether it can be administered orally without decomposing prior to entering the blood stream) and the disease being treated. One of administration for compounds provided herein is oral. Routes of administration for the second active agents or ingredients are known to those of ordinary skill in the art. See, e.g., (60ed., 2006).","In one embodiment, the second active agent is administered intravenously or subcutaneously and once or twice daily in an amount of from about 1 to about 1000 mg, from about 5 to about 500 mg, from about 10 to about 350 mg, or from about 50 to about 200 mg. The specific amount of the second active agent will depend on the specific agent used, the type of disease being treated or managed, the severity and stage of disease, and the amount(s) of compounds provided herein and any optional additional active agents concurrently administered to the patient.","As discussed elsewhere herein, also encompassed is a method of reducing, treating and\/or preventing adverse or undesired effects associated with conventional therapy including, but not limited to, surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, hormonal therapy, biological therapy and immunotherapy. Salts and solid forms provided herein and other active ingredients can be administered to a patient prior to, during, or after the occurrence of the adverse effect associated with conventional therapy.","5.7 Cycling Therapy","In certain embodiments, the prophylactic or therapeutic agents provided herein are cyclically administered to a patient. Cycling therapy involves the administration of an active agent for a period of time, followed by a rest (i.e., discontinuation of the administration) for a period of time, and repeating this sequential administration. Cycling therapy can reduce the development of resistance to one or more of the therapies, avoid or reduce the side effects of one of the therapies, and\/or improve the efficacy of the treatment.","Consequently, in one embodiment, a salt or solid form provided herein is administered daily in a single or divided doses in a four to six week cycle with a rest period of about a week or two weeks. Cycling therapy further allows the frequency, number, and length of dosing cycles to be increased. Thus, another embodiment encompasses the administration of a compound provided herein for more cycles than are typical when it is administered alone. In yet another embodiment, a salt or solid form provided herein is administered for a greater number of cycles than would typically cause dose-limiting toxicity in a patient to whom a second active ingredient is not also being administered.","In one embodiment, a salt or solid form provided herein is administered daily and continuously for three or four weeks at a dose of from about 0.1 mg to about 500 mg per day, followed by a rest of one or two weeks. In other embodiments, the dose can be from about 1 mg to about 300 mg, from about 0.1 mg to about 150 mg, from about 1 mg to about 200 mg, from about 10 mg to about 100 mg, from about 0.1 mg to about 50 mg, from about 1 mg to about 50 mg, from about 10 mg to about 50 mg, from about 20 mg to about 30 mg, or from about 1 mg to about 20 mg, followed by a rest.","In one embodiment, a salt or solid form provided herein and a second active ingredient are administered orally, with administration of the compound provided herein occurring 30 to 60 minutes prior to the second active ingredient, during a cycle of four to six weeks. In another embodiment, the combination of a compound provided herein and a second active ingredient is administered by intravenous infusion over about 90 minutes every cycle.","Typically, the number of cycles during which the combination treatment is administered to a patient will be from about one to about 24 cycles, from about two to about 16 cycles, or from about four to about three cycles.","5.8 Pharmaceutical Compositions and Dosage Forms","Pharmaceutical compositions can be used in the preparation of individual, single unit dosage forms. Pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms provided herein comprise a salt or solid form provided herein. Pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms can further comprise one or more excipients.","Pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms provided herein can also comprise one or more additional active ingredients. Examples of optional second, or additional, active ingredients are disclosed above.","Single unit dosage forms provided herein are suitable for oral, mucosal (e.g., nasal, sublingual, vaginal, buccal, or rectal), parenteral (e.g., subcutaneous, intravenous, bolus injection, intramuscular, or intraarterial), topical (e.g., eye drops or other ophthalmic preparations), transdermal or transcutaneous administration to a patient. Examples of dosage forms include, but are not limited to: tablets; caplets; capsules, such as soft elastic gelatin capsules; cachets; troches; lozenges; dispersions; suppositories; powders; aerosols (e.g., nasal sprays or inhalers); gels; liquid dosage forms suitable for oral or mucosal administration to a patient, including suspensions (e.g., aqueous or non-aqueous liquid suspensions, oil-in-water emulsions, or a water-in-oil liquid emulsions), solutions, and elixirs; liquid dosage forms suitable for parenteral administration to a patient; eye drops or other ophthalmic preparations suitable for topical administration; and sterile solids (e.g., crystalline or amorphous solids) that can be reconstituted to provide liquid dosage forms suitable for parenteral administration to a patient.","The composition, shape, and type of dosage forms will typically vary depending on their use. For example, a dosage form used in the acute treatment of a disease may contain larger amounts of one or more of the active ingredients it comprises than a dosage form used in the chronic treatment of the same disease. Similarly, a parenteral dosage form may contain smaller amounts of one or more of the active ingredients it comprises than an oral dosage form used to treat the same disease. These and other ways in which specific dosage forms are used will vary from one another will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art. See, e.g., 20ed., Mack Publishing, Easton Pa. (2000).","In one embodiment, pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms comprise one or more excipients. Suitable excipients are well known to those skilled in the art of pharmacy, and non-limiting examples of suitable excipients are provided herein. Whether a particular excipient is suitable for incorporation into a pharmaceutical composition or dosage form depends on a variety of factors well known in the art including, but not limited to, the way in which the dosage form will be administered to a patient. For example, oral dosage forms such as tablets may contain excipients not suited for use in parenteral dosage forms. The suitability of a particular excipient may also depend on the specific active ingredients in the dosage form. For example, the decomposition of some active ingredients may be accelerated by some excipients such as lactose, or when exposed to water. Active ingredients that comprise primary or secondary amines are particularly susceptible to such accelerated decomposition. Consequently, provided are pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms that contain little, if any, lactose other mono- or di-saccharides. As used herein, the term \u201clactose-free\u201d means that the amount of lactose present, if any, is insufficient to substantially increase the degradation rate of an active ingredient.","Lactose-free compositions can comprise excipients that are well known in the art and are listed, for example, in the (USP) 25-NF20 (2002). In general, lactose-free compositions comprise active ingredients, a binder\/filler, and a lubricant in pharmaceutically compatible and pharmaceutically acceptable amounts. In one embodiment, lactose-free dosage forms comprise active ingredients, microcrystalline cellulose, pre-gelatinized starch, and magnesium stearate.","Also provided are anhydrous pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms comprising active ingredients, since water can facilitate the degradation of some compounds. For example, the addition of water (e.g., 5%) is widely accepted in the pharmaceutical arts as a means of simulating long-term storage in order to determine characteristics such as shelf-life or the stability of formulations over time. See, e.g., Jens T. Carstensen, & 2d. Ed., Marcel Dekker, NY, N.Y., 1995, pp. 379-80. In effect, water and heat accelerate the decomposition of some compounds. Thus, the effect of water on a formulation can be of great significance since moisture and\/or humidity are commonly encountered during manufacture, handling, packaging, storage, shipment, and use of formulations.","Anhydrous pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms can be prepared using anhydrous or low moisture containing ingredients and low moisture or low humidity conditions. Pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms that comprise lactose and at least one active ingredient that comprises a primary or secondary amine are anhydrous if substantial contact with moisture and\/or humidity during manufacturing, packaging, and\/or storage is expected.","An anhydrous pharmaceutical composition should be prepared and stored such that its anhydrous nature is maintained. Accordingly, anhydrous compositions are, in one embodiment, packaged using materials known to prevent exposure to water such that they can be included in suitable formulary kits. Examples of suitable packaging include, but are not limited to, hermetically sealed foils, plastics, unit dose containers (e.g., vials), blister packs, and strip packs.","Also provided are pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms that comprise one or more compounds that reduce the rate by which an active ingredient will decompose. Such compounds, which are referred to herein as \u201cstabilizers,\u201d include, but are not limited to, antioxidants such as ascorbic acid, pH buffers, or salt buffers.","Like the amounts and types of excipients, the amounts and specific types of active ingredients in a dosage form may differ depending on factors such as, but not limited to, the route by which it is to be administered to patients. In one embodiment, dosage forms comprise a compound provided herein in an amount of from about 0.10 to about 500 mg. In other embodiments, dosage forms comprise a compound provided herein in an amount of about 0.1, 1, 2, 5, 7.5, 10, 12.5, 15, 17.5, 20, 25, 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, or 500 mg.","In other embodiments, dosage forms comprise the second active ingredient in an amount of 1 to about 1000 mg, from about 5 to about 500 mg, from about 10 to about 350 mg, or from about 50 to about 200 mg. Of course, the specific amount of the second active agent will depend on the specific agent used, the diseases or disorders being treated or managed, and the amount(s) of a compound provided herein, and any optional additional active agents concurrently administered to the patient.","5.8.1 Oral Dosage Forms","Pharmaceutical compositions that are suitable for oral administration can be provided as discrete dosage forms, such as, but not limited to, tablets (e.g., chewable tablets), caplets, capsules, and liquids (e.g., flavored syrups). Such dosage forms contain predetermined amounts of active ingredients, and may be prepared by methods of pharmacy well known to those skilled in the art. See generally, 20th ed., Mack Publishing, Easton Pa. (2000).","Oral dosage forms provided herein are prepared by combining the active ingredients in an intimate admixture with at least one excipient according to conventional pharmaceutical compounding techniques. Excipients can take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration. For example, excipients suitable for use in oral liquid or aerosol dosage forms include, but are not limited to, water, glycols, oils, alcohols, flavoring agents, preservatives, and coloring agents. Examples of excipients suitable for use in solid oral dosage forms (e.g., powders, tablets, capsules, and caplets) include, but are not limited to, starches, sugars, micro-crystalline cellulose, diluents, granulating agents, lubricants, binders, and disintegrating agents.","In one embodiment, oral dosage forms are tablets or capsules, in which case solid excipients are employed. In another embodiment, tablets can be coated by standard aqueous or nonaqueous techniques. Such dosage forms can be prepared by any of the methods of pharmacy. In general, pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms are prepared by uniformly and intimately admixing the active ingredients with liquid carriers, finely divided solid carriers, or both, and then shaping the product into the desired presentation if necessary.","For example, a tablet can be prepared by compression or molding. Compressed tablets can be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active ingredients in a free-flowing form such as powder or granules, optionally mixed with an excipient. Molded tablets can be made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent.","Examples of excipients that can be used in oral dosage forms provided herein include, but are not limited to, binders, fillers, disintegrants, and lubricants. Binders suitable for use in pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms include, but are not limited to, corn starch, potato starch, or other starches, gelatin, natural and synthetic gums such as acacia, sodium alginate, alginic acid, other alginates, powdered tragacanth, guar gum, cellulose and its derivatives (e.g., ethyl cellulose, cellulose acetate, carboxymethyl cellulose calcium, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose), polyvinyl pyrrolidone, methyl cellulose, pre-gelatinized starch, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, (e.g., Nos. 2208, 2906, 2910), microcrystalline cellulose, and mixtures thereof.","Suitable forms of microcrystalline cellulose include, but are not limited to, the materials sold as AVICEL-PH-101, AVICEL-PH-103 AVICEL RC-581, AVICEL-PH-105 (available from FMC Corporation, American Viscose Division, Avicel Sales, Marcus Hook, Pa.), and mixtures thereof. An specific binder is a mixture of microcrystalline cellulose and sodium carboxymethyl cellulose sold as AVICEL RC-581. Suitable anhydrous or low moisture excipients or additives include AVICEL-PH-103\u2122 and Starch 1500 LM.","Examples of fillers suitable for use in the pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms provided herein include, but are not limited to, talc, calcium carbonate (e.g., granules or powder), microcrystalline cellulose, powdered cellulose, dextrates, kaolin, mannitol, silicic acid, sorbitol, starch, pre-gelatinized starch, and mixtures thereof. The binder or filler in pharmaceutical compositions is, in one embodiment, present in from about 50 to about 99 weight percent of the pharmaceutical composition or dosage form.","Disintegrants may be used in the compositions to provide tablets that disintegrate when exposed to an aqueous environment. Tablets that contain too much disintegrant may disintegrate in storage, while those that contain too little may not disintegrate at a desired rate or under the desired conditions. Thus, a sufficient amount of disintegrant that is neither too much nor too little to detrimentally alter the release of the active ingredients may be used to form solid oral dosage forms. The amount of disintegrant used varies based upon the type of formulation, and is readily discernible to those of ordinary skill in the art. In one embodiment, pharmaceutical compositions comprise from about 0.5 to about 15 weight percent of disintegrant, or from about 1 to about 5 weight percent of disintegrant.","Disintegrants that can be used in pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms include, but are not limited to, agar-agar, alginic acid, calcium carbonate, microcrystalline cellulose, croscarmellose sodium, crospovidone, polacrilin potassium, sodium starch glycolate, potato or tapioca starch, other starches, pre-gelatinized starch, other starches, clays, other algins, other celluloses, gums, and mixtures thereof.","Lubricants that can be used in pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms include, but are not limited to, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, mineral oil, light mineral oil, glycerin, sorbitol, mannitol, polyethylene glycol, other glycols, stearic acid, sodium lauryl sulfate, talc, hydrogenated vegetable oil (e.g., peanut oil, cottonseed oil, sunflower oil, sesame oil, olive oil, corn oil, and soybean oil), zinc stearate, ethyl oleate, ethyl laureate, agar, and mixtures thereof. Additional lubricants include, for example, a syloid silica gel (AEROSIL200, manufactured by W.R. Grace Co. of Baltimore, Md.), a coagulated aerosol of synthetic silica (marketed by Degussa Co. of Plano, Tex.), CAB-O-SIL (a pyrogenic silicon dioxide product sold by Cabot Co. of Boston, Mass.), and mixtures thereof. If used at all, lubricants may be used in an amount of less than about 1 weight percent of the pharmaceutical compositions or dosage forms into which they are incorporated.","In one embodiment, a solid oral dosage form comprises a salt or solid form provided herein, anhydrous lactose, microcrystalline cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, stearic acid, colloidal anhydrous silica, and gelatin.","5.8.2 Controlled Release Dosage Forms","Active ingredients such as the compounds, salts and solid forms provided herein can be administered by controlled release means or by delivery devices that are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Examples include, but are not limited to, those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,845,770; 3,916,899; 3,536,809; 3,598,123; and 4,008,719; 5,674,533; 5,059,595; 5,591,767; 5,120,548; 5,073,543; 5,639,476; 5,354,556; 5,639,480; 5,733,566; 5,739,108; 5,891,474; 5,922,356; 5,972,891; 5,980,945; 5,993,855; 6,045,830; 6,087,324; 6,113,943; 6,197,350; 6,248,363; 6,264,970; 6,267,981; 6,376,461; 6,419,961; 6,589,548; 6,613,358; 6,699,500 each of which is incorporated herein by reference. Such dosage forms can be used to provide slow or controlled release of one or more active ingredients using, for example, hydropropylmethyl cellulose, other polymer matrices, gels, permeable membranes, osmotic systems, multilayer coatings, microparticles, liposomes, microspheres, or a combination thereof to provide the desired release profile in varying proportions. Suitable controlled release formulations known to those of ordinary skill in the art, including those described herein, can be readily selected for use with the active ingredients provided herein. Thus, the compositions provided encompass single unit dosage forms suitable for oral administration such as, but not limited to, tablets, capsules, gelcaps, and caplets that are adapted for controlled release.","All controlled release pharmaceutical products have a common goal of improving drug therapy over that achieved by their non controlled counterparts. Ideally, the use of an optimally designed controlled release preparation in medical treatment is characterized by a minimum of drug substance being employed to cure or control the condition in a minimum amount of time. Advantages of controlled release formulations include extended activity of the drug, reduced dosage frequency, and increased subject compliance. In addition, controlled release formulations can be used to affect the time of onset of action or other characteristics, such as blood levels of the drug, and can thus affect the occurrence of side (e.g., adverse) effects.","Most controlled release formulations are designed to initially release an amount of drug (active ingredient) that promptly produces the desired therapeutic effect, and gradually and continually release of other amounts of drug to maintain this level of therapeutic or prophylactic effect over an extended period of time. In order to maintain this constant level of drug in the body, the drug must be released from the dosage form at a rate that will replace the amount of drug being metabolized and excreted from the body. Controlled release of an active ingredient can be stimulated by various conditions including, but not limited to, pH, temperature, enzymes, water, or other physiological conditions or compounds.","In certain embodiments, the drug may be administered using intravenous infusion, an implantable osmotic pump, a transdermal patch, liposomes, or other modes of administration. In one embodiment, a pump may be used (see, Sefton, 14:201 (1987); Buchwald et al., 88:507 (1980); Saudek et al., 321:574 (1989)). In another embodiment, polymeric materials can be used. In yet another embodiment, a controlled release system can be placed in a subject at an appropriate site determined by a practitioner of skill, i.e., thus requiring only a fraction of the systemic dose (see, e.g., Goodson, Medical Applications of Controlled Release, vol. 2, pp. 115-138 (1984)). Other controlled release systems are discussed in the review by Langer (249:1527-1533 (1990)). The active ingredient can be dispersed in a solid inner matrix, e.g., polymethylmethacrylate, polybutylmethacrylate, plasticized or unplasticized polyvinylchloride, plasticized nylon, plasticized polyethyleneterephthalate, natural rubber, polyisoprene, polyisobutylene, polybutadiene, polyethylene, ethylene-vinylacetate copolymers, silicone rubbers, polydimethylsiloxanes, silicone carbonate copolymers, hydrophilic polymers such as hydrogels of esters of acrylic and methacrylic acid, collagen, cross-linked polyvinylalcohol and cross-linked partially hydrolyzed polyvinyl acetate, that is surrounded by an outer polymeric membrane, e.g., polyethylene, polypropylene, ethylene\/propylene copolymers, ethylene\/ethyl acrylate copolymers, ethylene\/vinylacetate copolymers, silicone rubbers, polydimethyl siloxanes, neoprene rubber, chlorinated polyethylene, polyvinylchloride, vinylchloride copolymers with vinyl acetate, vinylidene chloride, ethylene and propylene, ionomer polyethylene terephthalate, butyl rubber epichlorohydrin rubbers, ethylene\/vinyl alcohol copolymer, ethylene\/vinyl acetate\/vinyl alcohol terpolymer, and ethylene\/vinyloxyethanol copolymer, that is insoluble in body fluids. The active ingredient then diffuses through the outer polymeric membrane in a release rate controlling step. The percentage of active ingredient in such parenteral compositions is highly dependent on the specific nature thereof, as well as the needs of the subject.","5.8.3 Parenteral Dosage Forms","Parenteral dosage forms can be administered to patients by various routes including, but not limited to, subcutaneous, intravenous (including bolus injection), intramuscular, and intraarterial. In some embodiments, administration of a parenteral dosage form bypasses patients' natural defenses against contaminants, and thus, in these embodiments, parenteral dosage forms are sterile or capable of being sterilized prior to administration to a patient. Examples of parenteral dosage forms include, but are not limited to, solutions ready for injection, dry products ready to be dissolved or suspended in a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle for injection, suspensions ready for injection, and emulsions.","Suitable vehicles that can be used to provide parenteral dosage forms are well known to those skilled in the art. Examples include, but are not limited to: Water for Injection USP; aqueous vehicles such as, but not limited to, Sodium Chloride Injection, Ringer's Injection, Dextrose Injection, Dextrose and Sodium Chloride Injection, and Lactated Ringer's Injection; water-miscible vehicles such as, but not limited to, ethyl alcohol, polyethylene glycol, and polypropylene glycol; and non-aqueous vehicles such as, but not limited to, corn oil, cottonseed oil, peanut oil, sesame oil, ethyl oleate, isopropyl myristate, and benzyl benzoate.","Salts and solid forms that increase the solubility of one or more of the active ingredients disclosed herein can also be incorporated into the parenteral dosage forms. For example, cyclodextrin and its derivatives can be used to increase the solubility of a compound provided herein. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,134,127, which is incorporated herein by reference.","5.8.4 Topical and Mucosal Dosage Forms","Topical and mucosal dosage forms provided herein include, but are not limited to, sprays, aerosols, solutions, emulsions, suspensions, eye drops or other ophthalmic preparations, or other forms known to one of skill in the art. See, e.g., 16, 18and 20eds., Mack Publishing, Easton Pa. (1980, 1990 and 2000); and 4th ed., Lea & Febiger, Philadelphia (1985). Dosage forms suitable for treating mucosal tissues within the oral cavity can be formulated as mouthwashes or as oral gels.","Suitable excipients (e.g., carriers and diluents) and other materials that can be used to provide topical and mucosal dosage forms encompassed herein are well known to those skilled in the pharmaceutical arts, and depend on the particular tissue to which a given pharmaceutical composition or dosage form will be applied. In one embodiment, excipients include, but are not limited to, water, acetone, ethanol, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, butane-1,3-diol, isopropyl myristate, isopropyl palmitate, mineral oil, and mixtures thereof to form solutions, emulsions or gels, which are non-toxic and pharmaceutically acceptable. Moisturizers or humectants can also be added to pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms. Examples of additional ingredients are well known in the art. See, e.g., 16, 18and 20eds., Mack Publishing, Easton Pa. (1980, 1990 and 2000).","The pH of a pharmaceutical composition or dosage form may also be adjusted to improve delivery of one or more active ingredients. Also, the polarity of a solvent carrier, its ionic strength, or tonicity can be adjusted to improve delivery. Compounds such as stearates can also be added to pharmaceutical compositions or dosage forms to alter the hydrophilicity or lipophilicity of one or more active ingredients so as to improve delivery. In other embodiments, stearates can serve as a lipid vehicle for the formulation, as an emulsifying agent or surfactant, or as a delivery-enhancing or penetration-enhancing agent. In other embodiments, salts, solvates, prodrugs, clathrates, or stereoisomers of the active ingredients can be used to further adjust the properties of the resulting composition","5.9 Kits","In one embodiment, active ingredients provided herein are not administered to a patient at the same time or by the same route of administration. In another embodiment, provided are kits which can simplify the administration of appropriate amounts of active ingredients.","In one embodiment, a kit comprises a dosage form of a compound provided herein. Kits can further comprise additional active ingredients such as oblimersen (Genasense\u00ae), melphalan, G-CSF, GM-CSF, EPO, topotecan, dacarbazine, irinotecan, taxotere, IFN, COX-2 inhibitor, pentoxifylline, ciprofloxacin, dexamethasone, IL2, IL8, IL18, Ara-C, vinorelbine, isotretinoin, 13 cis-retinoic acid, or a pharmacologically active mutant or derivative thereof, or a combination thereof. Examples of the additional active ingredients include, but are not limited to, those disclosed herein.","In other embodiments, kits can further comprise devices that are used to administer the active ingredients. Examples of such devices include, but are not limited to, syringes, drip bags, patches, and inhalers.","Kits can further comprise cells or blood for transplantation as well as pharmaceutically acceptable vehicles that can be used to administer one or more active ingredients. For example, if an active ingredient is provided in a solid form that must be reconstituted for parenteral administration, the kit can comprise a sealed container of a suitable vehicle in which the active ingredient can be dissolved to form a particulate-free sterile solution that is suitable for parenteral administration. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable vehicles include, but are not limited to: Water for Injection USP; aqueous vehicles such as, but not limited to, Sodium Chloride Injection, Ringer's Injection, Dextrose Injection, Dextrose and Sodium Chloride Injection, and Lactated Ringer's Injection; water-miscible vehicles such as, but not limited to, ethyl alcohol, polyethylene glycol, and polypropylene glycol; and non-aqueous vehicles such as, but not limited to, corn oil, cottonseed oil, peanut oil, sesame oil, ethyl oleate, isopropyl myristate, and benzyl benzoate.","6.1 Salts and Solvates of Compound (I-S)","6.1.1 Synthesis of Compound (I-S)","Besylate of Compound (I-S) (75 g, 1\u00d7) and sodium bicarbonate (11.4 g, 0.15\u00d7) were added to methyl acetate (1350 mL, 18\u00d7) and water (300 mL, 4\u00d7) in a 3 liter jacketed bottom drop vessel with overhead agitation and nitrogen blanket.

The batch was then cooled to room temperature and the slurry was filtered and dried, affording Form A, an anhydrate of a HCl salt of Compound (I-S).

A TGA weight loss of 0.16% up to \u02dc120\u00b0 C. was observed. The H-NMR spectrum of Form A was consistent with Compound (I-S) structure with a small amount of residual solvent ().

After undergoing the adsorption\/desorption cycles, the XRPD diffractogram of the sample showed no change ().","The stability of Form A was further characterized by compression test and form transfer experiments. Upon application of 2000-psi pressure for about 1 minute, the material was still Form A (). Results from form transfer experiments (Tables 5 and 6) showed that all hydrate and solvate form will convert to Form A in IPA slurry. Furthermore Form A is also the more stable than hydrate forms in water and aqueous\/organic mixtures studied.
