No. 61\/974,517, filed Apr. 3, 2014; the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","This invention was made with government support under Grant No. IIP 1216908 awarded by the National Science Foundation. The government has certain rights in the invention.","The subject matter described herein relates to methods and systems for tunable filters. More particularly, the subject matter described herein relates to tunable filters employing feedforward cancellation.","The FCC predicts that consumer demand for wireless bandwidth will exceed national capacity in less than two years [FCC11]. With Smartphone sales (200 million units in Q1 of 2013 [LIU13]) and their consumption of bandwidth accelerating, greater spectral efficiency is crucial. Multi-band Smartphones are projected to require up to a dozen channel filters by 2014, and rising thereafter, with the results that filter cost will soon be \u02dc10\u00d7 that of a feature phone [KAS10,YOL12]. The prospect of ever rising cost, complexity and space requirements in Smartphones has driven the search for an ultra-wideband tunable filter. To date, research has focused on MEMS or other switched filter banks and on tunable capacitors [WU06, HIL08, MOR09, REI09, MI10], but none have met all the criteria for commercial success. Without a cost effective ultra-wideband tuning technology free of distortion, utilization of spectrum will be inadequate, adversely affecting consumers, industry and the economy.","Accordingly, there exists a need for a cost effective ultra-wideband tuning technology free of distortion, and particularly for a tunable filter employing feedforward cancellation.","According to one aspect, the subject matter described herein includes a tunable transmissive filter that includes a splitter for splitting an input signal into a first signal and a second signal; a first modifier circuit for modifying a characteristic of the first signal to produce a modified first signal; a second modifier circuit for using feedforward cancellation to modify a characteristic of the second signal to produce a modified second signal, the second modifier circuit including an N-path filter, N being an integer greater than 0, and the N-path filter having a desired frequency response (e.g., bandstop, bandpass, etc.); and a combiner for combining the modified first signal and the modified second signal to produce a filtered output signal having a bandpass response.","According to another aspect, the subject matter described herein includes a tunable reflective filter that includes: a first reflecting network comprising an N path terminated filter having a plurality of switching devices for selectively connecting an input to a load through at least one of a plurality of active termination devices, N being an integer greater than 0 and the N-path filter having a desired frequency response (e.g., bandstop, bandpass, etc.); a second reflecting network comprising either another N path terminated filter having a plurality of switching devices for selectively connecting an input to a load through at least one of a plurality of active termination devices, N being an integer greater than 0 and the N-path filter having a desired frequency response (e.g., bandstop, bandpass, etc.) or a tunable delay line having a first end and a second end, the second end being connected to a termination circuit for selectively terminating the second end of the delay line to an open circuit, to a short circuit to ground, or to an impedance to ground; and a coupler for coupling a filter input signal to the first end of the tunable delay line and to the input of the terminated filter and for coupling the first end of the tunable delay line and the input of the terminated filter to a filter output signal, wherein the coupler uses feedforward cancellation to combine a signal reflection from the delay line with a signal reflection from the terminated filter to produce a filtered output signal having a desired frequency response.","According to yet another aspect, the subject matter described herein includes a method for tunable transmissive filtering. The method includes splitting an input signal into a first signal and a second signal; modifying a characteristic of the first signal to produce a modified first signal; modifying a characteristic of the second signal to produce a modified second signal, including using an N-path filter, N being an integer greater than 0, and the N-path filter having a desired frequency response (e.g., bandstop, bandpass, etc.); and combining the modified first signal and the modified second signal to produce a filtered output signal having a bandpass response.","According to yet another aspect, the subject matter described herein includes a method for tunable reflective filtering. The method includes: providing a filter input signal to a first reflecting network comprising an N path terminated filter having a plurality of switching devices for selectively connecting an input to a load through at least one of a plurality of active termination devices, N being an integer greater than 0 and the N-path filter having a desired frequency response (e.g., bandstop, bandpass, etc.); providing the filter input signal to a second reflecting network comprising either another N path terminated filter having a plurality of switching devices for selectively connecting an input to a load through at least one of a plurality of active termination devices, N being an integer greater than 0 and the N-path filter having a desired frequency response (e.g., bandstop, bandpass, etc.) or a tunable delay line having a first end and a second end, the second end being connected to a termination circuit for selectively terminating the second end of the delay line to an open circuit, to a short circuit to ground, or to an impedance to ground; and combining a signal reflection from the first reflecting network with a signal reflection from the second reflecting network to produce a filtered output signal having a filter response.","The subject matter described herein can be implemented in software in combination with hardware and\/or firmware. For example, the subject matter described herein can be implemented in software executed by a processor. In one exemplary implementation, the subject matter described herein can be implemented using a non-transitory computer readable medium having stored thereon computer executable instructions that when executed by the processor of a computer control the computer to perform steps.

In addition, a computer readable medium that implements the subject matter described herein may be located on a single device or computing platform or may be distributed across multiple devices or computing platforms.","A universal channel selection filter for smartphones and other wireless mobile devices and radios. The analog filter technology illustrated herein is termed Adjustable Mixer-Based Interference Response (AMBIR) to reflect the fact that it exploits frequency translating mixers together with feedforward cancellation to realize a widely tunable filter which reduces the need for resonance-based filters in common use today. Exemplary principles of the AMBIR filter technology of wide tunability and frequency-translated filtering functions have been demonstrated through simulation and measurement. AMBIR is proposed as a new class of filter that enables a universal channel selector supporting spectrum efficiency in Smartphones and other reconfigurable platforms. As a CMOS circuit, AMBIR can provide the low size, weight, power and cost required of consumer wireless electronics, while also addressing military requirements for multi-band tuning.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"In the embodiment illustrated in , filter  includes a splitter  for splitting an input signal  into a first signal  and a second signal .

A proof-of-concept design was implemented to assess the feasibility of realizing a fully-integrated, single-chip AMBIR filter in low-cost CMOS technology for 0.7-3.0 GHz operation. The prototype was realized in 0.13-\u03bcm CMOS technology and included spiral transformers, a delay line, a phase shifter, an RF amplifier, an 8-path tunable notch filter, and an 8-phase clock generator. Here, we describe the first-generation circuit operation and highlight the simulated performance of the filter.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["300","302","304","306","308","310","312","314","316"]},"In the AMBIR filter, a type of feed-forward cancellation is used to invert the response of the 8-path tunable notch to obtain a linearized band-pass response. The in-band response is set by the passive path and the out-of-band response to be set by the matching between the two paths. As a result, the linearity of the N-path and the out-of-band rejection are both improved. To achieve good out-of-band rejection, the two paths should be amplitude- and delay-matched; hence, an RF amplifier is included in the active path for amplitude matching, a delay line  is included in the passive path to compensate for the active path's group delay, and a four-quadrant vector interpolator  is included in the active path for precise cancellation.  shows the simulated transfer function of the filter shown in  when set for a 1 GHz center frequency when the active path is configured for cancellation at this frequency. These results confirm the proof of concept.","AMBIR filter extensions and modifications. The basic AMBIR Filter can be modified in numerous ways to realize improved performance and\/or enhanced functionality. The AMBIR Filter IC can have enhanced functionality by providing tunable bandwidth and Q-factor. To realize programmable filter functions, active baseband filter implementations can be utilized (e.g., op-amp based) which are up-converted through the N-path topology and linearized through the AMBIR topology. This provides tunable bandwidth, center frequency, and Q factor. The AMBIR Filter IC can have reduced size and\/or reduced insertion loss through compact power splitting\/combining implementations with unequal power splitting\/combining. The AMBIR Filter IC can have reduced size and\/or power consumption through incorporation of the gain within the active baseband filter and replacing the active RF phase shifter with tunable passive delay lines.","The following paragraphs describe these approaches in more detail.","Enhancing the functionality through active baseband filter implementation: In the AMBIR filter shown in , the N-path filter incorporates a bank of simple series capacitors to realize a high-pass function, which, when translated to RF, results in a 2nd-order notch response. To achieve selectable bandwidth and filter order, active baseband filter implementations can be utilized, such as Gm-C or biquadratic implementations.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 3","FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["1","8","1","8"],"sub":["1","8 "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 5"]},"Reducing the power and area of the filter.  illustrates a chip layout for an AMBIR filter according to an embodiment of the subject matter described herein. The initial proof-of-concept design shown in  consumes 2.8 mmarea and 90 mW power at 2 GHz, where clock power depends on frequency. Though the single-chip footprint can replace many stand-alone SAW filters, it is desirable to reduce the area to save cost. Towards this end, the output balun can be replaced with a non-isolating T-junction, reducing size by \u02dc30%. This is similar to how Doherty amplifiers are power combined at their outputs [DOH36]; however, the lack of isolation between the two paths requires the output impedance of the active path to be high in band which may restrict the tuning. Second, the phase shifter can be eliminated and their function instead realized using a tunable delay line in the passive path [NAT07], [LAR09]. Third, as mentioned above, through the use of active baseband filters, the RF amplifier can be eliminated.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 8","FIG. 8"],"sub":["1","8 "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},"In the embodiment illustrated in , filter  includes a first reflecting load , a second reflecting load , and a 90-degree hybrid coupler . As shown in , the first reflecting load  is comprised of an N path terminated filter having a plurality of switching devices  for selectively connecting an input  to ground through at least one of a plurality of active termination devices . In the embodiment illustrated in , reflecting load  includes an 8-path terminated filter, but other values of N could be used, N being an integer greater than 0. In one embodiment,  includes a controller  includes an N-phase pulse generator for controlling the plurality of switching devices  via control signals  sent to control terminals of the plurality of switching devices .","The second reflecting load  can be implemented either as another N-path reflecting load  or as a tunable delay line . As shown in , the tunable delay line  comprises a first end and a second end, the second end being connected to a termination circuit  for selectively terminating the second end of the delay line to an open circuit, to a short circuit to ground, or to an impedance to ground.","Filter  includes a coupler  couples a filter input signal IN to both the input of a first reflecting load  and the input of a second reflecting load , and also couples the input of a first reflecting load  and the input of a second reflecting load  to a filter output signal OUT. Coupler  combines a signal reflection from reflecting load  with a signal reflection from reflecting load  to produce a filtered output signal OUT having a desired frequency response.","In the embodiment illustrated in , the input signal IN is applied to port  of coupler . Half the signal appears at port  with 90\u00b0 phase shift and half appears at port  with 180\u00b0 phase shift. A first reflecting load , is attached to the through port (port ) having a reflection coefficient \u0393() and a second reflecting load , is attached to the coupled port (port ) having a reflection coefficient \u0393(). It can be shown that the output signal is proportional to \u0393+\u0393, whereas the signal returned to the input is proportional to \u0393\u2212\u0393. By correctly designing \u0393and \u0393, an AMBIR cancellation response can be achieved. As with the previous embodiments, the N-phase active filter illustrated in  can be tuned by adjusting the local oscillator frequency, which changes the frequency of the signals LO-LOillustrated in .","Enhancing the Electrical Performance of the Filter. To reduce insertion loss, unequal power splitting in the balun(s) can be used. For example, referring to , 90% of the signal can be fed to the passive path and 10% fed to the active path. Since the active path has gain, the two paths can be equalized to achieve good out-of-band cancellation. In-band, the loss is now much less since we have not thrown away half of the input power into the active path.","To improve out-of-band cancellation, the delay between the active and passive bands must be matched. To reduce the delay in the active path, both the RF amplifier and the RF phase shifter can be eliminated and replaced with the gain in the active baseband filter and a tunable passive delay line in the passive path, respectively. In so doing, the group delay will be reduced, allowing the on-chip delay line to be a reasonable length for integration (<2 mm) such that both the active and passive paths can have approximately equal group delay. With equal group delays, wideband cancellation can be achieved with the rejection dictated by the exact amplitude and phase matching. Our simulations of the active baseband filter implementation show much lower group delay (200 ps).","It should be noted that, although most of the examples above describe the principles of operation of an N-path filter that functions as a band-stop filter, the subject matter described herein is not so limited and may also apply to the use of an N-path filter that implements a high-pass, low-pass, bandpass, or bandstop function, as well as to the use of multiple N-path filters in parallel and\/or series to further shape the filter response. The multiple N-path filters may perform the same or different filter functions.","It will be understood that various details of the subject matter described herein may be changed without departing from the scope of the subject matter described herein. Furthermore, the foregoing description is for the purpose of illustration only, and not for the purpose of limitation.","The disclosures of all of the references listed herein are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties.","[ABO10] Abouzied, A., \u201cAn integrated SAW-less narrowband F front end,\u201d 53Midwest Symp Cir and Sys 2010:664-7.","[AND10] C.
