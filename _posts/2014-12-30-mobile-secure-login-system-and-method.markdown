title: Mobile secure login system and method
abstract: A mobile secure login method comprises steps of 1) displaying a machine readable graphic form encoded with a sign in URL and a unique token on a browser, wherein the said machine readable graphic form comprises at least one of a 1D barcode, a 2D barcode, a PDF417, an QR code, a Data Matrix code, an Aztec code, and OCR symbol; 2) scanning the said machine readable graphic form using a mobile device; 3) transmitting the sign in credential with the said unique token to a server at the said sign in URL from the said mobile device, wherein the said sign in credential comprises at least one of a username, a password, and a PKI signed challenge; 4) authenticating the said sign in credential at the said server to enable the said browser login to a secure website automatically.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Identity fraud on the Internet has become more prevalent in recent years. The source of fraud is primarily due to insecure passwords, phishing and keyloggers. To address the issue of insecure passwords, many websites have now encouraged users to include combinations of letters, numbers and symbols into their password. Therefore creating and remembering multiple secure passwords is a huge burden for a typical Internet user, especially for seldom used accounts. However, these secure passwords can be undermined by keyloggers, malware that record everything that a user types on a computer.","Although there are plenty of browsers that offer to \u201cremember\u201d your usernames and passwords in the browser, this practice is usually not recommended by security experts, as the computers and browsers are vulnerable to attacks by viruses and other malware.","Other secure Apps on a mobile phone such as eWallet, Password ABC, etc. cannot sign in a user to a website open in a browser on another device such as a PC. Mobile apps such as Password ABC only allows the device to login the website on the same mobile device. But if a user wishes to login to a website on a separate device such as a PC, the user still needs to search for the proper username and password in these Apps and then manually type in the username and password into the PC website to login the site. If a user would like to use a public PC to login a secure site, there is no guarantee that her\/his username and password will remain private, as it could be captured by a keystroke logging malware, for example. Thus rendering these secure mobile apps no more secure than a user's own memory.","In one aspect, the invented secure mobile login method enables the user to login to a secure website on a computer (e.g. a Personal Computer) without manually entering a username and password. This is accomplished by using a mobile device to scan a barcode displayed on the webpage.","Additionally, after using a mobile device to scan a barcode displayed on the webpage, the invented method automatically matches the website with a proper credential that is securely stored in the mobile device and upon user's permission then transmits to the website server for authentication.","Furthermore, once the website server has authenticated the mobile secure login credentials transmitted from a user mobile device, the current invented method enables the browser or client on the computer to be notified through either a pushing or pulling message to automatically advance into a secure webpage without a key press or a mouse click on the computer, that is, without human intervention.","In another aspect, the invented secure mobile login method does not require a user to type in his\/her credentials (e.g. a username and a password) on a computer, therefore it would not be subject to keylogging attacks.","Yet another aspect, the invented secure mobile login method will automatically check the validity of the website before submitting the user credentials to the website server thus avoiding a potential phishing attack.","Furthermore, the current invented method enables extremely long periodically random generated password as a mobile secure login credential, which is almost impossible for a human being to remember, thus enhancing security dramatically.","Additionally, the invented method enables the use of Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) signed challenge as a mobile secure login credential which also significantly enhances the login security.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","106","102","104","108","104","108","106","102","108","106"]},"Referring to  and , a user may run a web browser in the computer  to login a secure web site at the server . A typical way of login to a secure website, for example, is to type in a username  and a password  at the sign in page  and click on \u201cSign in\u201d button  as shown in . The current invention method provides an alternative secure way to login to the secure web site without typing in a username , a password , and clicking the \u201cSign in\u201d button  in the computer . Instead, a user can pull out her\/his mobile device , such as a smart phone, and scan a barcode  displayed in the web browser running on the computer .","Referring to the , after a user scans the barcode  as shown in , a mobile device  displays, for example, two accounts: John Doe , J. H. Doe , for the user to select to login to the secure website.","Referring to the  and , once the user selects John Doe  on the mobile device , the browser in the computer  automatically advances the user into the secure website  with greeting message to John Doe  and a private message  for the user's account summary, for example.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["600","104","602","104","108","104","108","108","104"]},"In step , a typical way of login to a secure website, the browser is activated by clicking \u201cSign in\u201d button . Then it goes to step  to submit the username and the password filled in by the user in the sign in form together with the unique token to the server  at the sign in URL.","In step , alternatively, in parallel of step , the browser running in the computer  will automatically check the server in the background periodically to see if the session associated with the unique token has been authenticated or not. If not yet, the browser will go to step  and wait for a predetermined period of time in the background, for example, a second, and then tries the step  again. If the session associated with the unique token has been authenticated, then it will go to step  to submit an empty sign in form with the unique token to the sign in URL. One of the preferred embodiments of step  is to use jQuery.Ajax (Asynchronous HTTP) request as shown in the example Code List 1 below. Another preferred embodiment is to use Comet model.
