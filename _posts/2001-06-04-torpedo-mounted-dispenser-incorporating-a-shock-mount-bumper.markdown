{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.","(1) Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to marine vessels and more particularly to wire-guided torpedoes for use thereon.","(2) Brief Description of the Prior Art","The MK 48 Torpedo utilizes a torpedo Tail Mounted Dispenser (TMD) as an integral part of its guidance wire communication system. The function of the TMD is to house a guidance wire coil and allow for successful deployment of a hollow core flexible cable known as a flex-hose that is used to position the guidance wire that is paying out through it, below the submarine's keel and propeller. A prior art TMD is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,385,109, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.","The TMD is attached to the tail end of the torpedo prior to loading the torpedo onboard the submarine and is stowed along with the torpedo inside of the submarine's torpedo room. Torpedoes are presently secured on U.S. Naval submarine weapon stowage and handling system (WSHS) by means of four dollies equipped with lashing straps. The TMD is suspended off the tail end of the torpedo and is not secured by one of the dollies and lashing straps. It has been determined that certain shock and vibration levels can cause significant displacement of the TMD, which can damage the TMD and the torpedo.","The prior art discloses a number of devices for the wire guidance of torpedoes and for reducing shock and vibration.","U.S. Pat. No. 3,565,028 to Hancks et al., for example, discloses a torpedo, which can be launched conventionally from a torpedo tube and trails a hydrophone on a long cable. A shroud encircling the propellers is articulated on a ball and socket joint to steer the torpedo, and to serve as a reel for carrying the long cable until after launching. Holddown fingers, which keep the coiled cable in place, are scuttled a measured time after launch. There is, however no disclosure of any means for reducing shock and vibration.","U.S. Pat. No. 4,819,503 to Fazi, Jr. et al. discloses a low frequency structure borne vibration isolation mount including an annular disk pad of vibration damping material which is sandwiched and bonded between two similar light but rugged annular disks. The annular disk pad and the two annular disks have equal numbers of matching and corresponding holes along the circumferences thereof. The sizes of the holes are so chosen that one of the annular disks can be secured to the moving piece of equipment and isolated from everything else and the other annular disk can be secured to the stationary piece of equipment. The vibrations of the moving piece of equipment are thus isolated from everything else. There is, however, no teaching of any way of increasing survivability during or after shock events.","U.S. Pat. No. 4,887,788 to Fisher et al. discloses a device for absorbing the energy of vibration of one of two abutting members which has begun to vibrate due to forces applied to either of the two abutting members, so as to reduce the frequency and magnitude of vibration of one of the two abutting members. The primary energy absorbing element is a piece of elastomeric resilient material which contains a core (or cores) of a substantially incompressible, highly efficient dampening material; the presence or absence of this core of highly efficient dampening material will depend upon desired device stiffness and dampening characteristics. The primary energy-absorbing element is surrounded by a flexible reinforced shell, which contains and restrains said element, yet allows said element to deform in the transverse and vertical directions. Two end pieces or mounting plates are secured to opposite ends of the primary energy-absorbing element. This patent, however, does not disclose a method of protecting a structure against high impact shock events.","U.S. Pat. No. 5,040,764 to Dubois discloses a mounting assembly for absorbing low frequency vibrational energy as produced by a source and isolating a base member therefrom, the mounting assembly including a central metallic ring, non-metallic foam rings located on both sides of the central metallic ring in concentric relation with respect thereto, and inner and outer metallic ring members engaging said foam rings in concentric relation, the foam rings defining a spongy mass that effectively absorbs the low frequency vibrational energy emanating from the source. This patent does not disclose any shock benefits to the torpedo or the torpedo mounted dispenser. In addition, the design disclosed in this patent requires mounting to multiple structures.","U.S. Pat. No. 5,158,030 to DuBois et al. discloses a damped flexible seal assembly for a torpedo, which isolates the tailcone thereof from vibrational energy present in the drive shaft assembly. A pair of outside flanges, each of which include an inwardly facing groove and an O-ring constrained therein, provide a watertight seal against the outer non-rotating surface of the drive shaft assembly. An inside flange includes an outwardly facing groove and an O-ring constrained therein, and provides a watertight seal against the inner surface of the tail cone. Two cast-in-place elastomeric seals provide a watertight seal between the flanges and further provide a damping barrier between the outside flanges and the inside flanges for damping vibrational energy present in the drive shaft assembly before the energy can reach the tailcone through the seal assembly. This arrangement does not, however, provide any benefits toward enhancing the chances that a torpedo will survive a shock event.","U.S. Pat. No. 5,396,855 to DuBois discloses an underwater vehicle tailcone assembly including a forward flange, a first tubular sheath extending rearwardly from the forward flange, and elastomer material bonded to inner and outer surfaces of the first sheath to form a forward chamber wall. The assembly further includes an aft flange, a second tubular sheath extending forwardly from the aft flange, and elastomer material bonded to inner and outer surfaces of the second sheath to form an aft chamber wall. The assembly still further includes a rigid housing wall disposed between a rearward end of the forward chamber wall and a forward end of the aft chamber wall. The forward chamber wall forms a continuous tailcone wall from a forward edge of the forward flange to a rearward edge of the aft flange. This patent, however, also does not disclose any features for protecting the torpedo from damage during shock events.","It is an object of the present invention to provide a TMD, which incorporates means for protecting the TMD and the torpedo with which the TMD is used from shock and vibration events.","This object is accomplished by the present invention, which is a TMD for deploying an elongated, flexible article generally along a deployment axis. This TMD includes a receptacle means storing the article in a multiple-turn, multiple-layer configuration about the deployment axis in a storage volume. There is also a torpedo connector mechanism having a terminal forward face and a lateral peripheral surface extending away from the receptacle along the deployment axis. An elastomeric cushioning feature is mounted on the lateral peripheral surface of the connector mechanism. Another elastomeric cushioning feature is mounted on the terminal forward face of the connector mechanism.","Tail Mounted Dispensers (TMD's) are a major component of the MK 48 Torpedo wire payout communication systems. The communication system has two payout coils, one in the torpedo's fuel tank and one in the TMD. During stowage in the torpedo room, the TMD is attached to the tail end of the torpedo. The TMD contains a coiled, weighted, flexible, hollow hose, through which the wire passes. The TMD adds considerable weight to the tail of the torpedo. The interaction of the TMD on the torpedo during certain shock and vibration levels can damage the TMD and the torpedo. The introduction of an elastomeric bumper between the tail end of the torpedo and the TMD minimized the shock impact forces imparted on the torpedo and the TMD. The device consists of a cylindrical, hollow, elastomeric bumper that is secured to a shock mount and ball-locking assembly mounted on the forward portion of the TMD. The bumper fills the majority of a void between the TMD and the torpedo when the TMD is mounted onto the torpedo.","The bumper is bolted to the forward face of the TMD shock mount. The ball-locking ring assembly is also bolted to the forward face of the TMD shock mount assembly. During installation of the TMD onto the torpedo, the ball-locking ring is positioned over the bell mouth adapter on the torpedo. The ball-locking ring is locked into position on the torpedo's bell mouth adapter when the TMD locking mechanism is activated. The bell mouth adapter is attached to the exhaust valve, which in turn is attached to the torpedo drive shaft. During a shock event, the bumper contacts the torpedo's shroud, transferring some of the TMD's energy into the shroud and the bumper and away from the drive shaft. Incorporation of the elastomeric resilient bumper positioned between the TMD and the torpedo minimizes displacement of the TMD and absorbs energy created by displacement of the TMD, which in turn prevents damage to the TMD and the torpedo. It has been shown that the strains in the drive shaft are lowered during shock when the bumper is installed The lowered strains increase the shock survivability of the exhaust valve\/drive shaft joint, the exhaust valve\/bell mouth joint and the propulsion system. The bumper cushions the TMD locking mechanism and reduces the motion of the TMD. This feature keeps the TMD's locking mechanism from becoming disengaged and impacting the shroud assembly of the torpedo. This eliminates damage to the torpedo shroud and the TMD ball-locking mechanism.","Referring to , a dispenser  includes receptacle , and a partitioning insert  for storing an elongated flexible hose  with an internal conductor or conductors as a multi-turn, multi-layer coil. The restraining bands  and  complete the dispenser . These components are mounted together coaxially about a deployment axis  that is generally horizontal in a submarine application. The receptacle  includes a cylindrical hub  that contains, within cylindrical wall  and an end wall , various mounting hardware for connection to a torpedo. Base plate  extends radially from one end of the hub  to support a cylindrical shell  that is concentric with and spaced from the cylindrical wall . The partitioning insert  is molded or cast with an annular base  that attaches or butts the base plate . The partitioning insert  also includes four finger sets , ,  and , perpendicular to and extending from base  in a direction parallel to axis  and spaced approximately 90\u00b0 about axis . Each of the finger sets includes a radial inner finger , intermediate fingers  and  and a radial outer finger . Each finger has, for example, a base portion , an intermediate portion , and a free end . An arcuate extension  is positioned between the base portion  and a base portion of an adjacent finger. There are no extensions between finger sets  and  as this area constitutes a transition area  in which the flexible hose  can transfer smoothly between adjacent channels.","The TMD  further includes a mechanical connector mechanism  secured to a shock mount  (not shown in ) on its lateral peripheral surface. Elastomeric lateral peripheral shock mount  is attached to hub . Referring now also to , TMD  includes annular, elastomeric bumper  secured to a forward peripheral surface of shock mount  and having a central aperture  to permit exposure of ball-locking ring assembly . TMD  is connected to a torpedo  at bell mouth adapter  of torpedo , which connects to the ball-locking ring assembly  and mechanical connector mechanism  of TMD . Adjacent the bell mouth adapter  there is an exhaust valve  and the bell mouth adapter  connects to drive shaft  of torpedo . Outwardly adjacent the drive shaft  there is a shroud  that is positioned in opposed relation to the terminal front shock mount bumper .","During certain shock and vibration levels, bumper  prevents the TMD locking mechanism from directly impacting shroud , so as to avoid the possibility of damage to shroud , which may render the locking\/unlocking mechanism ,  inoperable. The use of bumper  also avoids the possibility that torpedo  cannot be deployed because the TMD  cannot be unlocked and detached from torpedo . The elastomeric bumper  also minimizes displacement of TMD  and absorbs energy created by the displacement of TMD , thus reducing damaging loads imparted to the torpedo. Additionally, it will be understood that bumper  is an extremely simple and easily implemented modification to prior art TMD  that produces exceptional results. Further, bumper  covers the locking mechanism  (as shown in ), inhibiting the locking mechanism  from impacting and damaging shroud  and preventing disengagement of locking mechanism  from locking ring assembly .","Those skilled in the art will appreciate that a wide range of materials, coatings, and molding and fabrication techniques may be used within the scope of this invention to maximize performance and minimize costs. Also, different values of the modulus and damping coefficients for the elastomer bumper may be employed with the scope of this invention to optimize the performance in conjunction with profiling the shape of the bumper. Furthermore, multiple layers of structures, elastomer, mass and damping materials may also be employed to provide fine-tuning for the bumper response without departing from the spirit of this invention.","While the present invention has been described in connection with the preferred embodiments of the various figures, it is to be understood that other similar embodiments may be used or modifications and additions may be made to the described embodiment for performing the same function of the present invention without deviating therefrom. Therefore, the present invention should not be limited to any single embodiment, but rather construed in breadth and scope in accordance with the recitation of the appended claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["Other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent upon reference to the following description of the preferred embodiments and to the drawings, wherein corresponding reference characters indicate corresponding parts in the drawings and wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 4"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
