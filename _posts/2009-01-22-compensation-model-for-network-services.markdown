title: Compensation model for network services
abstract: A compensation model is disclosed for compensating a network service provider. A networked system is also disclosed for presenting advertising during on-line interactions between a user and a service of a network (e.g., the Internet, interactive cable, and/or a LAN). Advertisements (ads) are presented to a networked user unrequestedly during user interactions with the service. The user can activate the ads (via hyperlinks) for receiving additional advertising. The system gathers user data and/or develops user profiles for selectively presenting ads, promotionals, discounts, etc. targeted to receptive users. In exchange for viewing such selective presentations, on-line access to the service is provided, the service including, e.g., (a) playing on-line interactive games (e.g., blackjack and poker), (b) providing access to the network itself (e.g., an Internet service provider), and/or (c) providing access to substantially any interactive service accessible via (b). The system can provide free/reduced cost network services to the user for viewing unrequested advertising. The system can be provided for a casino.

No. 12\/167,244 filed Jul. 2, 2008, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60\/947,598 filed Jul. 2, 2007; the present application is also a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/502,285 filed on Feb. 11, 2000 (now U.S. Pat.

No. 08\/759,895 filed Dec. 3, 1996 (now U.S. Pat. No. 5,823,879), which claims the benefit of both U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60\/010,361 filed Jan. 19, 1996 and U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60\/010,703 filed Jan. 26, 1996; the entire disclosure of each of the above-identified applications is hereby fully incorporated by reference as part of the present application.","The present invention relates to method and system for providing compensation to a network service provider via advertising and user fees for services.","There are various techniques and strategies for providing services\/products to users via a network such as the Internet, wherein the network nodes (e.g., websites) providing such services\/products receive compensation by a combination of revenue streams, including:\n\n","The primary techniques or business models for enticing a large number of repeated user visitations to a network node (e.g., website) is to provide an interactive informational service that large numbers of users find repeatedly desirable and\/or necessary. Examples of such successful business models are Internet search engine sites such as Google, social networking websites (e.g., www.facebook.com and www.myspace.com), various game websites, video website (e.g., www.youtube.com), and music websites. However, due to the competitiveness of network nodes for enticing users virtually all entities operating commercial network nodes need all the advantages and\/or user enticements that are commercially feasible to maintain profitable revenue streams. Thus, in addition to providing free Internet searches, Google (as well as many other Internet sites) provide other free services\/products such as browser toolbars, desktop search engines, notepads, pictures for computer monitor background screens, free games, instructional presentations (e.g., www.digg.com) and news reports. However, it would be advantageous to provide users with additional incentives for repeatedly visiting and expending additional time at a particular network node, such as an Internet website, by providing the capability to win cash prizes, free products or services, and\/or access to products or services that are restricted from use by other users.","For at least some entities operating network (Internet) nodes, their business models also may include receiving compensation from users, wherein such compensation can be viewed as: (i) an activation fee, (ii) a license or subscription fee to use a service for, e.g., a predetermined amount of time, (iii) a membership fee, and\/or (iv) a predetermined payment from which funds are withdrawn as the service is used such as in certain Internet wagering games. Such entities and\/or the nodes they operate will be referred to hereinbelow as \u201cuser funded\u201d nodes, sites, websites, services, entities, etc. User funded sites typically do not provide unrequested advertising to the users funding the website, or will present advertisements that are deemed very beneficial to a likely large number of the users funding the site. Accordingly, advertising revenues from such sites can be somewhat diminished. Some network site operators have developed a hybrid business model wherein some of the services at their network site are free to users, and the users are presented various types of advertising which may or may not be demographically targeted to the users, whereas other portions of the network site that are user funded and have little if any advertising. Thus, advertising revenue is derived from only the free services portion of the network site. However, it would be advantageous for a network site operator to be able to present more advertising and\/or addition user enticements such as coupons, or reduced cost services\/products to users funding the site to thereby generate, e.g., greater advertising revenue.","In some contexts, user compensation, where the users fund the site, may be considered illegal under the U.S. Federal Wire Act and\/or other U.S. Federal Acts such as the \u201cUnlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006,\u201d (\u201cUIGEA\u201d). In particular, if the service provided by the network site includes betting, wagering, or other activity wherein there is a staking or risking of something of value upon the outcome of a contest of others, a sporting event, or a game subject to chance, upon an agreement or understanding that the person or another person will receive something of value in the event of a certain output occurring, then such U.S. laws may prohibit such services and\/or user compensation therefor. Although such U.S. laws do not appear to be currently strictly enforced, the potential threat of enforcement is problematic. Basically, in the U.S. any service offered may be considered illegal to offer on a network such as the Internet if a user:\n\n","To avoid violating the UIGEA, network sites offering games of chance have been forced to: (a) locate outside of the U.S., (b) wager points or tokens that have no intrinsic value, (c) play such games without the possibility of winning a prize of monetary value, and\/or (d) play such games without the ability to wager at all. However, each of these options are undesirable, and in the case of (a) needlessly cause U.S. funds to be diverted to other countries. Moreover, none of these appropriately address the fact that many games of chance are substantially games of skill and should be treated as such.","Accordingly, it would be advantageous to be able to provide services (e.g., games), wherein a user skill aspect of the service is capable of being measured separately from random chance events related to the service. More particularly, when the service includes playing games of chance that include, e.g., generally recognized aspects of skill, it is desirable to play such games legally in the U.S., wherein prizes of monetary value can be won. For example, it is desirable for the skill portion of such games to be separately measured and used to award prizes to players having demonstrated a predetermined skill level.","Although Internet gaming in the U.S. is substantially done by Internet sites that are located in foreign countries (since such sites are then less subject to U.S. Federal laws), other games and services may also be subject to such U.S. laws such as UIGEA. For example, many \u201cpay for play\u201d games may be illegal under U.S. Federal law if there is an enticement to win a prize, wherein, e.g., a player pays a fixed amount upfront to play a game and wherein there is the possibility for the player to win a prize, e.g., a prize that is worth substantially more than the player's pay for play entry fee. It is believed that such U.S. laws may be enforced against any service having: (a) paying users and where there is some degree of risk (as may be determined by a U.S. court) is involved, and (b) where there is a prize that can be won wherein the prize is worth more than the user paid upfront. Accordingly, it would be advantageous to provide enticements to network (Internet) users when playing games having upfront payments and that involve prizes without violating such U.S. laws.","Referring particularly to Internet sites having free games wherein game tournaments are provided, there can be a significant problem with a user\/player entering the same tournament multiple times by entering under a multitude of different user names and thereby significantly increasing his\/her chances of winning the tournament (and any corresponding prize). For example, even if distinct email addresses are required for each tournament player, it is relatively easy for a single user to obtain a plurality of email accounts. Accordingly, since a person's email address is the method usually used by a network site to determine whether an entrant has previously registered, multiple entries by the same person can significantly increase his\/her odds of winning the tournament. Accordingly, it would be advantageous to inhibit tournament players of, e.g., free tournaments, from easily entering such tournaments under multiple user names, and thereby inherently reducing the attractiveness of the tournament to other users. Moreover, since the revenue that the network site operator obtains from the tournament is likely to be from offering advertising and\/or advertiser services\/products that are based upon the number of \u201cdistinct\u201d users, it is problematic for the operator to assert with any certainty to his\/her advertisers that the advertisers' ads are being presented to a sufficient number of distinct users. That is, the ability of a game site operator to assure that the number of players it represents to its advertisers is accurate and that few, if any, entrants are duplicates has been problematic.","If and when there is a change in the law that allows on-line gambling in the U.S., there remains the need to provide unique methods of recruiting users to both free as well as pay for play type games. Since a \u201cfree\u201d game is one of the ways to attract users, a combination of free and pay for play style games is believed to be attractive to users and commercially viable for network site operators. Thus, the problems addressed in this disclosure will remain issues to be resolved, whatever the state of the law.","The cost effective automation of playing certain games, like blackjack, has been difficult due to the fact that these games typically require a dealer and only a relatively small number of players may play the game with a single dealer. However, with the popularity of local and wide-area data communication networks, it is desirable to have an automated gaming system for games such as blackjack wherein large numbers of players may cost-effectively and efficiently play such games.","Furthermore, it has been difficult to cost-effectively provide a network gaming system on such networks as the Internet in that gaming restrictions prohibit wagering and ante fees in most contexts except such situations as local area networks within a casino. However, since many players have an interest in playing casino-type games, it would also be desirable to have a way to benefit from interests in such games. Accordingly, it would be desirable to have a system that utilized a gaming context as a vehicle for delivering product and\/or service information to users of a network such as the Internet. In particular, it would be desirable to have a data processing system that provided a large number of players with the ability to substantially asynchronously play casino-style games on the Internet for prizes at a reduced risk or at substantially no risk, wherein the data processing system coordinated the presentation of products and\/or services from sponsors of the games so that there is a coordinated, interactive exchange of information between players and sponsors regarding advertisements, samples, prizes and questionnaires related to sponsor products and\/or services.","Accordingly, since the present invention, as described in the sections hereinbelow, addresses the above-discussed problems within the context of playing blackjack, an overview of this particular game is provided so that the novelty and various related aspects of the present invention may be more fully appreciated.","Description of Blackjack:","The card game of blackjack is a game of chance played between a designated player known as a \u201cdealer\u201d and one or more other players. Basically, each player plays against the dealer in the sense that each player attempts to achieve a collection or hand of cards having a total score for the hand closer to the value 21 than the score of the hand of the dealer. However, if a player's card hand goes over 21, the player may lose any wagers bet on the hand regardless of the value of the card hand of the dealer.","In further detail, blackjack is typically played with one or more standard playing card decks wherein each card has a value. In particular, each of the face cards has the value of 10, and non-face card has a value identical to the numerical value as indicated on the card, except for aces. That is, for aces a value may be assigned of either 1 or 11, depending on which value a player deems most beneficial to his\/her hand.","In one conventional method for playing blackjack, at the commencement of a blackjack hand, each player initially is provided with two cards and the dealer also receives two cards. Typically, one of the dealer's cards is dealt with the value of the card showing whereas the other card is dealt with the value of the card hidden. However, variations on when the dealer receives his\/her cards may depend on the blackjack gaming rules where blackjack is being played but, in any case, one of the dealer's cards must be face-up before the players exercise various wagering options beyond an initial ante.","After a player has reviewed his\/her cards, the player may request one or more additional cards in an attempt to get: (a) a value for a card hand that will be greater than the hand the dealer will have, and (b) a value for the card hand that is less than or equal to 21. Further, a player may under certain circumstances, as will be described below, simultaneously play more than one hand of cards against the dealer's cards. However, in requesting such additional cards, a player runs the risk of \u201cbusting\u201d each hand played wherein the player loses his\/her wager(s) on a card hand by adding cards to the hand until a value exceeding 21 occurs. Further note that such busting of a hand occurs regardless of whether or not the dealer has a card hand value of less than or equal to 21.","Note that after each player has ceased to request further cards (i.e., each player \u201cstands\u201d on his cards), the dealer either takes one or more further cards (i.e., \u201chits\u201d) according to predetermined blackjack rules as established, for example, by the gaming establishment where the blackjack game is being conducted. In general, the dealer must take additional cards if his\/her current card count total is less than 17 and the dealer must decline further cards if the dealer's hand has a value of 17 or more. However, there are various rules regarding whether a dealer may stand or hit when the card count total is a \u201csoft 17.\u201d That is, one of the dealer's cards is an ace (and therefore may have a value of 1 or 11) and one of the values for the dealer's hand is 17. For example, the dealer may be required to take a hit on a soft 17.","Since a hit(s) taken by the dealer is performed after all players have exercised their wagering options, the final numerical value of the dealer's hand is then compared to the final numerical value of each of the player's hand(s) to determine the winning and losing wagers. Note that if the dealer's hand exceeds the value of 21, then any player that has not busted wins the wagers for their hand(s) regardless of the hand's total value. Alternatively, if the dealer's card hand is less or equal to 21, then it is compared with each of the player's card hand(s) and in each comparison the card hand with the closest total value to 21 without exceeding 21 wins. Of course, ties are possible. In such cases (called a \u201cpush\u201d), the player's wager(s) on his\/her card hand are returned.","It is typical in blackjack to have at least three additional player options depending on the circumstances of play. A first such option is known as \u201cdoubling down\u201d wherein if the player's first two cards have a value within a predetermined range (e.g., 10 or 11), then the player may double his or her wager and once dealt a single additional card, the total of the three card hand becomes the value for the player's hand. Alternatively, another option is that of \u201csplitting pairs\u201d wherein if the player's first two cards are identical with the exception of suit (i.e., a pair), then the pair may be split so that two card hands are created with one card of the pair in each hand. Thus, the player must wager on each of the hands at least the initial wagering or ante amount. Subsequently, a second card and any subsequent successive cards are dealt to each of the separate hands as the player requests and the results of both hands are compared to the dealer's hand, assuming neither the dealer nor either of the player's two hands busts.","In a third option, played immediately after each player has been dealt their first two cards and the dealer has been dealt at least a first card, a player may request \u201cinsurance\u201d under the circumstances where the dealer's single face-up card is an ace. In this circumstance, the player is betting that the dealer has blackjack (i.e., a card value total of 21). If the dealer does not have blackjack, then the insurance bet is forfeited and the player plays his\/her blackjack hand as if the insurance bet were never made. Note that the player can typically wager an insurance bet of one-half of the amount of his\/her initial blackjack wager or ante and if the dealer has blackjack, then the dealer (or the gaming establishment) pays the player double or triple his\/her insurance bet.","Further note that options for splitting pairs and doubling down may interact with one another according to certain pre-established gaming establishment rules wherein, for example, a player may double down on one or more of his\/her split hands.","Additionally, there are blackjack tournaments having tournament entrants that compete against each other for tournament prizes. In such tournaments each entrant has a fixed initial number of points that can be wagered in a pre-established number of tournament blackjack games to be played. Accordingly, the player having the highest number of points at the end of the tournament wins the tournament. Note that in such tournaments, there may be specific guidelines established at the beginning of the tournament for varying the blackjack gaming rules between tournament games. For example, rules may vary on when a player may split pairs repeatedly during the same blackjack game. Also, double down rules may vary so that, for example, after a splitting of pairs, a player may be allowed to double down on any two cards or, alternatively, an additional wager of less than the initial wager may be acceptable when a player requests to double down.","However, in all known variations of blackjack, players are only allowed to enter a blackjack game at the completion of a previous game and, further, there is a relatively small number of players that can play blackjack at a dealer's station simultaneously. Accordingly, it is desirable to provide a system for playing blackjack wherein potentially a very larger number of players can play blackjack simultaneously from a single dealer station and wherein players can commence playing blackjack at their own discretion without waiting for a previous blackjack game to complete.","The advantages identified hereinabove are provided by the disclosure hereinbelow.","The present disclosure is directed to a novel collection of business techniques or business models (also referred to as a \u201ccompensation model\u201d herein) for addressing the problems, and attaining the advantages, outlined in the Background section hereinabove. In particular, the present disclosure describes a method and system for receiving compensation for network (e.g., Internet) services, wherein such services may require users to pay or fund a first service (e.g., a \u201cuser funded\u201d service as described in Background section hereinabove), and regardless of what elements of risk (if any) are involved in performing or participating in the user-funded service, such users may become eligible to legally win a prize of, e.g., monetary value associated with an instance of a service (this service referred to herein as a \u201cprize-winning service\u201d) once one or more proficiency criteria in the user-funded service is demonstrated. Moreover, the present disclosure directed to utilizing the user-funded service whether or not the prize-winning service is available. In particular, the user-funded service may be configured so that a user's funds are only retained (or charged to the user) by the user-funded service when the user fails to satisfy a predetermined criteria related to the service. For example, if the service includes the playing of games, then the user-funded service may only retain\/charge the user when the user does not play a minimum number of games, a minimum amount of time, demonstrate a minimum indication of game proficiency (e.g., accumulate a minimum number of game points, beat one or more other players\u2014possibly robot players, place sufficiently high in a game tournament, etc.). However, it is within the scope of the present disclosure that other services, instead of games, may be provided for the user-funded service and\/or a related prize-winning service. For example, such a service may be an Internet search engine, or an instructional video site wherein a user is only charged for using the service if, e.g., the user does not access the service sufficiently frequently during a particular time period, or does not interact with the service in a particular by the end of a particular time period (e.g., the user does not contribute to an appropriate product evaluation, does not contribute an appropriate instructional video, does not contribute appropriate assistance to other users, and\/or does not contribute appropriate music recommendations, etc.), then the user is charged a fee for accessing the service, and\/or a previously paid user fee is refunded.","Regarding, the prize-winning service, such a service may be operated by the same service as the user-funded service, or each such service may be operated by separate operators, wherein user participation in an instance of the prize-winning service may be free to the user having established a proficiency\/eligibility in the user-funded service. Additionally, since the users competing for prizes (in instances of the prize-winning service) are known, e.g., via credit\/debit card network transactions when paying for the user-funded service, the present compensation model introduces a greater measure of integrity or fairness into user competition in that restrictions on a user participating, e.g., under aliases, to thereby favorably skew odds in his\/her favor of winning can be enforced.","In a first collection of embodiments of the present compensation model for receiving an opportunity to win prizes, each of a plurality of users are required to provide an initial activation fee or deposit to access a service (a user-funded service herein, and which may be, e.g., a game or contest). Subsequently, each of the users can obtain a refund of his\/her activation fee or deposit if and when the user, e.g., achieves a certain or predetermined level of proficiency (i.e., skill) related to the user-funded service. That is, after reaching such a level of proficiency, the user's activation fee or deposit is returned to the user. In one embodiment, exactly the user's activation fee or deposit is returned, no more and no less. Note that if more than the user's activation fee or deposit were returned, then the excess amount might be legally considered as a prize in certain circumstances, and thus problematic in the context of, e.g., U.S. gaming laws. Moreover, the repaying of an amount that is less than the user activation fee or deposit may also be problematic in that the ability for the user to activate additional services (e.g., a \u201cprize-winning service\u201d), wherein prizes of monetary value can be won, may be considered as a service that the user has also paid for as well.","In this first collection of embodiments, once the user has attained a certain level of proficiency or skill in a particular user-funded service, and the user's fee or deposit has been returned, the user may be then eligible to win one or more prizes of monetary value related to subsequent instance of the prize-winning service without paying any further fees or deposits. Accordingly, claims that there has been compensation (consideration) paid to the network site operator for winning a prize of monetary are believed (at least in some instances) to be avoided. Thus, the initial activation fee or deposit may be properly considered as a fee or deposit for the user gaining expertise with the user-funded service (or, e.g., similar services), and such consideration from the user to the site operator is not at risk for winning a prize since such consideration was used for a service for which no prizes of a monetary value were offered, and user's fee or deposit is entirely refunded when the user reaches an appropriate level of proficiency or skill.","In another embodiment of the present compensation model, users provide nothing of value initially to participate in the user-funded service. Instead, a user(s) enters into an agreement with the operator of the user-funded service, wherein the user(s) agrees that, e.g., after a given amount of time (such as a week, six weeks, or six months), if the user does not satisfy certain service related criteria (e.g., one or more proficiency criteria), then (and only then) will the user be charged for using the service. Accordingly, the user may be required to provide credit card information when registering to access the user-funded service. However, no expense is incurred by the user unless the agreed to one or more service related criteria are not satisfied. Note that such service related criteria may be that the user agrees, e.g., to access the service at a given frequency (e.g., once a day), to access the service for a given number of hours per week, to sponsor at least one new service user per month, etc.","In some embodiments of the compensation model (including some of the first collection described above), users having reached a predetermined proficiency level (or satisfies certain service related criteria) may pick and choose which from among a plurality of instances of a prize-winning service (which may be an instance of the user-funded service or another service) that are provided at different times, or at different geographical (or network) locations. Alternatively\/additionally, such users may be able to select from among additional instances of the prize-winning services, wherein such instances are offered at substantially the same time. Thus, a user having reached a particular proficiency level (or satisfied certain service related criteria) in a user-funded service may enter an instance of a free prize-winning service for winning prizes immediately after demonstrating his\/her proficiency (or satisfying certain service related criteria), or the user may elect to participate in such a prize-winning service for winning prizes at a later date.","In some embodiments of the compensation model (including some of the first collection described above), users may activate or use the user-funded service as much as they desire (e.g., play as many games as they desire), and\/or take as long as they desire (e.g., within a reasonable amount of time, e.g., six months or a year) to demonstrate that they have reached an appropriate skill or proficiency level for qualifying to participate in a corresponding instance of a prize-winning service wherein there is an opportunity to win prizes without the users risking anything of value (e.g., money). In some embodiments, users may be required to demonstrate their proficiency (or satisfying certain service related criteria) within, e.g., a predetermined time, and at the end of the predetermined time all users will have their activation fees or deposits refunded. However, only those users satisfying the predetermined proficiency levels will be eligible to enter the additional instances of the prize-winning service(s) for winning prizes.","In some embodiments of the compensation model (including some of the first collection described above), a user may circumvent activating the user-funded service for demonstrating his\/her proficiency or skill by providing alternative evidence that the user has the desired proficiency or skill to participate in the free prize-winning service(s) that can result in the user winning a prize(s) of monetary value. In particular, a user may show his\/her proficiency or skill by presenting evidence of such proficiency in ways other than providing the activation fee or deposit and participating in the user-funded service. In particular, in a gaming context (e.g., game of chance also having an element of skill), a user may provide evidence that he\/she is proficient by identifying, e.g., a casino or other establishment (or network site) along with date that the user demonstrated an appropriate level of proficiency in the user-funded service. For example, if the user-funded service is the game of scrabble, and a user is able to verify that he\/she has won a well known scrabble contest, and\/or has a National Scrabble Association rating above a particular value, then the user may be considered sufficiently proficient for participating in a corresponding free prize-winning service such as a scrabble contest or, e.g., another word related competition. In one embodiment, such a user may be required to provide a deposit for participating in the prize-winning service, and if the user wins a prize then the user may have to provide his\/her evidence of proficiency before receiving the prize. Accordingly, if the evidence cannot be verified, then his\/her deposit is forfeited. In one embodiment, when the user-funded service is a game of chance, a user may assert that he\/she has won, e.g., certain amount of money, a tournament for the game of chance, or won a certain number of games at a particular casino or during a particular time period as a way of demonstrating his\/her proficiency at the user-funded service. Moreover, the network site operator may contract with one or more casinos (online or otherwise) so that both the casino and the operator's site each advertise one another's gaming services so that players considered proficient at such a casino may be automatically considered proficient on the operator's network site. In addition, when the user-funded service is (or includes) a game, a user may attain the predetermined level of proficiency by playing against a software program (e.g., a robot) that is programmed to play at at least a desired predetermined proficiency level.","In a second collection of embodiments, the present compensation model requests users to provide an activation fee or deposit for using a user-funded service, and once all users have used the user-funded service as intended (e.g., played the required number of games within a predetermined time period), all users have their activation fees or deposits returned them, and additionally those users demonstrating the most skill (e.g., by winning the most games) are also provided with prizes in addition to receiving their refunds. Note that a fundamental difference between the first and second collections of embodiments is that in the first collection of embodiments, the site operator has the opportunity to at least recover some of his\/her expenses for enhancing the skills or proficiency of the users since it is likely that not all user's will reach the predetermined proficiency level. However, in either the first or second collection of embodiments, the upfront funding (and\/or providing credit card information for potentially charging) for accessing the user-funded service is likely to deter a user from duplicatively registering a large number of times and thereby skewing the odds in the user's favor of winning a prize. In particular, since each such registration may be by credit\/debit card, duplicate registrations in a user-funded service (for eventually participating in an instance of a prize-winning service) may be inhibited to a great extent by preventing registration (and payment of the activation fee or deposit) from each user whose name is identical (or substantially so) to another registered user at, e.g., a same geographical (or network) address as provided by the credit card information.","In one embodiment, the user-funded service and\/or the prize-winning service referred to hereinabove may be an online Internet game service wherein the game(s) may be poker, chess, checkers, monopoly, hearts, spades, euchre, canasta, blackjack, scrabble, video games (e.g., war games), racing games (e.g., auto racing games), trivia games, Internet search games and\/or investment games (e.g., stock market investment competitions). More generally, such Internet games and\/or contests may be single player games (e.g., where a user plays against a network site or house), multi-player games (e.g., multi-player Internet video\/simulation games, or games based on geographical locations of players), games that include an element of chance (e.g., casino card games), board games, and\/or mystery solving games.","In one embodiment, the level of proficiency may be one or more of: obtaining a predetermined number of points (e.g., chips in one or more poker games), winning a certain number of game instances (e.g., winning a predetermined number of scrabble games), winning more games than another user (e.g., winning the most hearts games in a hearts tournament), obtaining a predetermined number of points from winning games against other players of a particular skill level (e.g., winning chess games against chess players having an Elo rating system above a particular rating), and\/or beating a predetermined number of players having a particular proficiency or skill level.","In another embodiment, the user-funded service and\/or the prize-winning service referred to hereinabove may allow users to compete in the creation of designs such as: landscape designs, auto designs, house designs, etc. In another embodiment, the user-funded service and\/or the prize-winning service may allow users to compete in the creation of musical compositions, user produced videos, etc., wherein the level of proficiency is determined by, e.g., a predetermined group of judges for judging user entries. In one embodiment, the predetermined group of judges may be the users themselves who have paid the activation fee or deposit. For example, if the user-funded service includes a design or art competition, then each user may register by agreeing to provide credit card information which may be charged in the event that the user's design\/art is eliminated from the competition, and not charged in the event that the user's design\/art is not eliminated. Moreover, user's whose design\/art is not eliminated may then be eligible to enter a free contest (design, art, or otherwise) wherein one or more contestants may win prizes of substantial value.","In one embodiment, the user-funded service may be provided by a third party network site. For example, if a third party website provides a service for which a proficiency level can be determined, then once the users pay a fee (or agree to potentially paying a fee) to the operator of the site providing the present compensation model (for determining, monitoring and\/or verifying that users performed the service to a particular proficiency level on the third party network site), the users reaching the particular proficiency level (on the third party network site) then would be allowed to win prizes in free instances of a prize-winning service. Moreover, the prize-winning service may also be provided by a third party site or a site owned or controlled by the operator of the site providing the present compensation model. Thus, an operator for a network site providing an embodiment of the compensation model need not actually provide the user-funded service or the prize-winning service. Accordingly, the operator of the compensation model provides a brokering service for the user-funded services and the prize-winning services.","In one embodiment, the activation fee referred to hereinabove may be considered as a deposit, wherein such a user's deposit is forfeited if the user does not reach the predetermined level of proficiency (or satisfies certain service related criteria), e.g., within a predetermined time limit, within a predetermined amount of service activation (e.g., a number of games played, or a number musical compositions submitted), or the like.","In one embodiment, the determination of proficiency (or satisfaction of certain service related criteria) for the user-funded service may be assessed by the amount of time a user has spent interacting with the user-funded service. For example, regardless of whether a user has met a proficiency level (or satisfaction of certain service related criteria) according to any other measurement, the user may be assumed to have a sufficient proficiency if the user has interacted with the user-funded service, e.g., a predetermined amount of time, a predetermined number service sessions, and\/or a predetermined number instances of the service (e.g., games played). Where the user-funded service includes a game, a user may be deemed to have reached the predetermined proficiency level if the user has won a predetermined number of instances of the game, or placed above a certain portion of the users in a ranking of the users, or won a predetermined percentage of the games played once at least a certain number of game instances have been played, or played a predetermined (likely much larger) number of games, or played a predetermined amount of time. Moreover, for each different level of proficiency demonstrated (assuming, e.g., there are multiple levels of proficiency monitored), the user may be allowed to activate a prize-winning service for winning prizes associated with the level of proficiency demonstrated.","In one embodiment, there may be more than one proficiency level for users to attain. Thus, when a first proficiency level is obtained, a user may opt to receive his\/her activation fee or deposit, and then participate in a corresponding instance of a prize-winning service. Alternatively, the user may instead opt to proceed to a second level of proficiency, and upon reaching such a second level, opt for receiving his\/her activation fee or deposit (or at least the equivalent in products or services), and then participate in a corresponding instance of a prize-winning service for winning a more substantial prize. In one embodiment, a first portion of a user's activation fee or deposit may be refunded at a first proficiency level, and an additional portion may be refunded at an additional proficiency level. Thus, users may be paid to enhance their skills (or satisfy certain service related criteria).","In one embodiment, the present compensation model may be used in providing a network service (user-funded service and\/or the prize-winning service), wherein the users registering for the service may become voting members for determining the proficiency level for other registered users. For example, the user-funded service (or instance thereof) may be a graphic design contest, wherein each registered user can enter up to three designs, and each member is allowed to vote once for no more than 10 designs not submitted by the member. Accordingly, the members whose graphic designs are voted to have obtained the predetermined proficiency level, would have their activation fee or deposit returned, and then be eligible to participate in, e.g., a free contest for winning a prize (the free contest may be another graphic design contest). Note that the proficiency level for the present embodiment may be, e.g., receiving a predetermined percentage of the votes (e.g., 5%), or receiving at least a predetermined number of votes, or receiving enough votes to be one of a predetermined number of top vote obtainers (e.g., the designs gathering the 100 highest numbers of votes).","Moreover, as discussed further hereinbelow, an important aspect of at least some embodiments of the compensation model is the fairness of a contest associated with the user-funded service and\/or the prize-winning service. For example, assuming names and addresses of users paying the activation fee or deposit is checked against other users that previously paid the activation fee or deposit for duplicates, such a procedure can be used to prevent a user from registering a large number of times and thereby distort the user's chances of attaining a particular proficiency level and\/or subsequently winning a prize. In particular, requiring an activation fee or deposit can substantially reduce a user receiving an unfair advantage since when each user pays for each registration, and the mechanism for such payment via a network (Internet) transaction requires the user to identify him\/herself via, e.g., a credit card or a debit card. Additional\/alternative, identification may be by a cell phone or other phone number that is acquired by the network site, wherein such additional information may used to verify a user's identity.","In another embodiment, the user's activation fee or deposit may be designated as a gift to a charity. Thus, the site operator may not receive any compensation from the user-funded service.","In at least some embodiments of the compensation model, network site operators may receive compensation for either or both of the user-funded service and\/or the prize-winning service from advertisers whose advertisements are presented to users during their participation in an instance(s) of the user-funded service and\/or the prize-winning service. In one embodiment, advertisers for the user funded and\/or prize-winning service instances may sponsor one or more users to participate in the user funded and\/or prize-winning service. For example, a well known poker player, or an especially proficient poker player, may be sponsored by an advertiser to play in a free poker tournament for winning prizes, and each poker hand won by a user from the well known poker player (wherein, e.g., the well known player does not fold) may contribute to the user winning a prize that is above and beyond merely winning the poker hand. Additionally\/alternatively, an advertiser may sponsor a user, e.g., based on proficiency information of the users, wherein the user's potential charges in the user-funded service are paid (if necessary) by an advertiser selected by the user. In one embodiment, instead of (or in addition to) paying an activation fee or deposit, a user may select one or more advertisers from which to receive advertising and\/or from which not to receive advertising. In the case where a user does not pay the activation fee or deposit, e.g., when it is paid by an advertiser or sponsor, the user may win prizes in the so called user-funded service, and there need not be a separate prize-winning service instance. For example, a beverage company might sponsor a prize of free beverages for a year in an instance of a prize-winning service, and the beverage company may provide the majority of the ads presented during one or both of the user-funded service and\/or the prize-winning service instances. However, note that it may still be advantageous for users to pay an activation fee or deposit (or at least providing card\/debit card information) in order to reduce the possibility of a user receiving unfair advantage in winning prizes as discussed hereinabove. Advertisers may provide prizes throughout the game as well as provide a prize to the ultimate winner(s).","In one embodiment, a game of skill is combined with a game of risk so that the combination creates a new game requiring an entrant to use skill to be recognized as a winner.","In one embodiment the users may choose the advertiser(s) or the advertising area of interest that they desire to view. The ability of a player to recall information in the advertising presented during the contest may be used to determine the winner.","In one embodiment, there may be a combination of a charitable contribution and a deposit or payment that is for a predetermined purpose e.g., paying for an item of information or the ability to cast a vote.","In one embodiment, an organization for which the user is a member may provide a deposit for a user-funded service to assist the user in attaining a higher proficiency level e.g., a dating service organization may provide its members with the opportunity to learn and exhibit their proficiency in email etiquette via an instance of a user-funded service.","In one embodiment, the present compensation model can be used for providing more integrity to Internet chat rooms since users would be required to pay an activation fee or deposit which may be returned to the user after, e.g., there are fewer than a predetermined number of complaints about the user.","The present disclosure further includes a computerized interactive advertising system (i.e., method and apparatus) for exchanging information regarding goods and\/or services between a first population of users (hereinafter also known as \u201cplayers\u201d or \u201cusers\u201d) and a second population of users (hereinafter also known as \u201csponsors\u201d or \u201cadvertisers\u201d). In particular, the sponsors or advertisers may present information related to goods and\/or services to the players using the present invention and the players may view this information while, for example, interacting with the present invention for playing a game such as blackjack, craps, roulette, poker, pai gow or the like. Moreover, a player may also interact with the present invention so that the player has the capability for responding to sponsor or advertiser presented questionnaires, as well as for purchasing or viewing sponsor goods and\/or services. Thus, the present invention provides an information exchange service within a gaming context for enticing players to view and\/or interact with sponsor presentations such as interactive advertisements.","It is also an aspect of the present disclosure that each player or user is presented with advertisements for products and\/or services, wherein it is believed the player will be receptive to the advertisement. That is, the present interactive advertising system selectively presents advertisements to each player, according to stored characteristics and preferences of the player that the present interactive advertising system has determined from, for example, player supplied personal information, player responses to questions, and\/or analysis of player interactions such as player requests for additional information related an advertisement. Thus, such a selective presentation of advertisements allows a sponsor or advertiser to provide information related to relatively extensive or expensive promotionals (e.g., demonstrations, samples, discounts, trial subscriptions, prizes, bonuses) to players most likely to subsequently purchase the advertised product or service. Consequently, such selectivity can greatly increase the cost effectiveness of advertising, wherein the term, advertising (or advertising presentation), as used herein is understood to include not only product or service presentations that are merely informational, but also more interactive advertising presentations such as promotionals wherein discounts, free samples or a trial usage may be offered.","Moreover, it is an aspect of the present interactive advertising system that each player may interact with and play a game at a time and pace (i.e., tempo) substantially of the player's choosing. In particular, the player is not bound by a required order or sequence of play involving other players, even though the player may be in competition with other players. In fact, a player may cease play for an extended time while in the midst of a game and subsequently continue the game at the point where the player ceased to play. Thus, if the present interactive advertising system is easily accessible, then players may interact with the present interactive advertising system at their leisure.","Accordingly, in a related aspect of the present disclosure, it is intended that players (more generally, users) are able to interact with the present invention remotely, as for example, via the Internet and\/or an interactive cable television network. Thus, using an Internet embodiment as an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, a gaming web site may be provided wherein players may access the interactive gaming capabilities of the present invention and substantially simultaneously also be presented with sponsor or advertiser provided information related to goods and\/or services of the sponsor or advertiser (those two terms being used substantially interchangeably to denote e.g., those who provide advertising to users and\/or subsidize game playing, product promotionals or network access). Moreover, the sponsor provided information may include, for example, hypertext links (also denoted hyperlinks) that allow players to activate, for example, network transfers for obtaining additional information regarding a sponsor's goods and\/or services regardless of the status of any game in which a player may be currently involved at the gaming web site.","It is a further aspect in one embodiment of the present invention that a player is able to commence play of a game at substantially any time the player accesses the present invention. That is, it is not necessary for any previous game being played by other players to be completed for the player to commence play. In other words, games provided by the present invention may be continuously and asynchronously commenced or entered by players.","It is a further aspect of the present invention to require each player to use a distinct identification provided when the player \u201cregisters\u201d with the present invention before playing any games so that a network site for the invention may be able to identify each player. Accordingly, it is an aspect of the present invention during registration, that each player provides personal information about him\/herself both for gaming identification and for use as selection criteria by sponsors or advertisers for presenting particular presentations. For example, in the case of an Internet embodiment of the present invention, such registering can be performed via the Internet prior to play of any games at a gaming\/advertising web site. Thus, players may be required to provide the present invention with information about themselves such as name, address, E-mail address, age, sex, and\/or other player characteristics deemed pertinent to one or more sponsors or advertisers. Accordingly, the present invention provides a sponsor or advertiser with the capability to target its presentations substantially only to players or users having selected characteristics as, for example, determined from player information provided when registering with a network site for the present invention.","It is a further aspect of the present invention to have players compete against one another for prizes in one or more gaming tournaments. Using the Internet embodiment of the present invention as illustrative, a gaming\/advertising web site for the present invention may partition the population of players into competitive groups wherein each group includes the players for a distinct tournament. Moreover, the present invention may determine a competitive group according to criteria such as: (a) the game(s) to be played in the tournament; (b) a skill level for the players (e.g., as determined by play in a previous tournament(s)); (c) particular player characteristics such as age, area of residence, home ownership, etc.; (d) particular player lifestyle traits such as traits exhibited by exercise enthusiasts or cruise ship enthusiasts; and (e) particular player preferences such as preferences related to jewelry, personal care products or particular sports.","It is a further aspect of the present invention to allow players to play games offered by the present invention without incurring financial risk or charges beyond those that are typical for the network being used in accessing the present invention.","It is a particular aspect of the present invention to provide blackjack and other casino-style games such as craps, roulette, poker, pai gow, or variations thereof, wherein such games may be played by a plurality of players continuously and asynchronously, and wherein each game is likely to be unique from all other games being played concurrently. Furthermore, in a related aspect of the present invention, such games may be automated so as to not require a manual dealer. Also, the present invention may be played, in one embodiment, in a gaming establishment (e.g., casino) using low cost gaming stations at which players may play such games entirely electronically. Alternatively, in another embodiment, the present invention may be used to play such casino style games as blackjack on the Internet. In this later embodiment, a blackjack game controller for the present invention communicates with blackjack players at Internet client nodes via a web site from which the blackjack game controller is accessed. Thus, blackjack players may play blackjack in the privacy of their own homes and at their leisure since the present invention does not require that a particular tempo of a blackjack game be maintained.","Additionally, the present invention utilizes novel varieties in such games, as blackjack, that make the games more enjoyable for users. For example, using variations of blackjack as illustrative, in one novel embodiment wherein the dealer functions are automated by a dealer module, this module can play blackjack with a plurality of players concurrently such that each player appears to be playing exclusively with the dealer module (e.g., \u201chead-to-head\u201d). Moreover, in one blackjack embodiment, each blackjack game is played asynchronously from other concurrent blackjack games with the dealer module. Furthermore, the dealer module may play a different dealer card hand with each player. In particular, the initial one (or two) cards (or card representations) dealt to the dealer for each game are unlikely to be the same for any two blackjack games being player with the dealer module; i.e., the probability of any two concurrently played blackjack games being identical is substantially equal to chance. Accordingly, this variation is particularly worthwhile when players are playing remotely through a network such as the Internet. Alternatively, in a different blackjack variation, the dealer module and each player concurrently playing blackjack with the dealer module may be provided with cards (or card representations) from the beginning of an identical sequence of card representations. Thus, each concurrently playing player receives an identical initial card hand and the dealer is also dealt an identical initial card hand. Subsequently, the card hands within each concurrent game will vary only if players request further cards differently. Accordingly, this variation of blackjack is particularly useful in tournament blackjack played within the confines of a casino, wherein the play of each player in the tournament is synchronized to start and stop within a predetermined interval. Note that this variation of blackjack is enjoyed by tournament players in that the tournament players may consider it a better or fairer way for demonstrating blackjack playing skill.","Additional features and benefits of the present disclosure are provided hereinbelow. The present SUMMARY section is not intended to provide a comprehensive description of the novel aspects provided herein. The claims provided hereinbelow are intended to define the novel features for patent protection. Moreover, to the extent that one of ordinary skill in the art can modify and\/or combine various aspects of the present disclosure, such modifications and\/or combinations are within the scope of the present disclosure from which patent protection can be sought. Accordingly, any operable novel combination of the embodiments of the user-funded service (and its operation), the prize-winning service (and its operation), and the compensation model (and its operation) disclosed herein may be recited in the claims hereinbelow.","Other features and benefits of the present invention will become apparent from the detailed description with the accompanying figures contained hereinafter.","In , a block diagram is presented of a first embodiment of an electronic system  for the present invention for playing blackjack, wherein data flows are represented by solid arrows and control flows are represented by dashed arrows. In particular, the embodiment of  presents an architecture for the present invention for use on, for example, a local network within a casino, wherein low cost gaming stations may be utilized. Accordingly, the blackjack gaming system  includes a blackjack game controller  electronically connected to one or more potentially remote gaming stations  so that for each gaming station a player may play blackjack. In the blackjack gaming system , the blackjack game controller  functions substantially as a dealer would in a manually operated blackjack game and each gaming station  provides a blackjack player with an electronic representation of a blackjack game wherein it may appear that the player (i.e., user) at the gaming station  is the only player playing against the dealer (i.e., \u201chead-to-head\u201d against the blackjack game controller ). Accordingly, each gaming station , as will be discussed with reference to  below, includes a display for displaying both the dealer's cards and the player's cards. Each gaming station  also includes player interaction capabilities for requesting additional cards, activating various blackjack player options at appropriate times, and potentially increasing various wagers at predetermined phases of a blackjack game. Further note that each gaming station , when in operation, may request a security code be provided by a player for identifying himself\/herself or, alternatively, the gaming station may request the player to insert an electronic card (not shown) into the gaming station  so that information electronically encoded upon the card is read at the gaming station and transferred to the blackjack controller .","Referring now to the internal structure of the blackjack game controller , a gaming station interface  is provided for interfacing with each of the gaming stations . In particular, the gaming station interface  buffers data signals between the other components included within the blackjack game controller  and the gaming stations . For example, the gaming station interface  may have speed matching buffers in order to adjust for differences in speed between the blackjack game controller  and the gaming stations . A blackjack driver  exchanges data with the gaming station interface . The blackjack driver  substantially coordinates the operation of the blackjack game controller . In particular, the following capabilities are substantially provided by the blackjack driver :\n\n","In performing the above tasks, the blackjack driver  communicates with a blackjack player registration and playing status database . The database system  maintains in persistent storage information regarding each blackjack player. In particular, the database system  maintains:\n\n","The blackjack driver  communicates with a wager accounting module  wherein the wager accounting module provides the following capabilities:\n\n","The blackjack driver  also communicates with a blackjack player evaluator . The blackjack player evaluator  receives, from each player (via instantiations of blackjack gaming data objects from the blackjack driver ), all blackjack player requests except the data from each player indicating an amount to be wagered. Thus, the blackjack player evaluator :\n\n","The blackjack player evaluator  is supplied with data corresponding to blackjack card representations from a card generator module . The card generator module  generates for example, an ordered collection or sequence of substantially random card representations and each such card representation is provided to the blackjack player evaluator , wherein the blackjack player evaluator responds to each player's valid hit request by outputting the most recent card representation received from the card generator module . That is, each player at a gaming station  receives a card representation according to when the player's request is received by the blackjack player evaluator .","Further, note that the card generator module  also supplies the same card representations as supplied to the blackjack player evaluator  to a house blackjack playing module , wherein this latter module plays the dealer's hand in each blackjack game. Thus, the house blackjack playing module  enforces the blackjack gaming rules on behalf of the gaming establishment. In particular, this module determines when and how insurance bets can be made related to the dealer's cards. Note, as with the blackjack player evaluator , the house blackjack playing module  outputs, when required to provide the dealer's hand with another card representation at a gaming station , the most recent card representation received from the card generator module . Further note that the house blackjack playing module  provides control information to the blackjack driver , particularly regarding activation of the blackjack insurance option. This information, in turn, is conveyed to the blackjack player evaluator  so that this latter evaluator may activate the insurance option for each player at an active gaming station .","A blackjack hand evaluator  is also in communication with the blackjack driver . The blackjack hand evaluator  evaluates each player's hand(s) in comparison to the dealer's blackjack hand for determining the win\/loss\/tie for each player's hand. Thus, the dealer's hand and the one or more hands played by each player at a gaming station  is supplied to the blackjack hand evaluator . Subsequently, this evaluator outputs win\/loss\/tie results to the gaming stations  via the blackjack driver  and the gaming station interface . Further, the blackjack hand evaluator  also outputs win\/loss\/tie results along with the identity of the player playing each hand to the wager accounting module  so that wager credits and debits for each player's account may be updated according to the last or most recent blackjack game results.","In , an embodiment of a gaming station  is illustrated. The gaming station  includes a player input area  wherein a player may press touch-sensitive portions of a thin film laminated with blackjack player operations and requests. Immediately above the player input area is a player output display area  for displaying blackjack gaming information related to the player. Optionally, each gaming station  may include a player identification card reader  so that a blackjack player may identify him\/herself at a gaming station  by swiping a magnetic identification portion of a player identification card (not shown) through the card slot  thereby allowing the card reader  to transmit the player's encoded identification upon his\/her card to the blackjack game controller . However, it should be noted that other configurations of the gaming station  are also contemplated by the present invention. In particular, gaming station  may not have a card reader . Instead, a blackjack player may be required to register either manually or automatically at a site remote from the gaming station , or, alternatively personal identification numbers may be provided to players for identifying themselves via the player input area  wherein, for example, a numeric digit provided in the lower bottom portion of some of the touch-sensitive areas may be used by the player to input a personal identification number. Further, the arrangement of the touch-sensitive portions of the player input area  and the format of the display area  (both being discussed in detail below) may have other arrangements and still be within the scope of the present invention.","Describing in detail now the touch-sensitive portions of the player input area , an activate\/enter next game button  is provided. This button is used to initially activate the gaming station  so that a \u201crequest to play\u201d signal is transmitted to the blackjack driver . That is, assuming a player activates this button at a gaming station , the blackjack driver  responds by requesting that the player input his\/her identification via, for example, placing an identification card in the card reader  and\/or a personal identification number via the player input area . Additionally, note that the button  may be pressed at the end of a blackjack game for indicating that the player wishes to play another blackjack game. Note that in one embodiment of the present invention when consecutive games are played by a player, the player need only press the button  to commence a new game. That is, the player's identification need not be entered for each consecutive game played (assuming the button  is activated within a predetermined time after the last game has terminated).","The player input area  also includes a quit button  that a player may press to explicitly indicate the player's desire to terminate any further gaming at the gaming station .","Additionally, buttons  through  provide the player with the capabilities to request the following blackjack gaming requests:\n\n","Note that subsequent to requesting a bet via the \u201cBET\u201d button , the buttons  through  are activated so that the player may input various betting amounts. In particular, buttons  through  provide the player with the option to bet $5.00 (button ), $25.00 (button ), $100.00 (button ) and $500.00 (button ). Moreover, a sequence of the buttons  through  may be pressed for obtaining a bet not provided by a single button. For example, to bet $130.00, the player presses consecutively each of the buttons ,  and  (in any order) exactly once.","The player input area  also includes various confirm and cancel buttons  through . The accept button  allows the user to accept a last input. For example, it is an aspect in the present embodiment of the invention that after each user input, the input is accepted either by the player explicitly pressing the accept button  or by allowing a predetermined amount of time to expire after the last player input. The \u201cCANCEL BET\u201d button  allows the user to cancel an immediately preceding bet that was input. However, note that if a time limit is exceeded for placing a bet due to, for example, the player pressing the \u201cCANCEL\u201d button , then any minimum bet required will be automatically wagered on the player's behalf by the wager accounting module . Further, the \u201cCANCEL LAST\u201d button  may be used by the player to cancel the immediately preceding wager of one of the dollar amount buttons  through . Thus, if a player intended to bet $125.00 by pressing first the button  followed by the button  but instead pressed the button sequence  and , then the player may press the button  for cancelling the $500.00 bet associated with button  and subsequently the player presses the button  to obtain the desired bet of $125.00. Note further that pressing the \u201cCANCEL LAST\u201d button twice in succession also cancels the entire bet.","A \u201cSPEED OF PLAY\u201d button  may be optionally provided on the player input area . This button allows the player to specify to the blackjack driver , for example, the predetermined amount of time after a player input to wait before each subsequent input is automatically accepted. In one embodiment of the present invention, the \u201cSPEED OF PLAY\u201d button  includes active areas at each end of the button, wherein if the user presses the \u201cslower\u201d end of the button , then the predetermined time(s) for automatically accepting a player input is lengthened. Alternatively, if the player presses the \u201cfaster\u201d end of the button , then the predetermined default acceptance time(s) becomes shorter. However, it is important to note that the tempo of the blackjack game is, using the present invention, no longer as important as in typical blackjack gaming situations. That is, since each blackjack player using the present invention is not playing in sequence with other players, there is less concern about speedily playing so as not to delay other players.","Lastly, the player input area  includes a \u201cHELP\u201d button  for allowing the player to request assistance from, for example, the personnel of the gaming establishment providing the gaming station .","Referring now to display area , the screen display provided here is but one of a number of contemplated screen layouts for the present invention. In particular, the screen layout illustrated in display area  is a representative layout for use in playing tournament blackjack. Thus, when other modes of blackjack are played other than tournament blackjack, then it is within the scope of the present invention to modify the fields represented in the display area  according to the player needs for the type of blackjack being played. Further, it is important to note that in one embodiment, the display  is in color so that, for example, diamonds and hearts are in red and spades and clubs are in black, and various fields of the display area  may be highlighted for focusing a player's attention on the portion of the display providing information most relevant to the player's currently permissible options.","Describing now the fields currently presented in display , at the top of the display is the house hand area : (a) for providing a representation of the cards that have been dealt to the house; (b) for providing a status of the house hand (i.e. one of: \u201cSTND\u201d for standing, \u201cBUSTED\u201d, when the value of the house hand exceeds 21, and \u201cCONTINUING\u201d when the house may take additional hits. That is, this field provides an annotation \u201chouse hand:\u201d followed by a representation for at least one card that has been dealt to the house; i.e., an ace of hearts. In the player's hand area  of the display area , there are five columns providing information related to each blackjack hand the player is currently playing in the blackjack game. The columns provide the following information:\n\n","Below the player hand area  is the player information area  wherein additional blackjack gaming information relating to the player is displayed. In particular, labeled line  displays the most recent bet amount that the player has requested along with a tag indicating the status (e.g., \u201cACCEPT\/CANCEL\u201d) of the most recent bet. Note that the status may be: (a) \u201cACCEPTED\u201d for explicitly or implicitly indicating the acceptance of a displayed wager (via the player pressing the accept button  or by default due to a time limit expiring); (b) \u201cCANCELLED\u201d for explicitly indicating the cancellation of the last entered wager (via the player pressing either of the cancel buttons  or ); (c) \u201cREJECTED\u201d, this status being displayed due to the wager accounting module  rejecting the player's most recent bet; and (d) \u201cACCEPT\/CANCEL\u201d for indicating that the present invention is waiting a predetermined amount of time for the player to explicitly accept or cancel the most recent bet. Thus, in the example of line  in , the player has indicated a most recent bet of $30.00 and the blackjack driver  has output a status of \u201cACCEPT\/CANCEL\u201d as in (d) above. Further note that the blackjack hand(s) to which this most recent bet applies may be designated in any of a number of ways such as, for example, highlighting the row(s) in the player hand area  of the blackjack hand(s) to which the most recent bet of line  applies. Alternately, an indicator such as arrows  may be used as in  to indicate to the player that the most recent bet is to be applied to both the upper and lower blackjack hand(s).","Additionally, note that line  displays the annotation \u201cINSURANCE BET:\u201d together with any insurance amount that has been bet by the player. Accordingly, the dollar amount on line  and the notation at the right end of the line pertain, respectively, to the amount that has been bet as insurance, and the status of this bet (i.e., one of \u201cACCEPTED\u201d, \u201cCANCELLED\u201d, \u201cREJECTED\u201d or \u201cACCEPT\/CANCEL\u201d as in line ).","In line  of the player information area , the total amount of funds available by the player for betting is displayed. For example, line  of  indicates that the player has a total amount for betting of $1,000.00. Note that the wager accounting module  maintains this total amount available for betting and updates it after each blackjack game.","The lower three lines ,  and  of the player information area  provide blackjack player information that is particularly useful when playing in a blackjack tournament. Thus, the information in these three lines may not be displayed when the present invention is used by players not in a tournament. In line , two fields are provided for displaying playing time information. The leftmost field, annotated by the label \u201cELAPSED PLAYING TIME:\u201d, displays the total amount of time the player has played blackjack (which in this case is 45 minutes). Alternatively, the rightmost field, annotated by the label \u201cREMAINING PLAYING TIME:\u201d, displays the time remaining in the tournament.","In line  an identifier for any tournament associated with the present blackjack game is displayed.","In line , up to two additional fields are provided that are useful in tournament blackjack. The leftmost field having an annotation of \u201cGAMES PLAYED:\u201d displays to the player the number of blackjack games he\/she has completed within a tournament. Note that in some blackjack tournaments each player is required to complete a certain predetermined number of games within a predetermined allotted time period. For example, a blackjack tournament may require each player to play 50 games within a predetermined interval (such as four days). Relatedly, but optionally, in blackjack gaming contexts where the total number of blackjack games in the tournament is meaningful, the rightmost field of line , having the annotation \u201cGAME NUMBER:\u201d, displays to the player the total number of tournament games that have been completed thus far in the tournament. Accordingly, using at least the leftmost annotated field in line  and \u201cREMAINING PLAYING TIME:\u201d annotated field of line , the player is able to determine the number of remaining games in the tournament that he\/she must play.","Further note that other blackjack game values are contemplated by the present invention. For example, a field providing the number of games remaining that a player must play in the tournament may be added (or substituted for) in addition to the current values in the player information area .","In a next display  lower area, denoted the rules area , blackjack house rules are displayed. In particular, the house rules displayed in area  allow variations upon the typical blackjack rules that a player is likely to assume if not presented with information to the contrary. Note that by providing these additional rules on the display of gaming stations , successive blackjack games may be provided with different house blackjack rules thereby creating an increased interest in each game by the players and requiring additional blackjack playing skills from the players. Note that three house rules are provided in the present display area . That is, (a) insurance for the present blackjack game pays 3 to 1 odds (instead of the typical 2 to 1 odds); (b) the player may double down after splitting only once; and (c) the minimum bet is $25.00 for the current game.","Lastly, the display  includes a player identification area  for identifying the player currently playing blackjack at the gaming station . The present player area , includes a field having the current player's name (e.g., I. R. SMITH). However, other fields identifying the player are also contemplated by the present invention including, for example, a player identification number such as the number that may be encoded upon a player identification card used in conjunction with the card reader  for identifying the player.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0102","num":"0129"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["14","14","308","318","14","324"]},"Accordingly, describing the web site  in more detail, it includes an Internet interface  for receiving and supplying communications between the Internet  and the remainder of the web site . The Internet interface , in turn, communicates with World Wide Web server : (a) for validating and\/or initiating registration of web site users (e.g., blackjack players) at web site ; and (b) for interpreting Internet requests for routing and\/or activating web site  modules that can fulfill such requests. Thus, the World Wide Web server  may access the database system  for determining the registration identity of, for example, a blackjack player. Additionally, upon receiving user registration confirmation regarding an Internet (e.g., World Wide Web) request, the World Wide Web server  activates instantiations of modules known as common gateway interface (CGI) scripts, each CGI script  instantiation (or, for simplicity, each such instantiation also being referred to as a CGI script ) being: (a) for interpreting and processing Internet requests according to the semantics of a web site  application associated with the CGI script; and (b) for constructing Internet responses from output from the associated application. Thus, there are one or more common gateway interface modules provided wherein each CGI script  (instantiation) invokes the blackjack game controller  to process a single Internet blackjack request from an Internet client node  where a player is playing blackjack, and subsequently the CGI script  constructs an appropriate Internet response from the output received from the blackjack game controller .","Since the embodiment of the blackjack game controller  of  is substantially identical to that of , a description of its internal structure is not repeated here. However, it is worthwhile to note that the embodiment of  is particularly appropriate when the blackjack game controller  executes on a different or remote processor from that of, for instance, the processor performing the CGI script(s) . Further, note that if the blackjack game controller  executes on the same processor as the other web site  modules of , then the communication interface  may be unnecessary, and additionally, much of the functionality of the other components of the blackjack game controller  may be incorporated into one or more CGI scripts . Thus, for example, the blackjack player evaluator  functionality may be incorporated into one CGI script  while house blackjack playing module  functionality may be incorporated into another CGI script.","There are also noteworthy distinctions between the gaming stations  of  and the Internet client nodes  of  as well as distinctions in blackjack play interactions. For example, the following distinctions may be provided:\n\n","In , a flowchart is presented of the high level steps performed by the blackjack game controller  when processing player requests in either of the embodiments of  for playing a novel blackjack variation wherein new eligible card representations are generated periodically regardless of whether they are dealt in a blackjack game or not and wherein the blackjack players may play the game asynchronously from one another. In step , the blackjack game controller  is initialized so that it may process blackjack player requests and output appropriate responses to each player's request. Subsequently, in step , the card generator module  commences to output at regular intervals (e.g., less than two seconds such as every 0.5 seconds) random card representations to both the blackjack player evaluator  and the house blackjack playing module . Thus, for as long as the blackjack game controller  is properly responding to blackjack player requests, the card generator module  continuously and regularly outputs card representations. Concomitantly with the actions in step , the remaining steps of  are performed. Thus, in step , the controller  waits for a (next) blackjack player input, such inputs being, for example, requests to enter a new blackjack tournament, requests to commence a new blackjack game within a tournament, requests to process a blackjack game play request, a request for information regarding the players account, and a request for help information (such as how to play blackjack).","Upon receiving a blackjack player request, in step  the communication interface  queues the request and subsequently transmits the request to the blackjack driver . In step , a determination is made as to whether the players request is related to a current blackjack game and\/or current blackjack tournament. If not, then step  is encountered wherein an additional determination is made as to whether the player's request is to enter a new blackjack tournament. If so, then in step  the blackjack driver  determines a blackjack tournament and enters the player into the tournament. Note that in providing this function, the blackjack player  communicates with the wager accounting module  to confirm that the player is eligible to enter a new tournament. Thus, the blackjack driver  supplies the wager accounting module  with at least the player's identification and a specification of the tournament in which the player may be entered. Note that the tournament selection may be provided by the player in some embodiments of the present invention. Alternatively, the blackjack driver  may select a tournament for the player using tournament information stored in the database system . Assuming that the wager accounting module  responds with a confirmation that the player may be entered into the selected tournament, in step , the blackjack driver  creates a confirmation record identifying the blackjack tournament in which the player is entered. Subsequently, in step  the blackjack driver  outputs information in the confirmation record to the player at his\/her Internet client node  (gaming station ). Thus, in the embodiment of  of the present invention, the output of step  (and all subsequent such outputs to a blackjack player) are output from the blackjack driver  to the communication interface  for queuing until the output can be transmitted to the CGI script  that initiated the player request to which this output is a response. Subsequently, the output is transmitted to the World Wide Web server  and to the Internet interface  for transmitting on the Internet  and thereby being routed to the Internet client node  where the player is playing blackjack.","Following step , in step , the blackjack driver  enters, into the database system , information indicating the blackjack tournament in which the player has been entered. Note that the information entered here into the database system  is subsequently accessible both by the blackjack driver  and the wager accounting module  for determining the tournament(s) in which the player has been entered. Following this step, since the player's request has been processed, the flow of control loops back to step  to wait for the next player input from a player at an Internet client node  or alternatively a gaming station .","Returning now to step , if the player has not requested to enter a blackjack tournament then step  is encountered to process any miscellaneous blackjack player requests not related to a current blackjack game and\/or blackjack tournament. For example, a player may request accounting information related to his\/her blackjack gaming account. Assuming such requests are processed and responded to in this step, the flow of control again returns to step  to wait for a next player input.","Returning now to step , if the player request is related to a current blackjack and\/or blackjack tournament, then step  is encountered wherein the blackjack driver  uses the player's identification (ID) provided with the request for retrieving any status information from the database system  regarding any current blackjack game and\/or blackjack tournament in which the player may be currently involved. Subsequently, in step , a determination is made as to whether the player request is to commence a new blackjack game in a current tournament. If so, then in step  the blackjack driver  requests confirmation from the wager accounting module  that the player can commence with a new blackjack game in the current tournament. That is, the wager accounting module  determines whether the player has sufficient tournament credits to continue in the tournament. Following this, in step , the blackjack driver  determines whether a confirmation has been received from the wager accounting module . If no such confirmation is provided, then in step , the blackjack driver  outputs a message to the player at his\/her Internet client node  (gaming station ) indicating that no further blackjack games in the current tournament may be played by the player.","Alternatively, if in step  the blackjack driver  receives confirmation from the wager accounting module , then in step  the blackjack driver  creates a blackjack game record for fulfilling the player's request. Note that in creating the new blackjack game data record, the blackjack driver  communicates with the wager accounting module  to both debit the player's account for any initial ante corresponding to commencing the new blackjack game and also to output to the blackjack driver  data of this transaction for subsequently outputting to the player. Following this step, in step , the blackjack driver  requests the blackjack player evaluator  to provide an initial blackjack game configuration for the new blackjack game. Subsequently, in step , the blackjack player evaluator  responds with an initial blackjack game configuration, wherein this configuration includes the initial card representation for the player's hand (as shown, for example, in area  of ). Note that this initial card representation is the most recent card representation provided to the blackjack player evaluator  by the card generator module . Thus, note that if two player requests to commence a new blackjack game were transmitted to the blackjack driver  in rapid succession, then step  may be performed for each of the requests before the dealer module  outputs a new random card representation to the blackjack player evaluator . Consequently, in such a case both players will be presented with an identical initial card representation for the player's hand. Subsequently, in step , the blackjack driver  stores information regarding the identity and initial configuration of the new blackjack game for the player in the database system . In particular, a blackjack game identifier for the new game is stored and associated with the identity of the blackjack player and the tournament to which the game is associated. Following step , in step , the blackjack driver  stores information regarding the new blackjack game for the player in the database system . In particular, the following information is stored regarding the initial configuration of the new blackjack game: the player's identity, the identity of the tournament for which the new game corresponds, and identifier identifying the new game, and an initial configuration for the new blackjack game including card representations and any initial required bets. Further, note that throughout the course of each blackjack game played by a player, the blackjack driver  and the wager accounting module  update information in the database system  as the game configuration changes due to interactions between the player and the blackjack game controller . Thus, for a blackjack game underway, each request from a player for continuing the game with a next play, need not provide the entire game configuration to the blackjack game controller . Instead, only sufficient information is required in the request for the blackjack driver  and\/or the wager accounting module  to retrieve information related to the blackjack game configuration corresponding to the player's request. Following step , in step , the blackjack driver  outputs an initial blackjack game configuration for the new game to the player at his\/her Internet client node  (gaming station ). Subsequently, the flow of control once again returns to step  to await a next player input to the controller .","Returning now to step , if it is determined here that the player request is not to commence a new blackjack game in a current tournament, then step  is encountered wherein a determination is made as to whether the player request is related to a play in a currently active blackjack game. If not, then in step  the blackjack game controller  processes miscellaneous requests such as, for example, a request for special blackjack rules relating to a current game and\/or tournament, the number of players remaining in the current tournament, the player's ranking in the current tournament, and the prizes for winners of the current tournament. Subsequently, assuming such miscellaneous requests are responded to, in step , the flow of control for the present flowchart returns to  to await a next player input.","Alternatively, if in step  the player request is related to a play in a currently active blackjack game, then in step  a further determination is made as to whether the player request is for a new card representation. If so, then in step , a determination is made as to whether the card request is for the house or for the player. If the card request is from the house, then in step  the blackjack driver  communicates with the house blackjack playing module  for obtaining a new blackjack game configuration for the current blackjack game, wherein the new game configuration includes the most recently output card representation from the card generator module  as the next card representation in the house hand for the blackjack game from which the current player's request came. Subsequently, in step  the house blackjack playing module  outputs blackjack game configuration information indicating the new house hand card representation and any player response(s) that the player may exercise in responding to the new blackjack game configuration.","Upon receiving the house blackjack playing module  output, in step , the blackjack driver  determines whether there is a further player response in the present game by invoking one or both of the blackjack player evaluator  and the blackjack hand evaluator . If there are additional possible player responses, then in step  the blackjack driver  outputs a blackjack game configuration to the player at his\/her Internet client node  (gaming station ) so that the player may exercise one of his\/her available game options. Subsequently, having processed the player's request the flow of control again loops back to step  to await a next player input. Alternatively, if in step  the blackjack driver  determines that there are no further possible player responses, then the current blackjack game is complete and the blackjack driver  in step  activates the blackjack hand evaluator  for evaluating the blackjack game hands so that the blackjack hand evaluator can activate the wager accounting module  to update the player's account (according to the results of the blackjack game) in the database system . Following this step, in step  the wager accounting module  outputs to the blackjack driver  updated accounting information to be provided to the player. In step , the blackjack driver  outputs the results of the blackjack game and the players updated account information to the player. Also, note that the blackjack driver  updates the database system  regarding the completion of the present blackjack game as well as any further status information related to the player and the tournament to which the present blackjack game is associated. Subsequently, having processed the player's request, the flow of control again loops back to step  to await a next player input.","Alternatively, if in step  it is determined that the player's request is for a new card representation for the player, then in step  the blackjack driver  activates the blackjack player evaluator  for obtaining a new blackjack game configuration for the current blackjack game, wherein the new game configuration includes the most recently output card representation from the card generator module  as the next card representation for the player's hand(s). Subsequently, in step  the blackjack player evaluator  determines the next blackjack play options the player may exercise for the present game and then outputs the new blackjack configuration with these options to the blackjack driver . Following this, the steps  and subsequent steps are performed as described above.","Returning now to step , if the player request is not for a new card representation then step  is encountered wherein the blackjack game controller  processes other blackjack player game requests such as requests for additional bets, cancellations of bets, a request to stand on a particular player hand, a request to split a pair of card representations, or a request for insurance. Assuming, that such requests as described above are processed, in step  the blackjack driver  subsequently outputs a new blackjack game configuration to the player according to the processing performed in step . Also, note that the blackjack driver  updates the database system  with information relating to the new blackjack game configuration so that it may be retrieved upon a subsequent player request relating to the present game. Following this step, the flow of control for the present flowchart loops back to step  to again wait for another player input.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0117","num":"0148"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["14","604","38","604","606","606","610","626","604","606","610","604","42","38","610","604","604","610","38","38","38","38"]},"Continuing now with the remaining plays of blackjack game , note that in the fifth time interval the player requests a hit thereby obtaining a card representation having a value of nine and thus obtaining a player's hand value of nineteen. Subsequently, the house takes hits for the next two consecutive card representations having values eight and ten respectively. Thus, the house hand busted when the value of twenty-three was obtained for the house hand.","Blackjack game rows  for blackjack games  through  may be interpreted similarly to the description above for blackjack game . Note however that each of these games commence at a different time interval in that each game commences with a different card representation taken as the first hit for the player's hand. That is, the first card representation dealt in each of the blackjack games  through  is different and further each of the card representations requested corresponding to values of the sequence  is different for each blackjack game. Therefore, substantially every blackjack game, even if played concurrently with other blackjack games, will have unique player hands and house hands. Thus, not only can a large number of asynchronous blackjack games be played simultaneously head-to-head with the house, but also there may be a greater degree of confidence by the blackjack players that the house is not manipulating card representations in that blackjack players may substantially determine the timing for substantially all hits in a blackjack game (for both the player hand and the house hand) and thereby reduce any suspicions that the card representations are being manipulated. Moreover, in one embodiment, the players may request the sequence of card representations that were generated during the course of a game.","Note that the present invention also may include other blackjack variations as well. In particular, referring to step  () again, instead of generating card representations at regular intervals, this step may simply activate the card generator module  so that it generates a substantially random card representation on demand whenever a request for a new card representation is made (e.g., steps  and ).","Additionally, in another blackjack variation, particularly suited for tournament blackjack where each player can be monitored, the players play each play for a blackjack game synchronously as blackjack is typically played with a human dealer in casinos. However, in the present variation, each player is provided with the identical card representations for their initial cards. Subsequently, each player hand and the house (i.e., dealer) hand varies between players only when players play their blackjack hands differently. That is, for each synchronously played blackjack game among a plurality of players, the same sequence of card representations is available to each player and the house blackjack playing module  so that, for example, the dealt card representations in each game between one of the players and the house blackjack playing module are identical for players playing the same sequence of plays throughout the game. Accordingly, as one skilled in the art will appreciate, for each blackjack game, it may be necessary for the card generator module  to maintain a predetermined sequence (or ordered collection) of card representations throughout the game so that layers playing differently may be dealt an appropriately sequenced card representation. Moreover, it may also be necessary for the house blackjack dealer playing module  to provide sufficient control information to the card generator module  so that the card generator module can respond with the appropriate card representation from the predetermined sequence.","Another embodiment of the present invention is presented in , wherein this embodiment is enhanced for presenting sponsor or advertiser product and\/or service advertising to qualified players that adequately match a predetermined player profile such as a demographic profile of a particular group of players. Accordingly, in , there is a game\/advertisement controller  for providing substantially the same functionality as the blackjack game controller  () except that games other than blackjack may also be played (such as poker, craps, pai gow and roulette). Additionally, the game\/advertisement controller  also performs functions related to matching particular advertising with the users (i.e., players) playing the various games provided by the game\/advertisement web site , wherein each user communicates with the web site  on a corresponding Internet client node  (alternatively interactive cable television node). That is, the present  present the high level modules for matching players having desired user characteristics (e.g., profiles) with advertising from sponsors or advertisers requesting players with such user characteristics. In particular, only the players with such desired profiles qualify for receiving a particular advertisement and\/or promotional (i.e., advertising) from a particular sponsor or advertiser. Accordingly, it is an aspect of the present invention that various criteria may be used to make such a determination as to which players (or, more generally, users) receive which advertising. For example, one or more of the following attributes may be used in matching users with advertising presentations:\n\n","To provide (or, match) particular users with particular advertising, data (or user information items) on each user is maintained in the form of a user profile in the user (player) database  which is an enhanced version of the blackjack player registration and playing status database  of . The user profiles are populated with such user related information as in (8.1) through (8.11). This information is obtained when users register at the web site  when users respond to explicit questions subsequently asked of them, or by monitoring the network activities of users. Note that user profiles may vary in length, depending on the amount of information obtained on each user. Moreover, different types of information may be obtained for different types of users. For example, for users having assets of more than one million dollars, these users may be requested to enter their favorite vacation destination location since this may be important for certain advertisers. However, for users whose assets are less than forty thousand dollars, no such information may be obtained since the information would be likely irrelevant to any advertiser. Thus, in one embodiment of the user profiles, each user profile has a variable length section for storing user information items not uniform across all users. Moreover, in such an embodiment, each user information item stored in the variable length section may be considered as a pair, wherein the first component of each pair indicates or references a question, user attribute, or user classification to which the second component provides an answer or value related to the first component. Thus, for example, for a particular user, an information item may provide the pair: (4, \u201cMadrid\u201d), wherein \u201c4\u201d identifies the attribute: \u201cfavorite vacation destination location,\u201d and \u201cMadrid\u201d is the value for this attribute, as one skilled in the art will understand.","Alternatively, data related to the advertisers or sponsors may reside in a different database, the advertiser database . Accordingly, this database stores demographic profiles which, in one embodiment, have a data structure substantially identical to the user profile data structure. Such demographic profiles may have a variable length section for specifying requested values for user information items that may be provided in (potentially only a relatively small number of) user profiles. In some embodiments, a demographic profile includes a reference to the advertiser's or sponsor's identity, a reference to the advertising to be presented and a variable length section of demographic item pairs, wherein the first component of each pair has the same interpretation as the first component of a user information item pair and the second component of the pair specifies a desired value or range of values that the advertiser or sponsor prefers. Further, note that, in some embodiments, each demographic item pair may have additional information associated with it such as a perceived importance of the demographic item pair to the advertiser or sponsor. Thus, such additional information may be in the form of a normalized scalar value wherein a value of one indicates that the demographic item pair is of highest importance whereas a value of zero indicates that the demographic item is substantially irrelevant to the advertiser or sponsor. Accordingly, regardless of the particular embodiment of the demographic profiles, the users' demographic profiles are used to match (i.e., select) one or more corresponding advertising presentations with a particular target group of users that, presumably, are likely to purchase the product and\/or service portrayed in such advertising presentations. Thus, since such advertising presentations may be provided to only users who are likely to be subsequent customers, advertisers and\/or sponsors may provide to these users specifically targeted advertising having relatively expensive promotionals such as product or service discounts, free samples, or a trial usage.","Accordingly, to perform the selecting or matching of users with such demographic profiles, for each user, the user profiles stored in the user database  are compared with the demographic profiles by the advertising selection engine . Note that there are numerous techniques for performing such a comparison for selecting a group of users. In particular, a precise match may be required between each demographic item pair and a corresponding user information item pair so that the second component of the user information item pair is (within) a desired range as specified in the corresponding demographic item pair. Alternatively, various weighting statistical techniques may be used for determining a \u201csimilarity\u201d measurement when not all demographic pairs are required to precisely match a demographic profile. In one embodiment, the similarity measurement may be provided by a statistical analysis module that determines the users that most closely match the corresponding demographic profile for an advertising presentation. Thus, in order for a user to be selected, the similarity measurement between the user's profile and a corresponding demographic profile may be required to be above a predetermined threshold. Additionally, note that the advertising selection engine  may perform the matching of users with advertising presentations as a background or non-real time process so that, for example, for each user profile in the user database , there is a related table identifying the advertising presentations that are candidates for presentation to the corresponding user when, for instance, this user communicates with the game\/advertisement web site .","Moreover, it is important to note that at least in one embodiment of the present invention, the advertising selection engine  may, for a particular demographic profile, periodically re-evaluate user profiles in the user database  for reselecting the group of users to which an advertising presentation is to be presented. Thus, users previously selected may be requalified or disqualified and users previously disqualified may be now qualified for selection due to, for example, an enhanced user profile.","Accordingly, the present invention may commence or cease transmitting a category of advertising to a user whose user profile is enhanced with additional information. For example, if a user indicates that he\/she is currently considering the purchase of a new car, then advertising for purchasing a car may be transmitted to the user. Alternatively, once the present invention is notified that, for example, a car has been purchased or that no further car advertising is are desired, then a further enhancement of the user's profile may be performed so that no further advertising from the category of car advertising is transmitted to the user.","Note that the present invention provides for flexibly creating, deleting and modifying categories of advertisements by providing techniques for linking demographic item pairs that are similarly related to a category record or object. Thus, at least the following advertising categories may be provided by the present invention: sports categories (e.g., baseball, soccer, hockey, etc.), food related categories (e.g., restaurants, grocery stores, food items), exercise related advertising (e.g., bicycles, in-line skates, skiing), insurance related advertising (e.g., auto insurance, life insurance), political related advertising (e.g., for or against a particular political candidate), and geographical related advertising (e.g., for users living in a particular area such as the Denver metropolitan area). Thus, the advertising selection engine  supplies the selected advertising presentations to the HTML display engine  for translating this data so that it may subsequently be included in an HTML output to the user by the common gateway interface .","More precisely, the selected advertisement data is joined in the HTML display engine  (at least in one operation of the present invention) with a token  representing, for example, a gaming card (for a current user game) that has been issued by the token generator (module) , this generator being an enhanced version of the card generator module  of . The generated token is supplied initially to the game play engine  for processing user gaming requests according to the rules of the game being played. That is, the game play engine  determines, for each available game: (a) how each token may be \u201cplayed\u201d; (b) who receives the token, for example, the user or the house playing module ; and (c) the result of playing the token. Note that in one embodiment, the token generator  generates tokens on request by, for example, the house playing module  and\/or the player options evaluators , wherein the tokens generated are appropriate to the game being played. Alternatively, in another embodiment, the token generator  may generate random tokens and the game play engine  transforms the tokens into appropriate randomized values for the games offered, as one skilled in the art will appreciate. Furthermore, other embodiments for supplying randomized tokens to a plurality of different games are within the scope of the present invention. Additionally, the game play engine  contacts the player database  to maintain the status of the user in relation to the particular game being played as well as the user's relationship to all of the other users (if, for example, the user is involved in a tournament offered at the game\/advertisement web site ). Note that, as one skilled in the art will appreciate, in one embodiment of the game play engine , its internal modules provide a similar architecture and functionality to the correspondingly labeled modules of , albeit additionally, for games other than blackjack (e.g., \u201chead-to-head\u201d poker, craps, roulette, and pai gow).","The common gateway interface or CGI scripts  transfer data between the HTML display engine  and the World Wide Web server  which, as one skilled in the art will understand, may be a plurality of high level executable programs as discussed in the description of CGI scripts  for . The World Wide Web server , in turn, transfers the data to the Internet TCP\/IP stack  that interfaces with the Internet  for transferring the data to an intended Internet client node  having an appropriate World Wide Web browser .","The present embodiment maintains information on the status of games being played and user responses to advertising in the user database . Moreover, additional advertiser specific information (e.g., desired demographic profiles, advertisements, promotionals, and information related to user responses) is provided in the advertiser database . Accordingly, as discussed above, the demographic profiles in the advertiser database  may include schemes or templates having fields for designating one or more of the attributes (8.1) through (8.11). Moreover, the databases  and  may maintain records of various types of pertinent statistics such as: (a) the advertising presentations presented to each user; (b) the time, date and number of presentations of a particular advertising presentation; and (c) the detected user responses to the advertising. Thus, this information may provide advertisers or sponsors with enhanced feedback as to the efficacy of their products, services and presentations thereof. Thus, by maintaining data regarding information on: (i) each game played, (ii) the users and (iii) the advertisers, the host computer  may maintain accurate records of every type of pertinent statistics such as: all advertisements seen by all users so that the time, date and number of views are available to the advertiser to confirm and verify e.g., (9.1) through (9.3) following, and additionally, an advertiser may be able to query the user and advertiser databases  and  to obtain such feedback as:\n\n","Referring now to , a diagram is presented providing one embodiment of the access routes or paths users navigate in accessing the features of the game\/advertisement web site . In particular, upon initiating Internet contact with the game\/advertisement web site , a user is first presented with the opening page  identifying the web site . Subsequently, the user can access the benefits and registration pages  for viewing general information related to web site  and also for registering at the web site (as is discussed in further detail below). Alternatively, the user may access one or more \u201cLobby\u201d pages  to view the gaming and information exchange capabilities as, for example, provided by advertisers. Assuming the user is registered at the game\/advertisement web site , the user may proceed from the LOBBY  to the game page , wherein a game  or game rules  can be selected for playing, via the introduction to game pages . Alternatively, the user may instead access one or more index pages  having, for example, listings of organizations to which the user may be allowed to access depending on the affiliations of the user (e.g., a member of a particular membership discount store chain). Additionally, from the index page(s)  substantially any user may access an advertisement or promotional provided by an advertiser on an advertiser page(s) . However, it is an aspect of the present invention that information related to certain promotionals provided by advertisers or sponsors are restricted. That is, such promotionals may be only presented to users having a demographic profile that has been determined by the present invention to be sufficiently compatible with a desired user profile for the advertiser or sponsor to warrant providing such a promotional. Thus, the present invention provides access to certain advertiser promotionals only to \u201cqualified\u201d users who are, for example, considered likely subsequent purchasers of the advertiser's products and\/or services. Additionally, such promotionals may also be presented to users who express an interest in a particular product or service advertised. For example, users who (a) request additional or supplemental information related to an advertised item, or (b) provide a favorable response to such advertising (by, for instance, indicating a preference for an advertised item), or (c) respond to a questionnaire related to personal information or marketing survey information may also be provided with information regarding promotionals. Thus, advertisers or sponsors may offer relatively substantial or expensive promotionals via the present invention to such users as well. Moreover, the present invention may also utilize such demographic profiles to prohibit a user not sufficiently matching such a demographic profile from gaining access to a corresponding promotional. Accordingly, in one embodiment of the present invention, when the user accesses an advertiser page , the user's profile (in the user database ) is compared with the demographic profiles in the advertiser data base  for determining any promotionals that can be presented to the user.","Moreover, from the index page  the user may be provided with the ability to link into various web sites or web site pages. That is, the user may be provided with the ability to link into another web site or web page at any time a link is made available (typically a hypertext link). Additionally, note that similar links may be accessible by users while playing a game . However, these links may generally hyperlink the user to an advertiser page  within the game\/advertisement web site  so that the user may be exposed to further information and\/or presented with promotional options for an advertised item. For instance, certain advertising hyperlinks may be integrated into the presentation of plays of a game . Accordingly, since an aspect of the present invention is to repeatedly integrate different advertising presentations (and any related hyperlinks) into the play of a game , a user may repeatedly be enticed to seek out additional information about different products or services by activating the related hyperlinks. Moreover, it is also an aspect of the present invention that when such hyperlinks provide the user with access to a different web site, that at least a portion of the display of the user's Internet client node  maintains a graphical format associated with the game\/advertisement web site , and that the user may leave and return to the web site  without the user being aware of accessing another web site. Moreover, by monitoring user input related to an advertising presentation, the present invention is able to provide feedback to an advertiser as to, for example, the number of times the advertising presentation is accessed by users for such additional information about products or services.","Also note that some advertisements (presented via advertiser pages  or as part of a game play presentation) may be interactive with the user wherein the user may perform a transaction such as making a reservation (e.g., an airline or hotel reservation). Further, a user may be given the opportunity to provide positive and negative opinions or responses on, for example, various advertisements, promotionals and other related matters by expressing such responses upon accessing advertisement related information. Thus, it is an aspect of the present invention to be able to conduct \u201ctest marketing\u201d in that statistically representative groups of users may be selected for determining:\n\n","Accordingly, input response data may be transmitted to the game\/advertisement web site  and retained for subsequent statistical evaluation. Thus, resulting aggregate statistics can be made available to, for example, advertisers or sponsors, thereby preserving the privacy of the users. In particular, statistics may be made available for:\n\n","Additionally, it is an aspect of the present invention that it may also maintain statistics (and\/or related information) for:\n\n","Accordingly, the following aspects of the present invention are noteworthy:\n\n","Such a referee will be available to resolve any dispute. Note that the user can notify the management operating the present invention of a problem via, for example, notification forms displayed when a notification button is activated.","Referring now to an alternative embodiment of the present invention presented in , wherein the game\/advertisement web site  coordinates with a third party Internet access service provider  (or interactive cable television provider) for providing Internet  (cable television) access to users on a reduced cost or free basis once a user has registered with the web server  (cable television provider). That is, the game\/advertisement web site  contacts the user's Internet service provider  and arranges to subsidize the user's Internet service charges in return for the gaming advertisement web site  being able to repeatedly download to the user's Internet client node  (or alternatively, interactive cable television node), unrequested information such as advertising for presentation to the user.","Accordingly, a prospective user of the present invention can sign up or register with the game\/advertisement web site  for reduced Internet service fees by dialing into an Internet service provider  with normal serial dialing and after gaining Internet access, subsequently log on to the web site  as a user identified by the generic user identifier \u201cNEW.\u201d Each user identified by \u201cNEW\u201d is forced into a connection with an enrollment or registration program so he\/she can provide information requested by the present invention that can subsequently be used in determining which advertising to present to this user according to, for example, advertiser preferences. Thus, when registration is completed, the present embodiment of the invention downloads, for example, an ad viewer program  and a communications daemon (e.g., ad receiver daemon ) to the user's Internet client node , wherein this daemon allows the game\/advertisement web site  to download to the user's Internet client node  unrequested information such as advertising repeatedly. Accordingly, assuming the daemon  is installed, the user may access not only the gaming and advertisement services of the web site , but also access substantially the entire Internet through the web site  at a reduced cost. Thus, whenever the end user processor  connects with the Internet service provider , the game\/advertisement web site  is alerted by the Internet service provider  and the DISPLAY ENGINE  starts up the downloaded daemon  via Internet communications with the user's Internet client node . Subsequently, the DISPLAY ENGINE  periodically sends selected advertising to the daemon . Accordingly, the daemon  utilizes the ad viewer program  to coordinate the display of the advertising presentation.","Note that various alternative embodiments related to the architecture and functionality of  are also within the scope of the present invention. For example, instead of communicating with a plurality of third-party Internet service providers  for determining when users registered with the present invention are accessing the Internet via subsidized Internet connections, the game\/advertisement web site  may include or be related to a dedicated Internet service provider  so that when a user registers with the present invention, the user is provided with a new Internet access code for the dedicated Internet service provider  and the user's Internet access fees may be subsidized.","However, regardless of how the present invention subsidizes Internet access, the game\/advertisement controller  is notified whenever each subsidized user connects to the Internet or disconnects from the Internet. Additionally, certain reliability features are included in the daemon  and ad view program  for assuring that advertising is indeed presented to the user. For example, there may be periodic transmissions from each subsidized user's Internet client node  to the web site  verifying that both the daemon  and the ad view program  are active. Note that whenever any advertising is received at the user's Internet client node , the daemon  transfers the advertising to the ad viewer program  which, in turn, converts the transmitted information to a displayable format and forces the display of the user's Internet client node  to present the advertising unobscured to the user.","Additionally, note that in certain contexts the DISPLAY ENGINE  may transmit a message to an Internet Service Provider  indicating that no further Internet access will be subsidized due to a predetermined number of advertising presentation display failures.","An additional and\/or alternative description of the embodiment of the present invention shown in  is as follows: users may use the present invention to access the INTERNET  on a reduced cost or free basis, by using whatever TCP\/IP SLIP\/PPP package they desire and registering with the web server . That is, a user can sign up or register by dialing into a terminal server with normal serial dialing and log on as a user identified by the identifier \u201cNEW.\u201d User \u201cNEW\u201d is then forced into a connection to an enrollment or registration program so he\/she can provide information requested by the present invention. When enrollment is completed, the present invention allows the user to download a communications daemon (e.g., ad receiver daemon ) to the user's Internet client node . The user may then install the daemon on their machine (Internet client node ) and dial-up with their favorite TCP\/IP package.","However, upon accessing the host , the user accesses basic functionality of the DISPLAY ENGINE  that starts up the downloaded daemon . The network host  periodically queries each active port on the terminal servers (e.g., Internet client node ) to get the IP addresses and then send a short message to the daemon  which is listening in on a specific port. The DISPLAY ENGINE  may also disable access by an end user machine  after a certain number of failures.","Note that the host  periodically sends an item to the downloaded daemon  to display. The daemon then displays the message (advertisement) in a window (of the WWW browser ) on the user's screen.","Referring to , a compensation model network site  is provided for coordinating and\/or controlling both the associated user-funded service(s) , and the associated prize-winning services . Note that the user-funded service(s)  and the prize-winning service(s)  may be incorporated into (more generally, accessible via) the compensation model site , or alternatively\/additionally, such service(s)  and\/or  may be substantially independent of the compensation model site . In particular, the service(s)  and\/or  may be operated or controlled by a different entity than the one that operates or controls the compensation model site .","The compensation model site  further includes (or provides access to) a registration module  for registering users  for accessing both the user-funded service(s)  and the prize-winning service(s) . The registration module  is interactive with each user (via the corresponding user's network station ) to be registered via network  communications with the network interface . The registration module  interacts with each user  for obtaining, e.g., user identification information, including name, address, email address, date of birth, and credit\/debit card information. Additionally, the registration module  may request additional user information such as the types of network services in which a user  is interested in participating, e.g., games of skill, games of chance, judged contests, development of user expertise in some area, etc. The registration module  may use the obtained registration information obtained from a potential user  to access the user database  for determining if there is a user already registered that may identify the potential user . Note, that data may be provided in the user information stored in the user database  indicating whether there is the possibility that the user has registered more than once with the compensation model site . However, generally, such user information may be only used to prevent the dispensing of a prize or winnings if it is determined that a user  entered the same instance of a prize-winning service under multiple user registrations.","The compensation model site  further includes (or provides access to) a service related criteria satisfaction module  which collects information on how each user  is progressing toward satisfying constraints related to the one or more user-funded services which the user  has committed to fulfilling. Such service related criteria may be specific to the one or more user-funded services  for which a user  has contracted. Such user data regarding satisfaction of service related criteria may be provided to the module  from a user-funded service  that the user  is able to access. However, if such user-funded services  are incorporated into (or operated by the operator of the compensation model site ), then at least some of the generic service related criteria (e.g., time interacting with a user-funded service ) may be tabulated directly by the module .","The compensation model site  also includes (or provides access to) an advertising selection engine  for providing advertising to be displayed at network stations  when user-funded services and\/or prize-winning services are being accessed by the users  of the network stations . For user-funded services  and\/or prize-winning services  incorporated into (or operated by the operator of the compensation model site ), such advertising may be directly joined with service presentations prior to transmission from the compensation model site  to a user network station . However, for user-funded services  and\/or prize-winning services  incorporated into (or operated by the operator of the compensation model site ), such advertising may be transmitted in a manner similar third party Internet advertising agencies such as DoubleClick\u00ae, wherein a service transmission received at a user network station  may include information for generating an additional request for advertising information from, e.g., the compensation model site . Note that the advertising selection engine  may select advertising from the advertising database  for presenting to users , and such advertising typically includes one or more hyperlinks that allow a user  viewing the advertising to activate the hyperlink and thereby receive additional advertising information from typically a corresponding advertiser's network site (e.g., Internet or website) as one skilled in the art will understand. However, such additional advertising information can also include alternative user interface techniques for presenting at least portions of the additional advertising information to the users . For example, such additional advertising may be transmitted (e.g., joined with service related information) so that when (if) a user  merely positions his\/her pointing device (\u201cmouses over\u201d with e.g., a mouse or trackball) on or over a display of an advertisement, then additional information is presented, and such additional information may be particularly targeted to the user; e.g., a sale of merchandise in which the user's profile indicates the user is interested. In one embodiment, there may be a designated portion of the user's network station display in which such additional advertising information is presented when the user mouses over a displayed advertisement. Such a designated portion may be similar to a news stream across, e.g., top or bottom portion of the network station display. In one embodiment, the advertising selection engine  attempts to match advertisements in the advertising database  with user profiles stored in the user database . A description of such a matching operation is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,712,702 fully incorporated herein by reference. Thus, advertising may be targeted to selected users  according to their interests, needs, life styles, etc.","The compensation model site  also includes a manager  for controlling and\/or coordinating the exchange of information between the users  and the modules , , , , and  of the compensation model site . Moreover, the manager  may join advertising to service presentations prior to transmission to a user(s) . Thus, since each of the user-funded services  and the prize-winning services  are likely to be interact with each of the users  (via their corresponding network stations ), the manager  may use display frame data for determining how to join selected advertising for display at a user's network station .","Regarding the user-funded service(s)  in more detail, this module\/network site may include a service related criteria satisfaction module  for determining and monitoring the progress of a user  toward satisfying the agreed to one or more criteria in order to use the user-funded service for free (e.g., have the user's service deposit refunded, or prevent the charging of a credit\/debit card of the user's). Thus, such a module  may monitor a user's interactions with the user-funded service for, e.g., an increase in proficiency of the user, an amount of time the user interacts with the service, a frequency with which the user interacts with the service, a number of submissions to the service (such as art, music or informational submissions, etc.). Accordingly, the module  may periodically provide the service related criteria satisfaction module  with information on users' individual progress. In particular, each module  provides the service related criteria satisfaction module  with information for identifying a user  that satisfied his\/her service related criteria, and information identifying a user  that did not satisfy his\/her service related criteria (and for which the user should have to pay for accessing the user-funded service). Accordingly, the user-funded service  provides service related criteria satisfaction\/dissatisfaction information to the manager  for storing in the user's data of the user database .","Regarding the prize-winning service(s)  in more detail, each such service  provides one or more contests that qualified users  may enter. Each such service  has at least one associated user-funded service  from which users  that satisfy the service related criteria for this associated service may elect to participate in a contest offered by the prize-winning service . Each contest preferably provides prizes to winners of the contest, and such prizes are of a sufficient value to motivate users  to both satisfy the service related criteria, and then win the contest. Each prize-winning service(s)  obtains its eligible users  from the service related criteria satisfaction module  (via the manager ). Moreover, the results of each contest (at least identifications of the winners, but in some embodiments, also those that did not win) are also communicated to the module  via the manager.","Regarding the service related criteria satisfaction module , this module may determine whether a winner of a prize-winning contest is eligible to collect his\/her prize. In particular, the module  may determine whether a winning user  has entered the contest more than a legitimate number of times.","Regarding the user database , the database may include the following fields for each user :\n\n","Regarding the services database , this database is accessed by the prize-winning service(s)  (via the manager ) for adding information on prize-winning contests when they become available for participation by users , and for deleting information on prize-winning contests when such contests are no longer available to be entered by users . Moreover, this database may include information on the prizes of contests, e.g., how\/who provided a prize for a contest, the value of the prize, the number of users  in the contest, the minimum and\/or maximum number of users  for the contest etc.","Regarding the advertising database , this database may include advertiser information as disclosed in the U.S. Pat. No. 6,712,702 fully incorporated herein by reference for a corresponding advertiser database.","The following pseudo-code may be performed by an embodiment of the compensation model  (together with

the user stands in satisfying service related criteria for an instance of a user-funded service (e.g., a game), and\/or for an instance of a prize-winning service instance. Moreover, such notification may be transmitted to the user's phone or cell phone. Additionally, an Internet feed and\/or instant message may be used to also allow a user to access the user-funded and\/or prize-winning service (e.g., blackjack, poker, and\/or chess). For example, a user might play a game while in a motor vehicle, and might even receive prizes or some type of \u201ccomps\u201d for playing. Voice recognition may also be used to allow the playing of games in an efficient manner, e.g., in a motor vehicle or other environment where the user's communication device available for receiving speech\/voice commands (e.g., a mobile phone). For instance, if a user is playing blackjack while in a motor vehicle, words and\/or phrases such as \u201chit me\u201d or \u201cfire\u201d may be used, since it is well within the state of voice recognition technology to readily recognize such simple phrases.","For a service (e.g., a game) being offered on a network, such as the Internet, wherein the interactions are essentially verbal by the user, the network site providing the service, in one embodiment, may user speech recognition processing and may also use text analysis processing. Text analysis processing is for recognizing a textual conversion of spoken dialogue for determining the actions requesting to be performed by a user. The text analysis functionality of the network site preferably includes identifying words and\/or phrases and\/or sentences that instruct the network site (e.g., a website) that then takes predetermined actions, and in performing such actions, the network site provides feedback to the user verifying the action(s) performed, either prior to or immediately after the action(s) is to be performed. For a user to play a game substantially verbally, game plays may be made by the user via spoken text or speech and such speech is translated into a stream of text transmitted to the network site, the network site then performs text analysis for determining a next game configuration requested by the user. Upon determining the likely user request, the network site then preferably acknowledges to the user the action(s) to be performed, and requests confirmation from the user to perform the action (e.g., the game play).","In one embodiment the network site may instruct the user regarding the words, phrases and or sentences which the network site recognizes for performing actions such as game plays (or other actions for other services). Alternatively\/additionally, the user may be able to use conventional speech without the network site providing predetermined speech patterns that the user must provide for the network site to perform particular actions. Accordingly, the network site processes user input and attempts to determine standard actions that are typically spoken to perform the service. For example, in blackjack when playing a game substantially verbally, the user may use the following phrases without being taught or without these phrases being specified by a blackjack playing website: \u201chit, stand, stay, double down, split, surrender\u201d whereas in poker, the words \u201craise, ante, fold, see you\u201d may be standard.","The present method and system for receiving compensation for network services provides numerous benefits over prior art business models for receiving compensation, including the following benefits.\n\n","In an alternative embodiment, some services may not require rigidly monitoring or assuring a single entry per user to a particular service (or instance thereof). Accordingly, in such circumstances, the activation fee or deposit may be increased to a level that generally inhibits a user from activating the service under multiple identifications or aliases since both a separate activation fee or deposit would be required for such user identification or alias.\n\n","Alternatively, if the operator wishes to derive revenue from offering coupons of advertisers, and\/or inexpensive items of advertisers, then the service related criteria may be made low enough so that most users satisfy the service related criteria, and subsequently the users may be given the option of selecting one or more coupons and\/or sponsor items in addition to, or in lieu of all or a portion of their activation fee or deposit. Moreover, since users satisfying the service related criteria will be provided with the opportunity to win additional, e.g., more substantial, prizes for free, users are likely to tolerate subsequent advertising during instances of the service for which such additional prizes may be won.","Additionally, user selection of particular coupons and\/or items as part of their refund (and\/or in addition to their refund) provides additional information about the users, and such information can be associated with the users' identities for presenting to such users additional advertising, coupons, and\/or sponsor products\/services that is likely to be of interest to the user.","If a fee is to be returned or refunded, instead of the fee being returned immediately, such fee may also be transferred by either the player or the site to another game, website, or another entity as agreed or as set forth in a predetermined agreement an operator of a network site providing (at least a portion) of the services for the compensation model.","In one embodiment, the user activation fee or deposit may be reduced if the user is identified by one or more other users as a user that motivated them to register for a user-funded service.","The advertising necessary to inform potential users of a network site that utilizes the present compensation model may be spread by word of mouth, and\/or various social networking sites. However, to facilitate awareness of such network sites, ads for such network sites may be placed upon disposable mats. In particular, such mats may provided in dressing rooms and other locations where people are concerned about their feet touching a floor due to concerns for cleanliness or the fear of contracting a foot disease\/infection. Such mats may have a water repelling surface on at least one of the sides and a germicide provided on the surface on the side that the user is to place his or her feet. Advertising may be placed upon at least one of the mat sides. The mats may be precut to a size large enough for a person's feet to avoid touching a floor's surface or the mat may be dispensed by using an \u201cendless\u201d roll\u2014or a roll from which many mats may be dispensed with the aid of perforations at various locations in the roll so that advertising mats may be used in said dressing rooms. Alternatively, such foot mats may be available in a plurality of sizes (e.g., similar to shoe sizes). Moreover, such foot mats may be secured to a person's foot via straps that adhesively adhere to one another or to the mat. The mats may be provided at little or no cost. Embodiments of such mats may be also used for \u201cplace mats\u201d upon which food may be placed. The advertising mats may also be made of a material and size that allows them to adhere to shirts or other material such as bed sheets. Additionally, such advertising may be provided in the form of stencils for placement upon bedding or wearing apparel, wherein such bedding or apparel may be provided at little or no cost to the public and\/or a third party.","The foregoing discussion of the invention has been presented for purposes of illustration and description.
