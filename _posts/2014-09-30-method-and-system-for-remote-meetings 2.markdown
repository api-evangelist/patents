{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS","Overview","Exemplary Embodiment"],"p":["The present disclosure generally relates to the user experience of an on-line meeting.","As the world becomes interconnected and \u201cflatter\u201d, more and more people are collaborating across the world, whether for business or other reasons. One consequence of this is that meetings are typically moving from being face-to-face meetings to virtual meetings. That is to say, participants are attending more meetings on-line. Since more and more people have smart phones and other hand held devices, many people are now using those devices, which have relatively small-screens, in order to attend these meetings.","When attending an on-line meeting, an attendee using a device with a small screen might want to zoom in on slides, text, or other displays. Such items might, however, be difficult to view, when not zoomed in, on a small screen.","A method, system and apparatus for a client device for remote meetings are described. A client device determines that a client device display screen is displaying a video image as enlarged, compares received regions of a received video image with regions of the displayed video image, determines that the compared regions of the received video image are different from the regions of the displayed video image, and stores received video frames comprising the received video image in a cache memory. Related systems, apparatus, and methods are also described.","Reference is now made to , which is a simplified pictorial illustration of a situation where a meeting host  of an on-line meeting is changing from a first slide  to a second slide . An attendee  of the meeting, viewing the meeting on a mobile device , is zoomed in on the first slide . When attending the on-line meeting, the attendee  may zoom in  with the small screen mobile device  in order to enlarge slides, text, or other displays, which might be difficult to see on a small display screen  when not zoomed in. In an embodiment described herein, if the attendee  zooms in  the display screen  of the mobile device  at the moment when the meeting host  changes from the first slide  to the second slide , the display screen  of the mobile device  continues to display the zoomed in first slide , as though the display is paused, and not updating.","Reference is now made to , which is a simplified pictorial illustration of a situation where the meeting host  of an on-line meeting is progressing in some manner with a presentation , , and the attendee  of the meeting, viewing the meeting on a mobile device , is not zoomed in on the content  (by contrast to ), but does wish to pause the content of the presentation . In  the meeting host  is depicted as sharing a presentation ,  over a cloud network . The display  of meeting host  indicates that elapsed time  for the present slide is 00:29 seconds on the mobile device  of the meeting host . However, because the attendee  has effectively paused the presentation, the display screen  of the mobile device  indicates that the elapsed time  is only 00:20 seconds, since the attendee  has paused the display, no received updates are displayed on the display screen .","Reference is now made to , which are, respectively, simplified pictorial illustration of the mobile device  (of ) of the attendee  () in various states.  depicts a notification  appearing on the display screen  of the mobile device . The notification  notifies the attendee  () that the meeting host  () has changed the content which the meeting host  () is sharing with the attendee  () as well as any other attendees who might be viewing the meeting.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 4","FIG. 1"],"b":["140","180","150","110","140","410","140","180","150","180","150","110","420","140"]},"It is appreciated that the sequence of events depicted in  may be applicable to either of the situations depicted in .","It is appreciated that double clicking the display screen  of the mobile device  is mentioned herein by way of example, and any appropriate manner of interfacing with or actuating the mobile device  may be used to input the user interaction with the mobile device . For example, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, a single click on the display screen  of the mobile device  may be used, actuating a button on the mobile device  may be used, or other appropriate user actions known in the art may be taken, in order to input the user's interaction.","Reference is now made to , which is a block diagram drawing of the mobile device  of  for use in an embodiment of the present invention. Typical implementations of the mobile device  include, but are not limited to a tablet device, smartphone, Internet-enabled television, media center PC, or any other suitable device, such as is known in the art.

The terms \u201cmobile device\u201d and \u201csmall screen\u201d are used solely for ease of depiction and description, and are not intended to be limiting.","The mobile device  comprises at least one processor , a user interface (typically a graphical user interface, GUI) , such as the display screen  (). The GUI  may display a single application, two applications which interact with each other, a Web browser or other appropriate application.","As mentioned above, the mobile device  may comprise more than one processor , one processor  of which may be a special purpose processor operative to perform the method of the present invention described herein. In addition, the mobile device  comprises non-transitory computer-readable storage media (i.e. memory) . The memory  may store instructions, which at least one of the processors  may execute, in order to perform the method of the present invention, as described herein. The mobile device  also comprises typical and standard hardware and software components as are known in the art.","The mobile device  comprises a communications bus  or other appropriate hardware, software, or a combination of hardware and software, as is known in the art, in order to facilitate communications between the various components described above comprising the mobile device .","The mobile device  comprises a client application  which will be described in greater detail below.","The mobile device  also comprises a storage device (not depicted) which may be used for caching data, such as a video cache.","Reference is now made to , which is a depiction of an embodiment as described with reference to of . In the embodiment depicted in , an application programming interface (API), which is available for use by a client application, such as, but not limited to an on-line meeting application, located in the mobile device , is utilized by hardware or software implementing embodiments of the present invention, in order to indicate if the display screen  is displaying an enlarged version of the display.","Such APIs are well known in the art. The API may have an object or method enabling the client application to determine zoom density. If there is no appropriate API based method for determining if the display screen  is displaying an enlarged version of the display or not (i.e. zoom density), the client application can use techniques known in the art in order to detect if the displayed content is zoomed in on, by comparing display screen  data with data from the original (i.e. the non-zoomed) video data such as the first slide  () and the presentation  ().","For Android devices, for example, a WebSettings.ZoomDensity object would be used to detect if the display screen  is displaying an enlarged version of the display. Apple devices use the uses zoomScale property to indicate zoom level.","A video image, such as the video image which is to be displayed on the display screen  is logically dividable into a plurality of small blocks . Of particular interest for the sake of this example are two of the plurality of small blocks , a first one of the plurality of small blocks , denoted block T, and a second one of the plurality of small blocks , denoted block T. The two blocks T and T are received as part of the video image to be displayed on the display screen  in updated video data received by the mobile device  from the cloud .","The mobile device , as noted above, comprises the client application . The client application  comprises a video cache , the utilization of which is described below, and the video display . The GUI  () may be implemented in the video display . As depicted in , each of the plurality of small blocks  is compared by the video client application  to the display screen  of the mobile device . For example, the received block T is compared, using conventional methods, to the display on the display screen  of the mobile device . In the present example, as a result of the comparing, block T is found not to match the corresponding portion of the display on the display screen  of the mobile device . Received block T is also compared to the display on the display screen  of the mobile device . If, for example, as a result of the comparing, block T is found not to match the display on the display screen  of the mobile device , in that no block of the plurality of small blocks  is found to match the video displayed on the display screen  of the mobile device , a notice, such as \u201cSharing Content Has Changed\u201d  then is made, by the client application , to appear on the display screen  of the mobile device .","However, if the display screen  of the mobile device  is found to match one of the plurality of small blocks , such as one of block T or block T, then the client application  takes no action (note that this scenario is not depicted).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":"670"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"203pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\/\/ check if the updated video data is in"]},{"entry":[{},"display region"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003Array updatedVideoData = {T0, T1, ...}"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003While (NotEmpty(updatedVideoData))"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003{"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003IsInDisplayRegion(updatedVideoData)"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003{"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003ShowNotification( );"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003TriggerNextProcess( );"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003}"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003Else"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003{"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\/\/ Do nothing"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003}"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003updatedVideoData++"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003}"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}}},"Reference is now additionally made to , which a depiction of the embodiment depicted in , where video is being paused .

A meeting server  manages the connection between a meeting host  and the meeting attendees' devices ,  (corresponding to device  of attendee  ()). The meeting host  comprises a meeting client . Similarly, the meeting attendees' devices ,  also comprise meeting clients , . Meeting clients , , and  correspond to client application  (). In order to stress that the attendee's device may be using either a mobile device  comprising the meeting client  or a desktop device  comprising the meeting client , both are depicted in . As was noted above, references to the mobile device  (, emphasis added) of the attendee  () are by way of example, and not meant to be limiting. Furthermore, it is appreciated that even if the devices  and  are both mobile devices, devices  and  would not necessarily have the same operating system, or the same network environment.","The inventors of the present invention believe that, at least in part, the lag between the host  and the attendees' device ,  is caused by video data size and the capability of the meeting server  and network . As is known in the art, at present, video meeting technology only transfers regions of the video image which change. So, when the host  changes a presentation from a first slide to a second slide, as is depicted in , only then will the changed regions be sent to the attendee devices , . It is appreciated that sending only video image regions which change is standard in video protocols, whether those protocols are members of the MPEG suites of protocols or they are proprietary protocols. Accordingly, when a large portion of the second slide is changed relative to the first slide, the delay time for the arrival of the video packets  at the attendees' device ,  are expected to be correspondingly large (i.e. closer to, or even exceeding, the 10 second delay noted above in the table). When the changes between the two slides are minor, the delay will correspondingly be small (i.e. closer to the 3 second delay noted in the table). This supports the contention that delay time is, at least in part, related to video data size. I.e., the more video packets  and associated data which needs to be transferred to the devices , , the more time the meeting server  requires to collect, package, compress, transfer, and cache the data. This leads to correspondingly larger delay times.","As the meeting host  is progressing to the next slide, while the meeting server  is processing the video packets  and associated data\u2014i.e. collecting, packaging, compressing, transferring, and caching the video packets  and associated data\u2014the meeting client  comprised in the meeting host  can, additionally, bypass these steps and send a notification flag  to the meeting client ,  comprised in meeting attendee's devices , . The notification flag  may be as small as a single byte, and there is no need for the meeting client  comprised in the meeting host  to perform the steps of collecting, packaging, compressing, transferring, and caching data in order to send the notification flag  to the meeting clients ,  comprised in the attendees' devices , . As such, the notification flag  should arrive at the attendees' devices ,  faster than the actual video data arrives.","The arrival of the notification flag  at the attendees' devices ,  will enable the meeting client ,  comprised in attendees' devices ,  to receive a notification that a change of the video content is imminent (see, for example, item  in  and item  in ). The arrival of the notification flag  will enable the attendees (i.e. attendee  ()) of the meeting to interact with the GUI  (), and either pause the video or advance to the new slide when the update video packets  arrive at the meeting client , . This process is described below in greater detail.","Reference is now additionally made to , which is a depiction of an embodiment of the present invention described with reference to . A meeting attendee's  () device  is depicted in  which corresponds, in a non-limiting fashion, to mobile device  of . After the mobile device  receives the notification flag , the display  of the mobile device  shows a notification  that a change of the video content is imminent. For example, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the display  shows the notification , \u201cCONTENT IS CHANGING, \u2018LONG SCREEN PRESS CAN HOLD CURRENT CONTENT\u201d.","As depicted in the lower portion of , when the user  performs a long press on the display screen  of the device , the video content on the display  (e.g. the slide show of ) can be paused. Once the long press is ended, the video content stored in the cache can then be displayed.","It is appreciated that the video is paused only on the display of the device  where the user  is performing the long press. The displays of other users and the presentation of the meeting host are unaffected. In both this and in other embodiments of the present invention described herein, it is appreciated that, in some embodiments, the presenter (corresponding to meeting host  ()) may receive a notification that the attendee  and  () are either pausing or zooming the displayed video. Providing this notification to the presenter (corresponding to meeting host  ()) enables the presenter (corresponding to meeting host  ()) to tailor the speed and zoom of the presentation to satisfy a majority or large plurality of attendees  and  (). Providing this notification also can enhance collaboration between the presenter\/meeting host  and  () and the attendees  and  (). Additionally, enabling the presenter\/meeting host  and  () to increase the responsiveness of the viewing practices of the attendees  and  () will improve the user experience of the attendees  and  ().","It is also appreciated that the use of \u201clong press\u201d as a way for the user to interact with the GUI  () is provided by way of example, and other appropriate interactions or actuations, for instance double clicking, which are well known in the art, may be used as well in an actual implementation of the present invention, e.g. for pausing and un-pausing the display. In some embodiments, where the device  supports such implementations, a voice command may be used to pause the video. Additionally, where supported, facial or eye motion may also be used to pause the video.","Reference is now additionally made to , which is a simplified flowchart of the method described above with reference to . In step  the presenter, who may be the meeting host  (), advances a slide show to the next slide. In step , the meeting client  determines if video regions displayed in the new slide are changing or not. One method for performing this determination is provided above, with reference to . If it is determined that there are no changes in video regions displayed, then the method ends until the next time the presenter advances to the next slide, and then the method returns to step . If the meeting client  determines that the video regions are changing in the new slide (step ), then two parallel processes are triggered.","In one of the two triggered parallel processes, the notification flag  is sent to devices of users (i.e. attendees)  (step ), such as the device , and mobile device  (). For the reasons explained above, the device  of the user  gets the notification flag  before any video data packets  are received (step ). In step , the user  is prompted to execute a long press of the display  of the device , in order to pause the video from progressing.","In the second of the two parallel processes, the meeting server  packages, compresses, etc. the video packets  (step ). The packaged, compressed, etc. video packets  from step  are then sent by the meeting server  to the cloud  for distribution to the meeting attendees' (remote) devices ,  (step ). The method then returns to step  and the user  is prompted to execute a long press of the display  of the device , in order to pause the video from progressing.","In step  the device ,  evaluates if the user  is continuing the long press. While the long press is maintained by the user , the device ,  continues to loop to step , enabling the user  to continue the long press. However, once the user  stops the long press, then in step video data appearing on the display screen  is refreshed by displaying the currently cached video data on the display screen  (step ).","Reference is now made to , which is a simplified flowchart of a method of implementation of an embodiment of the present invention. In step , the client device (such as device , ) determines whether or not the client device display screen (such as the display screen  ()) is displaying a video image as enlarged or not enlarged. In step , the method forks, and proceeds to step  if the client device display screen (such as the display screen  ()) is not displaying the video image as enlarged. In that case, the client device (such as device , ) takes no action. If, however, the client device display screen (such as the display screen  ()) is displaying the video image as enlarged, the method proceeds to step , and compares received regions of a received video image with regions of the displayed video image. In step , it is determined that the regions of a received video image are the same as the compared regions of the displayed video image, then the method proceed to step , and the client device (such as device , ) takes no action. However, if it is determined that the regions of a received video image are not the same as the compared regions of the displayed video image, then the method proceed to step , and received video frames comprising the received video image are stored in a cache memory.","It is appreciated that software components of the present invention may, if desired, be implemented in ROM (read only memory) form. The software components may, generally, be implemented in hardware, if desired, using conventional techniques. It is further appreciated that the software components may be instantiated, for example: as a computer program product or on a tangible medium.
