Each of the functions of the portable terminal , the printer , and the server  will now be described.","First, a description will be given for the function of the printer . The printer  includes a network communication part , an operation-information-obtaining part , an identifying-information-obtaining part , a printing part , an information display part , and an operation-instructing part . In the first embodiment, the printer  is presumed to be a single-function device. However, this is not provided by way of limitation; the printer  can also be a multifunction device provided with a scanner function or a copying function. In the operation-instructing part , the user operates an operation button or otherwise issues an instruction to each of the functional parts of the printer  to perform printing or another operation. The printer  includes a help button (not shown) as one of the operation-instructing parts . The help button is pressed when an error occurs in the printer  and the user wishes to learn the details of the error. The help button is also pressed when the method of operating the printer  is not known. In such an instance, the help button functions as a request-admitting part. The user presses the help button, whereby the help button admits a request for display of content that corresponds to the printer state.","The information display part  displays information necessary for the operation-instructing part  to instruct an operation. Also, in an instance in which an error of some type occurs in the printer , the information display part  displays information relating to the error that has occurred. In the present first embodiment, a liquid crystal panel of approximately several inches is assumed.","The network communication part  functions as a first transmitting part, and performs communication with the server  through a connection established via a wireless LAN or a similar network. The printing part  prints a print image on a paper sheet, based on an operation instruction sent from the operation-instructing part . In the present first embodiment, the printing method is assumed to be an ink-jet method, but this is not provided by way of limitation.","Pressing the help button of the operation-instructing part  triggers the operation-information-obtaining part  to obtain operation history information with regards to operation of the printer  by the user, and status information with regards to errors that occur in the printer . The obtained information is sent from the network communication part  to the server . In the present first embodiment, the help button represents the trigger for the operation-information-obtaining part  to obtain information. However, the trigger is not limited to the help button; it can be a variety of types of buttons arranged on the operation-instructing part .","The identifying-information-obtaining part  obtains information that can uniquely identify the printer , and adds the information to information that is sent (i.e., first information) when the operation-information-obtaining part  sends information to the server . In the present first embodiment, the identifying information is assumed to be a serial ID, which represents information for identifying the printer , but this is not provided by way of limitation. In the present embodiment, the operation-information-obtaining part  and the identifying-information-obtaining part  function as the first generating part.","Next, a description will be given for the function of the server . The server  includes a network communication part , a mail service part , a packet communication part , and a content service part . The content service part  includes a content-determining part , a content-link-information-generating part , and a content storage part . In the present first embodiment, the server  is configured from a single unit. However, this is not provided by way of limitation. The server  can be configured from a plurality of units, or can have a so-called cloud computing configuration provided with an application programming interface (API) for admitting various service requests. For example, the content service part  can be a service provided by a service server installed by the maker of the printer  in order to provide a service to users, and the mail service part  and the packet communication part  can be service provided by a base station installed by a telecommunication provider.","The network communication part  functions as a first receiving part, receives information sent from the printer , and sends the received information to the content service part . Information relating to the serial ID added to the information is sent to the mail service part .","Based on information sent from the printer , the content-determining part  determines content to be displayed from among the content stored in the content storage part . In the present first embodiment, the content is assumed to be video information, text information, still image information, and other types of information.","In an instance in which the information sent from the printer  is error status information, the content-determining part  determines content that indicates countermeasure methods in relation to errors; extracts, from the content, a region that corresponds to the error status information; and adds the extracted information to the link information described further below.","For example, in an instance in which the content is a video file related to an error with regards to the printing paper, and the error status information indicates a \u201cpaper blockage\u201d, the content-determining part  adds, to the link information, scope of display that indicates a countermeasure against \u201cpaper blockage\u201d from the video file, i.e., information relating to the start frame position and the end frame position. Error items such as \u201cpaper blockage\u201d and the scope of the video that corresponds to each of the error items are linked in advance in the form of a table, recorded, and referenced as required. The video file can also be divided so as to result in, e.g., a \u201cpaper blockage\u201d countermeasure file. In such an instance, the whole of the region of the video file that can be played back represents the scope of the video.","Also, in an instance in which information sent from the printer  is the operation history information, the content-determining part  determines the content indicating the setting method, as well as using the operation history to extract, from the content, the portion that indicates the item to be set next, and adding the extracted portion to the link information. In an instance in which the content-determining part  judges, from the operation history, that a specific operation is being repeated, the content-determining part  can also determine the content that relates to the specific operation. The content-determining part  can also store information relating to past mistakes made by users, and determine the content in accordance to this information.","For example, in an instance in which the content is expressed in Extensible Markup Language (XML) or another markup language, information regarding the tag corresponding with the scope of display corresponding to the next item to be set is added to the link information.","The content can be of a configuration in which information to be displayed on the information display part  has been translated into a predetermined language. In this instance, the content-determining part  determines the language to be displayed based on user registration information for the printer . The content-determining part  can also ascertain an age band to which the user belongs based on the user registration information for the printer , and, e.g., in an instance in which the user is an elderly person, determine content that cater for elderly persons. Content recorded in the content storage part  of the server  can also be modified by the administrator of the server . For example, refreshing the content makes it possible to provide the user with countermeasure methods or guidance that have not been initially assumed.","The content-link-information-generating part  functions as a second generating part, and generates link information indicating access to the content determined by the content-determining part . In the present first embodiment, the link information represents file pass information or Uniform Resource Locator (URL) information for the content stored in the content storage part . The link information generated by the content-link-information-generating part  is sent to the mail service part .","In the present first embodiment, in an instance in which the scope of display is included in the link information, and content corresponding to the link information is transmitted to the portable terminal , the content service part  extracts only the data representing the scope of display, and transmits the data.","The mail service part  transmits, to an email address that corresponds to a serial ID, the link information that has been generated by the content-link-information-generating part . In the present first embodiment, the correspondence relationship between the printer  and the portable terminal , i.e., the serial ID and the email address corresponding to the serial ID, is registered in the server  in advance during user registration for the printer .","The packet communication part  functions as the second transmitting part, and performs packet communication with a communication counterpart (portable terminal ) with which a wireless connection is established via a mobile communication network. In the present first embodiment, it is assumed that link information or content data are transmitted from the server  to the portable terminal , and that instruction signals generated in the portable terminal  are received.","Next, a description will be given for the function of the portable terminal . The portable terminal  is assumed to be a mobile telephone, a smartphone, a portable-type information processing device, or a similar device. The portable terminal  includes a packet communication part , an information display part , and an operation-instructing part . The packet communication part  functions as a third receiving part and a third transmitting part, and performs packet communication with respect to a communication part (i.e., the server ) with which a wireless connection has been established via a mobile communication network.","The information display part  functions as a display part and displays e-mail or content transmitted from the server . In the present first embodiment, the information display part  includes an email client (i.e., email software) for handling email, or application software for displaying the detail of the content.","In the present first embodiment, the user operates email software, whereby an email sent from the server  is opened, and link information included in the emails is displayed on the information display part . The user operates the operation-instructing part  at this point. In an instance in which link information indicated by the email is selected using the operation-instructing part , the portable terminal  generates an email for selection information including a content transmission request, and sends the email to the server . In response, the server  transmits content data corresponding to the link information to the portable terminal .","With regards to the application software, in an instance in which the content data is a video file that has been compressed using a predetermined method, the compressed video file is subjected to an expansion process and restored, application software corresponding to the video file is activated, and content based on the restored data is displayed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0050"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["5","20","100"]},"Next, the CPU of the printer  transmits the operation information and the identifying information to the server  (step S).","The CPU of the server  receives the operation information and the identifying information transmitted from the printer  (step S).","Next, the CPU of the server  determines, based on the received operation information, the content to be displayed (step S).","Next, the CPU of the server  generates the link information for the content (step S), and transmits an email including the generated link information to the address that corresponds with the identifying information (step S).","Next, the CPU of the portable terminal  receives an email transmitted by the server  (step S), and displays the received email (step S). In this instance, the link information included in the email is also displayed.","Next, the CPU of the portable terminal  judges whether or not the user has selected the link information (step S).","At this point, in an instance in which the user closes or deletes the displayed email, the CPU of the portable terminal  judges that the user will not select the link information (\u201cNo\u201d at step S), and the succession of processes are completed.","In contrast, in an instance in which the user clicks the link information in the displayed email, the CPU of the portable terminal  judges that the user has selected the link information (\u201cYes\u201d at step S) and transmits the selection information to the server  (step S).","Subsequently, the CPU of the server  receives the selection information (step S), and transmits, to the portable terminal , content data that is based on the content transmission request included in the selection information (step S).","Next, the CPU of the portable terminal  receives the content data transmitted from the server  (step S).","Next, the CPU of the portable terminal  displays the content based on the received content data (step S), and the succession of processes are completed.","The first embodiment described above has the following effects.","(1) In an instance in which the printer  is operated and a state of error is generated, or in an instance in which the user has a question in relation to the method of setting or the method of operating the printer , the user presses the help button on the printer , whereby content indicating an appropriate method of response or operation is displayed on the portable terminal  held by the portable terminal . Therefore, the user is able to gain knowledge of an appropriate response method without the need to browse the printed operation instructions for the corresponding section, perform an online search on the Internet, or telephone a call center for the manufacturer of the printer .","(2) Since the content is displayed on its own portable terminal , there is no need to switch the information displayed on the information display part  of the printer . Therefore, the user is able to view the content in a state in which information displayed in the information display part  is maintained.","Second Embodiment","Next, a second embodiment of the invention will be described with reference to .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0066"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["5","30","38","38"]},"In the first embodiment, the user pressing the help button of the printer  triggers the operation-information-obtaining part  to obtain the operation history information or the error status information. However, in the present second embodiment, the operation-information-obtaining part  obtains the operation history information or the error status information at predetermined time intervals, and the obtained information is transmitted to the server .","The server  receives the operation history information or the error status information transmitted from the printer , and stores the received information in the status storage part . This information stored in the status storage part  is stored, over a predetermined period that has been determined in advance, for each of the serial IDs of the printers .","In the first embodiment, the help button of the printer  being pressed down triggers the displaying of content on the portable terminal .
