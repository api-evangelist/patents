{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured, used, sold and\/or licensed by or for the United States Government.","The invention relates to a process for aligning a laser source with a photoreceiver in a laser rangefinder.","Laser rangefinders are generally known in the art and may be utilized to determine the range of an object at varying distances. Laser rangefinders generally include a laser which transmits a pulse of energy toward a target. The laser energy is reflected by the target and detected by the rangefinder to calculate a distance or range to the target.","Laser rangefinders are precise instruments that require calibration and alignment to ensure an accurate detected distance. Various processes have been suggested for testing laser rangefinder systems. For example, it is known in the art to provide a range simulator or a simulated object in front of a laser rangefinder. The simulated object provides a pulse that is received by the rangefinder to simulate an object at a varying distance. A calculation of the return signal delay time may be utilized to determine the accuracy of the distance to a simulated target.","Additionally, the pulses from the target may be linked with a detector such that an operator may attempt to align or calibrate the laser rangefinder by moving the detector such that a pulse source is peaked or optimized. An operator may then attenuate the simulated transmitter source and attempt to focus to determine a best position or focusing spot associated with a photoreceiver. These varying steps may be performed over and over until an operator feels he has successfully aligned and focused a laser rangefinder.","However, the alignment and focusing is performed using an electronic signal that may be inaccurate due to various electrical connections and returns associated with the pulse signals. Additionally, such a calibration system may erroneously align various components due to the faulty signals mentioned previously. Further, such a process requires a hunt and search technique that is effort and labor intensive. The quality of an alignment and focusing utilizing such a system with large variations may result in laser rangefinder systems having varying performance characteristics.","There is therefore a need in the art for a process to optically align a photoreceiver with a laser transmitter source to provide a well aligned return on a photoreceiver as well as a focused return on the photoreceiver. There is also a need in the art for a process that reduces the labor and effort involved in alignment and focusing of a laser rangefinder that assures an accurate and repeatable alignment of multiple laser rangefinder systems.","In one aspect, there is disclosed a process for optically aligning a laser rangefinder that includes the steps of providing a laser rangefinder having a laser source, a photodetector lens and a photodetector, providing a fiber optic travel path, aligning the laser source to the fiber optic travel path, illuminating the photodetector with a light source, focusing the photodetector lens, coupling the fiber optic travel path to an optical light source, and aligning the fiber optic light relative to the photodetector.","In another aspect of the invention, there is provided a process for optically aligning a laser rangefinder that may include the steps of providing a laser rangefinder having a laser source, a photodetector lens and a photodetector, providing a fiber optic travel path, providing a mirror simulating a far field position and transmitting a laser beam from the laser source at the mirror into the fiber optic travel path, providing a camera, monitor and wavelength filter to view the photodetector and provide a light source at a desired wavelength to the camera, aligning the laser source to the fiber optic travel path, illuminating the photodetector with a light source, focusing the photodetector lens at a wavelength corresponding to the wavelength of the laser source, coupling the fiber optic travel path to an optical light source, and aligning the fiber optic light relative to the photodetector.","Referring to , there are shown a block diagram and graphical depictions outlining the steps of one embodiment of a process for optically aligning a laser source  that produces a laser beam  with a photodetector  in a laser rangefinder . As can be seen in , the process may include the step A of providing a laser rangefinder  that includes a laser source , a photodetector lens , and a photodetector , as shown in . In one aspect, the laser source  may be an eyesafe laser source having a wavelength outside of the visible spectrum. In another aspect, the eyesafe laser may have a wavelength of approximately 1.5 microns.","The process for optically aligning the rangefinder may also include the step B of providing a fiber optic travel path , as shown in . In the next step C of the process, the laser source  is aligned with the fiber optic travel path , as shown in the graphical depiction of . A spherical mirror  may be adjusted, as represented by the vertical and horizontal arrows to align the laser source  with the travel path . The spherical mirror  may be positioned to simulate a far field position. In one aspect, the fiber optic travel path  may be aligned with the focal point of the mirror . When the laser beam  from the laser source  is transmitted through the fiber optic travel path , it may be detected by a detector , as shown in  or it may be detected with a visual cue on a screen , as shown in  to optimize the transmission of the laser beam  indicating an alignment of the laser source  with the fiber optic travel path .","In an alternative embodiment, as shown in , a laser source  other than the laser source  may be utilized for operation of the laser rangefinder  such as a secondary or alternative laser source in a visible wavelength. In this aspect, the alternative laser source  may be transmitted at the mirror  and into the fiber optic travel path . The alternative laser source  may be projected onto a screen and the visible laser  brightness may be optimized on the screen to indicate an alignment of a laser source with the fiber optic travel path . It should be realized that the optically visible laser source may be boresighted or aligned with the eyesafe laser source of the laser rangefinder .","The next step D includes illuminating the photodetector  of the laser rangefinder  with a light source , as shown in the graphical depiction of . In one aspect, a camera , monitor  and wavelength filter  are provided to allow for the optical viewing of the photodetector . The wavelength filter  provides a desired wave length to see on the monitor . The wavelength filter  may be chosen such that it corresponds to a wavelength of the laser source . In this manner, an operator may optically align a fiber optic light source  relative to the photodetector  at a same wavelength corresponding with the laser source . Additionally, a beam splitter may also be provided for transmitting a portion of the light from the light source  to the camera . Illumination of the photodetector  with a light source  in combination with the camera , monitor , and wavelength filter  allow an operator to visually focus the photodetector lens  such that the photodetector  is clearly focused on the monitor  at the desired wavelength of the laser source . In one aspect, during the process of aligning the fiber optic light relative to the photodetector , the operator may move an illuminator reflector that reflects the light source  toward the mirror  to adjust an axis of the light source so that is corresponds to the axis of the laser source . Additionally, the operator may also adjust a position of the mirror  to align the laser source  with the fiber optic travel path . Manipulation of both the mirror , as well as the reflector , may be utilized to align the laser source  with the fiber optic travel path .","After the photodetector lens  has been focused in step E, the fiber optic travel path  may be coupled to an optical light source  in step F as shown in . The coupling of the optical light source  provides a spot or point of light  that may be visually aligned in step G with a center of the photodetector  displayed in the monitor .","Referring to , there is shown a graphical depiction of the point of light  on a substrate material  to which the photodetector  is attached. An operator may align the point of light  from the substrate  to the photodetector  by moving the photodetector  until the fiber optic light  is centered on the photodetector , as shown in . In one aspect, the substrate  and photodetector  materials are selected such that there is a visual contrast between the two materials. The visual contrast allows an operator to verify alignment of the point of light  on the photodetector . In this manner, there is visual feedback to an operator of an alignment of the fiber optic light representing a laser source that is centered on the photodetector .","After the alignment of the fiber optic light relative to the photodetector  in step G, the operator may readjust the focus of the photodetector lens  in step H to assure that the lens is focused after movement during the alignment step.","The process for optically aligning a laser rangefinder has improvements over prior art processes in that visual confirmation of the alignment and focusing of the laser rangefinder  is achieved through the use of a camera , monitor  and filter  that provides visual verification using a desired image corresponding to a wavelength of the laser source . Additionally, the process improves the quality of the alignment and focus by providing visual confirmation while reducing the time required to perform the alignment and focus of an eyesafe laser rangefinder's photodetector  with the laser transmitter source , and assure that false readings associated with prior process and systems are avoided.","The invention has been described in an illustrative manner. It is to be understood that the terminology which has been used is intended to be in the nature of words of description rather than limitation. Many modifications and variations of the invention are possible in light of the above teachings. Therefore, within the scope of the appended claims, the invention may be practiced other than as specifically described."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 2A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 2B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 2C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 5A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 5B"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
