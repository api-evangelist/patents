title: Variable user interface based on document access privileges
abstract: Users may be presented with different viewing interfaces for a document based on a combination of factors relating to display rights possessed for the document and user specific information. In one implementation, the user's location is used to determine portions of the document that can be displayed to the user. More particularly, access privileges to a document for a user are determined based on geographical location information of the user and based on access rights possessed for the document. Portions of the document may then be formatted for display to the user based on the determined access privileges.

No. 12\/627,834, filed Nov. 30, 2009 (now U.S. Pat. No. 8,364,712), which is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/953,496, filed Sep. 30, 2004 (now U.S. Pat. No. 7,664,751), which are incorporated herein by reference.","A. Field of the Invention","Systems and methods described herein relate to data formatting and presentation and, more particularly, to techniques for presenting textual and graphical material.","B. Description of Related Art","Modern computer networks, and in particular, the Internet, have made large bodies of information widely and easily available. Free Internet search engines, for instance, index many millions of web documents that are linked to the Internet. A user connected to the Internet can enter a simple search query to quickly locate web documents relevant to the search query.","One category of content that is not widely available on the Internet, however, are the more traditional printed works of authorship, such as books and magazines. Before presenting this type of digital content to users, the content may first be scanned using an optical scanner. Once scanned, optical character recognition (OCR) may be used to convert text in the scanned digital images of the pages of the content to a searchable digital form.","When transmitting the scanned\/OCR'ed version of the content (e.g., books or magazines) to users, the content provider may only be able to lawfully provide certain portions of the content to the users. For example, the content provider may provide certain books that are in the public domain and other documents for which the content provider does not have full legal rights. Accordingly, the portions of the book that the content provider chooses to provide to the users may vary.","According to one aspect, a method includes determining access privileges to a document for a user based on geographical location information of the user and based on access rights possessed for the document. The method further includes formatting portions of the document for display to the user based on the determined access privileges and transmitting the formatted portions of the document to the user.","According to another aspect, a method includes receiving a request for a document from a user, receiving information relating to the user, and determining viewable portions of the document, as governed by copyright laws, based on the information relating to the user. The method further includes making available the viewable portions of the document to the user.","According to yet another aspect, a system includes a search engine configured to receive search queries and return links to documents relevant to the search queries. The system further includes a document browsing component configured to, in response to requests for one or more of the documents relevant to the search query, determine access privileges to the one or more of the documents on a per-user basis based on geographical location information of the user. The document browsing component additionally transmits portions of the one or more of the documents permitted by the determined access privileges to the user.","The following detailed description of the invention refers to the accompanying drawings. The detailed description does not limit the invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["105","105"]},"The ability to make the documents in database  available to the end users may be limited by the display rights possessed by the content provider (i.e., the operator of database ). Copyright laws, business choices, or contractual restrictions may limit what is desired to be provided to the end users. The portions of the documents in database  that can be shown to a particular end user may be determined based on a number of factors, such as: (1) the location of the user (e.g., users in different countries\/legal jurisdictions may be subject to different copyright requirements), (2) the permissions that the content provider has for the document being requested, (3) the type of content, and (4) the user's security status or state (e.g., whether the user is a registered user of a particular web site or a member of a particular group).","Consistent with aspects of the invention, users may be presented with different viewing interfaces each designed to present the available portions of the document, such as the portions determined based on the above-listed factors. The intersection of these factors can be conceptualized as permission matrix . The output of permission matrix  defines the spectrum of display rights available to the particular user. For a public domain document, for example, the display rights may be \u201cfull display,\u201d indicating that the entire document can be shown to the users. Other document\/end user combinations may correspond to a lower level of display rights, down to as low as \u201crestricted\u201d viewing, which may correspond to a minimum viewing permission.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","200","210","220","240","240","210","220","240"]},"A client  may include a device such as a wireless telephone, a personal computer, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a lap top, or another type of computation or communication device, a thread or process running on one of these devices, and\/or an object executable by one of these devices. Server  may include a server device that processes, searches, and\/or maintains documents and images in a manner consistent with the principles of the invention. Clients  and server  may connect to network  via wired, wireless, or optical connections.","Server  may include a document browsing component  that transmits images corresponding to documents, such as image pages of books, magazines, or catalogs, to clients . In addition to transmitting images of the pages of the documents, document browsing component  may provide information representing the text contained on the pages, such as ASCII text characters corresponding to the documents' pages. These documents may be gathered by document browsing component  in a number of ways, such as by optically scanning the documents or by receiving the documents from a third party, etc.","In one implementation, document browsing component  may include, or be coupled with, a search engine that allows clients to search a database of the documents via textual search queries.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["210","220","210","220","310","320","330","340","350","360","370","380","310","210","220"]},"Processor  may include conventional processors, microprocessors, or processing logic that interpret and execute instructions. Main memory  may include a random access memory (RAM) or another type of dynamic storage device that stores information and instructions for execution by processor . ROM  may include a conventional ROM device or another type of static storage device that stores static information and instructions for use by processor . Storage device  may include a magnetic and\/or optical recording medium and its corresponding drive.","Input device  may include one or more conventional mechanisms that permit a user to input information to client\/server \/, such as a keyboard, a mouse, a pen, voice recognition and\/or biometric mechanisms, etc. Output device  may include one or more conventional mechanisms that output information to the user, including a display, a printer, a speaker, etc. Communication interface  may include any transceiver-like mechanism that enables client\/server \/ to communicate with other devices and\/or systems. For example, communication interface  may include mechanisms for communicating with another device or system via a network, such as network .","Server , consistent with the principles of the invention, may implement additional document browsing component . Document browsing component  may be stored in a computer-readable medium, such as memory . A computer-readable medium may be defined as one or more physical or logical memory devices and\/or carrier waves.","The software instructions defining document browsing component  may be read into memory  from another computer-readable medium, such as data storage device , or from another device via communication interface . The software instructions contained in memory  may cause processor  to perform processes that will be described later. Alternatively, hardwired circuitry or other logic may be used in place of, or in combination with, software instructions to implement processes consistent with the invention. Thus, implementations consistent with the principles of the invention are not limited to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software. Additionally, multiple computing devices may function together to implement the functionality of a single server  or document browsing component .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["225","225","405","410","405","410","405"]},"As mentioned, database  may store documents and information related to the documents.  is a diagram illustrating portions of an exemplary document  stored in database . The information defining document  may include images  of pages of the document, text  of the document, and metadata  relating to the document. In some implementations, images  or text  may not be present. That is, a document  may include either page images  or text .","Images  may include images of the pages of the document. By storing images , users wishing to view the document can see the document in the form that the document was originally printed. The images may be obtained, for example, by optically scanning each page of the document or by obtaining the images from the publisher, author, or another source.","Text  may include the text in document  in a machine-readable format. For example, text  may include an ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) representation of the text of document . Text  may be obtained in a number of ways, such as by performing OCR on images , by manually typing the text of the document, or by obtaining the text from the publisher, author, or another source.","Metadata  may include additional information relating to document . For example, metadata  may include publisher information, the ISBN of document  (when document  is a document, such as a book, that has an ISBN), summary information describing document , links to additional information about document  (such as Web links), etc. Consistent with an aspect of the invention, metadata  may include information relating to access rights associated with or possessed for document .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["520","520","605","520","610","615"]},"More generally, metadata  may include additional information relating to display rights granted from the publisher\/content source to the content provider. Examples of such additional information include an indication of whether images or photos should be blocked in documents, a list of domains from which advertisements should not be used, a reference to a logo or link that should be displayed with the document, whether advertisements should be displayed, information defining a \u201cbuy the book\u201d link from which the user can purchase a copy of the document, or information defining a link to promotional material. This additional information may be used when formatting the document for presentation to the user.","Additionally, different display standards may be applied to readers in different geographies. For instance, both readers in Canada and the United States may have display ability based on legal or other criteria, but the limited display ability in the two countries may be different. One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the various display types available to the users in different locations can be specified for a particular document or a group of documents in a number of different ways. Storing the access rights, which translate into display types, in fields  and , as described above, is one exemplary technique.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 7"],"b":"225"},"User information may be determined (act ). In one implementation, the user information may include the location of the user. The user's location may be determined based on the Internet Protocol (IP) address associated with the user. Alternately, the domain that is being browsed may be used to determine the location. Information other than, or in addition to, the user location may also be used as user information. For example, whether the user accepts cookies may be determined and included as part of the user information. Other user security or state information may also be used. For example, registered users that have successfully logged-on may be eligible to view different portions of a document than non-registered users.","The access rights associated with the document may also be retrieved (act ). As previously discussed, the access rights may be stored as metadata in database . Based on the user information and the access rights associated with the document, decision component  may determine what portions of the document are eligible to be shown to the particular user (act ). The user information and the access rights associated with the document may be thought of as forming permission matrix  (), which defines the access privileges that can be granted to the user for the requested document. In some implementations, the content of the document itself may be taken into consideration when determining the access privileges that can be granted to the user. For example, fair use display for a book may be chosen to be a number of paragraphs or pages of text, while the fair use display for a short poem may be chosen to be only a line or two from the poem.","The portions of the document that can be shown to the user may then be appropriately formatted and transmitted to the user (acts  and ). This formatting can be performed in a number of ways. For example, for a given document, multiple versions of the document, each including a select subset of the document, may be pre-formatted and stored. The appropriate version may then be selected and transmitted to the user in acts  and . Alternatively, the formatting can be performed on the fly. The formatting can, for instance, be a \u201csmart\u201d formatting in which portions of the document that are most relevant to the user (such as portions that include terms of a search query) are selected and formatted for presentation to the user.","In some implementations, photographs contained in the documents may be given special attention when formatting and transmitting the documents to the user. For example, the content source of the document may give permission to display the text of a document but not photographs in the document. The photographs may be individually obscured or deleted from the document.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 8"],"b":["800","701","703","210","805","810","815","830","800","830"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":["900","210","225","905","930","830"]},"One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that \u201cpartial access\u201d for a document can be provided in numerous ways in addition to that shown in . For example: in a specified time period (e.g., 24 hours) the user may only be permitted to view a certain portion (e.g., 10%) of the document; only pre-designated portions of the document may be viewable; the document may be stamped or watermarked with lettering such as \u201ccopyrighted\u201d; etc. Different \u201cpartial access\u201d interfaces may be presented to different users based on their location, other user specific information, and based on access privileges for the requested document.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIG. 9"],"b":["1000","5","15","28","1040"]},"The exemplary interfaces shown in  illustrate an exemplary spectrum of possible document access privileges that may be granted to a user based on user specific information and general access rights of the document.
