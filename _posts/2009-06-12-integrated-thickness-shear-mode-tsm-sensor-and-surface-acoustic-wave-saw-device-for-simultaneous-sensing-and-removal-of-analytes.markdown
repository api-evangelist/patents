title: Integrated thickness shear mode (TSM) sensor and surface acoustic wave (SAW) device for simultaneous sensing and removal of analytes
abstract: Provided is a sensor which integrates a pair of substantially unidirectional surface acoustic wave (SAW) interdigital transducers (IDTs) and a thickness shear mode (TSM) electrode. The sensor provides simultaneous sensing and removal of material from the sensor's surface. The sensing aspect is accomplished through the use of the TSM electrode that is designed to operate between 2 and 100 MHz. The removal of material is accomplished using substantially unidirectional IDTs aligned on the substrate to produce acoustic waves, such as Rayleigh waves, across the entire TSM sensor active area. When liquid is added over the acoustic waves, acoustic streaming occurs, which dislodges material from the sensor's surface. The acoustic waves are designed to operate at a significantly different frequency than the sensor to prevent interference between the two.

The Government has certain rights in the invention.","This invention relates to thickness shear mode sensors and surface acoustic wave devices. More specifically, this invention relates to a device that simultaneously senses concentrations in complex fluids as well as removes material from the surface.","Sensors, including biosensors, are constantly hindered by the effects of fouling and non-specific binding of proteins. Non-specifically bound (NSB) protein interactions can interfere with sensor response and concentration determination. NSB protein interaction can cause, among other problems, reduced signal to noise ratios, exaggerated response due to multi-layer formation, false responses due to miscellaneous proteins covering the surface, and no response due to poor alignment of the functional groups. Minor improvements to biosensor responses can be achieved by a thorough rinsing, use of ultrasonic baths, and pretreatment of the analyte containing fluids. However, each of these processes adds to the complexity of the creation and use of the biosensor and decreases the functionality of a biosensor operated without specialized training in everyday environments. Developments in acoustic wave applications have demonstrated NSB protein removal with relatively low power consumption thus significantly decreasing the uncertainty of the sensors response.","SAW devices known in the art lack the ability to remove NSB proteins while also detecting biological species. An improved sensor is needed in the art that provides simultaneous sensing and removal of NSB proteins. The improved sensor needs to improve sensitivity and selectivity while simultaneously removing NSB proteins. However, in view of the prior art considered as a whole at the time the present invention was made, it was not obvious to those of ordinary skill in the pertinent art how the identified need could be fulfilled.","The need for a sensor that exhibits desired characteristics superior to sensors known in the art is now met by a new, useful, and non-obvious invention.","In accordance with the present invention a sensor is provided including a substrate, a pair of surface acoustic wave (SAW) interdigital transducers (IDTs) on the substrate, and a thickness shear mode (TSM) electrode on the substrate. The SAW IDTs are aligned in a substantially unidirectional manner. The pair of SAW IDTs is also arranged to form an acoustic path capable of propagating an acoustic wave therebetween. The TSM electrode lies in between the SAW IDT pair in the acoustic path.","In an embodiment, the sensor also has a second TSM electrode located on a second side of the substrate.","In an additional embodiment, the substrate is selected from the group consisting of quartz, lithium niobate, lithium tantalate, and langasite.","In a further embodiment, the SAW IDTs are of sufficient size to expose the entire surface of the TSM electrode to the acoustic wave.","Also provided in accordance with present invention is a method for simultaneous sensing and removal of materials from a sensor's surface. The method includes providing a sensor as described above, operating the TSM electrode between 2 and 100 Mhz, producing acoustic waves along the acoustic path and across the TSM electrode, and adding a liquid over the acoustic wave to induce acoustic streaming. The acoustic wave is produced using the pair of SAW IDTs. The operation of the TSM electrode provides the sensing for the device while the SAW IDT pair provides for the acoustic streaming, which dislodges analytes from the sensor's surface.","In an embodiment, the acoustic waves are Rayleigh waves.","In the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments, reference is made to the accompanying drawings, which form a part hereof, and within which are shown by way of illustration specific embodiments by which the invention may be practiced. It is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and structural changes may be made without departing from the scope of the invention.","The present invention capitalizes on the ease of use of a thickness shear mode (TSM) sensor, such as quartz crystal microbalances, and the lower power required by a surface acoustic wave (SAW) device to remove material from the surface. The combination of these two devices provides a novel device that has stable, easy to operate sensing and reduces the effects caused by fouling analytes. The device is also able to regenerate itself for repeated\/continual sensing use.","As shown in , sensor  comprises piezoelectric substrate , pair of SAW interdigital transducers (IDTs) , and thickness shear mode (TSM) electrode . SAW IDT pair  and TSM electrode  are located on the top surface of substrate . Second TSM electrode  may also be located on the bottom surface of substrate , as shown in .","Sensing is accomplished through the use of TSM electrode  which preferably operates between 2 to 100 MHz and is functionalized using methods known in the art, both depending on the specific application.","Removal of material is accomplished using pair of SAW IDTs . SAW IDTs  are designed such that they are at least substantially unidirectional. SAW IDTs  are also aligned on substrate  to create an acoustic path between SAW IDT pair . SAW IDT pair  is capable of propagating acoustic waves along this acoustic path. In a preferred embodiment, the acoustic waves are Rayleigh waves. When liquid is added over the acoustic waves, a phenomena known as acoustic streaming occurs that is sufficient to dislodge material from the surface of substrate . The acoustic waves are designed to operate at a significantly different frequency than the sensor to prevent any interference between the two.","In a preferred embodiment, SAW IDT pair  are of sufficient size and aligned in a manner such that the acoustic waves produced by SAW IDT pair  are propagated across the entire active area of TSM electrode . SAW IDT pair  is also designed such that each IDT is substantially unidirectional. This allows the most possible acoustic wave energy to the surface of TSM electrode .","In an embodiment, piezoelectric substrate  is double polished. Piezoelectric substrate  may be any known in the art and may selected according to a particular application. For example, quartz, such as ST-cut quartz or AT-cut quartz for temperature stabilization, may be used. Other examples include lithium niobate, lithium tantalate, and langasite.","The TSM electrodes and the SAW IDTs are added to the surface of the substrate through standard lithographic techniques. The electrodes and transducers may be made using a titanium adhesion layer with gold on top. However, these materials are not meant to be limiting; other metals and conductors may be used, and a thin layer of oxide or polymer may be added to provide needed sensor characteristics to functionalize the sensor surface.","The operation of the TSM electrode  is controlled with a well-known oscillator circuit. The operation of the SAW component is accomplished with a frequency generator and a power amplifier that can be tuned to the desired energy. Both IDTs in the IDT pair are powered when the device is operating.","The surface acoustic waves from the IDTs can be used for many functions. Examples include:\n\n","The present invention is described with reference to biosensors; however, it can be used for chemical sensors as well. As a biosensor, the device can be used as an analytical instrument for consumer use. Also, because the sensor is not susceptible to fouling, it can be used in industrial processes for such things as viscosity measurements.","It will be seen that the advantages set forth above, and those made apparent from the foregoing description, are efficiently attained and since certain changes may be made in the above construction without departing from the scope of the invention, it is intended that all matters contained in the foregoing description or shown in the accompanying drawings shall be interpreted as illustrative and not in a limiting sense.","It is also to be understood that the following claims are intended to cover all of the generic and specific features of the invention herein described, and all statements of the scope of the invention which, as a matter of language, might be said to fall therebetween."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["For a fuller understanding of the invention, reference should be made to the following detailed description, taken in connection with the accompanying drawings, in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 2"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
