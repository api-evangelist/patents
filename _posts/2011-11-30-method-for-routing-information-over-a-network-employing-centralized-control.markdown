All of the above-identified applications and their disclosures are incorporated herein by reference for all purposes as if completely and fully set forth herein.","1. Field of the Invention","This invention relates to the field of information networks, and more particularly relates to a protocol for configuring routes over a network.","2. Description of the Related Art","Today's networks carry vast amounts of information. High bandwidth applications supported by these networks include streaming video, streaming audio, and large aggregations of voice traffic. In the future, these demands are certain to increase. To meet such demands, an increasingly popular alternative is the use of lightwave communications carried over fiber optic cables. The use of lightwave communications provides several benefits, including high bandwidth, ease of installation, and capacity for future growth.","The synchronous optical network (SONET) protocol is among those protocols employing an optical infrastructure. SONET is a physical transmission vehicle capable of transmission speeds in the multi-gigabit range, and is defined by a set of electrical as well as optical standards. SONET's ability to use currently-installed fiber optic cabling, coupled with the fact that SONET significantly reduces complexity and equipment functionality requirements, gives local and interexchange carriers incentive to employ SONET. Also attractive is the immediate savings in operational cost that this reduction in complexity provides. SONET thus allows the realization of a new generation of high-bandwidth services in a more economical manner than previously existed.","SONET networks have traditionally been protected from failures by using topologies that dedicate something on the order of half the network's available bandwidth for protection, such as a ring topology. Two approaches in common use today are diverse protection and self-healing rings (SHR), both of which offer relatively fast restoration times with relatively simple control logic, but do not scale well for large data networks. This is mostly due to their inefficiency in capacity allocation. Their fast restoration time, however, makes most failures transparent to the end-user, which is important in applications such as telephony and other voice communications. The existing schemes rely on 1-plus-1 and 1-for-1 topologies that carry active traffic over two separate fibers (line switched) or signals (path switched), and use a protocol (Automatic Protection Switching or APS), or hardware (diverse protection) to detect, propagate, and restore failures.","A SONET network using an SHR topology provides very fast restoration of failed links by using redundant links between the nodes of each ring. Thus, each ring actually consists of two rings, a ring supporting information transfer in a \u201cclockwise\u201d direction and a ring supporting information transfer in a \u201ccounter-clockwise\u201d direction. The terms \u201ceast\u201d and \u201cwest\u201d are also commonly used in this regard. Each direction employs its own set of fiber optic cables, with traffic between nodes assigned a certain direction (either clockwise or counter clockwise). If a cable in one of these sub-rings is damaged, the SONET ring \u201cheals\u201d itself by changing the direction of information flow from the direction taken by the information transferred over the failed link to the sub-ring having information flow in the opposite direction.","The detection of such faults and the restoration of information flow thus occurs very quickly, on the order of 10 ms (for detection) and 50 ms (for restoration) for most ring implementations. The short restoration time is critical in supporting applications, such as current telephone networks, that are sensitive to quality of service (QoS) because such short restoration times prevent old digital terminals and switches from generating red alarms and initiating Carrier Group Alarms (CGA). These alarms are undesirable because such alarms usually result in dropped calls, causing users down time aggravation. Restoration times that exceed 10 seconds can lead to timeouts at higher protocol layers, while those that exceed 1 minute can lead to disastrous results for the entire network. However, the price of such quickly restored information flow is the high bandwidth requirements of such systems. By maintaining completely redundant sub-rings, an SHR topology requires 100% excess bandwidth.","An alternative to the ring topology is the mesh topology. The mesh topology is similar to the point-to-point topology used in inter-networking. Each node in such a network is connected to one or more other nodes. Thus, each node is connected to the rest of the network by one or more links. In this manner, a path from a first node to a second node uses all or a portion of the capacity of the links between those two nodes.","Networks based on mesh-type restoration are inherently more capacity-efficient than ring-based designs, mainly because each network link can potentially provide protection for fiber cuts on several different links. By sharing the capacity between links, a SONET network using a mesh topology can provide redundancy for failure restoration at less than 100% of the bandwidth capacity originally required. Such networks are even more efficient when traffic transits several links. However, restoration times exhibited by such approaches range from several minutes to several months.","Embodiments of the present invention provide a centralized routing protocol that supports relatively simple provisioning and relatively fast restoration (on the order of, for example, 50 ms), while providing relatively efficient bandwidth usage (i.e., minimizing excess bandwidth requirements for restoration, on the order of less than 100% redundant capacity and preferably less than 50% redundant capacity). Such a centralized routing protocol is, in certain embodiments, easily scaled to accommodate increasing bandwidth requirements.","According to embodiments of the present invention, an apparatus and method are described for configuring routes over a network. Such a method, embodied in a protocol according to embodiments of the present invention, provides several advantages, including relatively fast restoration (on the order of, for example, 50 ms) and relatively efficient bandwidth usage (i.e., on the order of less than 100% redundant capacity and preferably less than 50% redundant capacity).","In one embodiment of the present invention, a network is described. The network includes a master node. The network includes a number of nodes, and each of the nodes is coupled to at least one other of the nodes, with the master node being one of the nodes. The master node maintains topology information regarding a topology of the network.","In one aspect of the embodiment, the network includes a backup node, which is one of the nodes of the network. Such a backup node maintains a redundant copy of the topology information.","In another embodiment of the present invention, a method for centralized control of a network is described. The network includes a number of nodes. The method includes creating a database and storing the database on a master node of the network. The database contains topology information regarding a topology of the network. Each of the nodes is coupled to at least one other of the nodes, with the master node being one of the nodes.","In one aspect of the embodiment, the method further includes retrieving backup topology information from a backup node with the backup node is one of the nodes. The backup node maintains a redundant copy of the topology information as the backup topology information. Moreover, the master node and the backup node can be maintain synchronization of the database and the backup topology information.","The foregoing is a summary and thus contains, by necessity, simplifications, generalizations and omissions of detail; consequently, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the summary is illustrative only and is not intended to be in any way limiting. Other aspects, inventive features, and advantages of the present invention, as defined solely by the claims, will become apparent in the non-limiting detailed description set forth below.","The use of the same reference symbols in different drawings indicates similar or identical items.","The following is intended to provide a detailed description of an example of the invention and should not be taken to be limiting of the invention itself. Rather, any number of variations may fall within the scope of the invention which is defined in the claims following the description.","Network Architecture","To limit the size of the topology database and the scope of broadcast packets, networks employing an embodiment of the protocol described herein can be divided into smaller logical groups referred to herein as \u201czones.\u201d Each zone runs a separate copy of the topology distribution algorithm, and nodes within each zone are only required to maintain information about their own zone. There is no need for a zone's topology to be known outside its boundaries, and nodes within a zone need not be aware of the network's topology external to their respective zones.","Nodes that attach to multiple zones are referred to herein as border nodes. Border nodes are required to maintain a separate topological database, also called link-state or connectivity database, for each of the zones they attach to. Border nodes use the connectivity database(s) for intra-zone routing. Border nodes are also required to maintain a separate database that describes the connectivity of the zones themselves. This database, which is called the network database, is used for inter-zone routing. The network database describes the topology of a special zone, referred to herein as the backbone, which is always assigned an identifier (ID) of 0. The backbone has all the characteristics of a zone. There is no need for a backbone's topology to be known outside the backbone, and its border nodes need not be aware of the topologies of other zones.","A network is referred to herein as flat if the network consists of a single zone (i.e., zone  or the backbone zone). Conversely, a network is referred to herein as hierarchical if the network contains two or more zones, not including the backbone. The resulting multi-level hierarchy (i.e., nodes and one or more zones) provides the following benefits:","1. The size of the link state database maintained by each network node is reduced, which allows the protocol to scale well for large networks.","2. The scope of broadcast packets is limited, reducing their impact.\n\n","3. Different sections of a long route (i.e., one spanning multiple zones) can be computed separately and in parallel, speeding the calculations.","4. Restricting routing to be within a zone prevents database corruption in one zone from affecting the intra-zone routing capability of other zones because routing within a zone is based solely on information maintained within the zone.","As noted, the protocol routes information at two different levels: inter-zone and intra-zone. The former is only used when the source and destination nodes of a virtual path are located in different zones. Inter-zone routing supports path restoration on an end-to-end basis from the source of the virtual path to the destination by isolating failures between zones. In the latter case, the border nodes in each transit zone originate and terminate the path-restoration request on behalf of the virtual path's source and destination nodes. A border node that assumes the role of a source (or destination) node during the path restoration activity is referred to herein as a proxy source (destination) node. Such nodes are responsible for originating (terminating) the restore path request (RPR) with their own zones. Proxy nodes are also required to communicate with border nodes in other zones to establish an inter-zone path for the VP.","In one embodiment, every node in a network employing the protocol is assigned a globally unique 16-bit ID referred to herein as the node ID. A node ID is divided into two parts, zone ID and node address. Logically, each node ID is a pair (zone ID, node address), where the zone ID identifies a zone within the network, and the node address identifies a node within that zone. To minimize overhead, the protocol defines three types of node IDs, each with a different size zone ID field, although a different number of zone types can be employed. The network provider selects which packet type to use based on the desired network architecture.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0060"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","110","120","130"]},"Type 0 IDs work well for networks that contain a small number of large zones (e.g., less than about 4 zones). Type 2 IDs are well suited for networks that contain a large number of small zones (e.g., more than about 15). Type 1 IDs provide a good compromise between zone size and number of available zones, which makes a type 1 node ID a good choice for networks that contain an average number of medium size zones (e.g., between about 4 and about 15). When zones being described herein are in a network, the node IDs of the nodes in a zone may be delineated as two decimal numbers separated by a period (e.g., ZoneID.NodeAddress).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0062"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["200","201","204","211","217","221","226","231","236","241","247","1","4","0","213","217","222","224","234","235","241","242","200","201","204"]},"Once a network topology has been defined, the protocol allows the user to configure one or more end-to-end connections that can span multiple nodes and zones. This operation is referred to herein as provisioning. Each set of physical connections that are provisioned creates an end-to-end connection between the two end nodes that supports a virtual point-to-point link (referred to herein as a virtual path or VP). The resulting VP has an associated capacity and an operational state, among other attributes. The end points of a VP can be configured to have a master\/slave relationship. The terms source and destination are also used herein in referring to the two end-nodes. In such a relationship, the node with a numerically lower node ID assumes the role of the master (or source) node, while the other assumes the role of the slave (or destination) node. The protocol defines a convention in which the source node initiates recovery under the control of a master node (described subsequently) and that the destination node simply waits for a message from the source node informing the source node of the VP's new path, although the opposite convention could easily be employed.","VPs are also assigned a priority level, which determines their relative priority within the network. This quality of service (QoS) parameter is used during failure recovery procedures to determine which VPs are first to be restored. Four QoS levels (-) are nominally defined in the protocol, with 0 being the lowest, although a larger or smaller number of QoS levels can be used. Provisioning is discussed in greater detail subsequently herein.","Initialization of Network Nodes","In one embodiment, network nodes use a protocol such as that referred to herein as the Hello Protocol in order to establish and maintain neighbor relationships, and to learn and distribute link state information throughout the network. The protocol relies on the periodic exchange of bi-directional packets (Hello packets) between neighbors. During the adjacency establishment phase of the protocol, which involves the exchange of INIT packets, nodes learn information about their neighbors, such as that listed in Table 1.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0066"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Information regarding neighbors stored by a node."}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"147pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Parameter","Usage"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Node ID","Node ID of the sending node, which is preferably"]},{"entry":[{},"from 8 bits to 32 bits."]},{"entry":["HelloInterval","How often Hello packets should be sent by the"]},{"entry":[{},"receiving node"]},{"entry":["HelloDeadInterval","The time interval, in seconds, after which the"]},{"entry":[{},"sending node will consider its neighbor dead if"]},{"entry":[{},"a valid Hello packets is not received."]},{"entry":["LinkCost","Cost of the link between the two neighbors."]},{"entry":[{},"This may represent distance, delay or any other"]},{"entry":[{},"metric."]},{"entry":["LinkCapacity","Total link capacity"]},{"entry":["QoS3Capacity","Link capacity reserved for QoS 3 connections"]},{"entry":["QoSnCapacity","Link capacity reserved for QoS 0-2 connections"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"During normal protocol operation, each node constructs a structure known as a Link State Advertisement (LSA), which contains a list of the node's neighbors, links, the capacity of those links, the quality of service available on over links, one or more costs associated with each of the links, and other pertinent information. The node that constructs the LSA is called the originating node. Normally, the originating node is the only node allowed to modify its contents (except for the HOP_COUNT field, which is not included in the checksum and so may be modified by other nodes). The originating node retransmits the LSA when the LSA's contents change. The LSA is sent in a special Hello packet that contains not only the node's own LSA in its advertisement, but also ones received from other nodes. The structure, field definitions, and related information are illustrated subsequently in  and described in the corresponding discussion. Each node stores the most recently generated instance of an LSA in its database. The list of stored LSAs gives the node a complete topological map of the network. The topology database maintained by a given node is, therefore, nothing more than a list of the most recent LSAs generated by its peers and received in Hello packets.","In the case of a stable network, the majority of transmitted Hello packets are empty (i.e., contain no topology information) because only altered LSAs are included in the Hello messages. Packets containing no changes (no LSAs) are referred to herein as null Hello packets. The Hello protocol requires neighbors to exchange null Hello packets periodically. The HelloInterval parameter defines the duration of this period. Such packets ensure that the two neighbors are alive, and that the link that connects them is operational.","Initialization Message","An INIT message is the first protocol transaction conducted between adjacent nodes, and is performed upon network startup or when a node is added to a pre-existing network. An INIT message is used by adjacent nodes to initialize and exchange adjacency parameters. The packet contains parameters that identify the neighbor (the node ID of the sending node), its link bandwidth (both total and available, on a QoS3\/QoSn basis), and its configured Hello protocol parameters. The structure, field definitions, and related information are illustrated subsequently in  and described in the text corresponding thereto.","In systems that provide two or more QoS levels, varying amounts of link bandwidth may be set aside for the exclusive use of services requiring a given QoS. For example, a certain amount of link bandwidth may be reserved for QoS3 connections. This guarantees that a given amount of link bandwidth will be available for use by these high-priority services. The remaining link bandwidth would then be available for use by all QoS levels (-). The Hello parameters include the HelloInterval and HelloDeadInterval parameters. The HelloInterval is the number of seconds between transmissions of Hello packets. A zero in this field indicates that this parameter hasn't been configured on the sending node and that the neighbor should use its own configured interval. If both nodes send a zero in this field then a default value (e.g., 7 seconds) preferably used. The HelloDeadInterval is the number of seconds the sending node will wait before declaring a silent neighbor down. A zero in this field indicates that this parameter hasn't been configured on the sending node and that the neighbor should use its own configured value. If both nodes send a zero in this field then a default value (e.g., 30 seconds) should be used. The successful receipt and processing of an INIT packet causes a START event to be sent to the Hello State machine, as is described subsequently.","Hello Message","Once adjacency between two neighbors has been established, the nodes periodically exchange Hello packets. The interval between these transmissions is a configurable parameter that can be different for each link, and for each direction. Nodes are expected to use the HelloInterval parameters specified in their neighbor's Hello message. A neighbor is considered dead if no Hello message is received from the neighbor within the HelloDeadInterval period (also a configurable parameter that can be link- and direction-specific).","In one embodiment, nodes in a network continuously receive Hello messages on each of their links and save the most recent LSAs from each message. Each LSA contains, among other things, an LSID (indicating which instance of the given LSA has been received) and a HOP_COUNT. The HOP_COUNT specifies the distance, as a number of hops, between the originating node and the receiving node. The originating node always sets this field of 0 when the LSA is created. The HOP_COUNT field is incremented by one for each hop (from node to node) traversed by the LSA instance. The HOP_COUNT field is set to zero by the originating node and is incremented by one on every hop of the flooding procedure. The ID field is initialized to FIRST_LSID during node start-up and is incremented every time a new instance of the LSA is created by the originating node. The initial ID is only used once by each originating node. Preferably, an LSA carrying such an ID is always accepted as most recent. This approach allows old instances of an LSA to be quickly flushed from the network when the originating node is restarted.","During normal network operation, the originating node of an LSA transmits LS update messages when the node detects activity that results in a change in its LSA. The node sets the HOP_COUNT field of the LSA to 0 and the LSID field to the LSID of the previous instance plus 1. Wraparound may be avoided by using a sufficiently-large LSID (e.g., 32 bits). When another node receives the update message, the node records the LSA in its database and schedules the LSA for transmission to its own neighbors. The HOP_COUNT field is incremented by one node and transmitted to the neighboring nodes. Likewise, when the nodes downstream of the current node receive an update message with a HOP_COUNT of H, they transmit their own update message to all of their neighbors with a HOP_COUNT of H+1, which represents the distance (in hops) to the originating node. This continues until the update message either reaches a node that has a newer instance of the LSA in its database or the hop-count field reaches MAX_HOPS.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0073","num":"0074"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","310","300","320","330","340","350","360","370","380","390"]},"Those skilled in the art will recognize the boundaries between and order of operations in this and the other flow diagrams described herein are merely illustrative and alternative embodiments may merge operations, impose an alternative decomposition of functionality of operations, or re-order the operations presented therein.

Furthermore, those skilled in the art will recognize that the operations described in this exemplary embodiment are for illustration only. Operations may be combined or the functionality of the operations may be distributed in additional operations in accordance with the invention.","The operations referred to herein may be modules or portions of modules (e.g., software, firmware or hardware modules).

The method may be embodied in a machine-readable and\/or computer-readable medium for configuring a computer system to execute the method. Thus, the software modules may be stored within and\/or transmitted to a computer system memory to configure the computer system to perform the functions of the module.","Those software modules may therefore be received (e.g. from one or more computer readable media) by the various hardware modules of a router such as that described in the Patent Application entitled \u201cA CONFIGURABLE NETWORK ROUTER,\u201d having A.

Various versions of the GET_LSA request are generated by nodes along the path, each with a varying number of requested LSA entries. An entry is removed from the request when the request reaches a node that has an instance of the requested LSA that meets the criteria of list B.","All database exchanges are expected to be reliable using the above method because received LSA's must be individually acknowledged. The acknowledgment packet contains a mask that has a \u201c1\u201d in all bit positions that correspond to LSA's that were received without any errors. The low-order bit corresponds to the first LSA received in the request, while the high-order bit corresponds to the last LSA. Upon receiving the response, the sender verifies the checksum of all LSA's in its database that have a corresponding \u201c0\u201d bit in the response. The sender then retransmits all LSA's with a valid checksum and ages out all others. An incorrect checksum indicates that the contents of the given LSA has changed while being held in the node's database. This is usually the result of a memory problem. Each node is thus required to verify the checksum of all LSA's in its database periodically.","The LS checksum is provided to ensure the integrity of LSA contents. As noted, the LS checksum is used to detect data corruption of an LSA. This corruption can occur while the advertisement is being transmitted, while the advertisement is being held in a node's database, or at other points in the networking equipment. The checksum can be formed by any one of a number of methods known to those of skill in the art, such as by treating the LSA as a sequence of 16-bit integers, adding them together using one's complement arithmetic, and then taking the one's complement of the result. Preferably, the checksum doesn't include the LSA's HOP_COUNT field, in order to allow other nodes to modify the HOP_COUNT without having to update the checksum field. In such a scenario, only the originating node is allowed to modify the contents of an LSA except for those two fields, including its checksum. This simplifies the detection and tracking of data corruption.","Specific instances of an LSA are identified by the LSA's ID field, the LSID. The LSID makes possible the detection of old and duplicate LSAs. Similar to sequence numbers, the space created by the ID is circular: a sequence number starts at some value (FIRST_LSID), increases to some maximum value (FIRST_LSID\u22121), and then goes back to FIRST_LSID+1. Preferably, the initial value is only used once during the lifetime of the LSA, which helps flush old instances of the LSA quickly from the network when the originating node is restarted. Given a large enough LSID, wrap-around will never occur, in a practical sense. For example, using a 32 bit LSID and a MinLSInterval of 5 seconds, wrap-around takes on the order of 680 years.","LSIDs must be such that two LSIDs can be compared and the greater (or lesser) of the two identified, or a failure of the comparison indicated. Given two LSIDs x and y, x is considered to be less than y if either\n\n|2and \n\nor\n\n|2and \n\nis true.

VPs may be provisioned statically or dynamically. For example, a user can identify the nodes through which the VP will pass and manually configure each node to support the given VP. Using a method according to the present invention this is done using a centralized technique via a master node. The selection of nodes may be based on any number of criteria, such as QoS, latency, cost, and the like. Alternatively, the VP may be provisioned dynamically using any one of a number of methods, such as a shortest path first technique or a distributed technique (e.g. as described herein). An example of a distributed technique is the restoration method described subsequently herein.","Failure Detection, Propagation, and Restoration","Failure Detection and Propagation","In one embodiment of networks herein, failures are detected using the mechanisms provided by the underlying physical network. For example, when using a SONET network, a fiber cut on a given link results in a loss of signal (LOS) condition at the nodes connected by that link. The LOS condition propagated an Alarm Indication Signal (AIS) downstream, and Remote Defect Indication (RDI) upstream (if the path still exists), and an LOS defect locally. Later, the defect is upgraded to a failure 2.5 seconds later, which causes an alarm to be sent to the Operations System (OS) (per Bellcore's recommendations in GR-253 (GR-253: Synchronous Optical Network (SONET) Transport Systems, Common Generic Criteria, Issue 2 [Bellcore, December 1995], included herein by reference, in its entirety and for all purposes)). Preferably when using SONET, the handling of the LOS condition follows Bellcore's recommendations in GR-253, which allows nodes to inter-operate, and co-exist, with other network equipment (NE) in the same network. The mesh restoration protocol is invoked as soon as the LOS defect is detected by the line card, which occurs 3 ms following the failure (a requirement under GR-253).","The arrival of the AIS at the downstream node causes that downstream node to send a similar alarm to its downstream neighbor and for that node to send an AIS to its own downstream neighbor. This continues from node to node until the AIS finally reaches the source node of the affected VP, or a proxy border node if the source node is located in a different zone. In the latter case, the border node restores the VP on behalf of the source node. Under GR-253, each node is allowed a maximum of 125 microseconds to forward the AIS downstream, which quickly propagates failures toward the source node.","Once a node has detected a failure on one of its links, either through a local LOS defect or a received AIS indication, the node scans its VP table looking for entries that have the failed link in their path. When the node finds one, the node releases all link bandwidth used by the VP. Then, if the node is a VP's source node or a proxy border node, the VP's state is changed to RESTORING and the VP placed on a list of VPs to be restored. Otherwise (if the node isn't the source node or a proxy border node), the state of the VP is changed to DOWN, and a timer is started to delete the VP from the database if a corresponding restore-path request isn't received from the origin node within a certain timeout period. The VP list that was created in the previous step is ordered by quality of service (QoS), which ensures that VPs with a higher QoS setting are restored first. Each entry in the list contains, among other things, the ID of the VP, its source and destination nodes, configured QoS level, and required bandwidth.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0111","num":"0123"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":["900","910","920","930","940","950","960","970","980","990"]},"Failure Restoration","For each VP on the list, the node then sends an RPR to all eligible neighbors in order to restore the given VP. The network will, of course, attempt to restore all failed VPs. Neighbor eligibility is determined by the state of the neighbor, available link bandwidth, current zone topology, location of the Target node, and other parameters. One method for determining the eligibility of a particular neighbor follows:\n\n","Due to the way RPR messages are forwarded by tandem nodes and the unconditional and periodic retransmmission of such messages by origin nodes, multiple instances of the same request are not uncommon, even multiple copies of each instance, circulating the network at any given time. To minimize the amount of broadcast traffic generated by the protocol and aid tandem nodes in allocating bandwidth fairly for competing RPRs, tandem nodes preferably execute a sequence such as that described subsequently.","The term \u201csame instance,\u201d as used below, refers to messages that carry the same VP ID, origin node ID, and hop-count, and are received from the same tandem node (usually, the same input link, assuming only one link between nodes). Any two messages that meet the above criteria are guaranteed to have been sent by the same origin node, over the same link, to restore the same VP, and to have traversed the same path. The terms \u201ccopy of an instance,\u201d or more simply \u201ccopy\u201d are used herein to refer to a retransmission of a given instance. Normally, tandem nodes select the first instance they receive since in most, but not all cases, as the first RPR received normally represents the quickest path to the origin node. A method for making such a determination was described in reference to . Because such information must be stored for numerous RPRs, a standard data structure is defined under this protocol.","The Restore-Path Request Entry (RPRE) is a data structure that maintains information about a specific instance of a RPRE packet.

If the local node's ID is equal to the target node's ID, the local node is the target of the RPR and must process the RPR as such. This is illustrated in  as step  and is the subject of the flow diagram illustrated in . If the local node is not the target node, the RPR's HOP_COUNT is compared to MAX_HOP in order to determine if the HOP_COUNT has exceed or will exceed the maximum number of hops allowable (step ). If this is the case, a negative acknowledgment (NAK) with a Flush indicator is then sent back to the originating node (step ). If the HOP_COUNT is still within acceptable limits, the node then determines whether this is the first instance of the RPR having been received (step ). If this is the case, a Restore-Path Request Entry (RPRE) is created for the request (step ). This is done by creating the RPRE and setting the RPRE's fields, including starting a time-to-live (TTL) or deletion timer, in the following manner:","RPRE. SourceNode=Header. Origin","RPRE.Destination Node=Header.Target","RPRE.FirstSequence Number=Hearder.SequenceNumber","RPRE.Last Sequence Number=Header.Sequence Number","RPRE.QoS=Header.Parms.RestorePath.QoS","RPRE.Bandwidth=Header.Parms.RestorePath.Bandwidth","RPRE.ReceivedFrom=Node ID of the neighbor that sent us this message","StartTimer (RPRE.Timer, RPR_TTL)","The ID of the input link is then added to the path in the RPRE (e.g., Path[PathIndex++]=LinkID) (step ). Next, the local node determines whether the target node is a direct neighbor (step ). If the target node is not a direct neighbor of the local node, a copy of the (modified) RPR is sent to all eligible neighbors (step ). The PendingReplies and SentTo Fields of the corresponding RPRE are also updated accordingly at this time. If the target node is a direct neighbor of the local node, the RPR is sent only to the target node (step ). In either case, the RPRE corresponding to the given RPR is then updated (step ).","If this is not the first instance of the RPR received by the local node, the local node then attempts to determine whether this might be a different instance of the RPR (step ). A request is considered to be a different instance if the RPR:\n\n","If this is simply a different instance of the RPR, and another instance of the same RPR has been processed, and accepted, by this node, a NAK Wrong Instance is sent to the originating neighbor (step ). The response follows the reverse of the path carried in the request. No broadcasting is therefore necessary in such a case. If a similar instance of the RPR has been processed and accepted by this node (step ), the local node determines whether a Terminate NAK has been received for this RPR (step ). If a Terminate NAK has been received for this RPR, the RPR is rejected by sending a Terminate response to the originating neighbor (step ). If a Terminate NAK was not received for this RPR, the new sequence number is recorded (step ) and a copy of the RPR is forwarded to all eligible neighbors that have not sent a Flush response to the local node for the same instance of this RPR (step ). This may include nodes that weren't previously considered by this node due to conflicts with other VPs, but does not include nodes from which a Flush response has already been received for the same instance of this RPR. The local node should then save the number of sent requests in the PendingReplies field of the corresponding RPRE.

While the response is making its way from node N to node N, node N is busy configuring its matrix. In most cases, by the time the response reaches the origin node, all nodes along the path have already configured their matrices.","The Terminate indicator prevents \u201cbad\u201d instances of an RPR from circulating around the network for extended periods of time. The Terminate indicator is propagated all the way back to the originating node and prevents the originating node, and all other nodes along the path, from sending or forwarding other copies of the corresponding RPR instance.","Terminating RPR Packets are processed as follows. The RPR continues along the path until any one of the following four conditions is encountered:\n\n","Further optimizations of the protocol can easily be envisioned by one of skill in the art, and are intended to be within the scope of this specification. For example in one embodiment, a mechanism is defined to further reduce the amount of broadcast traffic generated for any given VP. In order to prevent an upstream neighbor from sending the same instance of an RPR every T milliseconds, a tandem node can immediately return a no-commit positive response to that neighbor, which prevents that neighbor from sending further copies of the instance. The response simply acknowledges the receipt of the request, and doesn't commit the sender to any of the requested resources. Preferably, however, the sender (of the positive response) periodically transmits the acknowledged request until a valid response is received from its downstream neighbor(s). This mechanism implements a piece-wise, or hop-by-hop, acknowledgment strategy that limits the scope of retransmitted packets to a region that gets progressively smaller as the request gets closer to its target node.","Optimizations","However, it is prudent to provide some optimizations for efficiently handling errors. Communication protocols often handle link errors by starting a timer after every transmission and, if a valid response isn't received within the timeout period, the message is retransmitted. If a response isn't received after a certain number of retransmission, the sender generates a local error and disables the connection. The timeout period is usually a configurable parameter, but in some cases the timeout period is computed dynamically, and continuously, by the two end points. The simplest form of this uses some multiple of the average round trip time as a timeout period, while others use complex mathematical formulas to determine this value. Depending on the distance between the two nodes, the speed of link that connects them, and the latency of the equipment along the path, the timeout period can range anywhere from millisecond to seconds.","The above strategy is not the preferred method of handling link errors. This is because the fast restoration times required dictates that 2-way, end-to-end communication be carried out in less than 50 ms. A drawback of the above-described solution is the time wasted while waiting for an acknowledgment to come back from the receiving node. A safe timeout period for a 2000 mile span, for instance, is over 35 ms, which doesn't leave enough time for a retransmission in case of an error.","This problem is addressed in one embodiment by taking advantage of the multiple communication channels, i.e. OC-48's that exist between nodes to:\n\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0146","num":"0177"},"figref":"FIG. 14","b":["1400","1400","1405","1410","1415","1455","1415","0","1445","6","0"]},"Network  is flat, meaning that all nodes belong to the same zone, zone  or the backbone zone.

The Delete Path packet can use the same packet format as the Restore Path packet. The originating node is responsible for initializing the Path [ ], PathLength, and Checksum fields to the packet, which should include the full path of the VP being deleted. The originating node also sets PathIndex to zero. Tandem nodes should release link resources allocated for the VP after they have received a valid response from the target node.

This message is provided for instances in which the alarms associated with such failures (AIS and RDI) do not reach the master node.","Centralized Method of Network Management","An extension of the preceding approach is the use of a centralized network management technique according to an embodiment of the present invention. Centralized control can be employed in which a central network node is elected to handle routing and provisioning tasks, such as provisioning connections in a network according to embodiments of the present invention.","Network Startup","In a network employing a centralized method according to embodiments of the present invention, the network's nodes are preferably configured in groups of three or more nodes, and interconnected in a mesh configuration, in a manner such as that described previously with regard to . The nodes form a single distributed system that can span thousands of miles and supports tens of thousands of connections. For such a system to work properly and reliably, there should be a well-defined interface between the nodes, and an agreed upon control hierarchy. Such an interface and hierarchy can be implemented as outlined previously, or may be implemented using a centralized method.","Using a centralized method, one node is designated the master node within each network. This master node is responsible for all path discovery, implementation, assurance, and restoration activities. A second node, preferably one that is geographically diverse from the master node, is assigned the role of the backup node. The backup node is responsible for closely monitoring the master node, and is always ready to take over the master node's responsibilities should the master node fail. The user can also designate one or more nodes as standby nodes. Such nodes act as a second line of defense against failures on the master and backup nodes. In the case where both the master and backup nodes experience failures, the remaining standby node with the highest priority assumes the role of the backup node, should the then-current master node fail.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0188","num":"0222"},"figref":"FIG. 22","b":["2200","2205","2215","2220","2225"]},"If the master is not the same (step ), and the node ID is numerically lower than that of the previous master (step ), then the following process occurs. A warning message (indicating that multiple master nodes are operating (multiple masters)) is logged (step ). The contents of the message are copied into a local structure, overwriting those of the previous message (step ). This is the point to which the process jumps if the IAM_MASTER message received was not the first IAM_MASTER message received. The hop count field of the message is then incremented (step ). This is the point to which the process jumps if the hop count and source node of the IAM_MASTER message received was the same as a previous IAM_MASTER message. If the hop count doesn't exceed the maximum allowed (step ), the IAM_MASTER message is forwarded to all immediate neighbors (step ).","Regardless of the hop count, the system controller then waits for a specified time (e.g., 25 ms\u00d7hop-count), and sends a positive reply to the master (step ). The reply carries information about the node, such as:","1. Node ID (e.g., the lower 16 bits of the node's serial number)","2. Node type (e.g., backup, normal)","3. System inventory (e.g., from a list of resources maintained by the node)","Finally, the version numbers of all local executable images are compared with those available on the master node, and make a list of all images that need to be updated (step ). The list of images created in step  above is then used by the node to update its local copy of the executable images. This may be accomplished, for example, by initiating one or more File Transfer Protocol (FTP) sessions with the master node. FTP, which is a TCP\/IP application, is an efficient file transfer protocol that is readily available on most TCP\/IP hosts.","At the end of the sequence illustrated in , the master node should have a list of all network resources, and all nodes should have the most recent version of their executable images. The acquired list contains information about whether a given node has routing capabilities, i.e., has a working route processor module. Such nodes automatically assume the role of a standby node, unless they are specifically configured otherwise. The master node assigns the role of the backup node to one of the standby nodes according to Table 19. Once a backup node has been selected for the network, the master node sends the backup node copies of various databases (e.g., the databases containing information regarding the network's topology (the topology database) and information regarding the virtual paths carried by the network), if necessary, and a copy of the resource list (the dynamic database that contains information regarding resources (also referred to herein as the resource database or run-time database).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0196","num":"0230"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00022","num":"00022"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 19"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Codes for Role of Backup Nodes"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"84pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"133pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Number of configured",{}]},{"entry":["backup nodes","Selected backup node"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["0","The standby node with the highest-priority"]},{"entry":[{},"(lowest ID)"]},{"entry":["1","The one configured as a backup node"]},{"entry":["2 or more","The backup node with the highest-priority"]},{"entry":[{},"(lowest ID)"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"The master node is assumed to have the most up-to-date copy of the database, which is also referred to herein as the authoritative or primary copy. The backup and standby nodes should have a mirror copy of the authoritative database, but this is not assumed unless the authoritative copy is no longer available due to damage or master node failure. Preferably, each version of the database is preferably assigned a unique serial number that allows different versions of the database to be uniquely identified. Such a serial number is normally higher on more recent versions of the same database, simplifying the location and identification of the most recent copy. Serial numbers can be assigned, for example, by the master node, and, in order to implement the preceding paradigm, incremented when the authoritative copy is modified. Changes to secondary copies of the database, by nodes other than the master node, are not usually allowed. When this occurs, however, only the version number of the database should be changed, and not the database's serial number. This allows independent branches of the authoritative copy to be easily tracked and merged. In most cases, however, only the authoritative copy of the database is modified by management agents. Other secondary copies are treated as read-only by their respective nodes.","Database Synchronization","During network startup, the master, backup, and standby nodes participate in a database synchronization activity that results in a single authoritative copy of the database(s). As depicted in , the sequence starts with the master node sending a message (referred to herein as a GET_DATABASE_INFO message) to the backup node (step ). Upon receiving the message (step ), the backup node sends back a reply containing the serial and version numbers of the backup node's database(s) (step ). The master node uses this information to determine whether a copy of the master node's authoritative database(s) should be sent to that backup node. If the numbers match those of the authoritative database(s) (step ), the backup node is assumed to be up-to-date, and no action is taken by the master node (step ). If, however, either number differs from that of the authoritative database(s) (step ), then a copy of the affected database(s) are sent to the backup node (step ).","The next action performed is the master node's sending a copy of the resource list (the dynamic or run-time database, as noted) to the backup node (step ). The embedded hierarchy of the resource list is preferably maintained when such a transfer occurs. Once the backup node has been updated, the backup node in turn sends copies of its database(s) (e.g., topology database and dynamic database) to all standby nodes found in the resource list (step ). The sequence is similar to the one described above, and so will not be repeated here. Once all nodes have been synchronized, they remain synchronized by messages that inform them of any changes made to the database(s) (e.g., LSA updates for topology changes, and a CreatePath packet for changes to VPs) (step ). Furthermore, all user-initiated changes, regardless of where such changes are entered, are handled through the master node, which also updates the backup and standby nodes, before committing the changes to the database(s).","Establishing Multiple Connections",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0200","num":"0234"},"figref":"FIG. 24"},"The process begins with the system controller sending a START_MULTIPLE message to the route processor (step ), which causes the route processor to enter batch-processing mode, where configuration requests are deleted until an END_MULTIPLE message is received. The system controller then retrieves the next connection record from the database (step ). This should be the highest priority connection of all such remaining connections.","The system controller sends an ADD_CONNECTION message to the route processor (step ). The message includes information about the connection such as the following, which may be obtained from the corresponding database record:","1. Source node","2. Destination node","3. Bandwidth","4. QoS","Upon receiving the ADD_CONNECTION request, the route processor computes the shortest-path route for the connection, taking into consideration the QoS, bandwidth, and any other parameters specified (step ). This may be accomplished, for example, using a method such as the QSPF method described earlier herein, and described more fully in patent application Ser.

Saleh as inventor, which is hereby incorporated by reference, in its entirety and for all purposes. If the route lookup attempt is successful (step ), the route processor then updates the input\/output maps of all affected nodes, and sends a positive reply to the system controller (step ). A positive reply from the route processor changes the state of the connection to MAPPED (step ). If the route lookup attempt fails for any reason (step ), the route processor sends back a negative response that carries a reason code explaining the cause of the failure (step ). A negative response changes the state of the connection to FAILED (step ) and causes an error message to be generated (step ).","The system controller continues until all provisioned connections have been processed (step ). The system controller then sends an END_MULTIPLE request to the route processor (step ), which causes the route processor to send all input\/output maps to their respective nodes. The route processor then sends a copy of those maps to the system controller (step ), which in turn sends a copy to the backup node (step ).","Adding A Connection",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0209","num":"0243"},"figref":"FIG. 25","b":["2500","2505","2510","2515","2510","2520"],"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0018","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0018-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0019","list-style":"none"},"li":["1.
