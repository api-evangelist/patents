One of the seminal modes for interacting with this data is through the use of hyperlinks within electronic documents.","More recently, there has been interest in hyperlinking documents to other documents based on the names of people in the documents. For example, to facilitate legal research, West Publishing Company of St. Paul, Minn. (doing business as Thomson West) provides thousands of electronic judicial opinions that hyperlink the names of attorneys and judges to their online biographical entries in the West Legal Directory, a proprietary directory of approximately 1,000,000 U.S. attorneys and 20,000 judges. These hyperlinks allow users accessing judicial opinions to quickly obtain contact and other specific information about lawyers and judges named in the opinions.","The hyperlinks in these judicial opinions are generated automatically, using a system that extracts first, middle, and last names; law firm name, city, and state; and court information from the text of the opinions and uses them as clues to determine whether to link the named attorneys and judges to their corresponding entries in the professional directory. See Christopher Dozier and Robert Haschart, \u201cAutomatic Extraction and Linking of Person Names in Legal Text\u201d (Proceedings of RIAO 2000: Content Based Multimedia Information Access.

Specialized or configurable parsers (finite state transducers), which are selected or configured on the basis of the determined document type and the entity record being built, identify and extract entity information for each type of entity.","Parsers extract information by specifically searching for a named entity (person, address, company, etc) or by relationships between entities. Parser text-extraction is based on the data's input criteria. For example, the more structured (tagged) data enables a \u201ctighter\u201d set of rules to be built within a parser. This set of rules allows more specific information to be extracted about a particular entity. A more \u201cfree\u201d data collection, such as a web site, is not as conducive to rule-based parsers. A collection could also include a combination of structured, semi-structured, and free data. More specifically, parsers are developed through \u201cregular-expression\u201d methods. The regular expressions serves are \u201crules\u201d for parsers to find entity types and categories of information.","Block  attempts to link or logically associate each extracted entity reference record with one or more existing authority directories. In the exemplary embodiment, this entails computing a Bayesian match probability for each extracted entity reference and one more corresponding candidate records in corresponding directories (or databases) that have been designated as authoritative in terms of accepted accuracy. If the match probability satisfies match criteria, the records are merged or associated and the input document. Execution then proceeds to block .","Block  entails enriching unmatched entity reference records using a matching process. In the exemplary embodiment, this enriching process entails operating specific types of data harvesters on the web, other databases, and other directories or lists, to assemble a cache of new relevant profile information for databases, such as expert database  in . The unmatched or unmarked entity records are then matched against the harvested entity records using Bayesian matching. Those that satisfy the match criteria are referred to a quality control process for verification or confirmation prior to addition to the relevant entity directory. The quality control process may be manual, semi-automatic, or fully automatic. For example, some embodiments base the type of quality control on the degree to which the match criteria is exceeded.","In some embodiments, blocks  operates in parallel with blocks -, continually retrieving new entity related data using any number of web crawlers, relational databases, or CDs, and attempting to building new entity records.","The embodiments described above are intended only to illustrate and teach one or more ways of practicing or implementing the present invention, not to restrict its breadth or scope. The actual scope of the invention, which embraces all ways of practicing or implementing the teachings of the invention, is defined only by the following claims and their equivalents."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":"100"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":"100"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIGS. 3-8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 10"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
