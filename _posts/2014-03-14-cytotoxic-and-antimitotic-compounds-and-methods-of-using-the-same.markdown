of cancer and other diseases.","Description of the Related Art","Talpir, R. et al. (1994) Tetrahedron Lett. 35:4453-6, describe the naturally occurring compound hemiasterlin, a stable tripeptide obtained from marine sponges that causes microtubule depolymerization and mitotic arrest in cells. Hemisasterlin consists of unusual and highly congested amino acids, features thought to contribute to its activity. A number of groups have modified particular structural elements of hemiasterlin to evaluate structure-activity relationships and assess the activity of hemiasterlin analogs. See for example Zask et al., Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry Letters, 14:4353-4358, 2004; Zask et al., J Med Chem, 47:4774-4786, 2004; Yamashita et al., Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry Letters, 14:5317-5322, 2004; PCT\/GB96\/00942; WO 2004\/026293; WO96\/33211; and U.S. Pat. No. 7,579,323.","Analogs of hemiasterlin with modifications in the \u201cA-segment\u201d, or the amino terminal segment, have been described (see for example, Zask et al., J Med Chem, 47:4774-4786, 2004; Yamashita et al., Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry Letters, 14:5317-5322, 2004; U.S. Pat. No. 7,579,323). U.S. Pat. No. 7,579,323 discloses an analog of hemiasterlin, referred to as HT1-286, in which the indole moiety is replaced by a phenyl group. HT1-286 exhibits potent anti-mitotic activity and has been assessed in clinical trials for the treatment of cancer (Ratain et al., Proc Am Soc Clin Oncol, 22:129, 2003).","Analogs of hemiasterlin with modifications in the \u201cD-segment\u201d, or the carboxy terminal segment, have also been reported (see, for example, WO 2004\/026293; Zask et al., Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry Letters, 14:4353-4358, 2004; Zask et al., J Med Chem, 47:4774-4786, 2004). The majority of modifications at the carboxy terminus result in compounds with substantially decreased potency compared to parent carboxylic acids. See, for example, WO 2004\/026293, particularly Table 12. Zask et al., (J Med Chem, 47:4774-4786, 2004) also report that amide analogs prepared using simple cyclic and acyclic amines exhibit significantly reduced potency (reductions of one to three orders of magnitude). Among the few tolerated modifications, Zask et al., (Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry Letters, 14:4353-4358, 2004) report that the addition of esterified cyclic amino acids at the carboxy-terminus yields tetrapeptide analogs with prolyl-like ester-containing termini, some of which exhibit potency comparable to parent compound in a tested cancer cell line.","Potent cytotoxic and anti-mitotic compositions are highly desired for the treatment of a number of devastating disorders, including cancer. While a wide variety of hemiasterlin analogs have been generated, many, including a wide variety of compounds with modifications at the carboxy terminus, exhibit reduced potency that limits utility in methods of medical treatment.","For the foregoing reasons, while progress has been made in this field, there is a need for additional potent anti-mitotic and cytotoxic compounds having preferred characteristics that render them suitable for the treatment of a variety of disorders, including cancer.

Hydroxyl and amino groups which protected with a protecting group are referred to herein as \u201cprotected hydroxyl groups\u201d and \u201cprotected amino groups\u201d, respectively. Protecting groups are typically used selectively and\/or orthogonally to protect sites during reactions at other reactive sites and can then be removed to leave the unprotected group as is or available for further reactions. Protecting groups as known in the art are described generally in Greene and Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 3rd edition, John Wiley & Sons, New York (1999). Groups can be selectively incorporated into compounds of the present disclosure as precursors. For example an amino group can be placed into a compound of the disclosure as an azido group that can be chemically converted to the amino group at a desired point in the synthesis. Generally, groups are protected or present as a precursor that will be inert to reactions that modify other areas of the parent molecule for conversion into their final groups at an appropriate time. Further representative protecting or precursor groups are discussed in Agrawal, et al., Protocols for Oligonucleotide Conjugates, Eds, Humana Press; New Jersey, 1994; Vol. 26 pp. 1-72.

Thus, the term \u201cprodrug\u201d refers to a metabolic precursor of a compound of the disclosure that is pharmaceutically acceptable. A prodrug may be inactive when administered to a subject in need thereof, but is converted in vivo to an active compound of the disclosure. In one embodiment, a prodrug is rapidly transformed in vivo to yield the parent compound of the disclosure, for example, by hydrolysis in blood. In one embodiment, a prodrug may be stable in plasma or blood. In one embodiment, a prodrug may be targeted form of a compound of the invention. The prodrug compound often offers advantages of solubility, tissue compatibility or delayed release in a mammalian organism (see, Bundgard, H., Design of Prodrugs (1985), pp. 7-9, 21-24 (Elsevier, Amsterdam)). A discussion of prodrugs is provided in Higuchi, T., et al., A.C.S. Symposium Series, Vol. 14, and in Bioreversible Carriers in Drug Design, Ed. Edward B. Roche, American Pharmaceutical Association and Pergamon Press, 1987.","The term \u201cprodrug\u201d is meant to include any covalently bonded carriers, which release the active compound of the disclosure in vivo when such prodrug is administered to a mammalian subject. Conjugates, including ADCs, as disclosed herein, are such prodrugs of compositions having structure (I). Prodrugs of a compound of the disclosure may be prepared by modifying functional groups present in the compound of the disclosure in such a way that the modifications are cleaved, either in routine manipulation or in vivo, to the parent compound of the disclosure. Prodrugs include compounds of the disclosure wherein a hydroxy, amino or mercapto group is bonded to any group that, when the prodrug of the compound of the disclosure is administered to a mammalian subject, cleaves to form a free hydroxy, free amino or free mercapto group, respectively. Examples of prodrugs include, but are not limited to, acetate, formate and benzoate derivatives of alcohol or amide derivatives of amine functional groups in the compounds of the disclosure and the like.","The present disclosure also meant to encompass all pharmaceutically acceptable compounds of structure (I) being isotopically-labelled by having one or more atoms replaced by an atom having a different atomic mass or mass number. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into the disclosed compounds include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorous, fluorine, chlorine, and iodine, such as H, H, C, C, C, N, N, O, O, O, P, P, S, F, Cl, I, and I, respectively. These radiolabelled compounds could be useful to help determine or measure the effectiveness of the compounds, by characterizing, for example, the site or mode of action, or binding affinity to pharmacologically important site of action. Certain isotopically-labelled compounds of structure (I), for example, those incorporating a radioactive isotope, are useful in drug and\/or substrate tissue distribution studies. The radioactive isotopes tritium, i.e. H, and carbon-14, i.e. C, are particularly useful for this purpose in view of their ease of incorporation and ready means of detection.","Substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium, i.e. H, may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example, increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements, and hence may be preferred in some circumstances.","Substitution with positron emitting isotopes, such as C, F, O and N, can be useful in Positron Emission Topography (PET) studies for examining substrate receptor occupancy. Isotopically-labeled compounds of structure (I) can generally be prepared by conventional techniques known to those skilled in the art or by processes analogous to those described in the Preparations and Examples as set out below using an appropriate isotopically-labeled reagent in place of the non-labeled reagent previously employed.","The present disclosure is also meant to encompass the in vivo metabolic products of the disclosed compounds. Such products may result from, for example, the oxidation, reduction, hydrolysis, amidation, esterification, and the like of the administered compound, primarily due to enzymatic processes. Accordingly, the present disclosure includes compounds produced by a process comprising administering a compound of this disclosure to a mammal for a period of time sufficient to yield a metabolic product thereof. Such products are typically identified by administering a radiolabelled compound of the disclosure in a detectable dose to an animal, such as rat, mouse, guinea pig, monkey, or to human, allowing sufficient time for metabolism to occur, and isolating its conversion products from the urine, blood or other biological samples.","\u201cStable compound\u201d and \u201cstable structure\u201d are meant to indicate a compound that is sufficiently robust to survive isolation to a useful degree of purity from a reaction mixture, and formulation into an efficacious therapeutic agent.","The term \u201cantibody\u201d herein is used in the broadest sense and specifically covers intact monoclonal antibodies, polyclonal antibodies, multispecific antibodies (e.g., bispecific antibodies) formed from at least two intact antibodies, and antibody fragments, so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity.

The immunoglobulin disclosed herein can be of any type (e.g., IgG, IgE, IgM, IgD, and IgA), class (e.g., IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgA1 and IgA2) or subclass of immunoglobulin molecule. The immunoglobulins can be derived from any species. In one aspect the immunoglobulin is of human, murine, or rabbit origin. In another aspect, the antibodies are polyclonal, monoclonal, multi-specific (e.g., bispecific), human, humanized or chimeric antibodies, linear antibodies, single chain antibodies, diabodies, maxibodies, minibodies, Fv, Fab fragments, F(ab\u2032) fragments, F(ab\u2032)fragments, fragments produced by a Fab expression library, anti-idiotypic (anti-Id) antibodies, CDR's, and epitope-binding fragments of any of the above which immunospecifically bind to a target antigen.","The term \u201cmonoclonal antibody\u201d as used herein refers to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, i.e., the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally-occurring mutations that may be present in minor amounts. Monoclonal antibodies include \u201cchimeric\u201d antibodies in which a portion of the heavy and\/or light chain is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass, while the remainder of the chain(s) is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass, as well as fragments of such antibodies (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567; and Morrison et al., 1984, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81:6851-6855). Monoclonal antibodies also include humanized antibodies may contain a completely human constant region and a CDRs from a nonhuman source.","An \u201cintact\u201d antibody is one which comprises an antigen-binding variable region as well as a light chain constant domain (CL) and heavy chain constant domains, C, Cand C.

Examples of antibody fragments include Fab, Fab\u2032, F(ab\u2032), and Fv fragments; diabodies; linear antibodies; single-chain antibody molecules; maxibodies; minibodies; and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragment(s).","An \u201cisolated\u201d antibody is one which has been identified and separated and\/or recovered from a component of its natural environment. Contaminant components of its natural environment are materials which would interfere with diagnostic or therapeutic uses for the antibody, and may include enzymes, hormones, and other proteinaceous or nonproteinaceous solutes. In some embodiments, the antibody will be purified (1) to greater than 95% by weight of antibody as determined by the Lowry method, and most preferably more than 99% by weight, (2) to a degree sufficient to obtain at least 15 residues of N-terminal or internal amino acid sequence by use of a spinning cup sequenator, or (3) to homogeneity by SDS-PAGE under reducing or nonreducing conditions using Coomassie blue or, preferably, silver stain. Isolated antibody includes the antibody in situ within recombinant cells since at least one component of the antibody's natural environment will not be present. Ordinarily, however, isolated antibody will be prepared by at least one purification step.","An antibody \u201cwhich binds\u201d an antigen of interest is one capable of binding that antigen with sufficient affinity such that the antibody is useful in targeting a cell expressing the antigen.","A \u201cnative sequence\u201d polypeptide is one which has the same amino acid sequence as a polypeptide derived from nature. Such native sequence polypeptides can be isolated from nature or can be produced by recombinant or synthetic means. Thus, a native sequence polypeptide can have the amino acid sequence of naturally-occurring human polypeptide, murine polypeptide, or polypeptide from any other mammalian species.","The term \u201cintracellular metabolite\u201d refers to a compound resulting from a metabolic process or reaction inside a cell on a composition of the invention (e.g., an antibody drug conjugate (ADC)). The metabolic process or reaction may be an enzymatic process such as proteolytic cleavage of a peptide linker of the subject composition, or hydrolysis of a functional group such as a hydrazone, ester, or amide within the subject composition. In the context of conjugates, including ADCs, intracellular metabolites include, but are not limited to, antibodies and free drug which have been separated intracellularly, i.e., after entry, diffusion, uptake or transport into a cell (e.g., by enzymatic cleavage of an ADC by an intracellular enzyme).","In the context of conjugates, including ADCs, the terms \u201cintracellularly cleaved\u201d and \u201cintracellular cleavage\u201d refer to metabolic processes or reactions inside a cell on a composition of the invention whereby the covalent attachment, e.g., the linker (L), between the drug moiety (D) and the targeting moiety (T) (e.g., an antibody) is broken, resulting in the free drug dissociated from (T) inside the cell. The cleaved moieties of the subject compositions are thus intracellular metabolites (e.g., T, T-L fragment, D-L fragment, D). Accordingly, in one embodiment, the invention provides compositions that are cleavage products of a composition having structure (II), which cleavage products include compositions comprising structure (I).","\u201cMammal\u201d includes humans and both domestic animals such as laboratory animals and household pets (e.g., cats, dogs, swine, cattle, sheep, goats, horses, rabbits), and non-domestic animals such as wildlife and the like.","\u201cOptional\u201d or \u201coptionally\u201d means that the subsequently described event of circumstances may or may not occur, and that the description includes instances where said event or circumstance occurs and instances in which it does not.

Methods of producing polyclonal antibodies are known in the art. A monoclonal antibody (mAb) to an antigen-of-interest can be prepared by using any technique known in the art. These include, but are not limited to, the hybridoma technique originally described by Kohler and Milstein (1975, Nature 256, 495-497), the human B cell hybridoma technique (Kozbor et al., 1983, Immunology Today 4:72), and the EBV-hybridoma technique (Cole et al., 1985, Monoclonal Antibodies and Cancer Therapy, Alan R.

Such antibodies may be of any immunoglobulin class including IgG, IgM, IgE, IgA, and IgD and any subclass thereof. The hybridoma producing the mAbs of use in this invention may be cultivated in vitro or in vivo.","The monoclonal antibody can be, for example, a human monoclonal antibody, a humanized monoclonal antibody, an antibody fragment, or a chimeric antibody (e.g., a human-mouse antibody). Human monoclonal antibodies may be made by any of numerous techniques known in the art (e.g., Teng et al., 1983, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 80:7308-7312; Kozbor et al., 1983, Immunology Today 4:72-79; and Olsson et al., 1982, Meth. Enzymol. 92:3-16). See also, Huse et al., 1989, Science 246:1275-1281 and McLean et al. J Immunol. 2005 Apr. 15; 174(8):4768-78.","The antibody can also be a bispecific antibody. Methods for making bispecific antibodies are known in the art. Traditional production of full-length bispecific antibodies is based on the coexpression of two immunoglobulin heavy chain-light chain pairs, where the two chains have different specificities (see, e.g., Milstein et al., 1983, Nature 305:537-539; International Publication No. WO 93\/08829, Traunecker et al., 1991, EMBO J. 10:3655-3659.","According to a different approach, antibody variable domains with the desired binding specificities (antibody-antigen combining sites) are fused to immunoglobulin constant domain sequences. The fusion preferably is with an immunoglobulin heavy chain constant domain, comprising at least part of the hinge, C, and Cregions. It is preferred to have the first heavy-chain constant region (C) containing the site necessary for light chain binding, present in at least one of the fusions. Nucleic acids with sequences encoding the immunoglobulin heavy chain fusions and, if desired, the immunoglobulin light chain, are inserted into separate expression vectors, and are co-transfected into a suitable host organism. This provides for flexibility in adjusting the mutual proportions of the three polypeptide fragments in embodiments when unequal ratios of the three polypeptide chains used in the construction provide the optimum yields. It is, however, possible to insert the coding sequences for two or all three polypeptide chains in one expression vector when the expression of at least two polypeptide chains in equal ratios results in high yields or when the ratios are of no particular significance.","For example, the bispecific antibodies can have a hybrid immunoglobulin heavy chain with a first binding specificity in one arm, and a hybrid immunoglobulin heavy chain-light chain pair (providing a second binding specificity) in the other arm. This asymmetric structure facilitates the separation of the desired bispecific compound from unwanted immunoglobulin chain combinations, as the presence of an immunoglobulin light chain in only one half of the bispecific molecule provides for a facile way of separation (International Publication No. WO 94\/04690) which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","For further details for generating bispecific antibodies see, for example, Suresh et al., 1986, Methods in Enzymology 121:210; Rodrigues et al., 1993, J. Immunology 151:6954-6961; Carter et al., 1992, Bio\/Technology 10:163-167; Carter et al., 1995, J. Hematotherapy 4:463-470; Merchant et al., 1998, Nature Biotechnology 16:677-681. Using such techniques, bispecific antibodies can be prepared for use in the treatment or prevention of disease as defined herein.","Bifunctional antibodies are also described in European Patent Publication No. EPA 0 105 360. As disclosed in this reference, hybrid or bifunctional antibodies can be derived either biologically, i.e., by cell fusion techniques, or chemically, especially with cross-linking agents or disulfide-bridge forming reagents, and may comprise whole antibodies or fragments thereof. Methods for obtaining such hybrid antibodies are disclosed for example, in International Publication WO 83\/03679, and European Patent Publication No. EPA 0 217 577, both of which are incorporated herein by reference.","The antibody also can be a functionally active fragment, derivative or analog of an antibody that immunospecifically binds to a target antigen (e.g., a cancer antigen, a viral antigen, a microbial antigen, or other antibodies bound to cells or matrix). In this regard, \u201cfunctionally active\u201d means that the fragment, derivative or analog is able to recognize the same antigen that the antibody from which the fragment, derivative or analog is derived recognized. Specifically, in an exemplary embodiment the antigenicity of the idiotype of the immunoglobulin molecule can be enhanced by deletion of framework and CDR sequences that are C-terminal to the CDR sequence that specifically recognizes the antigen. To determine which CDR sequences bind the antigen, synthetic peptides containing the CDR sequences can be used in binding assays with the antigen by any binding assay method known in the art (e.g., the BIA core assay) (see, e.g., Kabat et al., 1991, Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, Fifth Edition, National Institute of Health, Bethesda, Md.; Kabat et al., 1980, J. Immunology 125(3):961-969).","Other useful antibodies include fragments of antibodies such as, but not limited to, F(ab\u2032)fragments, Fab fragments, Fab\u2032, Fv fragments and heavy chain and light chain dimers of antibodies, or any minimal fragment thereof such as Fvs or single chain antibodies (SCAs) (e.g., as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,946,778; Bird, 1988, Science 242:423-42; Huston et al., 1988, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85:5879-5883; and Ward et al., 1989, Nature 334:544-54).","Recombinant antibodies, such as chimeric and humanized monoclonal antibodies, comprising both human and non-human portions, which can be made using standard recombinant DNA techniques, also can be used. (See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567; and U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,397.) Humanized antibodies are antibody molecules from non-human species having one or more complementarity determining regions (CDRs) from the non-human species and a framework region from a human immunoglobulin molecule. (See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,585,089.)

Human antibodies can be prepared, for example, using transgenic mice that are incapable of expressing endogenous immunoglobulin heavy and light chains genes, but which can express human heavy and light chain genes. The transgenic mice are immunized in the normal fashion with a selected antigen, e.g., all or a portion of a polypeptide of the invention. Monoclonal antibodies directed against the antigen can be obtained using conventional hybridoma technology. The human immunoglobulin transgenes harbored by the transgenic mice rearrange during B cell differentiation, and subsequently undergo class switching and somatic mutation. Thus, using such a technique, it is possible to produce therapeutically useful IgG, IgA, IgM and IgE antibodies. For an overview of this technology for producing human antibodies, see Lonberg and Huszar (1995, Int. Rev. Immunol. 13:65-93). For a detailed discussion of this technology for producing human antibodies and human monoclonal antibodies and protocols for producing such antibodies. see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,625,126; 5,633,425; 5,569,825; 5,661,016; and 5,545,806.","Human antibodies that recognize a selected epitope also can be generated using a technique referred to as \u201cguided selection.\u201d In this approach a selected non-human monoclonal antibody, e.g., a mouse antibody, is used to guide the selection of a completely human antibody recognizing the same epitope. (See, e.g., Jespers et al., 1994, Biotechnology 12:899-903.) Human antibodies can also be produced using various techniques known in the art, including phage display libraries (see, e.g., Hoogenboom and Winter, 1991, J. Mol. Biol. 227:381; Marks et al., 1991, J. Mol. Biol. 222:581; Quan and Carter, 2002, \u201cThe rise of monoclonal antibodies as therapeutics,\u201d in Anti-IgE and Allergic Disease, Jardieu, P. M. and Fick Jr., R. B, eds., Marcel Dekker, New York, N.Y., Chapter 20, pp. 427-469).","In other embodiments, the antibody is a fusion protein of an antibody, or a functionally active fragment thereof. For example, an antibody can be fused via a covalent bond (e.g., a peptide bond) at either the N-terminus or the C-terminus to an amino acid sequence of another protein (or portion thereof, such as at least a 10, 20 or 50 amino acid portion of the protein) that is not the antibody.","Antibodies also include analogs and derivatives that are either modified, i.e., by the covalent attachment of any type of molecule as long as such covalent attachment permits the antibody to retain its antigen binding immunospecificity. For example, but not by way of limitation, the derivatives and analogs of the antibodies include those that have been further modified, e.g., by glycosylation, acetylation, pegylation, phosphorylation, amidation, derivatization by known protecting\/blocking groups, proteolytic cleavage, linkage to a cellular antibody unit or other protein, etc. Any of numerous chemical modifications can be carried out by known techniques, including but not limited to specific chemical cleavage, acetylation, formylation, metabolic synthesis in the presence of tunicamycin, etc. Additionally, the analog or derivative can contain one or more unnatural amino acids.","The antibodies can have modifications (e.g., substitutions, deletions or additions) in amino acid residues that interact with Fc receptors. In particular, antibodies include antibodies having modifications in amino acid residues identified as involved in the interaction between the anti-Fc domain and the FcRn receptor (see, e.g., International Publication No. WO 97\/34631, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). Antibodies immunospecific for a target antigen can be obtained commercially or other source or produced by any method known to one of skill in the art such as, e.g., chemical synthesis or recombinant expression techniques. The nucleotide sequence encoding antibodies immunospecific for a cancer cell antigen can be obtained, e.g., from the GenBank database or a database like it, the literature publications, or by routine cloning and sequencing.","Examples of antibodies available for the treatment of cancer include, but are not limited to, humanized anti HER2 monoclonal antibody, HERCEPTIN\u00ae (trastuzumab; Genentech); RITUXAN\u00ae (rituximab; Genentech) which is a chimeric anti CD20 monoclonal antibody for the treatment of patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; OvaRex (AltaRex Corporation, MA) which is a murine antibody for the treatment of ovarian cancer; Panorex (Glaxo Wellcome, NC) which is a murine IgG2a antibody for the treatment of colorectal cancer; Cetuximab Erbitux (Imclone Systems Inc., NY) which is an anti-EGFR IgG chimeric antibody for the treatment of epidermal growth factor positive cancers, such as head and neck cancer; Vitaxin (MedImmune, Inc., MD) which is a humanized antibody for the treatment of sarcoma; Campath I\/H (Leukosite, Mass.) which is a humanized IgG1 antibody for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL); Smart MI95 (Protein Design Labs, Inc., CA) which is a humanized anti-CD33 IgG antibody for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML); LymphoCide (Immunomedics, Inc., NJ) which is a humanized anti-CD22 IgG antibody for the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; Smart ID10 (Protein Design Labs, Inc., CA) which is a humanized anti-HLA-DR antibody for the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; Oncolym (Techniclone, Inc., CA) which is a radiolabeled murine anti-HLA-Dr10 antibody for the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; Allomune (BioTransplant, CA) which is a humanized anti-CD2 mAb for the treatment of Hodgkin's Disease or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; Avastin (Genentech, Inc., CA) which is an anti-VEGF humanized antibody for the treatment of lung and colorectal cancers; Epratuzamab (Immunomedics, Inc., NJ and Amgen, Calif.) which is an anti-CD22 antibody for the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; and CEAcide (Immunomedics, NJ) which is a humanized anti-CEA antibody for the treatment of colorectal cancer.","Other antibodies useful in the treatment of cancer include, but are not limited to, antibodies against the following antigens (exemplary cancers are indicated in parentheses): CA125 (ovarian), CA15-3 (carcinomas), CA19-9 (carcinomas), L6 (carcinomas), Lewis Y (carcinomas), Lewis X (carcinomas), alpha fetoprotein (carcinomas), CA 242 (colorectal), placental alkaline phosphatase (carcinomas), prostate specific membrane antigen (prostate), prostatic acid phosphatase (prostate), epidermal growth factor (carcinomas), MAGE-1 (carcinomas), MAGE-2 (carcinomas), MAGE-3 (carcinomas), MAGE-4 (carcinomas), anti transferrin receptor (carcinomas), p97 (melanoma), MUC1-KLH (breast cancer), CEA (colorectal), gp100 (melanoma), MARTI (melanoma), prostate specific antigen (PSA) (prostate), IL-2 receptor (T-cell leukemia and lymphomas), CD20 (non Hodgkin's lymphoma), CD52 (leukemia), CD33 (leukemia), CD22 (lymphoma), human chorionic gonadotropin (carcinoma), CD38 (multiple myeloma), CD40 (lymphoma), mucin (carcinomas), P21 (carcinomas), MPG (melanoma), and Neu oncogene product (carcinomas). Some specific, useful antibodies include, but are not limited to, BR96 mAb (Trail et al., 1993, Science 261:212-215), BR64 (Trail et al., 1997, Cancer Research 57:100-105), mAbs against the CD40 antigen, such as S2C6 mAb (Francisco et al., 2000, Cancer Res. 60:3225-3231) and chimeric and humanized variants thereof, mabs against the cD33 antigen; mabs against the EphA2 antigen; mAbs against the CD70 antigen, such as 1F6 mAb and 2F2 mAb and chimeric and humanized variants thereof, and mAbs against the CD30 antigen, such as AC10 (Bowen et al., 1993, J. Immunol. 151:5896-5906; Wahl et al., 2002, Cancer Res. 62(13):3736-42) and chimeric and humanized variants thereof. Many other internalizing antibodies that bind to tumor associated antigens can be used and have been reviewed (see, e.g., Franke et al., 2000, Cancer Biother. Radiopharm. 15:459 76; Murray, 2000, Semin. Oncol. 27:64 70; Breitling et al., Recombinant Antibodies, John Wiley, and Sons, New York, 1998).","The antibody also can be an antibody that binds to an antigen that is present on a target cell or target cell population. For example, transmembrane polypeptides and other markers can be specifically expressed on the surface of one or more particular type(s) of target cells (e.g., a cancer cell) as compared to on one or more normal (e.g., a non-cancerous cell(s)). Often, such markers are more abundantly expressed on the surface of the target cells, or exhibit greater immunogenicity, as compared to those on the surface of the normal cells. The identification of such cell surface antigen polypeptides has given rise to the ability to specifically target cells for destruction via antibody-based therapies. Thus, in some embodiments, the antibodies include, but are not limited to, antibodies against tumor-associated antigens (TAA). Such tumor-associated antigens are known in the art, and can prepared for use in generating antibodies using methods and information which are well known in the art.","See also EP2552957, WO\/2012\/116453, WO\/2012\/032080.

Conjugates\u2014Exemplary Linkers","As recognized by the artisan of reasonable skill, the particular linker used for conjugate formation will depend upon the reactive group of the reactant compound being used for bond formation. As an example, and within the scope of the present invention, compounds having thiol moiety may be used for conjugate formation. In some of the present examples, the commercially available cleavable linker sulfosuccinimidyl 6-[3\u2032(2-pyridyldithio)-propionamido]hexanoate (sulfo-LC-SPDP: Thermo Pierce Cat#21650) and Non-cleavable linker succinimidyl 4-[N-maleimidomethyl]cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (SMCC: Thermo Pierce Cat#22360) were utilized for antibody-drug conjugation reactions. The coupling procedure is performed in two major steps: 1) incorporation of the linkers onto the antibody via reaction with antibody primary amine groups (Lysine residues) and the N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) ester moiety of the linkers, and 2) reaction of the incorporated maleimide group (SMCC) or 2-pyridyldithio group (LC-SPDP) with thiol-containing compounds.","Activation of Antibody with Cleavable (LC-SPDP) or Non-Cleavable (SMCC) Linkers","Antibody (Herceptin) was diluted into either Potassium Phosphate pH 8 (sulfo-LC-SPDP) or D-PBS (Invitrogen) pH 7.4 (SMCC) to 5 mg\/mL. To the diluted antibody, freshly dissolved linker was added\u2014using ultra-pure water for sulfo-LC-SPDP or anhydrous N,N-Dimethylacetamide (DMA) for SMCC. 10-14 fold molar-excesses of SMCC:antibody or sulfo-LC-SPDP:antibody result in incorporation of 5-7 linkers\/antibody. The linker-antibody \u201cactivation\u201d reaction was incubated at 28\u00b0 C. for 2 hours. Following the incubation, the un-reacted linker was removed from each antibody sample using 40 kda Zeba Size-exclusion chromatography\/desalting columns (Thermo Pierce Cat#87771, or 87772 depending on the scale). During the same chromatography step the buffer was exchanged in preparation for the next reaction; either Phosphate Buffer\/EDTA pH 6.5 (LC-SPDP), or Citrate buffer\/EDTA pH 5 (SMCC). The purified preparations were then assayed for total protein content versus an antibody standard curve using the microplate adapted BCA assay (Thermo Pierce Cat#23225). To estimate the extent of linker incorporation a small scale reaction with excess (\u02dc10-fold compared to protein concentration) Cysteine was performed. Following a 10 minute incubation the un-reacted Cysteine was detected using 5,5-Dithio-bis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (Ellman's reagent, Thermo Pierce Cat#22582). By interpolating the concentration from a Cysteine standard curve the linker concentration was determined by subtracting the determined value from the known concentration of Cysteine used.","Reaction of Thiol-Containing Compounds to Linker-Activated Antibody","In the second step of the coupling reaction, the activated-antibody was utilized by first diluting the preparation to 2 mg\/mL using either Phosphate Buffer\/EDTA pH 6.5 (LC-SPDP), or Citrate buffer\/EDTA pH 5 (SMCC). Prior to use, the thiol containing n-acyl sulfonamide compounds or maytansinoid DM1 were reduced using TCEP-agarose beads to ensure the thiol group was available to react to the incorporated linkers. In brief, compounds were diluted to 5 mM using Phosphate Buffer\/EDTA pH 6.5. In instances where aqueous solubility was an issue, a small volume of 37% HCl (1:300) was added and this was sufficient to solubilize the compounds at 5 mM. TCEP-agarose beads (Thermo Pierce Cat 77712), were equilibrated with Phosphate Buffer\/EDTA\/10% DMA prior to use. The compound dilutions were rotated with TCEP-agarose beads for at least 0.5 hours, or up to 3 hours. The reduced compounds were collected by centrifugation over a filter which excluded the TCEP-agarose. The extent of reduction and thiol concentration was measured using Ellman's reagent (compared to a Cysteine standard curve). The reduced thiol-containing compounds were then added to the activated antibody samples at a molar excess of \u02dc2-fold compared to the previously determined linker concentrations. In order to monitor the coupling reaction effectiveness an \u201covernight\u201d conjugation control was prepared by diluting each compound into Phosphate Buffer\/EDTA pH 6.5 or Citrate buffer\/EDTA pH 5 at the same dilution factor that was used in the conjugation reaction. The remaining compound stocks were frozen at \u221280\u00b0 C. The reactions and overnight controls were incubated at ambient temperature overnight. The next morning the frozen compound stocks were thawed and another control was prepared for each compound exactly like the \u201covernight\u201d control\u2014this is the \u201cfresh\u201d control. A small volume of each conjugation reaction was compared to the overnight and fresh compound controls using Ellman's reagent. Non-reacted compound was purified away from the ADCs using 40 kda Zeba Size-exclusion\/desalting columns; during the same step the buffer was exchanged to D-PBS pH7.4 (Invitrogen).","The purified ADCs were then analysed for: total protein content (BCA assay, Pierce microBCA protocol), relative affinity for antigen binding (equilibrium native binding), and selective cytotoxic killing of HER2-positive cells (HCC1954) compared HER2-negative cells (Jurkat).","Cytotoxicity Assay","Tables 9 and 10 summarize the cytotoxic activity of ADCs comprising compounds A, B, or C when tested using the Human mammary carcinoma cell line HCC1954 or Human T-cell leukemia cell line Jurkat.  show cytotoxicity data plots for individual compositions as indicated.","On the day prior to adding test articles, HCC1954 cells were added to opaque-walled 96-well tissue culture-treated microtiter plates using complete growth medium at a density of 2500 cells\/100 microliter (uL) of medium. The HCC1954 cells were incubated for one night at 37\u00b0 C.\/5% COto allow the cells to attach to the microtiter plate surface. On the day that test articles were added, Jurkat cells are added to separate 96-well microtiter plates at 2500 cells\/100 uL using the same growth medium as HCC1954. To compare the ADC killing to that obtained from the free-compounds, the n-acyl sulfonamide compounds were first serially diluted using dimethyl sulfoxide or DMA, and then the prepared dilutions are added to complete growth medium at five-times the final concentration\u2014compounds were then titrated 1:3, eight steps. To test the ADCs, they were diluted directly in growth medium at five-times the final concentration\u2014ADCs were then titrated 1:3, eight steps. A control with no test article present (growth medium alone) was included on each microtiter plate in sextuplicate. The prepared compound\/ADC titrations were added (twenty-five uL\/well) in triplicate to both the HCC1954 cells and Jurkat cells. The cells and titrations were incubated at 37\u00b0 C.\/5% COfor three nights. After the incubation, cell viability was measured using CellTiter-Glo\u00ae reagent by adding thirty uL of prepared CellTiter-Glo\u00ae to each assay well. The assay was incubated for at least twenty minutes in the dark prior to measuring emitted luminescence using a microplate luminometer (500 ms integration time). The collected relative luminescence units (RLU) were converted to % cytotoxicity using the Growth medium alone control mentioned above (% Cytotoxicity=1\u2212[Well RLU\/average medium alone control RLU]).","The data indicate that the subject compounds are active cytotoxins on both cell lines used. The LC-SPDP-linked compound conjugates demonstrated potent killing of HER2-positive HCC1954 cells. Jurkat cell killing was observed at high-doses of ADC due to the presence of \u03b2-mercaptoethanol in cell culture medium, which resulted in the release of free compound (data not shown).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0838","num":"0839"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00009","num":"00009"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"315pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE

The resulting deglycosylated ADC was again buffer exchanged with water using a 100K MWCO Amicon concentrator, and diluted with 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile\/water (50\/50 v\/v %) to a concentration of 3.0 \u03bcg\/\u03bcL prior to analysis.","Analyses indicated that antibody was loaded with a DAR range of between 4-7 (data not shown).","Preparation of Antibody-Drug Conjugates from MCvcPABC-Toxins, General Methods:","To a solution of antibody (1-10 mg\/mL) in 25 mM sodium borate, 25 mM sodium chloride, 1 mM DTPA (pH 8.0) was added TCEP from a freshly prepared stock (1-10 mM) in the same buffer (2.0-3.0 molar equivalents). The solution was mixed thoroughly and incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for two hours before cooling on ice. In some instances the reduced antibody solution was further diluted with either ice-cold phosphate buffered saline containing 1 mM DTPA (final protein concentration 2.0 mg\/mL) or ice-cold 25 mM sodium borate, 25 mM sodium chloride, 1 mM DTPA (pH 8.0), to obtain a solution with a final protein concentration of between 1 and 4 mg\/mL. To the reduced protein solution stored on ice was added the maleimide functionalized toxin (10-12 molar equivalents) from a 10 mM dmso stock solution. The conjugation reaction was immediately mixed thoroughly by inversion and conjugation was allowed to proceed on ice for a period of approximately 1 hour before purification by passage over Zeba Spin Desalting Columns (40 KDa MWCO; Peirce) pre-equilibrated with phosphate buffered saline or 10 mM sodium citrate, 150 mM sodium chloride, pH 5.5. The eluate was pooled, filter sterilized (Steriflip, Millipore), and stored at 4\u00b0 C.","The purified ADCs were analyzed for total protein content (bicinchonic acid assay, Pierce microBCA protocol, catalogue #23225). The ADC product was characterized by reducing and non-reducing PAGE, HPLC-HIC, SEC, and RP-UPLC-MS. The average DAR and drug distribution were derived from interpretation of HIC and LC-MS data with reference to non-reducing PAGE. Average DAR estimates were normally in the range of 3.5-4.5. Relative affinity of ADCs for antigen binding (equilibrium native binding) was performed as described (above\/below). The selective cytotoxicity of the antibody drug conjugates was assessed by testing for killing of both antigen positive and antigen negative cell lines.","Assay of Selective In Vitro Cytotoxicity of Antigen-Positive Cells by Antibody Drug Conjugates:","Selective killing of an antigen positive cell line (including HCC1954, NCI-N87, HPAF-II and BxPC-3 cell lines) over antigen-negative Jurkat cells was demonstrated for each conjugate prepared. Cytotoxicity of example ADCs on several antigen positive cell lines is summarized in the identified Figures and Tables 9-13. In addition, the conjugates indicated by (*) in Table 11 were tested and showed potent cell kill activity against a human breast cancer cell line (data not shown). Briefly, cells were obtained from the ATCC and cultured as described in the product sheet provided. Cells were seeded at 25000 cells\/mL (2500 cells\/well) in Costar 3904 black walled, flat bottomed 96-well plates. Adherent cell lines cells were incubated for one night at 37\u00b0 C. in a 5% COatmosphere to allow the cells to attach to the microtitre plate surface, while suspension (Jurkat) cells were plated immediately before use. ADCs were diluted directly in the appropriate cell growth medium at five-times the desired final concentration. These ADCs were then titrated, normally 1:3, over eight steps. A control with no test article present (growth medium alone) was included on each microtiter plate in sextuplicate. The prepared ADC titrations were added (25 uL\/well) in triplicate to each cell line assayed. The cells and titrations were incubated at 37\u00b0 C.\/5% COfor three nights (Jurkat) and five nights (all other cell lines). After the incubation, cell viability was measured using CellTiter-Glo\u00ae reagent by adding thirty uL of prepared CellTiter-Glo\u00ae to each assay well. The mixtures were incubated for at least twenty minutes in the dark prior to measuring emitted luminescence using a microplate luminometer (500 ms integration time). The collected relative luminescence units (RLU) were converted to % cytotoxicity using the growth medium alone control mentioned above (% Cytotoxicity=1\u2212[Well RLU\/average medium alone control RLU]). Data (% Cytotoxicity vs. Concentration of ADC (log 10(nM)) were plotted and were analyzed by non-linear regression methods using GraphPad Prism software v. 5.02 to obtain ECestimates.","Estimation of Drug to Antibody Ratio (Dar):","The average degree of conjugation of toxin-linker to antibody was assessed by hydrophobic interaction chromatography and high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. These techniques are described in Antibody Drug Conjugates, Methods in Molecular Biology vol. 1045, 2013. pp 275-284. L. Ducry, Ed., and Asish B. Chakraborty, Scott J. Berger and John C. Gebler, Characterization of an IgG1 Monoclonal Antibody and related Sub-structures by LC\/ESI-TOF\/MS: Application note, Waters Corporation. March 2007. 720002107EN.","Method 1. Hydrophobic Interaction Chromatography","Antibody drug conjugates were subjected to hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) on a TSKgeI Butyl-NPR column (Tosoh Bioscience; 4.6 mm\u00d735 mm i.d.; 2.5 \u03bcm particle size) connected to an Agilent 1100 series HPLC. Samples were injected (5 uL) at or above 4 mg\/mL. Where necessary, ADCs were concentrated prior to injection using PALL Nanosep Omega centrifugal concentration devices (part # OD010C34). A linear gradient elution was employed starting at 95% mobile phase A\/5% mobile phase B, transitioning to 5% mobile phase A\/95% mobile phase B over a period of 12 minutes (mobile phase A: 1.5M ammonium sulfate+25 mM sodium phosphate at pH 6.95 and mobile phase B: 25% isopropanol, 75% 25 mM sodium phosphate at pH 6.95). Injection of unmodified antibody provided a means of identifying the peak with DAR=0. Antibodies were detected on the basis of absorbance at 280 nm.","Method 2. Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry for DAR Estimation","Reversed phase ultra performance liquid-chromatography tandem ESI-QToF-mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-QToF-MS) was used to characterize antibody drug conjugates for extent of drug conjugation following reduction with dithiothreitol. The characterization was performed using Acquity-UPLC (H-class) Bio coupled to a Quatro-Premier QToF mass spectrometer with an electrospray ion source (WATERS Corporation). UPLC analysis of the reduced ADC sample was performed at 70\u00b0 C. with a PolymerX 5u PR-1 100 A, 50\u00d72.0 mm column (Phenomenex, Inc.) and with a mobile phase composed of Solvent A: Acetonitrile\/Water\/Trifluoroacetic acid\/Formic acid (10\/90\/0.1\/0.1, v\/v %), and Solvent B: Acetonitrile\/Formic acid (100\/0.1, % v\/v). Components of the reduced ADC sample were eluted with a linear gradient starting at Solvent A\/Solvent B (80\/20 v\/v and a flow rate of 0.3 ml\/min to Solvent A\/Solvent B (40\/60, v\/v %) over 25 min, and then to Solvent A\/Solvent B (10\/90, v\/v %) over 2 minutes before equilibrating back to initial conditions. The total run time was 30 minutes. The ESI-Tof MS total ion current (TIC) data was acquired over 500-4500 m\/z range using MassLynx data acquisition software (Waters Corporation). Sample component mass data was acquired in the positive ion V-mode, and the ESI source was operated at source temperature: 150\u00b0 C., desolvation temperature: 350\u00b0 C., desolvation gas: 800 L\/hr, sample cone voltage: 60 V, capillary voltage: 3.0 kV, desolvation gas: nitrogen, and collision gas: argon. The summed TIC mass spectra for each peak was deconvoluted by the MaxEnt1 algorithm to generate the neutral mass data of the peak component.","Preparation of Reduced ADC Samples for UPLC\/ESI-ToF MS Analysis","Reduction of the disulfide bonds in the antibody of the ADC (\u02dc1 \u03bcg\/\u03bcL solution) to generate the light and heavy chains was performed using 20 mM DTT at 60\u00b0 C. for 20 minutes. An injection volume of 5-10 \u03bcL of the reduced ADC sample was employed for UPLC\/ESI-ToF-MS analysis.","Exemplary ADC (PABC) for Illustration

Animals received sterile food and water ad libitum and housing and use of animals was performed in accordance with Canadian Council on Animal Care guidelines. Animals were handled aseptically, and cages changed once every 10-14 days.","Data Collection (Tumour Size)","Mice were monitored every Monday, Wednesday and Friday for tumour development. Dimensions of established tumours was measured with calipers. Tumour volumes were calculated according to the equation L\u00d7W\/2 with the length (mm) being the longer axis of the tumour. Animals were also weighed at the time of tumour measurement. Tumours were allowed to grow to a maximum of 800 mm.","Institutional Animal Care Committee","The methodology used was reviewed and approved by the University of British Columbia Animal Care Committee (ACC) prior to conducting the studies to ensure studies were planned in accordance with the Canadian Council on Animal Care guidelines. During the study the care, housing and use of animals was performed in accordance with the Canadian Council on Animal Care guidelines.","Analysis Methods","Tumour Volume X Experimental Day Growth Curves","Tumour volumes of each group across the treatment days were plotted. Growth curves were cutoff for each group at the time point when the first animal reached the tumour-size experimental endpoint (800 mm3), or at the last day of the study. Any animal that was withdrawn from the study prior to the group growth curve cutoff was removed entirely from the study.","Animal Exclusions","Any animal with ulcerating tumours, necessitating euthanasia of the animal, with tumour volume of 700 mmor smaller were removed from the study and did not contribute to the data analysis (except for Days to Recurrence if the final tumour volume was >2.0 fold higher than on the treatment day).","All of the U.S. patents, U.S. patent application publications, U.S. patent applications, foreign patents, foreign patent applications and non-patent publications referred to in this specification are incorporated herein by reference, in their entirety to the extent not inconsistent with the present description.","From the foregoing it will be appreciated that, although specific embodiments of the disclosure have been described herein for purposes of illustration, various modifications may be made without deviating from the spirit and scope of the disclosure.
