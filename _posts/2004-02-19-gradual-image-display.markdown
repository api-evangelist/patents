{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/632,805, filed Aug. 4, 2000 now U.S. Pat. No. 6,781,608, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60\/215,765 filed Jun. 30, 2000.","The present invention relates generally to transferring files between subscribers of a communications system.","Online service providers are constantly offering new services and upgrading existing services to enhance their subscribers' online experience. Subscribers have virtually on-demand access to news, weather, financial, sports, and entertainment services as well as the ability to transmit electronic messages and to participate in online discussion groups. For example, subscribers of online service providers such as America Online or CompuServe may view and retrieve information on a wide variety of topics from servers located throughout the world. A server may be maintained by the service provider or by a third party provider who makes information and services available through the worldwide network of computers that make up the online service.","America Online has provided subscribers with the ability to send and receive instant messages. Instant messages are private online conversations between two or more people who have subscribed to the instant messaging service and have installed the necessary software. Because such online conversations take place virtually in real time, instant messaging can provide immediate access to desired information. Instant messaging is becoming a preferred means of communicating among online subscribers.","In one general aspect, an image sent between subscribers of a communications system is displayed by receiving electronic data corresponding to the image; displaying a blurred view of the image; and gradually displaying a sharper version of the image in response to user input.","Implementations may include displaying a blurred view of the image by partially rendering the image data; setting preferences for receiving images; and allowing the user to reject the image. A graphic user interface may be presented to the user for setting preferences and\/or rejecting the images.","The communications system may be an instant messaging system. The image data may be received as an instant message and\/or compressed to standardized image size. An instant message may be displayed concurrently with the blurred view and\/or the sharpened view of the image in a separate dialog box. The image may be an icon and may be associated with a sender of an instant message and\/or an e-mail message.","Embodiments may be implemented by an apparatus and\/or by a computer program stored on a computer readable medium. The computer readable medium may be a disc, a client device, a host device, and\/or a propagated signal.","Other features and advantages will be apparent from the following description, including the drawings, and from the claims.","For illustrative purposes,  describe a communications system for implementing techniques for displaying an image sent between subscribers of a communications system. For brevity, several elements in the figures described below are represented as monolithic entities. However, as would be understood by one skilled in the art, these elements each may include numerous interconnected computers and components designed to perform a set of specified operations and\/or dedicated to a particular geographical region.","Referring to , a communications system  is capable of delivering and exchanging data between a client system  and a host system  through a communications link .

An example of client controller  is a software application loaded on the client device  for commanding and directing communications enabled by the client device . Other examples include a program, a piece of code, an instruction, a device, a computer, a computer system, or a combination thereof, for independently or collectively instructing the client device  to interact and operate as described herein. The client controller  may be embodied permanently or temporarily in any type of machine, component, equipment, storage medium, or propagated signal capable of providing instructions to the client device .","The communications link  typically includes a delivery network  making a direct or indirect communication between the client system  and the host system , irrespective of physical separation. Examples of a delivery network  include the Internet, the World Wide Web, WANs, LANs, analog or digital wired and wireless telephone networks (e.g. PSTN, ISDN, or xDSL), radio, television, cable, satellite, and\/or any other delivery mechanism for carrying data. The communications link  may include communication pathways ,  that enable communications through the one or more delivery networks  described above. Each of the communication pathways ,  may include, for example, a wired, wireless, cable or satellite communication pathway.","The host system  includes a host device  capable of executing instructions under the command and direction of a host controller . The host device  is connected to the host controller  by a wired or wireless data pathway  capable of carrying and delivering data.","The host system  typically includes one or more host devices  and\/or host controllers .

In particular, the host system  and communications link  typically have attributes comparable to those described with respect to host system  and communications link  of . Likewise, the client system  of  typically has attributes comparable to and illustrates one possible embodiment of the client system  of .","The client device  typically includes a general purpose computer  having an internal or external storage  for storing data and programs such as an operating system  (e.g., DOS, Windows\u2122, Windows 95\u2122, Windows 98\u2122, Windows 2000\u2122, Windows NT\u2122, OS\/2, or Linux) and one or more application programs. Examples of application programs include authoring applications  (e.g., word processing, database programs, spreadsheet programs, or graphics programs) capable of generating documents or other electronic content; client applications  (e.g., AOL client, CompuServe client, AIM client, AOL TV client, or ISP client) capable of communicating with other computer users, accessing various computer resources, and viewing, creating, or otherwise manipulating electronic content; and browser applications  (e.g., Netscape's Navigator or Microsoft's Internet Explorer) capable of rendering standard Internet content.","The general-purpose computer  also includes a central processing unit  (CPU) for executing instructions in response to commands from the client controller . In one implementation, the client controller  includes one or more of the application programs installed on the internal or external storage  of the general-purpose computer . In another implementation, the client controller  includes application programs externally stored in and performed by one or more device(s) external to the general-purpose computer .","The general-purpose computer typically will include a communication device  for sending and receiving data. One example of the communication device  is a modem. Other examples include a transceiver, a set-top box, a communication card, a satellite dish, an antenna, or another network adapter capable of transmitting and receiving data over the communications link  through a wired or wireless data pathway . The general-purpose computer  also may include a TV (\u201ctelevision\u201d) tuner  for receiving television programming in the form of broadcast, satellite, and\/or cable TV signals. As a result, the client device  can selectively and\/or simultaneously display network content received by communications device  and television programming content received by the TV tuner .","The general-purpose computer  typically will include an input\/output interface  for wired or wireless connection to various peripheral devices . Examples of peripheral devices  include, but are not limited to, a mouse , a mobile phone , a personal digital assistant  (PDA), a keyboard , a display monitor  with or without a touch screen input, and\/or a TV remote control  for receiving information from and rendering information to subscribers.","Although  illustrates devices such as a mobile telephone , a PDA , and a TV remote control  as being peripheral with respect to the general-purpose computer , in another implementation, such devices may themselves include the functionality of the general-purpose computer  and operate as the client device . For example, the mobile phone  or the PDA  may include computing and networking capabilities and function as a client device  by accessing the delivery network  and communicating with the host system . Furthermore, the client system  may include one, some or all of the components and devices described above.","Referring to , a communications system  is capable of delivering and exchanging information between a client system  and a host system  through a communication link . Client system  typically includes one or more client devices  and one or more client controllers  for controlling the client devices .

Likewise, the host system  of  may have attributes comparable to and illustrates one possible embodiment of the host systems  and  shown in , respectively.","The host system  includes a host device  and a host controller . The host controller  is generally capable of transmitting instructions to any or all of the elements of the host device . For example, in one implementation, the host controller  includes one or more software applications loaded on the host device . However, in other implementations, as described above, the host controller  may include any of several other programs, machines, and devices operating independently or collectively to control the host device .","The host device  includes a login server  for enabling access by subscribers and routing communications between the client system  and other elements of the host device . The host device  also includes various host complexes such as the depicted OSP (\u201cOnline Service Provider\u201d) host complex  and IM (\u201cInstant Messaging\u201d) host complex . To enable access to these host complexes by subscribers, the client system  includes communication software, for example, an OSP client application and an IM client application. The OSP and IM communication software applications are designed to facilitate the subscriber's interactions with the respective services and, in particular, may provide access to all the services available within the respective host complexes.","Typically, the OSP host complex  supports different services, such as email, discussion groups, chat, news services, and Internet access. The OSP host complex  is generally designed with an architecture that enables the machines within the OSP host complex  to communicate with each other and employs certain protocols (i.e., standards, formats, conventions, rules, and structures) to transfer data. The OSP host complex  ordinarily employs one or more OSP protocols and custom dialing engines to enable access by selected client applications. The OSP host complex  may define one or more specific protocols for each service based on a common, underlying proprietary protocol.","The IM host complex  is generally independent of the OSP host complex , and supports instant messaging services irrespective of a subscriber's network or Internet access. Thus, the IM host complex  allows subscribers to send and receive instant messages, whether or not they have access to any particular ISP. The IM host complex  may support associated services, such as administrative matters, advertising, directory services, chat, and interest groups related to the instant messaging. The IM host complex  has an architecture that enables all of the machines within the IM host complex to communicate with each other. To transfer data, the IM host complex  employs one or more standard or exclusive IM protocols.","The host device  may include one or more gateways that connect and therefore link complexes, such as the OSP host complex gateway  and the IM host complex gateway . The OSP host complex gateway  and the IM host complex  gateway may directly or indirectly link the OSP host complex  with the IM host complex  through a wired or wireless pathway. Ordinarily, when used to facilitate a link between complexes, the OSP host complex gateway  and the IM host complex gateway  are privy to information regarding the protocol type anticipated by a destination complex, which enables any necessary protocol conversion to be performed incident to the transfer of data from one complex to another. For instance, the OSP host complex  and IM host complex  generally use different protocols such that transferring data between the complexes requires protocol conversion by or at the request of the OSP host complex gateway  and\/or the IM host complex gateway .","Referring to , a communications system  is capable of delivering and exchanging information between a client system  and a host system  through a communication link . Client system  typically includes one or more client devices  and one or more client controllers  for controlling the client devices . Host system  typically includes one or more host devices  and one or more host controllers  for controlling the host devices . The communications link  may include communication pathways ,  enabling communications through the one or more delivery networks . As shown, the client system  may access the Internet  through the host system .","Examples of each element within the communication system of  are broadly described above with respect to . In particular, the client system  and the communications link  typically have attributes comparable to those described with respect to client systems , , and  and communications links , , and  of . Likewise, the host system  of  may have attributes comparable to and illustrates one possible embodiment of the host systems , , and  shown in , respectively. However,  describes an aspect of the host system , focusing primarily on one particular implementation of OSP host complex . For purposes of communicating with an OSP host complex , the delivery network  is generally a telephone network.","The client system  includes a client device  and a client controller . The client controller  is generally capable of establishing a connection to the host system , including the OSP host complex , the IM host complex  and\/or the Internet . In one implementation, the client controller  includes an OSP application for communicating with servers in the OSP host complex  using exclusive OSP protocols. The client controller  also may include applications, such as an IM client application, and\/or an Internet browser application, for communicating with the IM host complex  and the Internet .","The host system  includes a host device  and a host controller . The host controller  is generally capable of transmitting instructions to any or all of the elements of the host device . For example, in one implementation, the host controller  includes one or more software applications loaded on one or more elements of the host device . However, in other implementations, as described above, the host controller  may include any of several other programs, machines, and devices operating independently or collectively to control the host device .","The host system  includes a login server  capable of enabling communications with and authorizing access by client systems  to various elements of the host system , including an OSP host complex  and an IM host complex . The login server  may implement one or more authorization procedures to enable simultaneous access to the OSP host complex  and the IM host complex . The OSP host complex  and the IM host complex  are connected through one or more OSP host complex gateways  and one or more IM host complex gateways . Each OSP host complex gateway  and IM host complex gateway  may perform any protocol conversions necessary to enable communication between the OSP host complex , the IM host complex , and the Internet .","The OSP host complex  supports a set of services from one or more servers located internal to and external from the OSP host complex . Servers external to the OSP host complex  generally communicate through the Internet . Servers internal to the OSP complex  may be arranged in one or more configurations. For example, servers may be arranged in large centralized clusters known as farms  or in localized clusters known as pods .","Farms  are groups of servers located at centralized locations within the OSP host complex . Farms  generally are dedicated to providing particular functionality and services to subscribers and clients from a centralized location, regardless of the location of the subscriber or client. Farms  are particularly useful for providing services that depend upon other processes and services for information, such as, for example, chat, email, instant messaging, news, newsgroups, search, stock updates, and weather. Thus, farms  tend to rely on connections with external resources such as the Internet  and\/or other servers within the OSP host complex .","To reduce the time delays and congestion inherent in centralized processing, some services offered by the OSP host complex  are provided from localized servers, generally known as pods . Each pod  includes one or more interrelated servers capable of operating together to provide one or more services offered by the OSP host complex  in a geographically localized manner, the servers within a pod  generally operating independently rather than relying on resources external to the pod  to operate. A pod  may cache content received from external sources, such as farms  or the Internet , making frequently requested information readily available to local subscribers served by the pod . In this way, pods  are particularly useful in providing services that are independent of other processes and servers such as, for example, routing, keywords, and downloading certain software and graphical interface updates with reduced processing time and congestion. The determination of which servers and processes are located in the pod  is made by the OSP according to load distribution, frequency of requests, demographics, and other factors.","In addition to farms  and pods , the implementation of  also includes one or more non-podded servers . In general, the non-podded server  may be dedicated to performing a particular service that relies on other processes and services for information and may be directly or indirectly connected to resources outside of the OSP host complex , such as the Internet  and the IM host complex , through an OSP gateway . In the event that subscriber usage of the particular service is relatively high, the non-podded server  may be included in a farm.","In the implementation of , a pod , shown in more detail, includes a routing processor . In a packet-based implementation, the client system  may generate information requests, convert the requests into data packets, sequence the data packets, perform error checking and other packet-switching techniques, and transmit the data packets to the routing processor . Upon receiving data packets from the client system , the routing processor  may directly or indirectly route the data packets to a specified destination within or outside of the OSP host complex . In general, the routing processor  will examine an address field of a data request, use a mapping table to determine the appropriate destination for the data request, and direct the data request to the appropriate destination.","For example, in the event that a data request from the client system  can be satisfied locally, the routing processor  may direct the data request to a local server  in the pod . In the event that the data request cannot be satisfied locally, the routing processor  may direct the data request internally to one or more farms , one or more other pods , or one or more non-podded servers  in the OSP host complex  or may direct the data request externally to the Internet  or the IM host complex  through an OSP\/pod gateway .","The routing processor  also may direct data requests and\/or otherwise facilitate communication between the client system  and the Internet . In one implementation, the client system  uses an OSP client application to convert standard Internet content and protocols into OSP protocols and vice versa. For example, when a browser application transmits a request in standard Internet protocol, the OSP client application can intercept the request, convert the request into an OSP protocol and send the converted request to the routing processor  in the OSP host complex . The routing processor  recognizes the Internet  as the destination and routes the data packets to an IP (\u201cInternet Protocol\u201d) tunnel . The IP tunnel  converts the data from the OSP protocol back into standard Internet protocol and transmits the data to the Internet . The IP tunnel  also converts the data received from the Internet in the standard Internet protocol back into the OSP protocol and sends the data to the routing processor  for delivery back to the client system . At the client system , the OSP client application converts the data in the OSP protocol back into standard Internet content for communication with the browser application.","The IP tunnel  may act as a buffer between the client system  and the Internet , and may implement content filtering and time saving techniques. For example, the IP tunnel  can check parental controls settings of the client system  and request and transmit content from the Internet  according to the parental control settings. In addition, the IP tunnel  may include a number a caches for storing frequently accessed information. If requested data is determined to be stored in the caches, the IP tunnel  may send the information to the client system  from the caches and avoid the need to access the Internet .","In another implementation, the client system  may use standard Internet protocols and formatting to access the pod  and the Internet . For example, the subscriber can use an OSP TV client application having an embedded browser application installed on the client system  to generate a request in standard Internet protocol, such as HTTP (\u201cHyperText Transport Protocol\u201d). In a packet-based implementation, data packets may be encapsulated inside a standard Internet tunneling protocol, such as, for example, UDP (\u201cUser Datagram Protocol\u201d) and routed to a web tunnel . The web tunnel  may be a L2TP (\u201cLayer Two Tunneling Protocol\u201d) tunnel capable of establishing a point-to-point protocol (PPP) session with the client system . The web tunnel  provides a gateway to the routing processor  within the pod , the Internet , and a web proxy .","The web proxy  can look up subscriber information from the IP address of the client system  to determine the subscriber's parental controls settings and other demographic information. In this way, the web proxy  can tailor the subscriber's content and user interfaces. The web proxy  can also perform caching functions to store certain URLs (\u201cUniform Resource Locators\u201d) and other electronic content so that the web proxy  can locally deliver information to the client system  and avoid the need to access the Internet  in the event that data requested by the client system  has been cached.","Referring to , a communications system  is capable of delivering and exchanging information between a client system  and a host system  through a communication link . Client system  typically includes one or more client devices  and one or more client controllers  for controlling the client devices . Host system  typically includes one or more host devices  and one or more host controllers  for controlling the host devices . The communications link  may include communication pathways ,  enabling communications through the one or more delivery networks .

However,  describes an aspect of the host system , focusing primarily on one particular implementation of IM host complex . For purposes of communicating with the IM host complex , the delivery network  is generally a telephone network.","The client system  includes a client device  and a client controller . The client controller  is generally capable of establishing a connection to the host system , including the OSP host complex , the IM host complex  and\/or the Internet . In one implementation, the client controller  includes an IM application for communicating with servers in the IM host complex  utilizing exclusive IM protocols. The client controller  also may include applications, such as an OSP client application, and\/or an Internet browser application for communicating with the OSP host complex  and the Internet , respectively.","The host system  includes a host device  and a host controller . The host controller  is generally capable of transmitting instructions to any or all of the elements of the host device . For example, in one implementation, the host controller  includes one or more software applications loaded on one or more elements of the host device . However, in other implementations, as described above, the host controller  may include any of several other programs, machines, and devices operating independently or collectively to control the host device .","The host system  includes a login server  capable of enabling communications with and authorizing access by client systems  to various elements of the host system , including an OSP host complex  and an IM host complex . The login server  may implement one or more authorization procedures to enable simultaneous access to the OSP host complex  and the IM host complex . The OSP host complex  and the IM host complex  are connected through one or more OSP host complex gateways  and one or more IM host complex gateways . Each OSP host complex gateway  and IM host complex gateway  may perform any protocol conversions necessary to enable communication between the OSP host complex , the IM host complex , and the Internet .","To access the IM host complex  to begin an instant messaging session, the client system  establishes a connection to the login server . The login server  typically determines whether the particular subscriber is authorized to access the IM host complex  by verifying a subscriber identification and password. If the subscriber is authorized to access the IM host complex , the login server  employs a hashing technique on the subscriber's screen name to identify a particular IM server  for use during the subscriber's session. The login server  provides the client system  with the IP address of the particular IM server , gives the client system  an encrypted key (i.e., a cookie), and breaks the connection. The client system  then uses the IP address to establish a connection to the particular IM server  through the communications link , and obtains access to that IM server  using the encrypted key. Typically, the client system  will be equipped with a Winsock API (\u201cApplication Programming Interface\u201d) that enables the client system  to establish an open TCP connection to the IM server .","Once a connection to the IM server  has been established, the client system  may directly or indirectly transmit data to and access content from the IM server  and one or more associated domain servers . The IM server  supports the fundamental instant messaging services and the domain servers  may support associated services, such as, for example, administrative matters, directory services, chat and interest groups. In general, the purpose of the domain servers  is to lighten the load placed on the IM server  by assuming responsibility for some of the services within the IM host complex . By accessing the IM server  and\/or the domain server , a subscriber can use the IM client application to view whether particular subscribers (\u201cbuddies\u201d) are online, exchange instant messages with particular subscribers, participate in group chat rooms, trade files such as pictures, invitations or documents, find other subscribers with similar interests, get customized news and stock quotes, and search the Web.","In the implementation of , the IM server  is directly or indirectly connected to a routing gateway . The routing gateway  facilitates the connection between the IM server  and one or more alert multiplexors , for example, by serving as a link minimization tool or hub to connect several IM servers to several alert multiplexors. In general, an alert multiplexor  maintains a record of alerts and subscribers registered to receive the alerts.","Once the client system  is connected to the alert multiplexor , a subscriber can register for and\/or receive one or more types of alerts. The connection pathway between the client system  and the alert multiplexor  is determined by employing another hashing technique at the IM server  to identify the particular alert multiplexor  to be used for the subscriber's session. Once the particular multiplexor  has been identified, the IM server  provides the client system  with the IP address of the particular alert multiplexor  and gives the client system  an encrypted key (i.e., a cookie). The client system  then uses the IP address to connect to the particular alert multiplexor  through the communication link  and obtains access to the alert multiplexor  using the encrypted key.","The alert multiplexor  is connected to an alert gate  that, like the IM host complex gateway , is capable of performing the necessary protocol conversions to form a bridge to the OSP host complex . The alert gate  is the interface between the IM host complex  and the physical servers, such as servers in the OSP host complex , where state changes are occurring. In general, the information regarding state changes will be gathered and used by the IM host complex . However, the alert multiplexor  also may communicate with the OSP host complex  through the IM gateway , for example, to provide the servers and subscribers of the OSP host complex  with certain information gathered from the alert gate .","The alert gate  can detect an alert feed corresponding to a particular type of alert. The alert gate  may include a piece of code (alert receive code) capable of interacting with another piece of code (alert broadcast code) on the physical server where a state change occurs. In general, the alert receive code installed on the alert gate  instructs the alert broadcast code installed on the physical server to send an alert feed to the alert gate  upon the occurrence of a particular state change. Upon detecting an alert feed, the alert gate  contacts the alert multiplexor , which in turn, informs the client system  of the detected alert feed.","In the implementation of , the IM host complex  also includes a subscriber profile server  connected to a database  for storing large amounts of subscriber profile data. The subscriber profile server  may be used to enter, retrieve, edit, manipulate, or otherwise process subscriber profile data. In one implementation, a subscriber's profile data includes, for example, the subscriber's buddy list, alert preferences, designated stocks, identified interests, and geographic location. The subscriber may enter, edit and\/or delete profile data using an installed IM client application on the client system  to interact with the subscriber profile server .","Because the subscriber's data is stored in the IM host complex , the subscriber does not have to reenter or update such information in the event that the subscriber accesses the IM host complex  using new or a different client system . Accordingly, when a subscriber accesses the IM host complex , the IM server  can instruct the subscriber profile server  to retrieve the subscriber's profile data from the database  and to provide, for example, the subscriber's buddy list to the IM server  and the subscriber's alert preferences to the alert multiplexor . The subscriber profile server  also may communicate with other servers in the OSP host complex  to share subscriber profile data with other services. Alternatively, user profile data may be saved locally on the client device .","Referring to , a communications system  is capable of delivering and exchanging information between a client system  and a host system  through a communication link .

The IM server network  is an interconnected network of IM servers and the alert multiplexor network  is an interconnected network of alert multiplexors. Each IM server and each alert multiplexor can directly or indirectly communicate and exchange information with all of the IM servers in the IM server network  and all of the alert multiplexors in the alert multiplexor network . Each of the alert multiplexors in the alert multiplexor network  is connected to several alert gates  that receive different types of alerts. In the implementation of , the IM server network  and the alert multiplexor network  are interconnected by a routing gateway  that serves as a common hub to reduce the number of connections.","A subscriber typically will be assigned to one IM server in the IM server network  and to one alert multiplexor in the alert multiplexor network  during a session based on one or more hashing techniques. However, the IM servers and the alert multiplexors are capable of storing subscriber information and other electronic content that may be accessed by the other IM servers and alert multiplexors. In one implementation, for example, each IM server in the IM server network  may be dedicated to serving a particular set of registered subscribers. Because all of the IM servers can communicate with each other, all subscribers can communicate with each other through instant messaging. In another implementation, each alert multiplexor in the alert multiplexor network  may be dedicated to storing information about a particular set or subset of alerts. Because all of the alert multiplexors can communicate with each other, all registered subscribers can receive all types of alerts. This networking arrangement enables the load to be distributed among the various servers in the IM host complex  while still enabling a subscriber to communicate, share information, or otherwise interact with other subscribers and servers in the IM host complex .","Referring to , a first client , a second client , and a host  interact according to a procedure  to enable and gradually display \u201cbuddy icons.\u201d Buddy icons are images such as cartoon characters, symbols, pictures, and other graphical images that subscribers can use to represent themselves or other buddies in their Buddy List\u00ae. In one implementation, buddy icons appear in the lower-left corner of instant messaging windows when subscribers send messages back and forth to each other.","The procedure  may be implemented by any suitable type of hardware, software, device, computer, computer system, equipment, component, program, application, code, storage medium, or propagated signal.","Examples of each element of  are broadly described above with respect to . In particular, the first client and the second client typically have attributes comparable to those described with respect to client devices , , , ,  and  and\/or client controllers , , , ,  and . The host  typically has attributes comparable to those described with respect to host device , , , ,  and  and\/or host controllers , , , ,  and . The first client , the second client , and\/or the host  may be directly or indirectly interconnected through a known or described delivery network.","Each of the clients , is associated with a subscriber. To enable buddy icons, each subscriber selects a buddy icon and then sets certain transfer preferences for permitting buddy icons to be transferred to and from other subscribers. For example, a first subscriber may set transfer preferences governing which screen names or subscribers can send buddy icons to client . Likewise, a second subscriber may set transfer preferences governing which screen names or subscribers can send buddy icons to client . Typically, each subscriber will be presented with a graphical UI (\u201cUser Interface\u201d) that permits the subscriber to select a buddy icon and set various transfer preferences. A subscriber's transfer preferences may be maintained locally or on the host .","Initially, the first subscriber selects a graphical image (step ). The graphical image may be selected from any of the images displayed by a browser when connecting to an OSP or the Internet. The first subscriber then installs the graphics file associated with the graphical image on the client (step ). In one implementation, the first subscriber saves the graphics file in a directory specifically designated for buddy icons on the client . The first subscriber designates the selected graphical image as a buddy icon for the first subscriber (step ). Typically, the first subscriber will be presented with a UI to perform this designation.","The IM client application will size the graphical image to conform to standard buddy icon size. In one implementation, graphical images are standardized to 48\u00d748 pixels. Formats for the graphics files include, but are not limited to .BMP (bit-mapped), .GIF (graphics interchange format), .JPEG (joint photographic experts group), .ICO (icon), and .XBM (X bit map) file formats. In general, there is no limit to the height and width of the graphical image designated as a buddy icon.","There may, however, be a disk space limitation for graphical images designated as buddy icons. In one implementation, the image cannot use more than 7168 bytes of disk space due to the limited capacity of the connection between the clients , and the host . The limited capacity of the connection is designed to prevent objectionable images from being sent to subscribers through the IM host since most images require more than 8 kilobytes of disk space. The rationale is that the real-time quality of instant messaging affords little opportunity to monitor or screen images sent between subscribers. Therefore, it is safer for subscribers if the host  prevents images from being sent through the IM host. As described above, images may be transferred between subscribers only when the clients are directly connected through a socket connection, for example. Typically, subscribers will allow only trusted persons to directly connect to their computers.","Even though the host  prevents images from being sent in an instant message dialogue box, there is still the danger that a subscriber will choose a buddy icon that other subscribers find objectionable. To reduce the danger of a subscriber viewing an objectionable image, the client gradually displays the buddy icon sent from another subscriber and affords the opportunity to accept or reject the buddy icon. This process will be described in more detail below.","At the second client , the second subscriber selects buddy icon preferences governing which screen names or subscribers can send buddy icons to the client (step ). The second subscriber may choose to never display buddy icons. When this option is set, the subscriber will not be able to see any buddy icons that have been chosen for other buddies. The second subscriber may select to never accept buddy icons. When this option is selected, the second subscriber is still able to see buddy icons that the second subscriber has chosen for other buddies. The second subscriber may select to accept buddy icons from users on the second subscribers Buddy List\u00ae. When this option is selected, the second subscriber will accept buddy icons from only familiar buddies that have been added to the subscribers Buddy List\u00ae. The second subscriber also may display a buddy icon knock-knock dialogue. When the option is selected, the second subscriber is alerted when a buddy desires to send a buddy icon. When this option is disabled, the second subscriber automatically receives buddy icons from users without any warning. In the procedure , it is assumed that the second subscriber has selected to display the buddy icon knock-knock dialogue.","After the first subscriber associated with the first client has designated a graphical image as a buddy icon (step ), the first subscriber uses the first client to communicate with the second subscriber. In particular, the first subscriber uses the first client to send an instant message addressed to the second subscriber along with image data corresponding to the buddy icon (step ). The host  receives the message addressed to the second subscriber along with the image data (step ). In one implementation, the host  is an IM host. The host  then authenticates the message addressed to the second subscriber (step ). Typically, authentication is accomplished by confirming that the sender and the addressee of the message are registered subscribers of the host . Once the message has been authenticated, the host  sends the message and the image data to the second subscriber (step ).","The client receives the message and the image data associated with the buddy icon of the first subscriber from the host  (step ). The client then displays a blurred view of the buddy icon (step ) and also displays the message sent from the first subscriber (step ). In one implementation, the blurred view of the buddy icon is displayed in a knock-knock dialogue box. The knock-knock dialogue box may be presented to the second subscriber prior to the message from the first subscriber. Alternatively, the knock-knock dialogue box may overlay the message dialogue box.","When presented with the blurred view of the buddy icon, the second subscriber uses the second client to accept or reject the buddy icon (step ). The second subscriber may immediately accept the buddy icon from the first subscriber. In this case, a clear view of the buddy icon is rendered in the instant message dialogue box. The second subscriber also may immediately reject the buddy icon. In this case, the buddy icon is not presented to the second subscriber.","In some cases, however, the second subscriber may be unsure whether to accept or reject the buddy icon. In this case, the second subscriber may sharpen the view of the buddy icon (step ). When the view of the buddy icon is sharpened, the second subscriber is presented with a better view of the buddy icon and can therefore make a more informed decision as to whether to accept or reject the buddy icon. After the view of the buddy icon is sharpened (step ), the second subscriber again can choose whether to accept or reject the buddy icon (step ).","In one implementation, the buddy icon is a 48\u00d748 pixel image. When the second client receives the image data from the host , the second client displays every eighth pixel to the second subscriber. When the second subscriber selects to sharpen the view of the buddy icon, the second client displays every fourth pixel to the second subscriber. If the second subscriber chooses to sharpen the view of the buddy icon again, the second client displays every other pixel to the second subscriber. Finally, if the second subscriber again sharpens the view of the buddy icon, the second client displays the clear view of the buddy icon to the second subscriber. If at any time, the second subscriber suspects that the buddy icon is objectionable, the second subscriber has the option to reject the buddy icon. By presenting the second subscriber with a very poor resolution image and then gradually improving the resolution of the image, the second subscriber will be less likely to view an objectionable image.","In general, the client and the client communicate over an open connection, such as an open TCP connection established through the host . Typically, both clients , include a Winsock API for establishing an open TCP connection to the host  and a client application for accessing the host . The client devices , connect to the host  to establish the connection.","The clients , can use the connection to communicate with the host  and with each other. The connection remains open during the time that the first client and the second client are accessing the host . To access the host , each client , sends a request to the host . The requests identify the associated subscribers to the host  and to other subscribers using the subscribers' unique screen names. The host  verifies a subscriber's information (e.g., screen name and password) against data stored in a subscriber database. If the subscriber's information is verified, the host  authorizes access. If the subscriber's information is not verified, the host  denies access and sends an error message.","Upon accessing the host , the client receives a list of the first subscriber's \u201cbuddies\u201d that are currently online (i.e., accessing the host ). Buddies are subscribers or screen names designated for exchanging instant messages. In general, the host  informs the first subscriber as to whether designated buddies are online or offline. The host  also informs any subscriber that has designated the first subscriber as a buddy that the first subscriber is online. The first subscriber can use an application running on the client (\u201cthe client application\u201d) to view the online status of particular buddies, exchange instant messages with online buddies, participate in group chat rooms, trade files such as pictures, invitations or documents, find other subscribers with similar interests, get customized news and stock quotes, and search the Web. Additionally, the subscriber can use the client application to transfer one or more files to or from the client device of another subscriber.","In one implementation, the client attempts to establish a direct socket connection (e.g., a peer-to-peer socket connection) to the client using the IP address of the client . In some circumstances, however, the client may be unable to establish a direct socket connection to the client , such as, for example, when the client is behind a firewall. In the event that the client cannot establish a direct socket connection to the client after a predetermined time period, the client sends a connect message to the client through the host . The connect message includes, for example, the message type, the screen name of the first subscriber, the screen name of the second subscriber, the IP address of the client , and a randomly generated security number. The host  authenticates that the connect message from the client is from a valid subscriber and then sends the connect message to the client ","Upon receiving the connect message, the client attempts to establish a direct socket connection to the client of the second subscriber using the IP address of the client . If, however, the client is unable to establish a direct socket connection to the client , such as, for example, when the client is behind a firewall, the client displays a message to that effect and sends an error message to the client through the host . The host  authenticates that the error message from the client is from a valid subscriber and then sends the error message to the client of the second subscriber. In response to the received error message, the client displays a message to the subscriber.","If a direct socket connection has been established between the client and the client , the client verifies that the client includes a valid client application by, for example, verifying the security number of the client application.","The direct connection bypasses the connection between the client and the host . In one implementation, the host  limits the capacity of the connection to the client . As a result, the client cannot transfer files larger than a threshold file size (e.g. 8000 characters or bytes) through the host . In contrast to the capacity of the connection between the client and the host , the capacity of the direct socket connection between the client and the client is not limited. The client , therefore, may transfer relatively large files (e.g. graphics files, executable files) to the client ",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0092","num":"0091"},"figref":"FIGS. 8-11"},"Referring to , a UI  includes a Buddy Icon preference box . A subscriber may use the Buddy Icon preference box  to set transfer preferences for buddy icons as well as to designate graphical images to be used as buddy icons. In one implementation, the Buddy Icon preference box  is used to select a subscriber's own buddy icon to be presented to other subscribers.","Referring to , a UI  includes a Buddy Icon preference box . In one implementation, the Buddy Icon preference box  is used to designate a buddy icon for a selected buddy.","Referring to , UI's A-D include Accept Buddy Icon dialogue boxes A-D. The Accept Buddy Icon dialogue boxes A-D illustrate the progression of knock-knock dialogue boxes presented to a subscriber. That is, accept buddy icon dialogue box B results from selecting the sharpen button in Accept Buddy Icon dialogue box A. Likewise, Accept Buddy Icon dialogue box C results from selecting the sharpened button in Accept Buddy Icon dialogue box B. Finally, a clear view of the buddy icon image is presented in Accept Buddy Icon dialogue box D from selecting the sharpen button in Accept Buddy Icon dialogue box C.","Referring to , a UI  includes an instant message dialogue box . In one implementation, the instant message dialogue box  includes a buddy icon . The buddy icon  is rendered in the instant message dialogue box  when designated as the buddy icon for the selected buddy and\/or when the buddy icon is selected by a buddy and accepted by the subscriber.","Although the examples above are described in conjunction with an instant messaging system, aspects may be applicable to other forms of communication, such as e-mail.
