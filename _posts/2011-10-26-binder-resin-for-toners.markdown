However, usually if a resin binder for a toner is formed into a low molecular compound in order to melt the resin at low temperatures, a glass transition temperature of the resin is lowered, thereby lowering in storage property.","In order to overcome this disadvantage, as a resin binder for use in a toner having a high glass transition temperature even at a low molecular weight, polyesters obtained from a carboxylic acid having an aromatic ring such as terephthalic acid or isophthalic acid as a raw material monomer are well used.","On the other hand, Patent Publication 1 discloses, as an objective of providing a thermoplastic resin having excellent heat resistance, mechanical properties, and weathering resistance, and having a sufficient molecular weight, using biomass as a raw material, a thermoplastic resin characterized in that the thermoplastic resin has a furan structure, and that the thermoplastic resin has a reducing viscosity (\u03b7sp\/C) of 0.48 dL\/g or more and a terminal acid value is less than 200 \u03bceq\/g. Also, Patent Publication 2 discloses a method for producing a polyester resin containing a dicarboxylic acid unit having a furan structure.","However, the resins described in Patent Publication 1 and Patent Publication 2 are used mainly in film applications or applications for injection-molded articles, so that the resins have high crystallinity, thereby making them unsuitable as resin binders for use in toners.","In addition, Patent Publication 3 discloses, as an objective of providing a novel polyester resin, which can be used in the production of molded articles having excellent impact resistance, a polyester resin characterized in that the polyester resin has a structural unit of a specified furan ring.","However, the resin described in Patent Publication 3 also is a composition for use in molded articles, so that the resin has a high crystallinity, thereby making it unsuitable as a resin binder for use in a toner.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":["Patent Publication 1: Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2008-291243","Patent Publication 2: Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2008-291244","Patent Publication 3: Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2009-197110"]}},"The present invention relates to:","[1] a resin binder for use in a toner, the resin binder containing an amorphous polyester having a furan ring; and","[2] a toner for electrophotography, containing the resin binder as defined in the above [1].","As a result of studies, the present inventors have found that a resin binder for use in a toner gives the toner excellent low-temperature fusing ability and storage property by making a polyester having a furan ring amorphous.","The present invention relates to a resin binder for use in a toner, which gives the toner excellent low-temperature fusing ability and storage property, and a toner for electrophotography containing the resin binder. Further, the present invention relates to a resin binder for use in a toner, which gives the toner excellent low-temperature fusing ability, storage property, and durability, and a toner for electrophotography containing the resin binder.","The resin binder for use in a toner of the present invention exhibits some excellent effects that both low-temperature fusing ability and storage property of the toner can be satisfied. Further, since a specified aliphatic carboxylic acid compound and\/or a specified aliphatic alcohol is used in a raw material monomer for an amorphous polyester, some excellent effects such as the resin binder for use in a toner of the present invention is capable of satisfying both low-temperature fusing ability and storage property of the toner, and further improving durability are exhibited.","The resin binder of the present invention has a great feature in that the resin binder contains an amorphous polyester having a furan ring. The present inventors have found that since a compound having a furan ring is used as a raw material monomer for a polyester, a resin having a high glass transition temperature even if its softening point is low, in other words, a resin having a high glass transition temperature even if a number-average molecular weight is low, is obtained. Accordingly, the resin binder for use in a toner of the present invention gives the toner excellent low-temperature fusing ability and storage property. Although the reasons therefor are not elucidated, it is considered that an amorphous polyester having a furan ring gives the toner excellent low-temperature fusing ability, and at the same time that the amorphous polyester has a structure having low flexibility in which the mobility of the resin is lowered, so that the amorphous polyester also gives the toner excellent storage property.","In the present invention, the crystallinity of the resin is expressed by a ratio of a softening point to a highest temperature of the endothermic peak determined with a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), i.e., a crystallinity index defined by \u201csoftening point\/highest temperature of the endothermic peak.\u201d Generally, when this crystallinity index exceeds 1.4, the resin is amorphous; and when the crystallinity index is less than 0.6, the resin is low in crystallinity and contains a greater amorphous portion. In the present invention, the \u201camorphous\u201d resin refers to a resin having a crystallinity index of exceeding 1.4, or less than 0.6. On the other hand, the \u201ccrystalline\u201d resin refers to a resin having a crystallinity index of from 0.6 to 1.4.","The \u201chighest temperature of the endothermic peak\u201d refers to a temperature of the peak on the highest temperature side among endothermic peaks observed under the conditions for the method for measurement described in Examples. When a difference between the highest temperature of the endothermic peak and the softening point is within 20\u00b0 C., the highest temperature of the endothermic peak is defined as a melting point of a crystalline resin (crystalline polyester). When the difference between the highest temperature of the endothermic peak and the softening point exceeds 20\u00b0 C., the peak is ascribed to a glass transition of an amorphous polyester.","The crystallinity of the resin can be adjusted by the kinds of the raw material monomers and a combination thereof. Specifically, the amorphization can be accelerated by using a carboxylic acid component or alcohol component having a branched structure, or a trivalent or higher polyvalent carboxylic acid component or alcohol component in proper amounts, for example, an alkyl- or alkenylsuccinic acid, an aliphatic diol having a hydroxyl group bonded to a secondary carbon atom, trimellitic acid, trimellitic anhydride, or the like. Also, the crystallization of the resin can be easily accelerated by using an \u03b1,\u03c9-linear alkanediol in a proper amount as an alcohol component.","In the present invention, the amorphous polyester is preferably a resin obtained by polycondensing a carboxylic acid component and an alcohol component, wherein at least a carboxylic acid component containing a carboxylic acid compound having a furan ring and\/or an alcohol component containing an alcohol having a furan ring is used as a raw material monomer, and the furan ring having a structure represented by the formula (Ia) or (Ib):",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0021"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"37.51mm","wi":"47.16mm","file":"US09023568-20150505-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"is preferred.","The carboxylic acid compound having a furan ring includes furan dicarboxylic acid compounds such as furan-2,5-dicarboxylic acid, furan-2,4-dicarboxylic acid, furan-2,3-dicarboxylic acid, and furan-3,4-dicarboxylic acid (in the present specification, the carboxylic acid compound includes carboxylic acids, esters formed between the carboxylic acids and alcohols having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, preferably from 1 to 3 carbon atoms, and acid anhydrides thereof); furan carboxylic acid compounds such as furan-2-carboxylic acid and furan-3-carboxylic acid; the hydroxyfuran carboxylic acid compounds such as 5-hydroxymethyl-furan-2-carboxylic acid; carboxylic acid compounds such as furfuryl acetic acid compounds and 3-carboxy-4-methyl-5-propyl-2-furan propionate (in the present specification, the carboxylic acid compound includes hydroxycarboxylic acid compounds); and the like.

At the point where the generation of the lines was confirmed, printing was stopped. The test was conducted up to 5,000 sheets at the maximum. Durability was evaluated by defining the number of printed sheets at the point where the generation of lines was visually confirmed on the images as the number of sheets at which lines were generated by fusion or fixing of toner on a developer roller, in accordance with the following evaluation criteria. In other words, it can be judged that the larger the number of sheets without generation of lines, the higher the durability of toner. The results are shown in Table B5.
