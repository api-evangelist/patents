Field of the Invention","The invention generally relates to integrated optical communications, and more particularly to a slotted multimode interference device for use in telecommunications, sensing, and related applications.","2. Description of the Related Art","Within this application several publications are referenced by Arabic numerals within brackets. Full citations for these publications may be found at the end of the specification immediately preceding the claims. The disclosures of all these publications in their entireties are hereby expressly incorporated by reference into the present application for the purposes of indicating the background of the invention and illustrating the general state of the art.","Multimode interference (MMI) devices are useful for the separation and combination of power of wavelengths or polarizations (SCWP) in integrated optic (IO) systems. However, like all SCWP devices, multimode interference devices can be rather long (geometrically), and thus take up more space on the integrated optical chip than is desirable. For example, wavelength separation\/combination devices of 1.3 \u03bcm and 1.5 \u03bcm are required in the field of fiber optic communications to take advantage of embedded fiber optic systems of sizes of 1.3 \u03bcm and to proceed with the deployment of the lower loss 1.5 \u03bcm systems. Conventional devices rely on bulk optical filters and therefore suffer high insertion loss. As another example, polarization separation\/combination devices are required for various IO and fiber optic sensing systems, such as optical gyroscopes and structural stress sensors. The self-imaging effect is a general property of light, therefore MMI devices do not have to be in IO.","Integrated optic devices are made according to photolithographic and microfabrication techniques. This allows for mass production, in the same way as for electrical integrated circuits. The most common electro-optic substrate materials for integrated optic devices are the semiconductors gallium arsenide and indium phosphide and lithium niobate, a ferroelectric insulating crystal. Lithium niobate is a strong, easily polished nonhydroscopic crystal, with a good electro-optic coefficient. It also has low optical transmission loss.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["1","1","2","3","3","4","2","4"],"i":["a","b "]},"A useful property of the self-imaging effect is that a lateral displacement of the input to the MMI region  along the object plane results in a corresponding displacement of the self-image along the image plane. This self-image displacement is antisymmetrical for the first self-image length (crossed). The second self-image is antisymmetrical to the first self-image, and thus symmetrically displaced relative to the input (barred). This continues, with odd-numbered self-images being antisymmetrically displaced (crossed), and even-numbered self-images being symmetrically displaced (barred).","In previous patents and publications, it has been shown that the dimensions of the MMI region  can be set such that the modes constructively interfere at the end of the region, forming a self-image of the TE (or \u03bb) input signal at one output waveguide and TM (or \u03bb) at the other output waveguide . Thus, the device  can separate two polarizations (or wavelengths) from one input  into two outputs , , each containing a different polarization (or wavelength). The device  can also work in reverse as a combiner. While MMI SCWP devices generally outperform other competing conventional techniques, they are still much longer than necessary or optimal, and some suffer from some performance limitations.","In other prior publications, it has been shown that introducing changes to the refractive index of portions of the MMI region  can drastically alter the self-imaging properties of the MMI device , allowing one to switch the light to either of the two outputs , . Most of these conventional devices describe devices that require either large changes in the refractive index, or changes to large regions, or both, which limits the usefulness of the respective devices.","Therefore, due to the limitations of the conventional devices and processes, there remains a need for improvements to self-imaging waveguide devices for use in optical and related systems.","In view of the foregoing, an embodiment of the invention provides a multimode interference (MMI) device comprising at least one input port, at least one output port, a multimode interference region separating the input port from the output port, and at least one subregion in the multimode interference region, wherein a self-image length within the multimode interference region is reduced by a factor that is approximately equal to one plus a number of subregions configured in the multimode interference region, wherein the at least one subregion is configured to have an effective width and effective refractive index running longitudinally through the multimode interference region, wherein the subregion has an effective refractive index different from the remaining portions of the MMI region, and wherein the multimode interference region has alterable self-imaging properties.","The subregion may comprise a slot, which is created by removing material from the MMI region (thus making it a \u201cslot\u201d in the usual sense of the word), but the subregion could, in another embodiment, instead have its effective refractive index changed by a variety of other means. However, a \u201cslot\u201d, as referred to in this application shall refer to the subregion of the MMI region having an effective refractive index different from the other portions of the MMI region, regardless of whether the slot is a slot in the traditional sense (i.e., material removed from the MMI region) or conversely the addition of material (i.e., a bump, etc.). Furthermore, the change in the effective refractive index may be an increase or a reduction. The input and output ports are most commonly connected to input and output waveguides which would lead to other devices. However, other devices could instead be connected to the ports directly. In a first embodiment, the at least one subregion is a single subregion centered in the multimode interference region, and the at least one input port and the at least one output port are positioned off-centered in relation to the multimode interference region.","According to another embodiment, the invention provides a method of manufacturing a multimode interference device, wherein the method comprises configuring at least one input port, configuring at least one output port, configuring a multimode interference region separating the input port from the output port, and forming a subregion in the multimode interference region, wherein a self-image length within the multimode interference region is reduced by a factor that is approximately equal to one plus a number of subregions configured in the multimode interference region, wherein the subregion is configured to have an effective width and effective refractive index running longitudinally through the multimode interference region, wherein the subregion has an effective refractive index different from the remaining portions of the MMI region, and wherein the multimode interference region has alterable self-imaging properties. In a first embodiment, the subregion comprises a single subregion, which may be embodied as a slot, centered in the multimode interference region. In a second embodiment, the subregion comprises a plurality of subregions, which may be embodied as slots. In another embodiment, the method comprises configuring a plurality of input and output ports, wherein the input port and the output port are positioned off-centered in relation to the multimode interference region. According to an embodiment of the invention, etching the multimode interference device forms the subregion(s). Alternatively, deposition processing forms the subregion(s). Alternatively, ion implantation forms the subregion(s). Still alternatively, applying a stimulus or stimuli to the multimode interference device forms the subregion(s), wherein the nature of the stimuli may be electrical, thermal, chemical, optical, and\/or mechanical.","These, and other aspects and advantages of the invention will be better appreciated and understood when considered in conjunction with the following description and the accompanying drawings. It should be understood, however, that the following description, while indicating preferred embodiments of the invention and numerous specific details thereof, is given by way of illustration and not of limitation. Many changes and modifications may be made within the scope of the invention without departing from the spirit thereof, and the invention includes all such modifications.","The invention and the various features and advantageous details thereof are explained more fully with reference to the non-limiting embodiments that are illustrated in the accompanying drawings and detailed in the following description. It should be noted that the features illustrated in the drawings are not necessarily drawn to scale. Descriptions of well-known components and processing techniques are omitted so as to not unnecessarily obscure the invention. The examples used herein are intended merely to facilitate an understanding of ways in which the invention may be practiced and to further enable those of skill in the art to practice the invention. Accordingly, the examples should not be construed as limiting the scope of the invention.","As previously mentioned, there is a need for an improved self-imaging waveguide device and a method of manufacturing the same. Referring now to the drawings, and more particularly to , there are shown preferred embodiments of the invention. For ease of understanding, in the several figures, \u2018A\u2019 refers to the center slot (center subregion), \u2018B\u2019 refers to the slots (subregions) on either side of \u2018A\u2019, \u2018C\u2019 refers to slots (subregions) on either side of \u2018B\u2019, etc., and the solid arrows represent the direction of light into and out of the device. However, it should be appreciated that (1) all of the slots shown in the various figures are not necessarily configured the same; (2) there is a mirror symmetry about the center of the MMI region ; and (3) a \u2018B\u2019 slot in a 3-slot device is not the same as a \u2018B\u2019 slot in a 4-slot device or a 5-slot device, etc. The above-referenced slot identifications (\u2018A\u2019, \u2018B\u2019, and \u2018C\u2019) are meant merely to distinguish the various slots from one another within a particular drawing and should not be read to constitute a limitation on the configuration of such slots.","The invention provides a novel technique for reducing multimode interference self-image lengths, and thus the lengths of MMI-based devices, such as SCWP devices. The invention provides a subregion, which may be embodied as a slot (or multiple slots), of a specific width and effective refractive index, and at a specific position, which runs the longitudinal length of the MMI region. According to a preferred embodiment of the invention,  illustrates a multimode interference device  comprising an input port , an output port , a multimode interference region  separating the input port  from the output port , and a slotted region  dimensioned and configured in the multimode interference region . Additionally, a self-image length within the multimode interference region  is reduced by a factor that is approximately equal (for example, within 5%) to one plus a number of subregions  configured in the multimode interference region . Moreover, the slotted region  comprises an effective width and effective refractive index running longitudinally through the multimode interference region , and wherein the multimode interference region  has alterable self-imaging properties. Moreover, the slotted region  has an effective refractive index different from the remaining portions of the MMI region .","The output port  further comprises a crossed output waveguide and a barred output waveguide . A single centered slot  with the proper width and effective refractive index reduces the self-imaging length by a factor of approximately two, without adversely affecting the performance or fabricability of the device . The difference in refractive index between the MMI region  and the slot  may be formed by etching the slot  (as is shown in ), or by etching everywhere in the MMI region  except the slot , by deposition of additional material in the slot , by deposition of additional material everywhere in the MMI region  except the slot , by use of the electro-optic effect, or by some other means. Those skilled in the art will recognize a variety of other methods used to define the waveguides , , the MMI region , and the slot .","The usefulness of the invention and the improvement to the art provided by the invention are demonstrated by investigating the correlation between slot dimensions and output, and by analyzing the optimization of length and throughput. As is indicated below, the feasibility of fabricating a slotted MMI device according to the invention is demonstrated by analyzing the allowable margins of error.","Although more than one self-image length is used to create SCWP devices, for the fabricability analysis only the first self-image length is discussed herein for ease of comparison, and to prevent unnecessary repetition. In the calculated results, unless otherwise stated, the MMI region width is 10 \u03bcm. The input\/output waveguides ,  are centered 2.5 \u03bcm from the edge of the MMI region . The experimental calculations are based on the modal propagation analysis (MPA), and on the beam propagation method (BPM), with both using the effective index method (EIM) to reduce the calculations to two dimensions. (These types of calculations are well-known in the field of integrated optics. Brief explanations can be found in references [6] and [11], along with further references). The effective index of refraction of the waveguide (including the MMI region ), n, is 3.0, with a lowered effective index of refraction for the slot, n. All areas outside of the waveguides are known as the lateral region. The effective refractive index of the lateral region, n, is set to 1.0, which indicates use of a very deep etch known as a pedestal etch. However, other etching techniques may be employed by the invention. The pedestal etch is used in the calculations presented because it allows for a small bend radii and thus is often used when one is trying to make small devices. The wavelength of the light is 1 \u03bcm. The input\/output field distribution is modeled as a Gaussian distribution with a full-width half-maximum of 1 \u03bcm, which corresponds to input\/output waveguide widths of 4 \u03bcm. Generally, wider inputs\/outputs increase throughput, which is desirable, but can increase crosstalk if made too wide, which is undesirable. The values used here are not critical. They are simply intermediate values that provide good throughput while keeping crosstalk very low.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":"FIG. 3","sub":["slot ","slot ","region"]},"It is well-known to those familiar with MMI devices (see reference [6], for example) that the self-image length for standard MMI devices with off-center inputs is given by:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mrow":{"mi":"L","mo":"=","mrow":{"mn":"4","mo":"\u2062","mfrac":{"mrow":{"msup":{"mi":"W","mn":"2"},"mo":"\u2062","msub":{"mi":["n","region"]}},"mi":"\u03bb"}}},"mo":","}}},"br":{},"sub":["region ","lat"],"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 4"]},"Examples of the application of a single slot to SCWP devices are shown schematically in the top views in ) and (). A polarization splitter is shown in ) and a wavelength splitter is shown in ) for wavelengths \u03bb1 and \u03bb2. Each device is one-half the length of the corresponding standard (unslotted) MMI SCWP device. Of course, each device can be used in reverse as a combiner.","This effect of a single slot has been used previously to design integrated optical switches (i.e., devices that allow one to control whether light entering the input port of the MMI will exit from the crossed output port or from the barred output port). Conventional approaches discuss such single-slotted MMI switches for the case of increased values for n. Recently, this concept has been extended to the case of decreased values for n. Crucially, neither of these conventional approaches nor any other conventional approach indicates that slotted MMI devices are more general than single-slotted MMI switches with a varying value of n. That is, the effect of multiple slots, the possible usefulness of slotted MMI devices for anything but switches, and the possibility of switching by varying the width or depth of the slot(s) are entirely absent from the prior art literature.","The throughput of a device is the power at the output port (or in the output waveguide), normalized by the power at the input port (or in the input waveguide). Ideally, one wants the throughput to be unity (i.e., 1.0), indicating that no power has been lost from the system due to the device in question. Conventional solutions indicated that throughput would degrade unless the slot were kept rather narrow. Other solutions use a wider slot, but indicate that there is something special or unique about the width used. Conversely, the calculations of the present invention indicate otherwise. According to the invention, for all slot widths, the throughput does not noticeably decrease for the best values of nexcept for slots wider than 1.0 \u03bcm, which interfere with the input\/output , . The difference in results is because, for each slot width, the best value of nis determined empirically by optimization to maximize the throughput. In contrast, the conventional solutions use rather simple equations, which are derived in reference [28] using approximations that are not quite valid. These equations are useful for giving one a physical \u201cfeel\u201d for what is happening and for finding starting points for the optimization (and according to the invention, it will be shown herein that they can be extended to multiple slots), but the conventional approaches should not be used for final designs or conclusions about the behavior of slotted MMI devices, as they are incomplete at best.","According to the invention, in order to determine fabricability, the effect of a 10% fabrication error in the slot width is calculated, while keeping all other parameters fixed. This is performed for slot widths of 0.1 \u03bcm, 0.5 \u03bcm, and 1.0 \u03bcm. In all cases, the resulting change in the throughput is determined to be not large enough to significantly degrade the functionality of the device. As an example of the results, ) and () illustrate the sensitivity results for a slot width of 0.5 \u03bcm. The slot width error for this case is \u00b150 nm. The solid curve corresponds to the correct value of slot width, while the two slotted curves correspond to the incorrect values. The differing self-imaging length for TE and TM polarizations that is seen here is a standard feature of MMI devices that is well-known in the prior art. The throughput responses for the other two cases are similar, indicating that the important parameter for fabricability is relative error rather than absolute error. Thus, a wider slot will have a larger allowable absolute error in the slot width, and will be easier to fabricate to the necessary tolerance in order to provide the required throughput.","As another test of fabricability, nis varied about its best value (i.e., the value that yields maximum throughput), while keeping the other parameters fixed. This is performed for slot widths of 0.1 \u03bcm, 0.5 \u03bcm, and 1.0 \u03bcm. In all cases, the device is able to tolerate a large relative error. For example, for a slot width of 0.5 \u03bcm, even a large relative error (\u00b120%) in the change of n, n\u2212n, only reduces the throughput from 99% to 97%. Hereinafter, n\u2212nis referred to as \u03b4n. Again, the throughput responses for the other two cases are similar, indicating that the important parameter for fabricability is relative error in \u03b4n rather than absolute error. Thus, a slot with a larger \u03b4n will have a larger allowable absolute error in \u03b4n, and will be easier to fabricate to the necessary tolerance in order to provide the required throughput. However, because larger \u03b4n implies smaller slot width, this means that there is a tradeoff in fabricability; narrow slots have a large absolute tolerance for on but a small absolute tolerance for slot width, while wide slots have a small absolute tolerance for \u03b4n but a large absolute tolerance for slot width. For applications of slotted MMI devices in which the slot parameters are fixed at fabrication, such as SCWP devices, one should therefore preferably pick a medium slot width and a medium \u03b4n.","On the other hand, the fabricability tradeoff can be advantageously used to make a switch. When the slot is wide, the value of napproximates the value of n. This means that a small absolute change in either nor nhas a large effect on the behavior of the device . This can be used as the basis of a slotted MMI cross-bar switch. Thus, if nis equal to nthe device  will behave as a standard MMI device . If the MMI region  length is set to the self-imaging length, then the output will be crossed. That is (referring to ), an optical signal will enter the MMI device  at input port , traverse the MMI region  while interacting with the slotted region , and will exit at the output port . However, if either nor nis changed slightly so that their difference is set to the correct value that causes halving of the self-image length, then (for very nearly the same MMI region length) the output will be barred. In this case, an optical signal will enter the MMI device  at input port , traverse the MMI region  while interacting with the slotted region , and will exit at the output port . This index change can be brought about by a variety of methods well-known in the IO prior art, such as the electro-optic effect, the thermo-optic effect, strip-loading due to adhesion of reactants to a surface coating, microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), etc. The simplest version of this type of slotted MMI switch, in which switching is obtained by changing nof a single slot via the electro-optic effect, is known in the art. ) and () illustrate a schematic top-view of a singly-slotted MMI switch in operation, with ) showing crossed output with the slot off and ) showing barred output with the slot on.","Conversely, when the slot  is narrow, the behavior of the device  is sensitive to absolute changes in the slot width. Thus, changing the slot width of a narrow slot can also be used as the basis of a cross-bar switch. The width change can be brought about by a variety of methods well-known in the 10 prior art, such as bulk heating or MEMS.","Several examples of MEMS slotted MMI switches are shown schematically in . ) and () illustrate a switch in which the MEMS acts horizontally, moving half of the MMI region. In the closed position shown in ), there is no slot and, with the MMI length set to the first self-image length for a standard MMI device, the output is crossed. In the open position shown in ), there is a single slot in the MMI region, so the self-image length is halved. The light self-images twice within the MMI region (for the same MMI region length), and the output is barred. Moreover, the distance required for the MEMS to move in this slotted-MMI device is much smaller than would be required if the switching device relied upon total internal reflection from the slot. That is, in the latter case, the slot would need to be much wider, placing greater demands upon the MEMS aspect of the device. ) and () illustrate a switch (in an end-on view) in which the MEMS acts vertically, moving a piece of the waveguide. In the closed position shown in ), there is no slot and, with the MMI length set to the first self-image length for a standard MMI device, the output is crossed. In the open position shown in ), there is a single slot in the MMI region, so the self-image length is halved. The light self-images twice within the MMI region (for the same MMI region length), and the output is barred. Furthermore, the size of the waveguide piece required for the MEMS to move in this slotted-MMI device is much smaller than would be required if the switching device relied upon total internal reflection from the slot. That is, in the latter case, the slot would need to be much wider and therefore more massive, thereby placing greater demands upon the MEMS aspect of the device. Additionally, the vertical distance required for the MEMS to move is not large, since the waveguide thickness is usually less than the light wavelength.","Combination SCWP and switch devices are also possible.  illustrate schematic top views of two examples of such devices. ) and () illustrate a switching polarization splitter, in which the device acts as a polarization splitter with the slot turned off as shown in ), but passes both polarizations to the barred output with the slot turned on as shown in ). ) and () illustrate a similar device for wavelengths \u03bb1 and \u03bb2. It is a switching wavelength splitter, in which the device acts as a wavelength splitter with the slot turned off shown in ), but passes both wavelengths to the barred output with the slot turned on shown in ). The principle of both devices is the same: activating the slot halves the self-image length. Therefore, a device that is a splitter with the slot off will, with the slot on, instead first split in the first half of the MMI region and then recombine in the second half of the MMI region.","As mentioned above, multiple slots may also be used. ) through (), which show top views of the simulated field intensity through MMI devices for identical propagation distances, illustrate the effect of introducing additional slots. FIG. () is for a conventional MMI device with no slot. The view is from the offset input to just beyond the first self-image. ) is for an MMI device with a single centered slot according to the invention. The same propagation distance now includes the second self-image. ) is for an MMI device with two evenly-spaced slots according to the invention. The same propagation distance now includes the third self-image. ) is for an MMI device with three evenly spaced slots according to the invention. The same propagation distance now includes the fourth self-image. Thus, for N slots, the self-image length is decreased by a factor of approximately N+1. This is shown schematically in . The throughput generally decreases for increasing numbers of slots. However, the slot parameters can often be set to optimize the throughput for a specific self-image or set of self-images. This can be seen in the N=2 case shown in ), where the throughput for all barred self-images is approximately 95% even though the throughput for the crossed self-images (including the first self-image) is only approximately 85%.","When designing a slotted MMI device with more than two slots, the slots should preferably not all have the same effective refractive index and width.

The center slot contributes delay A; the off-center slots each contribute a delay B. Every fourth mode has nulls at all slot positions, and thus gets zero slot delay. Even modes not divisible by 4 have nulls at the center, so they get no A delay, but they have maxima at both off-center slots, so they get two full B delays. Odd modes are maximum at zero, so they get a full A delay, but only have a value of 1\/\u221a{square root over (2)} at the position of the off-center slots, so they get half of a B delay from each off-center slot for a total of one B delay. After some algebraic calculations, one finds that all odd-phase differences result from the following combinations (among others) of A and B: 1\/4, 1\/2; 5\/4, \u22121\/2; 1\/4, \u22123\/2; and \u22123\/4, \u22121\/2. This demonstrates that there are a variety of combinations of both positive and negative values of \u03b4n that will result in self-imaging for an MMI region that is one-fourth of the standard self-image length.","Solutions have also been obtained for slot delays that result in self-imaging for slotted MMI devices with 4 slots and 5 slots (at propagation distances of L\/5 and L\/6, respectively). The algebraic calculations become more complicated, but the procedure is essentially the same as shown above for 1, 2, and 3 slots. These calculations have been confirmed with MPA and BPM calculations. The same algebraic procedure works for any number of slots; however, as the number of slots increases, the required delay from some slots will become large enough to invalidate the assumption that the \u201cno-slot\u201d modes are unperturbed to first order. Thus, in practice there is a limit to the length reduction possible in slotted MMI devices. This limit will depend upon the particular parameters of the device under investigation, but a reduction factor of approximately 10 is most likely the upper limit for most cases of interest.","The application of multiple slots to SCWP devices is a straightforward extension of the application of a single slot to SCWP devices. Examples of the application of multiple slots to switching devices are shown schematically in . ) and () illustrate a three-slotted MMI switch with one permanent slot down the center of the MMI region and two switchable slots centered at approximately \u00b1W\/4. The exact locations of slots can be varied slightly to optimize performance. With the switchable slots off as shown in ), and the length of the MMI region set to the first self-image length for a single-slotted device, one obtains crossed output. With the switchable slots on as shown in ), the self-image length is halved, and one obtains barred output. This device is one-half the length of a single-slotted MMI switch. ) and () illustrate a similar device, but with five slots. Two of the slots, centered at approximately \u00b1W\/6, are permanent. The other three slots, centered at 0 and approximately \u00b1W\/3, are switchable. A switchable slot is a slot that is switched on and off. For example, an applied voltage can change the refractive index in the slot region to make a slot, but if the voltage is turned off then the index of the slot region is the same as the index of the rest of the MMI region, and so there is no slot. In contrast, a permanent slot is not turned on and off, either because one always keeps it on or because a permanent change has been made to the device (e.g., an etch or a deposition).","With the switchable slots off as shown in ), and the length of the MMI region set to the first self-image length for a doubly-slotted device, one obtains crossed output. With the switchable slots on as shown in ), the self-image length is halved, and one obtains barred output. This device is 1\/3 the length of a single-slotted MMI switch. This concept can be extended to switches with 7 slots, 9 slots, 11 slots, etc., although at some point (depending on the application) the extra reduction in length is not efficient due to the penalties in device complexity and performance, as indicated above.","Therefore, a slot  with optimal parameters in the MMI region  halves the self-image length, while the throughput performance suffers only slightly. The best throughput of an unslotted device ()) is experimentally shown to be 99.7%, compared to 99.3% for a single slotted device ()). Multiple slots may be used, in which case the length reduction is by a factor that is approximately equal to one plus the number of slots.","According to another embodiment shown in the flow diagram of , the invention provides a method of manufacturing a multimode interference device , wherein the method comprises configuring  an input port , configuring  an output port , configuring  a multimode interference region  separating the input port  from the output port , and forming  a subregion  in the multimode interference region  having an effective refractive index different from other regions of the multimode interference region . Additionally, a self-image length within the multimode interference region  is reduced by a factor that is approximately equal to one plus a number of subregions  configured in the multimode interference region . Furthermore, the subregion  is configured to have an effective width and effective refractive index running longitudinally through the multimode interference region , and the multimode interference region  has alterable self-imaging properties, which means that the subregion  in the MMI region  alters the self-imaging properties of the MMI region .","In a first embodiment, the subregion  comprises a single slot  centered in the multimode interference region. In a second embodiment, the slotted region  comprises a plurality of slots. In another embodiment, the method comprises configuring a plurality of input (not shown) and output ports , , wherein the input port and the output ports are positioned off-centered in relation to the multimode interference region . According to an embodiment of the invention, the subregion  is formed by etching the multimode interference device . Alternatively, the subregion  is formed by deposition processing. Still alternatively, the subregion  is formed by applying a stimulus to the multimode interference device , wherein the stimulus is any of an electrical stimulus, a thermal stimulus, a chemical stimulus, an optical stimulus, and a mechanical stimulus.","The invention is advantageous over the conventional devices and methods because the invention reduces the length of a MMI SCWP device without significantly reducing device performance. That is, the MMI device  of the invention is substantially shorter than standard MMI devices, and because of the novel slot  in the MMI region , the invention is able to achieve shorter lengths. In fact, the device  with one slot  as provided by the invention is half the length of a standard MMI device. Moreover, in another embodiment, the device provided by the invention is 1\/(N+1) times the length of a standard MMI device, wherein N is the number of slots  in the device . Furthermore, the slotted MMI region  is a novel concept, which has many useful applications in IO and other fields.","Most of the conventional devices describe devices that operate on fundamentally different principles from those described by the invention. Furthermore, the conventional devices require either large changes in the refractive index, or changes to large regions, or both, which makes them less useful than the devices provided by the invention. Other devices describe switching devices that are the simplest versions of more-general switching devices. However, no other prior device describes a generally-applicable means of reducing the self-image length of any MMI device with an off-center input by introducing changes to the refractive index of portions of the MMI region, as does the invention.","The foregoing description of the specific embodiments will so fully reveal the general nature of the invention that others can, by applying current knowledge, readily modify and\/or adapt for various applications such specific embodiments without departing from the generic concept, and, therefore, such adaptations and modifications should and are intended to be comprehended within the meaning and range of equivalents of the disclosed embodiments.
