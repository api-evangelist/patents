{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/118,608, filed on Nov. 29, 2008. The disclosure of the above application is incorporated herein by reference.","The disclosure relates to implantable medical devices and, more particularly, to implantable medical electrical leads.","The human anatomy includes many types of tissues that can either voluntarily or involuntarily, perform certain functions. After disease, injury, or natural defects, certain tissues may no longer operate within general anatomical norms. For example, after disease, injury, time, or combinations thereof, the heart muscle may begin to experience certain failures or deficiencies. Certain failures or deficiencies can be corrected or treated with implantable medical devices (IMDs), such as implantable pacemakers, implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) devices, cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator devices, or combinations thereof.","IMDs detect and deliver therapy for a variety of medical conditions in patients. IMDs include implantable pulse generators (IPGs) or implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) that deliver electrical stimuli to tissue of a patient. ICDs typically include, inter alia, a control module, a capacitor, and a battery that are housed in a hermetically sealed container with a lead extending therefrom. It is generally known that the hermetically sealed container can be implanted in a selected portion of the anatomical structure, such as in a chest or abdominal wall, and the lead can be inserted through various venous portions so that the tip portion can be positioned at the selected position near or in the muscle group. When therapy is required by a patient, the control module signals the battery to charge the capacitor, which in turn discharges electrical stimuli to tissue of a patient through via electrodes disposed on the lead, e.g., typically near the distal end of the lead. Typically, a medical electrical lead includes a flexible elongated body with one or more insulated elongated conductors. Each conductor electrically couples a sensing and\/or a stimulation electrode of the lead to the control module through a connector module.","In the context of implantable defibrillators, most systems include large surface area implantable electrodes to be mounted in or adjacent the heart. One common approach of providing a large surface area electrode is to employ an elongated exposed coil of biocompatible metal. In the context of an endocardial lead, this is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,161,952 issued to Kinney. In the context of an epicardial lead, this is disclosed in the context of U.S. Pat. No. 4,817,634 issued to Holleman et al.","An elongated coil serving as the electrode is typically mounted around the exterior of an insulative lead body. It is believed desirable in this context to stabilize the electrode coil with respect to the lead body, both to provide mechanical integrity and to prevent fibrous ingrowth around the individual coils of the electrode coil. In the above cited Kinney et al. patent and in U.S. Pat. No. 4,934,049, issued to Keikhafer et al., this is accomplished by sliding the coil over the lead body and backfilling the spaces between the electrode coil with a plastic material. In prior U.S. Pat. No. 5,042,143 issued to Holleman, et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 5,344,708 issued to Bischoff, et al. alternative methods of producing a lead structure similar to that produced in the Keikhafer patent are disclosed. In these patents a plastic tube is stretched. An electrode coil having a inner is then slid over the stretched tube, after which the tube, after which the tube is released, allowing it to return to its previous length. Thereafter, a mandrel is inserted into the tubing, compressing the tubing between the mandrel and the conductor coil. The assembly is thereafter heated, allowing the tubing to flow into spaces between the electrode coil to a desired depth.","Other designs for electrode-bearing leads are set forth in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/549,284 filed Oct. 13, 2006 by Boser discloses one mechanism for providing such joints.","The present invention relates to medical electrical leads that include a lead body and at least one tubular electrode sub-assembly positioned over and attached to the lead body. The lead body includes at least one elongated conductive element, such as a cable, that is electrically connected to a coiled electrode of the tubular electrode sub-assembly. The tubular electrode sub-assembly includes a tubular liner and an electrode embedded in the outer surface of the liner. In some embodiments, only a portion of the inner surface of the tubular liner is attached to the lead body in order to improve flexibility of the medical electrode lead in the area occupied by the tubular electrode sub-assembly.","In some embodiments, the tubular electrode sub-assembly may include a thermoplastic tubular liner having an inner surface and an outer surface and an electrode embedded into the outer surface of the thermoplastic tubular liner to depth sufficient to mechanically couple the electrode to the thermoplastic tubular liner, wherein at least a portion of an outer surface of the electrode includes an exposed outer surface proximate the outer surface of the thermoplastic tubular liner. The lead may include one or more selected attachment sites at which the tubular electrode sub-assembly is positioned over and attached to underlying structure of the lead body, wherein the one or more selected attachment sites occupy only a portion of the inner surface of the thermoplastic tubular liner.","The present disclosure also relates to methods of manufacturing medical electrical leads that include manufacturing a tubular electrode sub-assembly by providing a thermoplastic tubular liner and an electrode within a containment cavity, wherein the electrode is located between an outer surface of the thermoplastic tubular liner and an inner surface of the containment cavity, expanding the thermoplastic tubular liner to compress the electrode between the outer surface of the thermoplastic tubular liner and the inner surface of the containment cavity, heating the thermoplastic tubular liner above a forming temperature while the thermoplastic tubular liner is expanded, wherein the electrode embeds into the outer surface of the thermoplastic tubular liner to a depth sufficient to mechanically couple the electrode to the thermoplastic tubular liner, wherein at least a portion of a surface of the electrode comprises an exposed outer surface proximate the outer surface of the thermoplastic tubular liner.","The method of manufacturing the lead may further include positioning an inner surface of the thermoplastic tubular liner of the tubular electrode sub-assembly over underlying structure of a lead body after manufacturing the tubular electrode sub-assembly, wherein the lead body defines a longitudinal axis extending between a proximal end and a distal end of the lead body, and wherein the longitudinal axis extends through the thermoplastic tubular liner; attaching the tubular electrode sub-assembly to the underlying structure of the lead body at one or more selected attachment sites, wherein the one or more selected attachment sites occupy only a portion of an inner surface of the thermoplastic tubular liner; and electrically connecting a conductive element located within an interior of the lead body to the electrode of the tubular electrode sub-assembly.","The principles described herein are applicable to all types of medical electrical leads. For example, the disclosure applies to cardiovascular leads (e.g. high voltage leads, low voltage leads etc.), neurological leads, or other suitable applications. Also, although described with respect to coiled electrodes, other electrode configurations may alternatively be used.","In the following detailed description, reference is made to the accompanying figures of the drawing which form a part hereof, and in which are shown, by way of illustration, specific embodiments. It is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and structural changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present disclosure.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","104","102","105","106","100","106","106","100","100","108","107","106","106","108","100"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["106","106","117","105","107","117","101","112","112","112","112","104","122","112","104","112","107","112","103","106","112","105","118","112","105","120"],"i":["a","d","a","d ","a","d","a","d","a","d ","c ","a,b ","a,b ","d ","c "]},"Electrically conductive elements that extend along the length of the lead  can include coils, wires, coil wound around a filament, cables, conductors or other suitable members. Conductive elements can include platinum, platinum alloys, titanium, titanium alloys, tantalum, tantalum alloys, cobalt alloys (e.g. MP35N, a nickel-cobalt alloy etc.), copper alloys, silver alloys, gold, silver, stainless steel, magnesium-nickel alloys, palladium, palladium alloys or other suitable materials. The electrically conductive elements are typically covered, or substantially covered, longitudinally with a jacket. In yet another embodiment, each conductive element within the lead body  is surrounded by a tubular element within the jacket, which can possess a circular or a non-circular cross-section. Any or all of the components within the lead body  can exhibit a non-circular cross-section.","Typically, the outer surface of electrodes  such as the ring electrode , the tip electrode , and the defibrillation electrodes are exposed or not covered by a jacket or liner so that electrodes  can sense and\/or deliver electrical stimuli to tissue of a patient. A sharpened distal tip (not shown) of tip electrode  may facilitate fixation of the distal end of helically shaped tip electrode  into tissue of a patient.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIGS. 3A and 3B","FIG. 3A","FIG. 3B"],"b":["117","112","112","117","130","140","130","112","112","117","112","112","130","140"],"i":["a ","c ","b ","d ","b ","d "]},"Among the electrodes , some of the electrodes, such as defibrillation electrodes and , may be provided in the form of coiled electrodes that form a helix, while other electrodes may be provided in different forms. Further, some of the electrodes  may be provided in the form of tubular electrode sub-assemblies that can be pre-fabricated and positioned over an existing lead body, where they are attached and where electrical connections with conductive elements within the lead body  can be made.","An example of one such tubular electrode sub-assembly  is depicted in , where the tubular electrode sub-assembly  is positioned over a portion of a lead body . The tubular electrode sub-assembly  includes a tubular liner  and electrode  embedded in the outer surface  of the tubular liner . The electrode  is preferably embedded in the outer surface  of the tubular liner  to a depth that is sufficient to mechanically couple the electrode  to the tubular liner . At least a portion of the outer surface  of the electrode  is exposed proximate the outer surface  of the tubular liner  such that the electrode  can be placed in electrical communication with tissue and\/or fluids surrounding the tubular electrode sub-assembly .","Another optional feature depicted in  is that the lead body  may be constructed with a variable diameter such that the area in which the tubular electrode sub-assembly  is positioned has a reduced size as compared to other portions of the lead body . For example, the lead body  may include a shoulder  as seen in  where the size of the lead body  decreases. The diameter of the lead body  may be increased on the opposite end of the tubular electrode sub-assembly  by optionally including a sleeve  or other structure to increase the size of the lead. Such a construction can be used to provide an isodiametric lead, although other constructions could also be used to compensate for the thickness of the tubular electrode sub-assembly .","The electrode  may, in some embodiments, be formed in the shape of a coil with one or more wraps or coils and using a wire element having a rectangular cross-section as depicted in , although coiled electrodes in other embodiments may be formed using wire elements having any selected shape (e.g., round, oval, elliptical, etc.)","The tubular liner  may be located between the electrode  and the underlying structure of the lead body  over a majority of the inner surface  of the tubular liner . Exceptions to this may occur where, for example, the electrode is connected to a conductive element extending through the lead body . That electrical connection may be made by a variety of techniques, with at least some potentially suitable connection techniques being described in US Patent Application Publication Nos. US 2005\/0240252 (Boser et al.); US 2005\/0113898 (Honeck et al.); etc.","The tubular liner  may alternatively be characterized as preventing contact between the inner surface of the electrode and the underlying structure of the lead body  (except where electrical connections may need to be made as described above).","In yet another manner of characterizing the relationship between the tubular liner  and the electrode  in some embodiments, the tubular liner  can be described as optionally having a liner thickness measured radially from the longitudinal axis  between the inner surface  and the outer surface  of the tubular liner . The electrode  can be described as having an electrode thickness that is measured radially from the longitudinal axis . Further, the liner thickness may be greater than the electrode thickness in some embodiments (as depicted, e.g., in ).","The tubular liner  includes an inner surface  that faces the underlying structure of the lead body . The tubular electrode sub-assembly  is preferably attached to underlying structure of the lead body  at one or more selected attachment sites. As discussed herein, the one or more selected attachment sites preferably occupy only a portion of the inner surface \u2014in some embodiments, the selected attachment sites may be described as occupying no more than about 50% of the inner surface  of the tubular liner . By limiting the surface area of attachment between the tubular electrode sub-assembly  and the underlying structure of the lead body , flexibility of the lead may be improved as compared to a lead in which the entire tubular electrode sub-assembly  was attached to the underlying structure of the lead body .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIGS. 6A-6C","FIGS. 6A-6C"],"b":["250","217"]},"In , the tubular electrode sub-assembly  may be attached at its proximal end  and its distal end  by selected attachment sites  that may be in the form of rings around the tubular electrode sub-assembly . Although the selected attachment sites  at the proximal and distal ends are depicted as continuous rings, they may be provided in any other form, e.g., a group of discrete attachment sites that are arranged around the periphery of the tubular electrode sub-assembly  such that a ring structure is formed, etc.","The set of selected attachment sites depicted in  may also optionally include one or more intermediate selected attachment sites  positioned between the proximal end  and the distal end  of the tubular electrode sub-assembly . Such an intermediate selected attachment site  may be provided in combination with attachment sites  at the ends of the tubular electrode sub-assembly  or one or more intermediate selected attachment sites  may be provided in the absence of attachment sites at the ends of the tubular electrode sub-assembly .","One potential alternative arrangement of selected attachment sites is depicted in  in which a selected attachment site  in the form of a line is depicted in combination with selected attachment sites  at the ends of the tubular electrode sub-assembly . Although depicted as a straight line that extends from the proximal end  to the distal end  of the tubular electrode sub-assembly  and that is aligned with the longitudinal axis , the line  may be shorter and\/or the line  may not be aligned with the longitudinal axis . Further, the attachment site  may be provided in combination with attachment sites  at the ends of the tubular electrode sub-assembly  (as depicted) or one or more such lines may be provided in the absence of attachment sites at the ends of the tubular electrode sub-assembly .","Another potential alternative arrangement of selected attachment sites is depicted in  in which a selected attachment site  is provided in the form of a helix that extends around the tubular electrode sub-assembly  and proceeds along its length between the proximal end  and the distal end . Although the selected attachment site  is depicted as a continuous structure, it may be provided in any other form, e.g., a group of discrete attachment sites that are arranged around and along the tubular electrode sub-assembly  such that a helical structure is formed, etc. Additional selected attachment sites may also be provided in combination with a helical selected attachment site .","In still another alternative, limiting the area occupied by the attachment sites between the tubular electrode sub-assembly  and the underlying structure of the lead body may not be used if, for example, the tubular electrode sub-assembly  is attached to the underlying structure of the lead body by an attachment agent that has a lower modulus than the material used to construct the liner  of the tubular electrode sub-assembly . For example, using a silicone medical adhesive to attach the inner surface of the liner  to the underlying structure of the lead body  may provide sufficient compliance to provide enhanced flexibility in the lead such that the attachment agent (e.g., silicone adhesive, etc.) may occupy more than about 50% of the surface are occupied by the tubular electrode sub-assembly . In some embodiments, the attachment agent may be provided over substantially all of the interface between the inner surface of the liner  and the underlying structure of the lead body .","As discussed herein, the electrode  is embedded in the outer surface  of the tubular liner . One potential method for manufacturing a tubular electrode sub-assembly having such a construction is depicted and will be described in connection with , which is a sectional view of the process.","The embedment process may preferably be accomplished within a containment cavity formed in a containment structure . The containment structure  may be provided in any suitable form such as a mold, a tube, etc., that is capable of providing a cavity that can contain the tubular electrode sub-assembly  during the manufacturing process described herein.","In the depicted method, a tubular liner  is provided within the interior of an electrode  which may, optionally, be a coiled electrode. Both the tubular liner  and the electrode  are located within a cavity of the containment structure , where the cavity is defined by the inner surface  of the containment structure . The exact order in which the components are placed in the containment cavity may not be important, so long as all of the components can be accurately placed within the containment cavity, for example, the electrode  may be placed in the containment structure  first, with the tubular liner  being inserted after the electrode . In one potential alternative, the electrode  may be placed over the outer surface  of the tubular liner  before the electrode and the tubular liner  are placed in the containment structure  as an assembly. Regardless of the order of placement, the end result has the electrode  located between the outer surface  of the liner  and the inner surface  of the containment structure .","With the components in place, the liner  may be expanded such that the electrode  is compressed between the outer surface  of the liner  and inner surface  of the containment cavity. The expansion may be accomplished by any suitable technique or combination of techniques, e.g., mechanically, pneumatically, hydraulically, etc. that is capable of providing pressure on the liner  radially outward from the interior of the liner . In some embodiments, the pressure may be uniformly applied to the entire inner surface  of the liner , although this may or may not be required.","In one embodiment, the expansion may be accomplished by introducing an inflation fluid into the interior of the tubular liner  such that the coiled electrode  is compressed between the outer surface  of the liner  and the inner surface  of the containment structure . One end of the tubular liner  may preferably be sealed to prevent the flow of fluid out of the tubular liner , e.g., a plug  is inserted into one end of the tubular liner , the liner  may be clamped off, etc. At the same time, the tubular liner  is also heated such that the internal pressure forces the material of the liner to flow around and at least partially embed the electrode  in the outer surface  of the liner  (see, e.g., ). The heating and inflation may be accomplished by introducing a heated inflation fluid into the liner . Potentially suitable inflation fluids may include air, carbon dioxide, and other gases, as well as liquids such as, e.g., water, oil, etc. In some instances, the inflation fluid may be provided in a bladder or other containment vessel to reduce or prevent contamination of the tubular electrode sub-assembly  by the inflation fluid.","In some methods, the inner surface  of the containment structure  may be heated to enhance the embedment process.","The containment structure  may optionally include or be composed of compliant material  along the inner surface  of the containment structure that can conform to the outer surface of the electrode . Such compliant material  may seal off or mask at least a portion of the outer surface of the electrode  during the embedment process. This may be useful if, e.g., the electrode  is made using rounded wires or elements, rectangular wires or elements, etc.","The compliant material is selected to seal off and prevent the thermoplastic material from coating the intended exposed surface of the electrode assembly. Examples include, but are not limited to, silicones, fluoropolymers, and fluoroelastomers. For example, such materials include low consistency silicones (e.g., those available under the trade designations MED-4719 or MED-4755 from NuSil), liquid silicone rubber (LSR) (such as Dow Corning's Q7-4850 or NuSil's MED-4850), Dyneon's THV (a polymer of tetrafluoroethylene, hexafluoropropylene and vinylidene fluoride), Daikin's T-530 fluoroelastomer. Specific types of silicones may be more appropriate if features need to be molded in (i.e. an LSR molding grade of silicone could be used), or if non-planar contours, shapes, or fine features need to be sealed-off (i.e., a lower durometer silicone could be used).","It is desirable that the compliant material be stable when subjected to the processing temperatures and not adhere to the thermoplastic material. For instance, a relatively low durometer silicone tubing or silicone mold insert can be used to comply to the electrode surface with pressure and effectively seal-off from ingress of the thermoplastic material. Alternatively, a fluoroelastomer such as Dyneon's THV or Daikin's T-530 could be used. A variation would include heat-shrink fluoropolymer tubing such as fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP), ethylene tetrafluoroethylene (ETFE), or polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) to seal-off and define the electrode assembly outer diameter, i.e., this would be contained within the mold cavity, oven, or other equipment to provide the necessary heat to flow the thermoplastic material.","The conditions under which the embedment is accomplished will vary based on a variety of factors such as, e.g., the composition of the liner, the thickness and size of the liner, the dimensions of the electrode, the time over which the pressure and\/or heat are applied, etc. In some embodiments, the expansion device (e.g., expandable tube, inflation fluid, etc.) may be heated to a temperature that approaches the melting temperature of the materials used to form the liner or to some other temperature at which the liner material can reflow such that the electrode can be embedded as described herein. If, for example, the liner  is constructed of a polyurethane silicone copolymer, suitable temperatures for an inflation fluid may range from about 150 to about 250 degrees Celsius at pressures that may range from about 30 to about 100 psi.","After the embedment process is complete, the tubular electrode sub-assembly can be removed from the containment structure  and processed such that it is in condition to be placed over a lead body as depicted in  and attached thereto in one or more selected attachment sites as described herein. Such processing to prepare the tubular electrode sub-assembly  for attachment to a lead body  may include, trimming the tubular electrode sub-assembly  to a selected length, preparing the ends or other portions of the coiled electrode for attachment to a conductive element within the lead body , etc.","Attachment of the tubular electrode sub-assembly  to a lead body  may be accomplished using any suitable technique or combination of techniques. In some embodiments, the tubular electrode sub-assembly  may be attached to the lead body  by welding the material of the liner  to the lead body . Such welding may be performed using any suitable technique or combination of techniques, e.g., ultrasonically, thermally, chemically (using, e.g., solvents), etc.","Another potential technique for providing the selected attachment sites between the tubular electrode sub-assembly  and the lead body  may be through the use of adhesive. Exemplary adhesive may include silicones, urethanes, flouropolymers etc. The adhesives could include those activated via thermal, UV light, chemical, moisture, and solvent-based methods.","Another potentially optional process that may be used is to backfill or overcoat the tubular electrode sub-assembly  before and\/or after positioning it on a medical electrical lead with a hardenable organic polymeric material that has a relatively low modulus (i.e., low stiffness, low durometer) for good flexibility of the final assembly, and has a relatively low viscosity (e.g., \u201cpre-cure\u201d viscosity) for good mold-filling properties. The material used to backfill may be a thermoset or a thermoplastic material. Examples include silicones, polyimides, epoxies, polyurethanes, polyurethanes with surface-modifying end groups (SME), polyurethane silicone block copolymers (e.g., a thermoplastic silicone polyether urethane available under the designation PurSil), ethylene tetrafluoroethylene (ETFE), polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), polyvinylidine difluoride (PVDF), Dyneon's THV (a polymer of tetrafluoroethylene, hexafluoropropylene and vinylidene fluoride), Daikin's T-530 fluoroelastomer, and other fluoropolymers and fluoropolymer elastomers, polyethylenes, and polyesters.","The materials used to form the tubular liners of the tubular electrode sub-assemblies may be selected from a wide variety of thermoplastic materials that have a relatively low modulus (i.e., low stiffness, low durometer) for good flexibility of the final assembly, and has a relatively low viscosity for good mold-filling properties. Examples include polyurethanes, polyurethanes with surface-modifying end groups (SME), polyurethane silicone block copolymers (e.g., a thermoplastic silicone polyether urethane available under the designation PurSil), fluoropolymers and fluoroelastomers (including ethylene tetrafluoroethylene (ETFE), polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), polyvinylidine difluoride (PVDF), Dyneon's THV (a polymer of tetrafluoroethylene, hexafluoropropylene and vinylidene fluoride), Daikin's T-530 fluoroelastomer, and other fluoropolymers and fluoroelastomers), polyethylenes, and polyesters. Note that e-beam irradiated ETFE or other fluoropolymers and fluoroelastomers are referred to herein as \u201cthermoplastics\u201d although they cannot be reflowed with heat after crosslinking. In some embodiments, a thermoplastic material, such as polyurethane silicone block copolymers (such as PurSil silicone polyether urethane), a polyurethane, a polyurethane with surface-modifying end groups, and ETFE), can be used for the tubular liner.","Fabrication of an electrode assembly using a thermoplastic material typically involves the simultaneous application of heat and pressure to cause the material to flow and fill the void spaces. The conditions needed (e.g., time, temperature, pressure), depend on the selection of the material and can be readily determined by one of skill in the art. For example, the temperature is related to the melt flow index of the material and has to be sufficient enough to flow the material adequately with the pressure applied. Increasing the temperature increases the fluidity (i.e., decreases viscosity) of the material and allows it to flow easier, as does increasing pressure.","The electrodes used in the tubular electrode assemblies may be selected from a wide variety of electrically conductive biocompatible materials (including, but not limited to, titanium, stainless steel, tantalum, platinum, etc. and combinations thereof (e.g., platinum-iridium clad tantalum, etc.)) that can be formed to take on any selected shape, e.g., a coiled helical shape, etc.","The words \u201cpreferred\u201d and \u201cpreferably\u201d refer to embodiments that may afford certain benefits, under certain circumstances. However, other embodiments may also be preferred, under the same or other circumstances. Furthermore, the recitation of one or more preferred embodiments does not imply that other embodiments are not useful, and is not intended to exclude other embodiments from the scope of the disclosure.","As used herein, \u201ca,\u201d \u201can,\u201d \u201cthe,\u201d \u201cat least one,\u201d and \u201cone or more\u201d are used interchangeably. Thus, for example, a leg clamp may refer to one or more leg clamps unless otherwise indicated.","The term \u201cand\/or\u201d means one or all of the listed elements or a combination of any two or more of the listed elements.","The complete disclosure of the patents, patent documents, and publications identified herein are incorporated by reference in their entirety as if each were individually incorporated.","The description of the invention is merely exemplary in nature and, thus, variations that do not depart from the gist of the invention are intended to be within the scope of the invention.
