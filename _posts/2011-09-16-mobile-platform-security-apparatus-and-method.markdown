Field","This disclosure relates to a technology for protecting a mobile communication terminal from an abnormal or unintentional operation of an application program installed on a platform of the mobile communication terminal.","2. Discussion of the Background","Generally, a platform refers to a system environment that allows an application program to be executed. Recently, an open platform has been developed to provide users with various services for user convenience as well as profitability for various application developers providing these services.","If a number of developers upload applications, which may be developed in accordance with the open standard, on web sites providing similar features as the Apple\u00ae App Store, users may be provided with various applications and services that may be conveniently downloaded and installed at a small or no cost to the user.","This open service environment may provide users with access to various services and applications as described above. However, the open service environment may be disadvantageous in that it may be open to a risk of data leakage of personal user data, virus infection, and fatal system errors that may be caused by malicious applications.","In other words, since an application may be designed to call an open platform application programming interface (API) in an open service environment, various problems may arise, such as data leakage of users, abnormal charging, and the like. For example, a user may install an application, which the user may believe to simply provide an alarm function. However, during use or after installation, the application may obtain a user's phonebook list by calling a platform API accessible to a user phonebook without the user's knowledge, and when a platform API that permits the use of a network is called, phonebook data may be leaked.","Exemplary embodiments of the present invention provide a mobile platform security apparatus and method.","Additional features of the invention will be set forth in the description which follows, and in part will be apparent from the description, or may be learned by practice of the invention.","Exemplary embodiments of the present invention provide an authentication key generating unit to generate a first authentication key, a second authentication key, and a third authentication key corresponding to a function called by an application program; a first storage unit to store the first authentication key and an identifier to identify the application program; a second storage unit to store the second authentication key and the identifier; and an authentication information registering unit to register the third authentication key and the identifier as a function parameter in the application program.","Exemplary embodiments of the present invention provide a mobile platform security method using a non-transitory processor for authenticating a function of an application program in a mobile communication terminal, the method including generating a first authentication key, a second authentication key, and a third authentication key corresponding to a function called by an application program; storing the first authentication key and an identifier for identifying the application program in a first storage unit; storing the second authentication key and the identifier in a secret domain of a second storage unit; and registering the third authentication key and the identifier as a function parameter in the application program.","Exemplary embodiments of the present invention provide a mobile platform security method using a non-transitory processor for authenticating a function of an application program in a mobile communication terminal, the method including generating a first authentication key, a second authentication key, and a third authentication key, corresponding to a function called by an application program; registering the third authentication key and the identifier as a function parameter in the application program; comparing the authentication keys; and permitting access to the called function if the three authentication keys correspond to one another, and denying access to the called function if the three authentication keys do not correspond to one another.","It is to be understood that both foregoing general descriptions and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory and are intended to provide further explanation of the invention as claimed. Other features and aspects will be apparent from the following detailed description, the drawings, and the claims.","The invention is described more fully hereinafter with references to the accompanying drawings, in which exemplary embodiments of the invention are shown.

The application program  installed on the platform  may be created or programmed using an application programming interface (API) provided by the platform .","The API may be a set of subroutines or functions that an application program may call to perform processing on an operating system (OS). In addition, the API may also refer to a set of functions defining a functionality of the OS and a method for using that functionality.","Accordingly, the application program , developed in accordance with a reference standard of the platform , may be operated regardless of an OS . That is, the application program  may access and execute a function on a file or a data domain managed by the OS  through API calling of the platform .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},"Referring to , the mobile platform security apparatus  may be made in a platform core of a mobile platform installed in a mobile communication terminal and the like. The mobile platform security apparatus  may limit or prevent the execution of a function or operation not authenticated by a user if a reference application program performs a plurality of functionalities. For example, the mobile platform security apparatus  may prevent an application program, which may simply provide an alarm function in a mobile communication terminal, from calling or accessing an API accessible to a phonebook and\/or from reading or leaking phonebook data.","Referring again to , the mobile platform security apparatus  includes an authentication key generating unit , a first storage unit , a second storage unit , an authentication information registering unit , and an authentication processing unit .

The function called by the application program  may represent a functionality of the application program , and the called function may be a function of the platform API . As shown in , if a function_a and a function_b are called during execution of APP_X, the function_a and the function_b may each refer to a functionality of the APP_X.","Accordingly, three authentication keys may be generated for each function of the platform API . According to aspects of the invention, if APP_X is installed, the authentication key generating unit  may analyze a code of the APP_X to determine that function_a and function_b are being called. Accordingly, the authentication key generating unit  may generate authentication keys, K, K, and K, corresponding to the function_a and authentication keys, K, K, and K, corresponding to the function_b.","Further, without limitation, three authentication keys may also be generated if an application program is installed or if a user makes a selection through an option menu. The authentication key may be an arbitrary number, an arbitrary symbol, and\/or combination thereof. According to aspects of the invention, a set of three authentication keys may be independently generated for each functionality or for each function, not to be overlapped with an authentication key used to call other functions. Also, the three authentication keys may be generated such that the three authentication keys have the same or similar values, so that the first authentication key, the second authentication key, and the third authentication key may have the same or similar values. Further, the three authentication keys may be generated such that the three authentication keys have different values, based on an authentication method of the authentication processing unit .","The first storage unit  may store an identifier of the application program and the first authentication key among the three authentication keys. According to aspects of the invention, the first storage unit  may be a file system, a system memory, or the like.","The second storage unit  may store the identifier of the application program and the second authentication key among the three authentication keys in a secret domain. According to aspects of the invention, the second storage unit  may be a system memory or other suitable secret domains. The second storage unit  may be used to prevent duplication and destruction of the first storage unit , and modification of the first authentication key.","Although the first storage unit  and the second storage unit  are illustrated in  as a feature of the mobile platform security apparatus , aspects are not limited thereto such that the first storage unit  and the second storage unit  may be external to the mobile platform security apparatus  and\/or accessible via a wired and\/or wireless communication network.","Also, the secret domain of the second storage unit  may be domain accessible, meaning that the data stored in the secret domain may be read and new data may be written, by at least one of the authentication key generating unit  and\/or the authentication processing unit . In addition, according to aspects of the invention, the secret domain of the second storage unit  may be domain accessible only by the authentication key generating unit  or the authentication processing unit .","The identifier and the first authentication key stored in the first storage unit  may be accessed by at least one of the authentication key generating unit  and\/or the authentication processing unit . In addition, according to aspects of the invention, the first storage unit  may be accessible only by the authentication key generating unit  or the authentication processing unit .","As shown in , the identifier of the application program is represented as APP_X, APP_Y, and the like. However, the representations of an identifier of the application programs are not limited to these examples.","For example, the identifier of the application program may also be a name of the application program, root directory of the application program, or the like. The generated authentication keys and the identifiers of the application program may be matched to correspond to each other and may be stored in the first storage unit  or the second storage unit  in a table form.","The authentication information registering unit  may register a third authentication key among three authentication keys and the identifier of the application program as a function parameter in the application program.","The authentication information registering unit  may record the generated third authentication key and the identifier of the application program in a reference data domain related to a code domain where the application program may be installed.","If the generated third authentication key and the identifier of the application program are added to the function parameter by the authentication information registering unit , the application program may call a function of the platform API  using the function parameter, including the generated third authentication key and the identifier of the application program.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":"220"},"Referring to , a table  stores an identifier of an application program  column, a function column, and a first authentication key  column.

Also, an additional domain  and an additional domain  may each represent the third authentication key (e.g., K, K, K, K) and the identifier of the application program (e.g., APP_X, APP_Y) registered as the function parameter. As described above, the authentication information registering unit  may register the third generated authentication key and the identifier of the application program in a reference data domain related to a code domain where the application program may be installed. Further, since the name of the application program may be determined using a return address of an API call, the identifier of the application program may also be registered by storing a location of the application program code during installation of the application program.","If a reference function is called by the application program, the authentication processing unit  may retrieve the third authentication key and the identifier included in the function parameter included in the application program, and determine whether the first authentication key and the second authentication key correspond with the third authentication key and\/or the identifier to authenticate the function called by the application program. If the first authentication key and the second authentication key correspond to the third authentication key and\/or the identifier, then the function called by the application program may be authenticated.
