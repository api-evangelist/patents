{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATION","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7119(e) of U.S. Provisional Application 60\/376,572 filed on Apr. 30, 2002, the entire contents of which are herein incorporated by reference.","The present invention relates to power sequencing, diagnostics and prognostics health monitoring of fault tolerant digital power conversion, distribution and load management systems. In particular, embodiments of the present invention provide modes of command\/control and methods of fault tolerant operation for coordinating digital protection functions, diagnostics and health monitoring of such systems based on start-up and continuous tests, comprehensive power sequencing for achieving Soft-start, Soft-stop, ride-through and for responding to power system contingencies such as shoot-through, voltage surge, under-voltage, voltage sag, system imbalance, system under\/over-frequency, over-load, critical component junction temperature and thermal management under\/over-temperature and wrong phase sequence conditions.","There are many components, devices, equipment and systems required to make up an electrical power conversion and distribution system and many such power-electronics based systems have been developed and used in the prior art for numerous different applications, including motor controls. Usually a command is received either manually or automatically and one or more control objectives are achieved, regulated and maintained through sensing related controlled system parameters. Appropriate control decisions are typically made in a closed-loop or feed-forward fashion through a digital or analog controller to control power-electronics based switches such as SCRs, MOSFETs, IGBTs, Intelligent Power Modules, etc. For example, a power electronics based motor controllers typically include the following main subassemblies\/functions:\n\n","Although electrical power conversion and distribution systems have been developed, these power conversion technologies can not presently be effectively used for mission critical \u201cmore electric\u201d future applications (e.g., land, sea, air transport) due to the harsh operating environments and conditions resulting in very low Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) of the main components and very limited integrated protection coordination, diagnostics and monitoring to improve overall system health and reliability.","Much work has been directed toward improving the overall health and reliability of power control systems. In particular, U.S. Pat. No. 6,122,575 discloses a system, method, and computer program to assist a technician in troubleshooting an aircraft auxiliary power unit (APU). A portable computer is capable of downloading the fault data captured in a memory of the electric control unit (ECU). The fault data corresponds to one or more instances of APU failure. The computer is further programmed to compare the fault data to predetermined fault patterns stored in a database. Each record of the database has one of the fault patterns, a corresponding fault indication, and a corresponding service recommendation indication. The computer is further programmed so that when a record in which the fault pattern matches the fault data is found, the corresponding fault indication and service recommendation are retrieved from the database and provided to the technician via the computer's display or other suitable output mechanism.","Although the foregoing system provides enhanced information regarding service recommendations, the analysis is performed offline based only on past faults recorded. Therefore, this system does not provide any forward-looking analysis of potential failures or real time analysis of component health. Further, the system disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,122,575 does not address component level critical devices, but only looks at the system at a subsystem level (e.g., APU). Furthermore, such a prior art health monitoring and diagnostics system does not address low MTBF and poor reliability of power-electronics based systems because the failure modes are not mitigated thoroughly, both at the system level and component level. Such conventional systems are not fault tolerant and due to limited Built-In-Tests (BIT) their proper operation can not be assessed at start-up or continuously monitored during normal or abnormal operation. Furthermore, lack of proper power sequencing, Soft-start, Soft-stop, ride-through, and proper protection against contingencies such as voltage-sag, voltage surge, system imbalance, under\/over-frequency, over-load, over-temperature and wrong phase sequence conditions results in very stressful situations which usually degrade or cause total failure of major components of the system. Other limitations of prior art systems include the following:\n\n","In accordance with the present invention, certain deficiencies in prior systems are overcome by providing a method and apparatus for implementing fault tolerant power control sequencing of power electronics based systems. In particular, some advantageous embodiments described herein include:\n\n","Aspects of the invention are more specifically set forth in the accompanying description with reference to the appended Figures.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0053"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","10","20","30","40","60","70","80","84","86","90","95","95","90"]},"Operation of and functional interaction between the components illustrated in  will become apparent from the following discussion. Although the various components of  are illustrated as discrete elements, such an illustration is for ease of explanation and it should be recognized that certain operations of the various components may be performed in the same physical device, e.g., in one or more digital signal processing (DSP), ASIC, FPGA, . . . , units or digital\/analog controllers, or distributed among multiple devices. Generally, the system illustrated in  provides power to a load(s) while performing and coordinating various protection, diagnostic, and health monitoring functions of the fault tolerant power system. The system of  controls transition between a plurality of operating modes, which together mitigate fault conditions and improve the ability to safely and efficiently operate despite the occurrence of power system contingencies such as shoot-through, voltage surge, under-voltage, voltage sag, system imbalance, system under\/over-frequency, over-load, critical component junction temperature and thermal management under\/over-temperature and wrong phase sequence conditions. At least five distinct modes of operation are achieved and integrated with the overall system for prognostic health monitoring and diagnostics according to embodiments of the present invention, including: STOP\/READY mode; STANDBY mode; RUN mode; FAULT mode; and ALARM mode, which will each be described below, to achieve a fault tolerant power electronics based system.","The system  illustrated in  is suitable for control sequencing and prognostics health monitoring of a synchronous and bi-directional variable frequency power conversion system, such as that described in the co-pending application filed on Apr. 1, 2003, and titled \u201cSYNCHRONOUS AND BI-DIRECTIONAL VARIABLE FREQUENCY POWER CONVERSION SYSTEMS,\u201d which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. In other words, PELM  may be implemented as including the power-conversion system described in this co-pending application. It should be recognized, however, that applicability of the present invention is not limited to such a power conversion system and instead generally extends to a variety of power electronics-based systems. In the following description, an exemplary embodiment is described with reference to characteristics of a power conversion system that utilizes active switching components for power rectification\/inversion in a multi-phase AC input\/output power environment, such as those components described in the above-referenced co-pending application, which rely on active switching for AC-DC; DC-AC; or AC-DC-AC power conversion. Thus, the exemplary embodiment presented below refers to certain control signals of such a system, including CB_ON (which is at a HIGH level when a circuit breaker between the power conversion system and the load is turned on), SS_ON (which is at a HIGH level when a Soft-start operation is completed), and PWM-Enable (which is HIGH when the gating pattern which controls the active switches of the power electronics are operating to rectify\/invert input power in accordance with a pulse width modulated switch gating signal). Such a description is not intended to limit the scope of the present application to such a power conversion system\/environment.","The DMU  includes the following sub-components: an outside command\/data unit ; a synthesized measured data unit ; a major component system data unit ; and an internal system data unit . The outside command\/data unit  receives commands and data from, and outputs data such as critical system parameters, system status indicators, alarm indicators, and fault indicators, to the operator interface  and\/or a higher level PHM and control device .","As described in greater detail below, the system  illustrated in  performs diagnostics and health monitoring of power electronics components based on both instantaneous measurement values as well as measurement value trends (including e.g., rms system voltages and currents, rates of temperature change, etc.). Accordingly, the decision making center  relies in part on synthesized\/refined measurement values. The synthesized measured data unit  synthesizes measurement values and stores the results of such synthesis to enable trend analysis. As known by those skilled in the art, manufacturers of electrical components (e.g., IGBTs, SCRs, MOSFETs, capacitors, filters, etc.) typically provide data regarding the operating envelopes, MTBF, allowable temperature, etc., of the devices and limits for usage beyond the operating envelope. Further, manufacturers, industry groups, and technical groups may provide information regarding the expected reduction to usable component life based upon certain operating conditions. This data may be provided both for individual components as well as for subsystems. The major component system data unit  stores such information, which, as described below, may be utilized by the DMC  to perform and enhance prognostics, diagnostics, and protection of components. Furthermore, diagnostics and health monitoring in accordance with embodiments of the present invention can identify conditions and characteristics of system components as a function of various operating condition\/modes so as to update\/supplement the data stored in the major component system data .","Still further, the prognostic, diagnostic, and protection functions performed under control of the DMC  generate data relating to out-of-range conditions, trend violations, etc., which serves as historical data that can subsequently be accessed to estimate future life\/reliability of electronic components\/subsystems. For example, such historical data may indicate magnitude, frequency, and duration of an out-of-range condition for a critical component (e.g., IGBT) and may be accessed to estimate the future life\/reliability of the component. According to the present invention, such generated data is stored in the internal system data unit  of the DMU . The internal system data unit  is preferably non-volatile memory for recording the history of diagnostics and health monitoring with the capability of remote access for command\/control and inspection\/intervention. The data storage unit  is provided to store measurement values (e.g., raw measurement values from the data measuring unit  to be subsequently refined\/synthesized) as well as historical data, from recorded field or other system\/component operation situations, beyond the storage capacity of the internal system data unit . Further aspects of the elements of system  illustrated in  will become apparent by the following description of the operation and functional interaction between the system components with reference to the flow diagrams of  and the operator interface illustrations of .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0059"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["20","20","100","210","212","20","20","100"]},"If the DMC  determines that the system is not ready, e.g., based on a lack of logic power supply or lack of internal\/external communication, this problem is communicated, if possible, to the operator interface  via the outside command\/data unit  of the DMU  (S). Furthermore, data indicating the particular problem is sent to the internal system data unit  of the DMU  (S). In other words, depending on the condition identified, a FAULT or ALARM flag may be set. Thus, the system may transition from the STOP\/READY mode to a FAULT or ALARM mode. Next, the system  returns to S.","When the DMC  determines at S that the system is ready, the DMC  transitions to STANDBY mode (S) and next determines whether an enable signal has been received from the operator interface  or the higher level PHM and control unit  (S). If the state of the enable signal is LOW, operation of the DMC  returns to step S (i.e., operation stays in the STANDBY mode). During STANDBY, a continuous built-in test (C-BIT) is used to continuously update and communicate the health of the system . Thus, the system may transition from STANDBY mode to a FAULT mode or an ALARM mode, to update appropriate flags and communicate to the operator interface , and back to the STANDBY mode. If the enable signal is HIGH, the DMC  initiates a series of control\/power sequencing, diagnostics, protection and prognostics health monitoring sub-routines. More specifically, the DMC  initiates a DMU sub-routine (S), a protection sub-routine (S), a power sequencing sub-routine (S), a power electronics load management sub-routine (S), and a prognostics health monitoring and diagnostics sub-routine (S). These individual sub-routines will next be described with reference to .","In accordance with the DMU sub-routine illustrated in , the DMU  polls the external operator interface  and the higher level PHM and control unit  via the outside command\/data unit  (S). For example, the DMU  may receive stop\/start command from the operator interface . Furthermore, the DMU  receives measured data, e.g., current, voltage, temperature, etc., directly from the data measuring unit  and\/or from the data storage unit  (S). The synthesized measured data unit  of the DMU  synthesizes\/refines measurement values (S) and the DMU  stores critical system data in the internal system data unit  (S). By way of example, the synthesized measured data unit  may calculate rms system voltage and current, under\/over frequency, power overload, power factor, rate of rise and fall of critical system parameters (di\/dt or dv\/dt, etc.), Total Harmonic Distortion (THD), individual harmonic components of the system voltages and currents, degree of system unbalance and variation in the systems symmetrical components (positive, negative and zero sequence components), system efficiency and its variation over-time for the same operational modes, degree of meeting system regulation objectives, etc. Furthermore, the DMU  provides the DMC  with synthesized and critical system data for PHMD, examples of which are discussed herein (S). This data may include major component system data (e.g., component MTBF, operating envelopes, etc.) accessed from the major system component unit if the DMU  also receives PHMD data from the DMC  so that such data may be stored in the internal system data unit  as historical data (S) and communicated to the operator interface  and\/or the higher level PHM and control unit  (S). This completes the DMU sub-routine, and operation flow returns to S of  (S).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0063"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 2"],"b":["40","224","60","40","20","40","95","90","410","40","412","40","40","20","414","20","84","86","416","20","418","20","420","420","420","422","428"]},"With reference again to , when the determination at S is that no action is required based on direct measured data from the controlled load  and the PELM , the protection unit  accesses additional information from the DMC  (S) and determines whether a fault condition exists (S). For example, the DMC  may indicate a FAULT condition based on synthesized measurement data. If yes, the operation of the protection unit  moves to S (clear PWM_ENABLE). If the determination at S is that there is no fault, the protection unit  clears all fault flags (S) and determines whether an ALARM condition has occurred (S). An alarm condition occurs when one or more conditions are detected which are close to boundaries of safe operation. Upon detecting such alarm conditions, the user interface  and\/or higher level PHM and control unit  are cautioned\/notified and correction actions\/interventions may be taken to maintain the health of the system by closely monitoring and predicting alarm conditions, thus preventing escalation of the problem to a more severe one which may result in a global fault or jeopardize the overall system\/unit safety. If the protection unit  determines that an ALARM condition exists, a global alarm flag is set (S) and an alarm flag table is updated (S). If, however, no alarm condition exists, all alarm flags are cleared (S). This completes the protection sub-routine, and operation flow returns to S of  (S).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0065"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 2"],"b":["80","226","80","10","20","510","80","512","514","80","512","516"]},"If the power sequencing unit  determines at S that no global fault condition exists, it determines the state of the ENABLE signal from the operator interface  or the higher PHM control unit  (S). If the ENABLE signal is LOW, the power sequencing unit  initiates a Soft-stop operation of S. The main purpose of a Soft-stop is to prevent electrical transients which may be imposed on major system components as a result of interrupting operation and quickly transitioning to a STOP\/READY mode. Some physical quantities such as speed of an electromechanical system, voltage across a capacitor, current through an inductor, etc. can not be reduced to zero without proper Soft-stop mitigation methods. For example, in the case of a controlled electromechanical system, a dynamic brake is required to dissipate the stored energy in a machine before it can be brought to a stop quickly. A Soft-stop technique in accordance with an exemplary implementation of the present invention would allow the use of a dynamic brake or allow bi-directional flow of energy to the DC link and back to the AC system, as applicable without the need for a dynamic brake.","If the ENABLE signal is HIGH, the power sequencing unit  determines whether an initial start operation is necessary (S). If no, the power sequencing unit  determines whether a power interrupt or power sag condition exists (S). If yes, the power sequencing unit  sets a power-interrupt\/sag fault flag (S) and the power sequencing sub-routine is complete (S). If the determination at S is that there is no power-interrupt condition, the power sequencing unit  sets\/maintains RUN mode (S). If the determination at S is that an initial start sequence is needed, the power sequencing unit  initiates a Soft-start operation (S).","Initial in-rush currents in inductive loads or charging capacitor banks cause very large transient currents and voltage excursions which over-stress semiconductors and may damage other electrical system circuit components such as DC link caps and EMI filter components. To prevent such stressful situations, a time-interval called \u201cSoft-start\u201d is incorporated at the beginning of operation, i.e., at the initiation of the RUN mode. Soft-start may be considered an initial sub-mode of the RUN mode. Two exemplary types of Soft-start interval are briefly described for AC-DC and DC-AC power conversion equipment below:\n\n","An exemplary Soft-start technique is described in co-pending application Ser. No. 10\/075,880, filed Feb. 13, 2002 and titled \u201cSoft-Start of DC Link Capacitors for Power Electronics and Drive Systems,\u201d which is incorporated herein by reference.","After the RUN mode is set at S, operation of the power sequencing sub-routine is complete and operation returns to S of  (S).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0073"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 2","FIG. 6","FIG. 2"],"b":["90","228","90","610","84","86","10","612","90","20","614","616","618","90","622","90","620","230","624"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0074"},"figref":["FIGS. 7A and 7B","FIG. 2"],"b":["30","230","30","20","10","710","30","712","714","716","30","718","30","720","722"]},"Next, the PHMD unit  determines whether any trend violation has occurred (S). For example, as described below, the PHMD unit  may predict unsafe operation condition by trending the past and present data, predict estimated MTBF for individual components and estimate the overall reliability of the system, achieve fail-safe operation for mission critical systems by suggesting preventive and\/or corrective actions by synthesizing all the data available in the Data Management Unit (DMU), prepare prognostic reports and highlight stressful operation conditions caused either by the deficiencies of the existing design or deviations from the component data-sheets to be reviewed by design engineers and discussed with supplier of such components. With reference to , if a trend violation is identified, the PHMD unit  updates flags and records data (S) and reports status and relevant information (S). As a result of the determination of whether there are any out-of-range violations, overload violations, or trend violations, the PHMD unit  assesses the impact on major system components (S). This may be done based on major component\/system data accessed from the DMU . The PHMD unit  determines whether any stressful situation has been indicated (S) and, if yes, assesses the cumulative effect of the stressful situation on the associated component\/sub-system\/system (S) and updates the estimated MTBF of major components (S in ). If no stressful situation has occurred, the PHMD unit  communicates system operation and health data to the operator interface  via the DMC  and the DMU  (S). If a stressful situation has occurred, and after updating the MTBF of major components, the PHMD unit  predicts overall system reliability and estimates the remaining time to failure (S). Next, the PHMD unit  determines whether any course of action, such as user intervention, is necessary, e.g., based on previously determined look-up tables (S), and communicates system operation health data to the operator interface  via the DMC  and the DMU  (S). This completes the PHMD sub-routine, and operation returns to S of  (S).","As evident from the above-description, an embodiment of the present invention relies on at least five distinct modes of operation for proper control sequencing, diagnostics, and prognostics health monitoring of digital power conversion and distribution equipment.  illustrates the allowed (i.e., fail-safe) transitions among these distinct modes of operation. Furthermore, table 1 below shows an exemplary \u201ctable,\u201d describing operation of a power conversion system under each mode of operation for the exemplary power conversion environment described above. It should be recognized that this table describes \u201clogic variables\u201d for a variable frequency power conversion and distribution system of the type described in the above-cited co-pending application, titled \u201cSYNCHRONOUS AND BI-DIRECTIONAL VARIABLE FREQUENCY POWER CONVERSION SYSTEMS,\u201d but the number of internal\/external logic variables can be expanded and their T\/F\/X status changed as required to meet the specific requirements of PHMD of other applications.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0077"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"9"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"8","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"9","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 1"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"9","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":[{},"Logic","Input",{},{},{},{},{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"Power","Power",{},{},"Any","Any"]},{"entry":["Mode","OK?","OK?","Enable","PWM_Enable","Fault?","Alarm?","CB_ON","SS_ON"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"9","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["STOP\/","T","F","F","F","F","F","F","F"]},{"entry":"READY"},{"entry":["RUN","T","T","T","T","F","X","T","T"]},{"entry":["ALARM","T","T","T","T","F","T","T","T"]},{"entry":["FAULT","X","X","X","X","T","X","X","X"]},{"entry":["STANDBY","T","X","F","F","X","X","X","X"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"9","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Legend:"},{"entry":"T = TRUE,"},{"entry":"F = FALSE,"},{"entry":"X = DON'T CARE"}]}}}}},"It should be realized that the logic variable values of Table 1 are for the nominal case, and that, during the start-up test (S-BIT) phase of operation (i.e., S of ), logic variable values for certain modes of operation will be different that those in Table 1. For example, during S-BIT, a FAULT or ALARM condition may be identified before Enable or input power is \u201cT.\u201d","In addition to relying on Soft-start and Soft-stop operations to protect power electronics, the present invention also provides enhanced ride-through capability for voltage sag conditions. Ride-through, which may be considered a sub-mode of the RUN mode, is the ability of a conditioned power system to continue to operate in a fail-safe fashion without tripping or the need for a cold-start or system reset in the face of a power interrupt. Two types of ride-through are identified in the present application:","1. Interruption of the main logic power supply input voltage (e.g., 28VDC). In this case, a back-up logic power supply may be realized from a DC-DC converter powered from the DC-link of the power conversion equipment. Alternatively, an auxiliary AC-DC converter powered from another AC-system source can be used to generate a back-up logic power supply. These back-up power supplies may be DIODE-ORed to realize a fail-safe logic power supply. Therefore, even if the main power input which provides power to the logic power supply is interrupted, the system diagnostics and control can continue its operation without any interruption.","2. Interruption of the main input power (e.g., AC system voltage). In this case, in the face of a momentary power interruption, the ride-through capability allows the power conversion system to properly resume operation without any significant electrical transients or time-delay (a need for waiting for speed to ramp-down to zero), usually referred to as a \u201ccold-start.\u201d In a traditional power conversion equipment\/motor controller system, when there is a momentary power interruption, protective functions at best detect a problem with the power system and shut down the system. The motor\/load cannot be re-energized immediately after the power is restored due to significant problems arising from the speed of the electromechanical load and synchronization problems which usually arise due to back emf of other types of active loads. In the case of motor controls, a cold-start is required which introduces time delays before speed can be restored to pre-fault conditions. In certain applications these time delays and nuisance trips cannot be tolerated. The operation of the ride-through controls are described below:","The DC link of the power conversion system is monitored and if it goes below a certain pre-determined level, the PWM_ENABLE signal is disabled. The energy stored in the DC link is still utilized for delivering power to the load and the inverter gating signals are still enabled. Even though an input system under-voltage condition is detected, the power electronics system is allowed to restart if the system power is restored back to normal conditions. This prevents any unnecessary cold-start or initialization of the controlled environment. Two levels of DC link voltage are used for enabling the ride-through controls: one for HIGH ENOUGH DC link voltage and one for TOO LOW a DC link. In the first case, this is the minimum DC link voltage that is required to deliver power to load without entering an overload condition. In the second case, the DC link voltage has fallen below a level which requires a fresh Soft-start and this condition is captured and memorized through the use of SS_ON control signal which is asserted LOW. Transition between these different DC link voltages may be controlled by two software-based independent hysteresis control loops and this prevents chattering of the associated ride-through controls around a predetermined HIGH ENOUGH or TOO LOW set points for the DC link.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0083"},"figref":"FIG. 9A","b":["84","1401","1402","1403","1404","1405","1406"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0084"},"figref":["FIG. 9B","FIG. 9B"],"b":["84","12","10","84","1503","1504","1505","84","20","10","84","1501"],"sub":["ac","ac"]},"The specific commands\/data identified in  are provided merely for illustration and will change depending on the specific application."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["A more complete understanding of the present invention and its advantages will become apparent from the following description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0044"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0045"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0046"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0047"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0048"},"figref":["FIGS. 7A-7B","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0049"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0050"},"figref":"FIG. 9A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0051"},"figref":["FIG. 9B","FIG. 1"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
