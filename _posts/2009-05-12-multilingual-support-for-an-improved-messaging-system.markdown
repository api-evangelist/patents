{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["1. Field","The illustrative embodiments relate generally to an improved data processing system and more specifically to a method, apparatus and computer program product for an improved messaging system. Still more particularly, the illustrative embodiments provide a method, apparatus, and computer program product for managing electronic communications in an improved messaging system.","2. Description of the Related Art","A messaging system allows users to transmit and receive messages with other users of the messaging system in one or more sessions. A messaging system may be implemented on one or more data processing systems in hardware, software, or a combination of hardware and software. An example of how a messaging system may be implemented is through one or more messaging servers and one or more messaging clients. One example of such an implementation is a messaging server that receives messages sent by one messaging client and transmits the message to one or more other messaging clients. The messaging clients, which may be implemented in a Web browser or one or more executables in an operating system, may process interaction with the user and may send and receive communications to the messaging server. The messaging server that may receive the requests may be implemented using one or more executables in an operating system or a Web server. The content of the messages sent and received by the messaging clients and the messaging server may be, for example, in the form of text, audio, or video.","Messaging systems are commonly used in the world of business because messaging systems are often more convenient than e-mail and more cost-effective than telephone calls or postal mail, especially when the parties are located in different countries. For example, a multinational company may provide a messaging system to its employees to allow communication with other employees and clients across geographical borders without the costs of international telephone calls or the delays of postal mail by making sending and receiving messages over existing data connections at each site. A project team at a business may be composed of employees at company locations in any number of countries. The project team may meet or communicate in individual messaging sessions or group messaging sessions at any convenient time using text, audio, and\/or video messages through the messaging system.","Communication among employees in different countries becomes more complicated when the employees do not speak and\/or write the same language. An employee in the United States may wish to hold a textual message session with a customer in China, but the employee may only speak English and the client may only speak Chinese. The employee may receive a message in Chinese, enter the Chinese message into a Web-based machine translation service, and read the English translation. To send a message in response, the employee may enter an English message into the Web-based translation service, receive the Chinese translation, and enter the Chinese translation into the messaging client for transmission to the client.","One or more illustrative embodiments provide a method, apparatus, and computer program product for managing a session of electronic communications. In one illustrative embodiment, a language is identified using a processor for an incoming electronic communication received from a sender computer in the session. It is determined whether the language differs from a desired display language. The incoming electronic communication is translated into the desired display language using a translation service to form a translated incoming electronic communication responsive to a determination that the language differs from the desired display language. The translated incoming electronic communication is displayed in the session on a display device.","As will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, the present invention may be embodied as a system, method or computer program product.

At the heart of the Internet is a backbone of high-speed data communication lines between major nodes or host computers, consisting of thousands of commercial, governmental, educational and other computer systems that route data and messages. Of course, network data processing system  also may be implemented as a number of different types of networks, such as for example, an intranet, a local area network (LAN), or a wide area network (WAN).  is intended as an example and not as an architectural limitation for the different illustrative embodiments.","With reference to , a diagram of a data processing system is depicted in accordance with an illustrative embodiment.

In this illustrative example, data processing system  includes communications fabric , which provides communications between processor unit , memory , persistent storage , communications unit , input\/output (I\/O) unit , and display device .","Processor unit  serves to execute instructions for software that may be loaded into memory . Processor unit  may be a set of one or more processors or may be a multi-processor core, depending on the particular implementation. Furthermore, processor unit  may be implemented using one or more heterogeneous processor systems in which a main processor is present with secondary processors on a single chip. As another illustrative example, processor unit  may be a symmetric multi-processor system containing multiple processors of the same type.","Memory  and persistent storage  are examples of storage devices . A storage device is any piece of hardware that is capable of storing information, such as, for example without limitation, data, program code in functional form, and\/or other suitable information either on a temporary basis and\/or a permanent basis. Memory , in these examples, may be, for example, a random access memory or any other suitable volatile or non-volatile storage device. Persistent storage  may take various forms depending on the particular implementation. For example, persistent storage  may contain one or more components or devices. For example, persistent storage  may be a hard drive, a flash memory, a rewritable optical disk, a rewritable magnetic tape, or some combination of the above.

The program code in the different embodiments may be embodied on different physical or tangible computer readable media, such as memory  or persistent storage .","Program code  is located in a functional form on computer readable media  that is selectively removable and may be loaded onto or transferred to data processing system  for execution by processor unit . Program code  and computer readable media  form computer program product  in these examples. In one example, computer readable media  may be in a tangible form, such as, for example, an optical or magnetic disc that is inserted or placed into a drive or other device that is part of persistent storage  for transfer onto a storage device, such as a hard drive that is part of persistent storage .

Furthermore, a memory may be, for example, memory  or a cache such as found in an interface and memory controller hub that may be present in communications fabric .","The different illustrative embodiments recognize and take into account a number of considerations. For example, the different illustrative embodiments recognize that when a user of a messaging system desires to communicate with others speaking languages not spoken and\/or understood by the user, the user must enter the message into a Web-based translation service to read the translated message. Additionally, to send a message in the foreign language, the user may enter the native language message into the Web-based translation service before receiving a message in the foreign language.","The illustrative embodiments recognize that entering each foreign language message into a Web-based translation service has the following disadvantages: (1) additional time and effort is required from the user to enter each message into the Web-based translation service, simply to read and write messages with a user who speaks a different language; and (2) transferring messages manually or via copy and paste, for example, between the messaging client and the Web-based translation service is prone to errors. In view of these considerations and\/or possibly other considerations, the different advantageous embodiments recognize that it would to advantageous to have a method, apparatus, and computer program product that takes into account one of more of the issues discussed above as well as possibly other issues.","Thus, the illustrative embodiments provide a method, apparatus, and computer program product for managing a session of electronic communications.
