title: Threat image projection system
abstract: A means for training and testing baggage screening machine operators. The invention is a computer system which causes the baggage screening monitor to show computer-generated (i.e. simulated) contraband items in a piece of baggage. This can be done in one of two ways: the image of the contraband item can be superimposed on the image of an actual piece of baggage being screened so that it appears to be within the piece of baggage, or the image of an entire piece of baggage containing a contraband item can be displayed. The invention allows the operator's proficiency in spotting contraband items to be evaluated and it can be used for training a new operator as well as for providing continued proficiency training and evaluation.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND","OBJECTS OF THE PRESENT INVENTION","SUMMARY","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["The present invention may be made or used by or on behalf of the Government of the United States without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.","Baggage screening is conducted at all major airports today. It usually takes the form of an X-ray machine which allows the user to view the contents of carry-on baggage in order to detect any weapons or other contraband. While a metal pistol or knife is obvious and easy to see, explosive devices have gotten more sophisticated and hard to spot. Some devices have been disguised as electronic gear such as personal portable radios or tape players. Such a device is difficult to recognize and distinguish from a real radio or tape player, even for an experienced user.","A further problem is that the job of baggage screening can become repetitious, leading to lapses in attention during which potentially dangerous items may be inadvertently allowed on board an aircraft.","While it is possible to have someone periodically try to breach the baggage screening security, in time a single person would begin to be recognized by the users and they would increase their attention whenever that person came to their machine. Thus it would require more than one person, thereby raising its cost. Furthermore, if the users's performance were to be quantified, the costs and inconvenience would increase considerably.","Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a means for training a baggage screening machine user.","It is a further object of the present invention to provide such a means that can be integrated into present baggage screening machines.","It is a further object to provide such a means that allows a variety of simulated contraband or other items to appear to be in luggage being screened.","It is a further object to provide such a means that allows an entire piece of simulated baggage to appear to be within the screening machine.","It is a further object to provide such a means that allows the simulated contraband or other items to be made to appear randomly or on a selectively variable basis.","Briefly, the present invention comprises a computer-implemented means for projecting the simulated image of contraband or other items on a baggage screening monitor. This is done by either overlaying a computer-generated image of a contraband or other item onto the image of the baggage being screened, or by substituting the image of an entire piece of baggage which contains contraband for the image of the baggage being screened. There is also provision for monitoring the performance of the machine user (i.e. determining the percentage of items found as well as the number of false alarms). The system can be used both for training new users as well as for maintaining the proficiency of experienced users. It can also be used for demonstrating new pieces of contraband items as they are discovered.","The following description is directed to an X-ray machine system. However, it can be applied with only minor modification to other types of security equipment producing a visual image, such as computed tomography or millimeter-wave personnel screening.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["1","2","3","4","5","4","1"]},"The present invention comprises a series of subroutines broadly labelled  which are incorporated into computer . These subroutines are generally categorized as security and access control; machine operation, threat projection, and user feedback; database, performance reports, and data downloading; maintaining user records and passcodes; and selecting and scheduling threats and updating the machine site and location data.","Broadly, the system of the present invention can be thought of as having three major functional aspects: (1) security of and access to the X-ray machine, (2) control and selection of the simulated threats that are presented, and (3) performance monitoring, data collection, and reporting.","Referring to , the security and access control subsystem, the user starts the X-ray machine (block ) using the key in the user control panel. Once the key is turned, the X-ray machine goes through a series of self-diagnostic tests and confirms that it is initialized (block ) and ready to scan bags. If the initialization fails (\u201cNO\u201d branch), system flow proceeds to block , and the user performs the machine manufacturer's troubleshooting procedures to diagnose the initialization problem. If the initialization in block  succeeds, process flow proceeds to block  and the login screen appears on the X-ray machine monitor. The user is queried in block  to type his user identification number, which is compared to information in the user ID master file (blocks , , , ). If the user fails to type his correct user identification number after three tries (\u201cNO\u201d branch), process flow returns to block  and the login screen appears anew. If the user types a valid user identification number, then process flow proceeds to block . In block  the user must type his passcode, which is compared to information in the user passcode master file (blocks , ), to gain access to the system. If the user fails to type his correct passcode after three tries (\u201cNO\u201d branch), process flow returns to block  and the login screen appears anew. If the user correctly types his passcode, then process flow proceeds to block  and the user login is verified. At this point, the user is recognized by the initial access and user verification component of the system and can proceed to the next level of security checks before being allowed to use the machine. In block  the user's name appears on the X-ray machine monitor. The displayed name can then be checked by a security supervisor to further ensure that the person operating the X-ray machine is, in fact, the person who is logged in (i.e., that the user ID and passcode have not been compromised). When the name is displayed on the X-ray machine monitor, the system also displays a warning (from blocks , ) if screener performance data have not been downloaded.","The remaining blocks in ,  through , ascertain the user's access level and permit use of the related system features. Block  tests if the user is a screener (i.e., level  access). If the answer is \u201cYES\u201d process flow proceeds to block  where the individual is granted access to operate the machine (described in FIG. ). The process flow then proceeds to block  which permits the user to continue (\u201cNO\u201d branch) or to log out of the system (\u201cYES\u201d branch). If the user chooses to log out, process flow returns to block  and the login screen appears.","If the test in block  indicates that the individual is not a screener (\u201cNO\u201d branch) then the process flow continues to block . Block  tests if the user is a checkpoint security screener (i.e., level  access). If the answer is \u201cYES\u201d process flow proceeds to block  where the individual is granted access to operate the level  machine features. The process flow then proceeds to block  which permits the user to continue (\u201cNO\u201d branch) or to log out of the system (\u201cYES\u201d branch). If the user chooses to log out, process flow returns to block  and the login screen appears.","If the test in block  indicates that the individual is not a checkpoint security supervisor (\u201cNO\u201d branch) then the process flow continues to block . Block  tests if the user is a guard company or air carrier manager (i.e., level  access). If the answer is \u201cYES\u201d process flow proceeds to block  where the individual is granted access to operate the level  machine features. The process flow then proceeds to block , which permits the user to continue (\u201cNO\u201d branch) or to log out of the system (\u201cYES\u201d branch). If the user chooses to log out, process flow returns to block  and the login screen appears.","If the test in block  indicates that the individual is not a guard company or air carrier manager (\u201cNO\u201d branch) then the process flow continues to block . Block  tests if the user is an FAA Federal Security Manager (i.e., level  access). If the answer is \u201cYES\u201d process flow proceeds to block  where the individual is granted access to operate the level  machine features. The process flow then proceeds to block , which permits the user to continue (\u201cNO\u201d branch) or to log out of the system (\u201cYES\u201d branch). If the user chooses to log out, process flow returns to block  and the login screen appears. If the test in block  indicates that the individual is not an FAA Federal Security Manager (\u201cNO\u201d branch) then the individual is not recognized for any available access levels. This indicates that the access level has not been properly set and process flow return to block , the login screen. At this point all users have been logged in at their appropriate access level.","Referring to , the X-ray machine user has chosen to operate the machine (blocks , , , ). In block  a passenger at the checkpoint inserts a bag. This begins the passenger bag screening process. Next, in block  the software increases the bag count by  to keep track of the number of bags that have been screened. The test in block  ascertains if the user wants to log out of machine operation. If the user wants to log out (\u201cYES\u201d branch), then, depending on the user's access level, process flow continues to blocks , , , or . If the user does not wish to log out (\u201cNO\u201d branch) then process flow continues to block , where the bag's image appears on the X-ray machine monitor for inspection by the security screener.","Block  then tests if there is a threat scheduled for projection onto the current passenger bag image. This test is based on threat schedule settings made in block . If there is no threat scheduled for projection (\u201cNO \u201d branch), process flow proceeds to block , and no simulated baggage image appears on the X-ray machine monitor. Continuing along this path, block  tests if the X-ray machine user pressed the \u201cthreat\u201d button to indicate that he believed a threat was present. If the user does not press the \u201cthreat\u201d button (\u201cNO\u201d branch), which is correct since no threat was projected, process flow proceeds to block . In block  the system scores the event as a \u201ccorrect rejection\u201d and the data are sent to block . If the user does press the \u201cthreat \u201d button (\u201cYES\u201d branch), which is incorrect since no threat was projected, process flow proceeds to block . In block  the screener is given feedback that he made a \u201cfalse alarm\u201d since he responded by pressing the \u201cthreat \u201d button when no simulated threat was projected. In this block the system also scores the event as a \u201cfalse alarm\u201d and the data are sent to block .","Returning to the test in block , if a threat is scheduled for projection into the current passenger bag (\u201cYES\u201d branch), then process flow proceeds to block . In block  a specific threat is selected from the image library. This selection is based on the threat selection settings made in block . Next, block  tests if the selected threat fits into the current passenger bag. This test is critical to ensure that a large threat is not projected into a small bag (e.g., a purse), thus cueing the screener that the threat is simulated. If the simulated threat would not fit into the current passenger bag (\u201cNO\u201d branch), process flow proceeds to block  and the simulated image projection is aborted. When this occurs it is possible that the screener will see part of the simulated threat as it is initially superimposed on the actual bag. To insure that the screener is not confused by this, feedback is given in block  to the screener that a simulated threat was aborted. Process flow then returns to block  and awaits a new passenger bag. If the test in block  indicates that the simulated threat will fit within the current passenger bag (\u201cYES\u201d branch), then process flow proceeds to block  where the simulated threat is projected and superimposed onto the bag image on the X-ray machine monitor.","At this point in the process a simulated threat image has been projected by the system of the present invention. Block  tests if the X-ray machine user pressed the \u201cthreat\u201d button within a specified time to indicate that he believed a threat was present. If the user does not press the \u201cthreat\u201d button (\u201cNO\u201d branch), process flow proceeds to block  which tests if the screener response time has elapsed. If the screener response time has not elapsed (\u201cNO\u201d block), and there is time remaining to make a threat detection decision, process flow returns to block  and waits for the screener to press the \u201cthreat\u201d button. If the screener response time has elapsed and the \u201cthreat\u201d button was not pressed (\u201cYES\u201d block), process flow proceeds to block . In block  the screener is given feedback that he missed the simulated threat since he did not respond by pressing the \u201cthreat\u201d button in a timely manner (e.g., 6 seconds). In this block the system also scores the event as a \u201cmiss\u201d and the data are sent to block .","In block , if the user does press the \u201cthreat\u201d button (\u201cYES\u201d branch) before the response time elapses, which is correct since a threat was projected, process flow proceeds to block . In block  the screener is given feedback that he \u201chit\u201d the simulated threat since he responded by pressing the \u201cthreat \u201d button in a timely manner (e.g., 6 seconds). In this block the system also scores the event as a \u201chit\u201d and the data are sent to block .","In  the screener performance data (i.e., false alarms, misses, hits, correct rejections) are stored in a database that permits performance reports and data downloads. In block  screener performance from blocks , , , and  are the data that are stored in the system database. The test in block  checks to see if the data in the system have been downloaded from the baggage screening machine in the last 30 days. If the data have not been downloaded in the last 30 days (\u201cNO\u201d branch) then block  places a download reminder on the X-ray monitor (block ). Next, the test in block  checks to see if the data in the system have been downloaded in the last 60 days. If the data have not been downloaded in the last 60 days (\u201cNO\u201d branch) then block  places an urgent download reminder on the X-ray monitor (block ). Then, the test in block  checks to see if the data in the system have been downloaded in the last 90 days. If the data have not been downloaded in the last 90 days (\u201cNO\u201d branch) then block  does not permit machine operation (e.g., the X-ray machine will not scan bags) until the data have been downloaded. This restriction is included because the system currently cannot store more than 3 months of data in memory. Greater memory capacity will permit longer amounts of time before the system requires that the data be downloaded. Process flow continues from block  to block , where the user is asked if he wants to download the data reports and get the machine to operate once again. See description of block  below.","If the data have been downloaded recently (e.g., 90 days or less) then the test in blocks , , or  takes the \u201cYES\u201d branch and program flow proceeds to block . Block  tests the access level of the user to ensure that they are level , , or . If the user is level  (\u201cNO\u201d branch) program flow continues to block  which indicates to the user that access is denied and returns him to block .","If the test in block  indicates that the user is level , , or  (\u201cYES \u201d branch) then process flow continues for viewing or downloading the reports. In block  the user selects one of the four available reports (e.g., screener log report). Next, block  allows the user to specify the month for the report or a specific screener's name. Block  asks the user if he would like to view the selected report. If the answer is \u201cYES\u201d then the process flow continues to block  where the report is shown on the X-ray monitor. After the report is viewed the process flow returns to block  to permit selection of other reports, months, or screeners. If the user indicates in block  that he does not want to view the reports (\u201cNO\u201d branch) then process flow continues to block .","Block  asks the user if he would like to download the selected report. If the answer is \u201cNO\u201d then the program returns to block , , or  to permit access to other features or to log out. If the answer is \u201cYES\u201d then the program continues to block . Block  tests the access level of the user to ensure that they are level  or . If the user is level  or  (\u201cNO\u201d branch) process flow continues to block  which indicates to the user that access is denied and returns him to block  or . If the test in block  indicates that the user is level  or  then process flow continues to block  and the selected report is downloaded to floppy disk or Zip\u2122 disk. After the report is downloaded the process flow returns to block  to permit selection of other reports, months, or screeners.","In , the process of maintaining user records and passcodes is shown in detail. Access to these functions requires that an user be logged into the system (in block ). Block  tests if the user has level  or  access. If the user is either a screener or CSS (i.e., level  or ) the \u201cNO\u201d branch directs process flow to block . Block  informs the user that access is denied and then process flow returns to block  for a screener or block  for a CSS.","In response to the query in block , if the user is either level  or  (\u201cYES\u201d branch), then the process flow proceeds to block . Block  asks the user if he would like to add information for a new X-ray machine user. If the answer is \u201cYES\u201d, the process proceeds to block . In block  information for a new user (e.g., name, ID number, access level, password) can be entered. Once the information has been added in block , the process continues to block  where the User ID Master File is amended. This information in block  is sent to block  to be used to confirm that the user has typed a correct user ID. Next, block  updates the Passcode Master File. This information in block  is sent to block  to be used to confirm that the correct passcode has been entered for system access. After block  the process flow returns to block .","Block  asks the user if he would like to edit user information for a user already in the system. If the answer is \u201cYES\u201d, the process proceeds to block . In block  information for a current user (e.g., name, ID number, access level, password) can be edited. Once the information has been edited in block , the process flow continues to block  where the User ID Master File is amended. This information in block  is used by block  to confirm that the user has typed a correct user ID. Next, block  updates the Passcode Master File. This information in block  is used by block  to confirm that the correct passcode has been entered for system access. After block  the process flow returns to block .","Block  asks the user if he would like to query the list for user information for an user already in the system. If the answer is \u201cYES\u201d, the process flow proceeds to block . In block  information for a current user can be sorted from either the top or the bottom of the list. Next, block  displays the requested user information. Following block  the process flow returns to block .","Block  asks the user if he would like to display user information for a specific user already in the system. If the answer is \u201cYES\u201d, the process flow proceeds to block . In block  information for a current user can displayed based on either name or the user ID number. Next, block  displays the requested user information. Following block  the process flow returns to block .","Block  asks the user if he would like to delete or inactivate user information for an user who has been put in the system but who has not yet screened any bags (i.e. who has quit before completing on-the-job training). If the answer is \u201cNO\u201d then process flow returns to block  (for a level  user) or block  (for a level  user). If the answer is \u201cYES\u201d, the process flow proceeds to block . Block  queries if data exist for the specific user. The system is designed so that no data can be deleted. Thus, if user data exist this information can only be inactivated (i.e., not deleted). If the response to block  is that no user data exist (\u201cNO\u201d branch), then process flow continues to block . Block  deletes the request for information for that specific user and displays that this operation has been conducted. Next, block  updates the User ID Master File. This information in block  is sent to block  to be used to confirm that the user ID has been entered. After block  the process flow returns to block .","If the response to block  is that user data exist (\u201cYES\u201d branch), then process flow continues to block .

This information in block  is sent to block  to be used to confirm that the user ID has been entered. After block  the process flow returns to block . \u201cInactivating\u201d refers to storing, but not deleting, data pertaining to a user who is no longer screening bags (i.e. who is on a leave of absence). These data would not appear in the reports but would still be available for later analysis. If the user returned to work the data would be reactivated.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6"],"b":["4","85","4"]},"The query in block  asks the system user (who has already proven he is a level  user) if he would like to schedule threats for projection into passenger bags. If the response is \u201cYES\u201d then process flow continues to block . Block  asks the user if he would like to set the parameters that are used to schedule the frequency of threat projections. If the response is \u201cYES \u201d then process flow continues to block . In block  the user can set the bag ratio, the bag range, and the randomness ratio. These three parameters link the frequency of simulated threat projections to the flow of bags through the X-ray machine (rather than time). The parameter settings in block  are sent to block  to control the simulated threat projection schedule and frequency. Following block  the process flow returns to block .","If the response to block  is \u201cNO\u201d, indicating the user does not want to set the projection frequency parameters, then process flow continues to block . If these parameters have not been set previously, the machine then acts as a conventional X-ray machine. Block  asks the user if he would like to set (or change) the percentages of threats (based on threat categories and subcategories) to be projected. If the response is \u201cYES\u201d then process flow proceeds to block . In block  the user can set the category percentages and the subcategory percentages. The percentages for the categories and subcategories must sum to 100% to be accepted by the system. For example, the bomb category can be selected as 30%, guns 20%, knives 10%, hazardous materials 10%, and combined threat images 30%. Within the bomb category the subcategories could be selected as 15% improvised explosive devices, 10% conventional explosives, and 5% nuclear, biological and chemical devices; within the combined threat image category the subcategories could be bombs 15%, guns 10%, knives 5%, hazardous materials 0%, and other\/miscellaneous 0%.","The threat percentage settings in block  are sent to block  to be used to control the simulated threat selection.
